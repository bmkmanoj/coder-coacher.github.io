I'll hear what another question and I'm
answering so this is something that I
see all the time on Quora this is
something I see here on the comments
like what separates a junior programmer
versus a Senior Programmer what's the
difference the difference is when you're
a junior programmer there's not that
many responsibilities on top right
you're responsible for the work that's
assigned to you and pretty much you're
not gonna get something extremely
complicated sometimes if they see that
hey you're very talented
and you can handle it they will give you
a complicated task when you are a job or
a company etc alright but most of the
time they're not gonna give you those
type of tasks for you to handle because
number one you don't have to experience
you don't have two years that a senior
developer has already all right and one
thing that says here that is pretty good
it says news Boris once said and
expertise a man who has made all the
mistakes which can be made in a narrow
field what does that mean it means
pretty much a senior developer has
already gone through the past that a
junior developer is going through like
all the little mistakes that you guys
make all the things that you come in and
you're like oh man let me write this
down like this but in reality there's an
easier more efficient way a senior
developer has already gone through that
you know somebody going in and hacking
the website a senior developer has
already gone through that somebody
coming in and you know by mistake
deleting the whole database a senior
developer has already gone through that
knows how to recover that data like
there's so many little examples out
there that a junior developer just
doesn't know you know I've seen this you
know in my own life where I will see
like a junior developers coming straight
out of college guys who were coming in
straight out of college to Austria from
a boot camp or teaching themselves at
home
and then you know they feel like they're
ready for primetime and oh yeah you know
I know this this amazing framework that
just came out and it's like everybody's
talking about this but senior developers
like you know what let's wait a little
while before we start using that
framework because what we have here
already works and we already tested it a
million times and pretty much is like
the one that you tryna throw at us it's
really like in beta or they just
released it and then the next week you
realize all the reviews from people and
ready or on Stack Overflow like oh my
god no nine point whatever sucks there's
so many bugs my whole project is
breaking on you know our website is down
we try to do the update and everything
went down it happens all the time
usually it's like I said it's like a
junior developer who got excited sort of
blog somewhere it's like hey guys
we gotta jump to know 9.7 and then I
realize that hey they just released it
so there's gonna be a whole bunch of
bugs so we're not gonna use that in
primetime you know but those are the
little things that separate a senior
from a junior like you have to
understand like you have to go through
the process of making mistakes you know
like whenever like I junior developer
main mistakes I never was one of those
people that come in and be like oh my
god you made a mistake that era I just I
laugh it off I'm gonna oh man you did
this is okay man I did this to you know
that's the type of person that I am this
some other senior developers will be
like you should know this you're you
supposed to know this like if you know
JavaScript you supposed to know you're
not supposed to do this dist isn't that
right me I was never that type of person
I was always the type of person that be
like oh wow you made this mistake cool
let me show you how to do this to route
in the right way that's it right so
that's the type of you know senior
developer that I am but yeah man I mean
there's really not much different
besides the experience and the fact that
the mistakes that you're going to make
some senior developer
meeting all right like when somebody
asks me a question about let's say PHP
right and they tell me oh man on the
Internet and PHP everybody says you know
it's bad and this listen down I'm not
gonna use PHP because it's not worth
free and it's a dying language and then
you like you do the research you you
realize you like man you don't know what
you're talking about you know as a
senior developer I come in and I'll tell
you hey look this artifacts these are
the things that's really happening you
can go out there and try to learn let's
say Python and or let's say I don't know
Java right and you're trying to teach
yourself that by yourself at home you're
gonna make a whole bunch of mistakes
you're not gonna be able to find a job
right away so PHP might be the best case
for you right but that's because I
already went through that path I already
went in through that path of hey I want
to follow the latest trends I want to
follow the latest frameworks I want to
follow the latest programming languages
and it's like the more I learned the
more mistakes that I made the more that
I got to you know become more
knowledgeable in this field so that's
the difference between a junior
developer in a senior developer it's
just that space that they have between
each other the years of mistakes that's
how I look at it it's like you've made
so many mistakes that by the time here
you're you know five years in six years
in 10 years in you already seen
everything so you learned from that you
know a junior developer doesn't have
that junior developer is like okay cool
it's like let's do this
you know without thinking about it it's
like a senior developer already been
through it you know so yeah man to me
that's what a junior and a senior
developer is somebody who has made
mistakes here and still needs to learn
and then somebody who already been
through the mistakes it has the
experience on how to solve them and how
to solve any problem that's thrown at
them because they've already been
through it that's what a senior means
it's like it's just like in life you
know it's like you you have a baby and
you
have somebody who's 70 years old you
know who has already made so many
mistakes and knows was what happens
through our lives like the 70 yo right
the baby
he just started crawling he don't know
that you know if you put his finger
inside the you know the wall you know he
could go and get electrocuted he don't
know about that he's a baby right but at
70 year olds as I go man that's
electricity right there man if I touch
that it's gonna break let me go this way
you know what I mean so that's how I
look at it all right guys so yeah man if
you guys want to sign up to my website
man check out my site man coding freeze
calm right now currently if you go to my
video version there's a link that says

into it a lot of people are getting a
lot of this website man they learning a
lot here man like learning HTML CSS
JavaScript PHP you know object-oriented

learning nodejs like all the things that
you need to be a successful developer
and be able to find a job like my goal
here is to get you working my goal here
is not to make you hey I'm gonna make
you the best developer in the world yes
you could do that yes you could become
