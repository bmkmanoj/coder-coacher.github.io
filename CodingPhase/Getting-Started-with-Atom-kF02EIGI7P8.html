comm listen today we're going to talk
about Adam an amazing text editor that's
completely free all right guys so what
we're going to do is basically come here
we're going to go to Adam that il and
we're going to click download for Mac of
course they have for Windows and they
have it for Linux so whatever system you
have you just download it click on that
button and everything should be fine
after that we're going to go to the
download folder we click here at a Mac I
downloaded a couple of times before
those are previous versions right now
that's the latest version that I'm
downloading ok ok cool so now what we're
going to do is we're going to drag this
into applications and now we have access
to Adam it should be popping up here
there you go
open that up
click open and now we good all right so
this is what you get when you first come
in to Adam of course we don't have a
file or a folder okay so we don't have a
file or a folder open but we could come
here to file new file right create a new
file ok we could come here create a new
window multiple windows we can also come
in here and add a project to this folder
ok we come here add that there
automatically we have that that folder
inside of this project another thing
that's cool about this that we could
just say open directly and we can just
open a file individually into this this
window or we could just click open on on
a home folder so we could come here and
let's say an example let me go to
projects hyper app click there
automatically the whole project gets
open in a new window we still have this
other one here now let's talk about a
little bit about the user interface as
you can see we have tabs of different
files so let's say an example we here
write a hyper app we want to open
index.html and then we want to open the
CSS for this one this is minified but
let's pick a better example let's say
SAS and here you go you have all your
SAS which is just CSS and then you have
your index.html you can also drag this
from top to bottom so now you have main
on top you got index on bottom now you
can move this to the side and say hey I
want to set aside and next year or CSS
there you could do the same thing here
and flip it around alright you can have
to pull files here let me see it would
take the gold badge is okay cool as you
can see you have two windows there
inside of one side so like the same
things I'll be working all your HTML
here and you say hey I want to have my
main that s CSS here and I have my
JavaScript here so be easier it's a good
flow all right now of course one of the
best things about Adam is the fact that
it has a whole bunch of different ways
of you know customizing it to the way
that you like it and all the good things
that it has like let's say an example of
something like this like it's like an
autocomplete so let's say you come here
and say div automatically it shows you
okay that's a div tag if you click enter
it creates the tag for you alright so
that's a good one cool thing let's say
an example if you wanted to find
something on this page you can say
command F and search app automatically
highlights it for you and it shows you
there alright now let's say an example
we wanted to search all over the whole
site well the whole project itself we
can say command shift F and it will
search to every single file that we have
in this project so let's say app search
that and then it gives us all the
different results you know I usually use
this depending on a certain situation
like let's say I wanted to find wherever
I'm using this right here this function
with this same argument I will do a
search for that I will say okay let me
search it here and then it will give me
the files that is actually requiring
that all right so it's a little bit more
specific you know instead of just saying
app all right so this is one of the cool
things that it has and like I said it
has syntax highlighting meaning
as you can see here these are the dis
these are the div tags or well this
one's a script tag doesn't the div tag
then it shows you the ID the ID is a
different color than the attribute right
then the params that's in there okay now
let's say an example here you see that
HTTP is a whole different color than
anything else like it gives you a little
highlights now let's say an example like
goat file like this one shows you the
name of the object is gopis in red and
then it shows you the method in blue
then the parenthesis is white and then
inside of it the arguments are green all
right so strings are green so this is
pretty cool it just it separates
everything for you visually so like that
you can actually come in and know where
everything is at and it's just a pretty
good pretty good on text editor right to
me this is my favorite one I love this
text editor there's definitely my
favorite alright guys so I'll see you
guys around
this is just a quick introduction how to
install Adam and get you started
alright like I said you have your file
tree here this your area where you write
your code and that's about it for this
video alright guys I'll see you guys
later
bow boy Joe back at it again I didn't
did it again man I came up with this new
course hyperope Jes course guys if you
want the full course you don't want to
wait for the videos on YouTube make sure
