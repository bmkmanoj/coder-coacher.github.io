at it again man cutting face calm your
boy is backing Adam David again alright
guys so somebody asks me Jill how can I
get more money as a developer I got
hired three months ago for forty five
thousand I'm a junior developer but I've
been doing the work that senior
developers do and pretty much I think I
should pay more
I passed my three months probation so I
should be fine
and how do I do this how do I talk to so
you know to the company from the HR and
tell them like hey my three months is up
I would like to get higher pay well I
would say basically go to HR tell them
like hey my three months are up you know
in most companies usually they gave her
the junior developers either erase or
some type of equity in the company
because if you're valuable for the
company they should take care of you
right
either they should be giving you
benefits either they should be giving
you more vacation time either they
should be giving you more sick days
whatever it is but you should definitely
be getting something more than $45,000
right especially after probation like
you already passed that and you're
working for a company the company is
legit now this is the difference if
you're working for a small business you
have to understand you work for a small
business you know small business a lot
of times they don't have benefits they
don't have a lot of the things that you
will have in a corporate company
but that's when you gotta talk to HR or
even if there is no a chart talk to the
owner of the business and tell them hey
listen I've been here for a while I've
been doing my job I come in every day a
median time pretty much if I start
looking at other companies I'm gonna get
paid a higher pay than 45,000 um you
know I love working here but I just want
to be able to feed my family
come up with a story that's why I
usually I usually used to tell them that
I don't even have a family everything
listen man I have to take care my family
I don't even have a family back then
right but just give or like you know a
real explanation just be like be honest
be like hey man like if I go to another
company they're going to pay me more
than that they're going to pay me at
least twenty thirty thousand dollars
more because the job that I'm doing the
the position that I'm working here is
basically very demanding and I know if I
start looking online I can find a better
and higher paid but I love working with
you guys so I want to stay here I rather
stay here in a place where I'm already
comfortable with and yeah I just would
definitely be like a little higher pay
then they're going to tell you what you
know what exactly is the number that
you're looking for
don't say a crazy number like $50,000
above what you're already getting paid
just you're not going to get paid at
some time yeah ahead of time you're not
going to get that but let's say an
example you say hey I want to get sixty
five right you start at 45 you've been
there for three months you showed and
you prove that you can do the job and
you like hey I want to get sixty five
you know a minimum of 60 thousand you
know so start with 65 68 thousand and
then if they be like oh we can't do it
nine just like missing the minimum that
I think is it's accurate for somebody
with my skills is 60,000 and don't feel
bad don't feel bad if if they just you
know they come to you and they be like
oh I don't know if we can afford that
right now just be like be prepared to it
but sometime like if you're going ask
for that raise be prepared to think like
hey if they don't give it to me at some
point I'm gonna leave out of here in the
next month or two don't stay there
because if you already ask for a reason
they're not giving it to you
they're never gonna give it to right is
it people know that it takes a lot for a
person to go and ask for something
especially for a raise so they don't
give it to you at that moment or they
come up with a plan and say hey if you
stay here by the sixth month we're gonna
bring it up if they do something like
that then you stay if not they're never
going to give you that race so that's
all I want to tell you guys like you
know just be honest you know sometimes
if you have to like so does he got a lie
you know like I used to do that my
junior year when I was like a freshman
and this web development I was like
y'all listen I got a king I can't I
can't stay I don't know if I could stay
here you know my kid expenses are
getting a little bit too much and I know
that I can get a better job well not a
better job or a better pace somewhere
else so that's what we tell them right
and then I okay yeah cool we'll give you
the race come on
because you're valuable you're doing a
job and you're doing a very important
job in a company so you should get paid
accordingly you know because the owner
doesn't get no pay cuts the a couple of
managers they don't get no pay cut so
why is you you know
working there full-time busting your ass
not on Facebook
like a lot of people that be in offices
they be on Facebook or YouTube way and
they're like not doing for you
because you're the developer you're
expected to be coding 24/7 the whole
time that you're there so if they
expecting that out of you then you
should get paid so accordingly to
whatever you're doing you know something
it's a very good price a good salary
something that you could say I'm
comfortable I'm happy at this moment
with this salary all right so that's my
advice to you and yeah I'll see you guys
around here everything else aboard joke
