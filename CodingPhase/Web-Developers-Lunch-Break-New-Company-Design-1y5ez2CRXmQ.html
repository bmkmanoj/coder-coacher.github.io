the city which is understand better
4G service but it really really sucks
please I live up here now work out here
and suburbs really sucks so I do this on
you know one minute I'm gonna give you
guys the best quality diving champ so
yeah like I said it sucks because I'm so
used to like looking down at my phone
and you know seeing Matt the air and let
the bots drop a link or I will see
something where there will be like you
know a couple of people
battlecry Axanar a handful a couple of
people will say sign it all be cool but
right now it's like no talking to myself
well with the little electric soap I'm
very exciting about this so I work we're
done working on the old site right so
now we doing the whole redesign we
basically did all the functionality
transfer everything's of my road we used
to be on Perl and now everything is
being transferred so well it got
transferred to Lara and now we're
actually being hiked all this
we're actually redesigning the whole
site the whole reason Sun is done now
it's all about basically implementing it
to the new website so I'm very excited
about that
you know like lot of people been asking
me Joe where do you work or what do you
do with what company you work for
I mean if you look through my link then
you will find out but haven't really put
it out there because number one I hate
the website I love the company but I
hate the website that's currently on so
it's not something that can be proud of
them oh yeah I work for this company and
the website looks like and you guys
remember gel your clothes sucks and it's
like nah man I might code we're
basically using a old template that they
had for like six seven years you know
how companies now every company could
just read update every year it's like
Amazon or one of those you know all
companies that they've been here since
2000-2001 you can't just leave your
design or redesign everything you know I
mean yo
when cousins scribble down would you
water Ganesha
okay good timing sorry oh honey Turkey
any turkey right I'm not 102 honey ham
here or any hand yeah honey Harry Potter
yeah oh honey ham with those tomatoes on
a on a hero arrow with anything yes oh
no nothing on it thank you
yeah that's how you do it man that's how
you know when you lower your customer
you come through and over show laughter
to the people they show love back to you
man
I'm just saying people love me
everywhere I go man you see that like
they come from inside the store to come
show love like yeah we want to make sure
you get your rights and which to me
people love me man
but yeah like what was I saying yes so
when you work in a company right old
company you got a deal with working with
legacy codes like before I got here we
were working well they were working on
Perl some framework or interchange that
framework is super old
you can't even update it's so old that
you can update and the website itself
just look like everything work like
 in my son's way because the company
itself works amazing like you know you
order your glasses you receive your
glasses everything's going to be good
but the website itself it just looked
bad because because this developers that
don't care like if I would have been
working here for like five ten years I
would have told them like hey let's
update to something more modern
I would say hey let's join something
like nodejs but see Larry well maybe
Ruby on Rails something more modern they
were using Perl some for
like 1998 so it's like when I got hired
I got hired to change the whole platform
of the website so
laravel and that's what I did when my
friend Joe was also
another developer and the company but it
was just pretty crazy laying now we
finally gonna release the new website
which looks amazing
everything works perfectly it's pretty
clean it's legit it's like literally
legit is like we we are competing with
like the top companies you know like
we're really up there right now and it's
cool because this is a small business
this is a business of probably less than
200 people that work here and it's
pretty cool man it's cool because when I
do something I change something it
really does a change in the company like
I'm one of two of the main developers so
there's two lane developers is Joe and
there's me and now we have another
developer who's a contract who's helping
us out for a moment but we don't know if
he's going to stay or not but there's
only two developers and then we have
somebody who's remote in Colombia and
we're looking for another remote back in
developer so maybe you guys are back and
developers who are really good let me
know you could work from home and work
on this company now have you set the
name on a company but you'll find out if
you go into my LinkedIn and try to
search through and do some creepy
stalker right you can probably go
we'll find out what company I work for
but I'll not say that the name of it
until we get the new website because
there's not something that I want to
show off to people but hey I work for
this company the website doesn't look as
good as you know my skills and how do
you explain to people I hate this
website I maintain it and now creating a
brand new website for it so when if you
visit it right now you gotta Batman this
website looks like it's old but in
army like so that's what I haven't
really said what company I work for but
besides that the company itself is
amazing
the owner is amazing you know the people
I work with for pretty cool you know
yeah like I stick more to like my IT
work and all this straight programming I
don't really mingle with everybody in a
company because I'm not there for that
 I'm there to do my job
follow clock I'm a today you know me
like I'm not there to try to make
friends and best friends than that
because you know how it is every job you
go in and try to be best friends with
everybody the day you leave everybody
talks about you so I rather not
give nobody any anything like you know
to talk about me so I don't give
them no information I don't tell by my
personal life I'll tell what I do
I'll tell them if I'll make money on the
side and tell them if I have another
company I want terrified to YouTube like
