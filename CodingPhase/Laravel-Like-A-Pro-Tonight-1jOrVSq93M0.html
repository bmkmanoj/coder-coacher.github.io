a lot of people who are members to my
website kobi5.com all the people who are
members and the people who are not a

tell a lot of you guys who signed up in
the beginning who were who basically
signed up in the first week I had
changed the way how we do will
transactions on the website so if you
want to be member of the the site again
you have to re-up date your your payment
system basically you know if you're
gonna use
if you're gonna use a credit card you
have to re-up date it because I changed
the whole system so I don't have access
to your your credit cards or any of your
information so basically we can't
recharge you the next month well that's
fine
you guys probably know that y'all get an
email somewhere this week you know so if
you signed up for the subscription I was
to take advantage man because it just
update your payment system because right

who got it for five dollars right in the
first week first two weeks yeah I got it
for $5 so don't lose that man I'm really
gonna tell you guys like don't lose that
your data for the super 13 so just come
back to the website man and just update
your your payment because that's my
phone and I do apologize I do apologize
that basically I decided to change who
did my payment like I was doing a lot of
PayPal but then I switched it up to two
strike so that's what happened right
all secure your credit card security is
fine
he said I was mindful I decided to to
change it Midway I was like man paper
Islands challenge is charging too much
money man so then I just switched it up
I stood up to strike that's what it was
but yeah man anyways but why am i doing
you guys all the technical like I
don't care about that right but I just
wanted to apologize those people there's
only a few people who are affected by it
it's just pretty much you have to put in
your credit card again nobody's charging
you anything but anyways man oh now we
jump
yes I started a month ago and I know a
lot of people been waiting on it for a
whole month they're like man I've only
got away until the laravel like a pro is
ready so I'm like ooh let's go we here
now and it would have really member
advanced things or you know intermediate
things and forget about the people that
don't know anything you know there's a
lot of people who want to become
developers but they can't find the right
resources so I said you know what I'm
gonna create that learn HTML CSS of
course and then they're in JavaScript
and then now we jump into larvae so I
think y'all ready now and we're gonna
build real projects what's gonna be cool
about the laravel course is gonna be the
first one's gonna be super easy it's
just a crud it's a task manager so
pretty much you you have a task you add
it in the same set of database you
either can edit it you can delete it you
can change the order of it you can
change the categories so it's super
simple but is gonna teach you how to
work with Nara right then from there
we're gonna build something a little bit
more complicated we're gonna create a
CMS for your portfolio
meaning we're gonna create a back-end
for you to be able to add your projects
and your you know the websites that you
worked on clients that you worked on so
it's pretty much a portfolio site but
we're giving it a feel of a CMS as if we
were creating our own WordPress you know
so that's what we're doing after that
and then the last step is gonna be doing
the bait store which is gonna be a
completely
full ecommerce site alright so yeah man
