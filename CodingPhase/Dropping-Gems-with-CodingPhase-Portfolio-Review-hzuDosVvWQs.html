now I'm here kids
rotting munos what up listen we got the
wolf pack man all right cool
so today I got something special today
we're doing something amazing something
that you guys love when I do these y'all
love when your boy comes in and says
ayyy we do it no web developer portfolio
review all right
Sasha without I don't know how to say
your last name your surname or Sadiq
stoic I don't know what it is man and
like always somebody wants to call you
at the wrong time right
you know mommy's email
w-what about rocket throwing out of me
more and be that like always my mom
calls me at the wrong time it never
feels right so anyways we out here kids
all right so today I'm gonna share my
screen with you guys today we have a web
developer portfolio so let me share my
screen and here you go
cool so we got her file Fernandez you
know maybe I'm making it to Spanish but
it's not fired right so Rafael basically
he got his website and I'm glad that he
actually found his domain which has his
full name is Rafael Fernandez that me
right it's not a.com don't get height
well at least you got adopt me you know
what I mean so cool so let's look at the
website let's refresh it let's see if
there's any animations or anything okay
it's a little cool no bounce right here
I like the grays looks pretty clean
let me see what else okay I'll see you
you got the little fade in when you
scroll okay I'll see you you know making
things look nice I like the little buddy
I wish there would have been like a
hover effect on top of this once I go
over it like the background should
change or something
let me see you like the typography looks
pretty clean there's definitely a
hierarchy you know whatever it needs to
be the title is actually bigger than the
subtitle you know sometimes people they
forgot about this thing sorry typography
in hierarchy that's why you have two h1
h2 h3 h4 h4 I fish sakes age you know
the whole shebang right that's why
there's that hierarchy because
technically you're supposed to have
everything that's important or H 1 and H
tools and they're from there you make
everything smaller
depending on on what the type of title
it is it just makes your website look
cleaner right another thing too that you
could notice here is that he's not using
black right so he got black for the
titles and then like off grey for the
regular text and that's actually better
than having something where everything
in the page is black it's like there's
no difference okay so that's pretty cool
let me see what else so he got his
projects here so this is where his
portfolio starts you know let's started
from here okay see a little scroll
scroll action I like it
alright so then we have what I forgot
this application app spark we gotta find
Fernandez calm
we got sessions a react native app that
allows users to create sessions seems
cool comparative if an application that
has crowdsource opinions in a photo via
voting system the application utilizes
relational databases user authentication
is raining Ruby and JavaScript there you
go godo Ruby you know and I'm sorry but
I find you had me until I saw this for
you please guys don't add to see your
portfolio I know is just shows like okay
I'd know how to do some JavaScript but
know how to work with a couple of little
things I know programming but please
don't put no little Simon game like you
know what I mean is cool okay okay
all right I need to stop get me out of
here all right so all right so the Simon
game is cool is fun and something to
practice it's not something that you
want to show right it's not something
that you you know nobody comes in and
puts into their portfolios like here's
how to reverse a string you know this is
the same thing as that to me right
because if you're a professional what
you want to have is just your projects
your major projects that you have and
that's it anything else that's like side
projects side little games like this
unless you built like a full fledge
html5 game something that shows I okay
this person created html5 game you know
this animations that sprites there's
different levels like that's something
that we go in and say oh cool this
person knows what the hell he's doing
but coming in and seeing this I'll be
honest to me I'm just like I didn't need
to see this
alright so cool I like the picture that
you got here your boy looking clean got
the nice little shape up you know what I
mean place no games you know as I hey
barber came through give him a little
shape up he good I like the Hat you know
taking my swag now I'm joking
listen all right so we got about me hi
I'm Raphael specialize making
applications and modern responsive
website Don located Providence Rhode
Island
Amen you're very close to me we need to
hang out pretty much over all I will say
I know enough to be dangerous more
important can deliver a results I
enjoyed treating new terrain exploring
fresh cold libraries building every
piece I don't know what every piece most
valuable player I don't know and most of
all taking an idea from had a no
headspace to database
I don't know that last part I don't know
what's going on there but you got your
resume you got your email you got your
contact info that's great I'm not gonna
put it here because you know how to
trolls be they'll try to throw you
okay now as far as the website looks
good let's look into the applications
themselves all right let us go to the
demo so app spark that Hiroko that cool
we know is you know free hosting a
Heroku so we gotta give you a little a
little time you know but then they load
so we good all right so let's see where
are where apps get started so what's
this what exactly is it sign up to spark
read your first app okay I'm gonna sign
up I'm gonna put in let's play pass word
Oh 34 password 34 ass word 34 okay let's
see was this not now okay so was
Johnny's at Bari mints I don't know I'm
just gonna click create app okay so this
is required I don't understand was this
Johnny's app I'm lost I'm lost in this
application I don't know what's the
point of this app honestly YouTube play
hey it is a SAP delete this what is this
I'm lost I guess this application is
like it's technically supposed to be
something where you can find different
developers and you know I mean I don't
know the user experience gotta get a
little bit fixed well that's fine I mean
you're a developer you're not a UX
designer you're not a UI designer like
okay now one thing that I am gonna call
you out on is this
you see there's there's no padding
around this like text and images should
never be touching the walls even this
right here unless that's what you're
going for put is a progression bar like
this should never be touching the walls
the borders so let me see let me look
into this we go in guys okay so we got
this okay I don't even know how how do
you put how you put this image in there
you put inside of a tag okay that's what
I was missing I just I don't know I
would have done it like that but that's
fine um okay so one wanna see is alright
you see this you should definitely put a
divider okay and put a div right like
this right here is one section this
should not be having the the text and
everything else on the same section it
should be divided into two sections like
okay there's one element and then the
image itself is one section and then
this area right here should be another
section so I could just easily come like
let's say if you would have made it into
another another section
I could easily came in and read padding
13 pixels Hey and even at that this
looks better than how it was before you
get the little difference like when you
have padding it just makes it look more
cleaner okay now if you want this image
to be 100 percent whiff of the element
make sure it's in a separate element
then this section down here this is like
the details this is the image so you
want that to be its own section separate
then how you have it right now all right
Oh as far as the application is cool it
shows you you know some what is this no
J yes I don't even know where's my
application settings where's the
settings or more tools extensions enable
is hey now is going to spark app refresh
this okay so you are well you using Ruby
okay so that's cool using from what I
see it says Ruby on Rails but that's
what's up
the only thing I will say is just I
don't know about this application I
don't know what will be its purpose you
know what I mean sometimes we try to
like you know come up with our own ideas
you know and sometimes it doesn't get
delivered the right way so my advice is
listen there's no shame on recreating
somebody else's application like let's
say for example Twitter or recreate a
Facebook just renaming it and changing
it around right creating a social
network creating something that's
already there you know because in
reality you want to show the the person
that hey my application is that this you
know at this level but at the same time
you don't want to have to be worried
about oh I gotta come up with a great
idea like no it's like you want to show
your skills that's what you should focus
on all right now putting your portfolio
here I don't know if that you know that
really shows anything cuz technically
the person that's watching your your
portfolio is already thinking like hey
this person already did it so there's
really no point of view announcing I
hate my portfolio I made it in here you
go this what I used on it like you don't
need it you don't need to actually put
your portfolio there sessions I says
this project isn't quite ready demo yet
um I will say try to get this up online
there's a way to actually share your
react native application
browser there's a way to delete let me
see if I find for you I mean I'm pretty
sure rappelled IIT has it so you could
literally take your code and go to rebel
that IT right and pretty much go to a
new rebel
if this was like the browser want hold
on let's say build this web think they
change a couple of things in here for
some reason I don't know it kind of
feels different
let's see let's see they kind of changed
a couple of things in here but go to all
languages that little thing that just
moved at the bottom right and here you
search react needed right and then from
there with Expo you can actually load
your react native there and you could
actually share it to people yeah it's a
way I mean I've done it before I can't
remember what was the site I know
Red Bull has a I can't remember exactly
the other site is Red Bull and there's
another one that actually lets you show
the person your react native court all
your react native application to
somebody on a browser alright so look
into that because having an image that
says hey I've done this on or react
native I don't know if that works okay
yes you have
oh dear boy nobody's gonna go in there
I'm being 100% honest nobody's gonna go
in there
people like to skim through things right
they go over your portfolio like it was
just like a resume they look at your
little thing and then they throw it
right back you know if nothing caught
their attention you know just throw that
let's say right back so you know now on
the next one which is I'm C log in
comparative explore
seems cool
being I'm not gonna go too
application but so far assume school I
mean I guess it's like you have two
images and people vote which one is the
best one and which one the like it seems
cool seems nice
alright now going back to
everything like I said yeah I always
tell everybody here you know as far as
the portfolio
it looks beautiful looks great I like
the design looks nice and clean
everything smooth the typography is
perfect now what you got to work on is
your projects that you have when you
perform you like you need to start
building stuff that real businesses are
going to need build a restaurant or a
building let's say build a system for a
restaurant where instead of them having
to use something like GrubHub or what
was the other one I forgot the other
company that is come competition for
grub up but let's say grandpa right how
people call just order online and then
the delivery how about you build that
system right with a real restaurant and
a real or you know a design that's out
there something that looks nice and then
you have I don't know like a demo
account at the bottom of the screen you
say hey use this demo account to see the
back end so somebody doesn't have to go
in there and actually register put in
their Facebook but in this isn't that
people don't want to do that when they
check it out like an application from a
prospect a future employee or employee a
young developer like people just want to
go in there and they skim through it
like nobody puts in time nobody looks at
your code nobody looks at that he
comment thinks well like nobody's
looking into that right nobody's
expecting you to have a perfect code but
what they expect is for something to be
easier for them to see like oh this
person has this skills
they created this they he has a whole
bunch of you know he got a back-end he
got a section for users he got uh you
know users following other users like
you know what I mean you can see it
through the backing I don't know if you
understand what I'm saying but hopefully
you know
I could say about this portfolio is that
you have some solid projects you have
some things that shows that you have
skills
you just gotta go the extra mile you
have to come in and start building you
know real projects for real businesses
right things that really solve a problem
sometimes creating like you know
quote-unquote like little startup B
applications like it seems cool nice but
it doesn't show like hey I'm actually a
pro you know what I mean like this is a
big difference between saying hey I just
came from a boot camp hey I just came
from you to me
hey I just learned this the stuff from
free cocaine there from actually seeing
a couple of portfolios and projects that
you go like bro I'm a pro
don't ask me you know what I'm
saying like that's the type of projects
that you want to show to people you want
people to just be like yo we need to
hire this guy now before somebody else
sees this so that's all I will say about
this portfolio and yeah and I find or
anything that you might have in the
future if you fix this up a little bit
you add extra projects go ahead send it
back to me go to face at gmail.com if
any of you guys I wanna get your or
fully or hosted here
you know just for the show none of this
stuff is like nobody has the best
portfolio nobody has the best
application if you have an application
you have a portfolio you have something
that you want to show to the community
and you say hey Joe look at it
critique it you know give me some some
opinion on it then I will put in the
show in you know we hear you know what I
mean
tab I so anyways when we out here I'll
see you guys I'll be right here you know
that mean I was about to say I'll see
you guys later but the I'm so used to
that every time that I do a portfolio
like this is something new I'm trying a
lot of new stuff man I'm starting to try
a lot of new things so I'm like doing
the review portfolios on my live shows
right I'm going to be talking about
different topics in my live show right
in
like I said I'm going to be cutting them
down into smaller clips now the next
part of the segment the next show this
is the next show the next part of the
show or I don't know how to call this
next part you know what I mean next part
oh I wanted to basically give you guys a
link that should be on the description
right so on the description of this
video if you are on your computer I'm
going to also add it here so you guys
can see it basically how long give me a
second
I'm gonna add it in the into the
chatroom for those of you guys that are
now in a computer you guys can actually
click on the link and I want you guys to
vote on this right because I was talking
to another more successful youtuber
somebody who I respect and shows love to
the channel I would not name them
because they don't want to be named
they're big let's just say they they're
big you know I mean but I don't want to
be named I don't know why but listen bro
I respect you think so I was like I'm
not gonna name you out here alright so I
was talking to him and he was telling me
like young why are you splitting your
your channel up
you're gonna have your live streams on
your channel which most people don't
even get to watch the whole thing right
and then you're gonna create another
channel that's gonna have the bytes so
it's like every clip of of the video of
the whole live stream is gonna have it
in multiple sections right so you're
gonna take it from here to put it in
another channel that's not a good idea
bro so that's what the person told me
but I think it might be good I don't
know now he might have
a real a real thing like you know like
he's being honest with me he's like yo
don't split the channel because then
you're gonna have you know coding freeze
bytes over there and then coding phase
right here now this is what you guys
come in this is where you guys are here
live the guys that get to see me all the
time you know the guys that come back to
the channel all the time I want you guys
to decide with this link that I'm about
to give you that is on the description
that basically says it is a link it's
just a survey it's just a survey guys
it's nothing crazy you know it's like
it's just a little simple survey right
sure live swing clips be hosted on the
main channel or another Channel I want
you guys to decide that and we're gonna

link I'm gonna paste it right here for
you guys

I don't know how he he knows me
we're gonna do a collaboration is gonna
be a surprise you know we do so you know
collaboration his channel my channel you

minutes I'm going to start letting
people come in to the show and we're
just gonna talk about different topics
okay so yeah like I've been doing it the
past few I don't know past few days when
I do my dropping gems with coding face
you know so here's the link guys click
there that's gonna bring you over here I
want you guys to just vote you know just
vote and let me know what you guys think
what should we do we got the respond
shall we split them up or shall we keep
it in Kota face the channel because I
know a lot of people don't don't watch
the livestream a lot of people missing
so then and even at that sometimes we do
in our livestream sometimes we do
two-hour live streams right so it's like
do we just alienate people that don't
even know about coding face bytes or
don't even get to watch the full
two-hour or do we come in here and leave
it on coding face what do you guys think
no beginning a couple couple of volts
all right so it's right there I'm gonna
put it up again there's about fifty
seven people live with us make sure make
sure you you come in guys and you know
click on the link just vote do that for
me man you know the next few weeks is
gonna be a lot of experimental things
going on on the channel as you can see
I'm changing the format of the live
shows I'm also gonna continue doing my
random live streams you know from my
phone but whenever you see me here at
the office this is gonna be called
dropping gems with coding phase you know
what I mean and at the same time I'm
also giving people the opportunity to
come in and be able to to actually you
know be part of the show in we get to
answer people's questions and you know
we go back and forth between me you guys

might get John summers up in here we
might get Chris Hawke's we might get a
traversing media we might get we don't

decide I'm going to go with it
if only 22 people voted this is what
we're gonna go with right
we are they're gonna start the new
coding phase bites which is gonna sort
of like I don't know it feels like it's
gonna be another channel like I really
want to do that but then at the same
time I don't know if I want to do that
because I realized that most people just
don't watch the live stream or they like
you know they're busy sometimes they
miss a sometimes they don't get the
notification so if I go I'll say hey
guys is on coding phase bites they might
miss out on that
you know I mean I don't want nobody
missing out of the beauty of all the
topics that we go over in the live
stream you got what I'm saying so yeah
man so we got 26 26 people voting so far
majority seems to be going hey just keep

up another channel so I'm gonna give it
another 2 to 3 minutes hey it's when
people yeah 26 people got got coding
fees in the palm of your hands right now

hired as the new UI software developer
so I appreciate it man much like a man
your boys he we also got a member of
coding phase dot-com
we got Jay guitard up in here shreya
straight out of Australia yo man
straight out the Outbacks peace out
there fighting alligators he comes back
your boy Jacob Todd man what up son no
watch man what up hey how's the Outbacks
man how's the Kangaroos house whose
boxing in the backyard you know what I
mean who being who being of the the the
kangaroos out there man
listen man yo
we want to thank 2j Guittard for doing a
lot of good work yeah coding face.com
you know the community chat room on this
court I want you guys to you know if we
had like a we need to get some sound
effects man I need to get some sound
effects up in here just like you know
get some applause this rule and guys
whoever wants to jumping I believe
there's a maximum
of like 9 or 10 people that can be here
live with us so take advantage before
this whole thing fills up this whole
area fills up we got two people in here
plus myself so we probably got I think
like seven more people that can join
live okay so yeah to doubt every man
congratulations man for you know getting
hired and yeah that's what's up I mean
what's the stack what you guys is
working on right now we're gonna be
working in angular it's some see like
c-sharp and some that stuff but mainly
I'm just gonna be focused on angular
because I don't I really have much
experience in c-sharp
or net plus but they're willing to train
which is really great so but I do have a
strong point in angular like the latest
version of angular so when I went to the
interview they you know they saw that uh
you know angler skills were pretty tight
so and I had some projects on my
portfolio so I think that's nice
I tell people man you gotta you gotta
get in there man you gotta get you know
it's either angular react if you know
one of the tool you're gonna be good no
matter what it depends on who you are
you know if you like the angular way or
you like the react weight either way is
fine either way you're gonna be golden
out here you know what I mean so you
know yeah I was really big hurry to like
well not so much in a hurry but you know
after I got more comfortable with
JavaScript it was like okay I gotta
learn a framework like I just started
off slow got the basics down of
JavaScript and then from there I just
went on I gotta learn angular I know
angular's hot or react but I just went
on an angular route because traversing
media had like this deal on udemy so I
just have to learn a word that's how it
is when I'm also coming out with the top
ten udemy courses that every developer
should have for 2018 and actually the
the angular course from traversing media
is one of them you know I I chose this
course because it's pretty simple pretty
straightforward there's not like a whole
bunch of theories I
we're gonna go over every single thing
that angular has is like no these are
the things that you're gonna use them in
your everyday for your application this
woman this was gonna get you hired so
I'm really happy that yes oh no I was
gonna say uh yeah Brad's been killing
man he has like the angular course that
he made is just really really good he's
good at breaking down things he just
updated it like a couple of months ago
and angular 5 and firebase is really
really really good so yeah I mean
Georgia media has been really really
great and you as well gentlemen I got to
give props to you for keeping this
community going and tired a man if if
they if you need anything man if it's
someone be help just let me know man I'm
a email or a livestream away I should
say yeah no definitely man I really

me up but you know I've been like super
busy even like Jay guitar boy Jake I
keep saying his whole name is like Jay

concert is like yo man was good we
puttin this thing live or not and I'm
like hey bro it's like I haven't even
got to I have even freaking guys the
chance to check it out what Oh
pretty much you know I really appreciate
it everybody that's hitting me up like
you know we want to be part of coding
phase we you know we want to show love
we want to give back to the community
yeah I really appreciate it guys you
know and as far as you Donovan listen
congratulations you you're now about to
start working you know holding it down
for the detail you know what I mean so

to catch all the last rooms that I can
allow me to or just tune in from come
home from work yeah I'm gonna be around
man guarantee you now don't worry that's
why I plan on doing the you know
dropping gems with coding face two days
out of the week one day is gonna be
early in the day ending another one's
gonna be like in the night time to give
to people that want to come coming or
either day you know the opportunity
because I know a lot of people work some
people are still in school some people
are training at home you know so if like
if you have the time in the daytime
that's fine if you can you come in
through the night I mean there's like a
GED program out here you know what I
mean I guess I got the word man so we
got somebody else in here we got who we
got in here Carlos what up Carlos
Roberto we got Carlos out here making
fool you know what I mean live that's
area what you eating right now Carlos it
was cold in that quinoa in that good
stuff man right in here was good it was
good hopping not much came back from
school water heater body sewed so yeah
Carlos I mean last time you didn't you
didn't get to speak that much you know
you look tired or you will feel tired
man
so tell us a little bit about you man
cuz we didn't get to speak to you to you
last time that much
Oh a little bit about me 20 school
coding uh it's gonna take a long time
for me to get a degree it is uh how was
how it happened was I went to school for
business and now I wanted to do computer
science but thing was a lot of math and
when I took the placement test or those
who don't know it places you on a
certain in that level I took the easy
one I got play super low I took the
class I was bored out of my mind some
way I'm still a business get that easy
degree and you know it was always until
recently I'm like damn what am I gonna
do with a business degree though I won
back to computer science but now I got
to take all those mats and I'm like you
know what I can't I'm still sticking
with school I'm I got a dropout over I
can't be I can be happy to have to work
man you know ya know I mean don't worry
I mean it's like an extra year and a
half you know two years it's fine you
know sometimes you get to you know find
yourself you know Midway of a career you
could be doing a whole bunch of other
stuff you know when I first went to
school I went in as was a I went in as a
teacher I didn't want to go to school I
went to uh like a quote unquote
Institute before I even started college
to become a audio engineer and then I
finished that in like nine months and I
couldn't find no jobs right cuz
everything they taught you like super
quick and it's one of the reasons why I
tell people boot camps are pretty much
 because it's like even though I
didn't go to a boot camp I went to a
boot camp for something else you know
what I'm saying like I know that process
of like going in and they teaching you
things super quick and they don't care
that you learned as a hoops somebody
learned during the classes I guess you
didn't learn it that's on you
you know so um so I know the whole
process and I went to school and started
like I was gonna be a teacher then I
switched it up to
programming and systems I was in the
same places you I was like yo I took the
placement test and I was like yo they're
like okay you're gonna have to take a
whole bunch of math sounds like I don't
know I don't know if I'm about to do
that k so I was like yo I just want to
get a degree I need an associate's
degree so it's a associate's
degree in programming systems then from
there after I finished from that it was
so much
I didn't even tell nobody about the
story like I went I finished like in
2000
II I finished in 2011 and because I
didn't have a internship for you to
graduate from the school that I went to
you need to have an internship and they
couldn't find a place for me to put me
in like a company right
these people they told me you can't
graduate so I didn't graduate to
December of 2012 so like a whole year of
me not going to school not doing nothing
right I was working at the time but I
was like yo I didn't have my degree in
my hand the whole year because I didn't
have an internship and then once I did
the internship they they're freaking
gave me my degree but it was crazy
because they told me like oh oh you work
already so you could've just said they
that was your internship I'm like why
didn't you tell me this you know that
means I was like I wasted a whole year
oh and then I go back to another school
to do computer science and then when I
was in there I was like man they told me
all my programming courses that I took
from my associates was gonna transfer to
the school when I got there that was
like you got five courses out of like
the whole two years meaning I will have
to do it another four years after the
two years I was like if that so I got
some a communication design and
and just like I left that I was like yo
whatever moved on so it's like I
definitely know what you mean when you
know sometimes you you you get like this
bumps on the road you're trying to get
the degree that you really want but it's
like they make it so difficult for you
you know what I mean yeah
every good thing widow would
web-development know and that's why I
took your course you know end up uh kind
of get that job like quake yeah yeah
yeah you don't need a degree for this
yeah and this is awesome that is and I
love doing this so this is like it's
like I tell people all the time um I go
listen even you know right now you young
though you you super young you like what
you like twenty years old and you go to
it all right if I go are cool it's gonna
take me till I'm like 24 of full-time
students and you know I'm trying to do
that I'm already you get uh my parents
are supporting me not a lot of people
have their I already pressure I mean
they're like you got a job yet working
yet oh my crying too yeah
instead one do it and uh what I what I
see you a lot of people a dashed in the
past was a lot of people cast like
should they drop out to do something and
what I've been doing this for now until
I get my my first job is I'm saying I'll
do it full-time and then and then decide
off and ask if someone can do and then
ask if you can do change so later on
with what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take
longer to get that degree but it's gonna
be part-time or time school you know it
might take me 10 years but I ain't gonna
need that degree right now I'm probably
not even gonna need a degree but in five
cuz I'm still gonna be doing web
development
alright so wanted just in case later on
I want to do like eighty signs or
anything that requires math I got it
mmm-hmm now that's what's up that's
that's the smartest thing to do even I
myself I was thinking about that the
other day I was like yo what does it
cost me to do like to three hours of
like even though you know go to school
like I was like looking at where I live
like just a whole bunch of like really
really good school like Yale is like
thirty minutes away so I'm like yo I'm
out of switches like I could go in and
apply to one of these schools and see
which one I'll get in just for the hell
of it just to get the computer science
degree because in reality my long-term
is like I want to be teaching to people
and like in a classroom so it's like no
matter what you can't bypass like you
need the bachelor's degree computer
science to teaching like a university no
matter what so right what does it cause
me to do like two hours a day you know
what I mean like crying so it's smart of
you to say hey I'm gonna continue with
this and just like I'll do it part-time
and when I get I get it you know what I
mean yeah and I was just throwing that
out there cuz I know a lot of people all
in the same situation yeah and like I
was saying like you you super young but
even at that some people that might be
like you know 30 31 years old you know
gosh and guys handing me up like yo I'm
38 years or don't know if it's too late
for me to do this I'm like bro just hop
on this cuz you don't need a degree it's
like it's more of like hey can you do
the job and this you can't do the job I
want you to you know you know you could
get hired you know what I mean like you
good you don't have to waste your time
in in trying to switch up your whole
career and not get paid for it you know
what I mean like this at least you
switch up and you know I most four to
five months you could find a job you
know if you do the right steps right if
you come in here and and just like play
around but I oh there's like a hobbies
like I'll get there I'll do it two days
out of the week I'll see you two years
from now hey Joe two years later I got a
job I'll be like okay cool
how many hours you put in two per week
I'm like oh they're like four hours you
know I wanted to chill you know then
that's on you son you know what I mean
right like like I said man if you follow
the road man trust me especially if you
follow the timeline I tell people follow
the timeline that I have on my website
even if you don't want to take the
courses with me find it online you know
what I mean I sign up to the website try
it out if it works for you a lot of
people that have signed up a worse for
them right now
if it doesn't work for you you have the
term line that's free that's like your
guide to how to become a developer and
you could take that from any other
person that's out there you know you
might have a traversing media you might
have a Steven Greiner you might have Co
steel you might have whoever the hell
you want right but that's the guideline
that's the thing and you're gonna be
good yeah yeah your time one has the
time line has helped me well man
like a computer science teacher back in
high school last year he was the same
computer science teacher I've had on in
middle school and I remember in middle
school I learned game development I
learned all these little things but I
created them like any other high school
course which means I took him soup and
it was fun but right after I forgot a
blow and then he came to me last year of
my senior year of high school he pretty
much planted that that idea I like
Archie have you thought about computers
and you know maybe like my second year
of college which is last year I started
coding I started going free free code
camp and man I've wasted so much time I
mean what I read what I learned in two
months taking your programs oh man
one of the things we were a freak free
free code camps was there at that always
learning I thought I was learning I was
getting Heights however when it came
time to start making making websites I
realized I don't know what the hell I
was doing and what I was doing I didn't
know early barely knew CSS and your time
on has held because third times we're
I'm not sure if I should move on I just
look at your timeline and I want you
know what if joke says it's time to move
on it's time to move on yeah listen I
tell people free cocaine or coke Adam II
you know
although the free solo learn all those
places are cool those
places are grateful whenever you're on
the phone you're like oh let me try this
out let me practice some stuff out
you're on the train you waiting on
online somewhere is great to go to those
places and practice right but you need a
resource that's teaching you hey this is
a website this is how you break down a
design and how you break things down
into layouts and you know and the CSS
and how to work with BOPE how to work
with JavaScript how to do all this stuff
you know what I'm saying like you need a
place for that and up to me going
through those places like free coke and
coke Adam E etc like it just doesn't
teach you that like this at the end of
the day you could go in there spend I
don't know three four hours going one by
one one by one one by one and then I
come to you like ok cool build me a
website you're gonna be like what like I
don't even know where to start you know
what I mean it happens to everybody so
don't worry about it it's cool hello
hello so yeah we got a couple of new
people hold on hold on we got a con a
con what up ok you go you go say what up
to the people are you from man yeah I'm
all here for me giant Saskatchewan
Canada AE Canada we got this we got the
boy out here selling straight from the
mountains
you already know there's snow out there
right now yeah cool cool cool we also
got our your boy
Sonic the Hedgehog we got him right here
man you got sonicing here man sonic
what's up man how's everything going
good I'm pretty well man how are you man
good to see you again I'm I'm doing good
I'm just saw it's been a lot of time on
JavaScript basics and just trying to you
know master that stuff because um you
know
I spent a ton of time watching tutorials
but I think what matters even more is
what you're able to move away from those
from tutorials and just start coding it
remember like how to make stuff so
that's what I've been focusing on just
getting really familiar on the basics
before you've been jumping into uh es6
and all that right right yes sir so we
got somebody else in here we got your
boy Tyler along Tyler how long Tyler's
mute it says Tyler is beauty let me see
we got Tyler in your yeah Louisiana
man what's up man we got people from
everywhere man
we got the whole United States North
America Africa we got people in
Australia we got people in Japan we got
people in Tokyo we got people in South
Korea we got people in North Korea you
what you know it's like you know you
remember when Michael Jackson who was on
that I put everybody together we are the
world you know I'm gonna put the whole
world together and we're gonna sing
Kumbaya you know to me person
Kumba yeah listen man doing the Nene
yeah
yo man look so what's good let's start
wave on Oh show we got somebody else
here hitting character an ass yes well
we got a hidden character somebody
pressed some leggings left right left
right a B and beat and we got an ass
real quick yes yes hello was good were
you from me I'm from Morocco
hey we got people from Morocco you shout
out to Africa man what about people from
Africa what up daddy I mean you know
what I mean yeah so what's good with you
Anna's on what you working on man
okay so um I'm still I'm still 18 and
I'm interested in computer science and
exactly and in the program
I love since I start coding I start with
the HTML and my pc broke and then it's
both the amount that I want to buy
another one
so I can star and I'm like so excited
that she so yeah like that's it now
that's what's up man I mean you just
started that's how it is that when you
start menu your early stages right now
no listen are start going in hard man
learn the basics HTML CSS hop on to that
JavaScript you know try out some jQuery
there from there jump onto a major
framework either angular or react and
then you should be good man if you
really want to become a web developer
now is the best time it doesn't matter
where you're from anywhere in the world
you know people are hiring every single
day not only that that I was telling
people or one of my cousins from the arc
that you know in the are like for them
they feel like they don't have that many
opportunities and then I was telling her
I was breaking it down how I found a
website out there where they looking for
people who are engineers guys who are
web developers and they couldn't find it
in Dominican Republic they couldn't find
like the developer so now the hiring is
crazy they have hearings indians and
pakistanis to go to dominican republic
and work over there on the companies
because people are not studying computer
science they're not studying work
developing out there and I was telling
him like yo bro this is crazy
you're telling me that they have to
import people from other places because
people don't know that this is a career
that they co actually choose it was like
I'm pretty sure even in your area in
Morocco
you know you might go over there and
maybe I don't know how's the tech scene
out there but you could I'm pretty sure
you can find a couple of businesses that
might need your services you know what I
mean yeah so so definitely keep going
man all right so Tyler how about you
what the hell you up to man out there in
Louisiana what you working on
I've been learning a flight the past
like five to six months and the web
development community on the first
programming language I learned was
actually Java and I used that for about
eight months working on little small
projects and now I decided to get into
the web development community after I
figured out that Java wasn't something
else
Java wasn't something I wanted to ever
to actually do so I got into the web
development community and and I'm I know
HTML CSS I know no n react and I'm
trying to pick up angler also but but
right now I'm trying to build up my
portfolio so when I go on Stack Overflow
and indeed I can um I would have a
portfolio to actually show our my
projects so my main goal right now is
to at least be like for like four amps I
wanna make like four applications with a
front end and a back into it
just so I have four applications I can
put on my portfolio and I began to get
my site so I can start applying the jobs
okay look the only thing that I will
give you as an advice because it seems
like you already know exactly what to do
um pretty much what I would say is don't
focus too much on getting four or five
full stack application only get two of
them right right
get two of them that you could show that
hey I did the front end and the back end
right to different type of applications
and it has to be for for businesses all
right so although I'm hearing like
somebody you gotta make sure you don't
have me on a speaker alright so so yeah
Tyler um what I would say is basically
build two applications then after you
build two applications front and back
also have like another three which are
just a front end right which is just
different applications like let's say
for a restaurant or like let's say a
small business in your area build a
website for them right you want to have
real type of websites you know sometimes
I I feel like people put into their
portfolio like little games like you
know we saw Raphael in the first half of
the show for his portfolio review we saw
that you know he had he had a couple of
applications but it wasn't like really
showing you know everything that he can
do right and at the same time to me they
didn't seem like small businesses you
get what I'm saying like you wanna have
websites day when people look at it but
I okay this was done for this week's
area this was done for this ecommerce
website this was done for a real estate
this was done for you know a taxi
company that you want to do stuff that
is for real businesses so a business can
trust you with their code you know
because a lot of times how can you
really show somebody uh you're prepared
unless you show them like hey man I'm
doing websites at a at a high caliber
you get what I'm saying like it's like
I'm I'm up here with the best of them
you know what I mean so you want to show
that to them so that's my only advice
that I would say so don't focus too much
I'm doing the back end on every single
website just do three front end and then
do do two that are gonna be full stack
because doing full stack web sites full
applications they take a long time so
you could come here and say I'm doing
four different them four different ones
and then next thing you know that might
take you two months you know what I'm
saying it's like instead of you spending
all that time building this to replicate
those four applications you might as
well put that time and learning
something and then start applying for
jobs so you could get higher and get
paid while you learning you know what I
mean like when your junior developer
nobody's expecting you to become like a
master in six months right so
automatically they're gonna give you the
opening to come into a company and at
the same time know that hey he might
make some mistakes he he might come in
and he some extra help
he needs a senior developer but that's
how you learn and you get paid at the
same time as you learn so yeah let me
see um was a console what you up to
economy you out there you're trying to
learn you're trying to learn what
development I mean what you up to so far
you got HTML CSS JavaScript you got all
of that oh I'm not really a front-end
development like you all are and more
bag and Moxie Girlz vase okay cool cool
cool not as good for you I will say just
focus then all databases make sure you
learn my sequel back out with you what
you're working on I'm walking on a
microkernel on what a microkernel
microkernel
okay so I mean what exactly is that
you're gonna focus on you're gonna do
the trying to focus on web development
software engineering what was it that
you saw when hearing and it probably was
probably embedded systems okay okay see
that's a whole different ballgame you
know what I mean that that you
definitely gotta go in there and you
know study your books go in there go
hard working your your data structures
get your algorithms in boy that is a
misconception people think that system
development is more it's more algorithms
know that that is the same principles
from web development just put it over
there just transfers over is the same
thing and just you know what I'm saying
what I'm saying it depends on the
company that you're going to because I
know from from experience like what if
you're going to web development is it's
easier to get in you know what I mean
like it's easier it's like you come in
you create a portfolio right you create
a portfolio you have your website and
then you have something to show for you
know when you're working with
applications and all the type of fields
like you you really have to how you got
to demonstrate to the person like hey
I'm prepared you get what I'm saying
like you gotta have more knowledge than
somebody who's just say hey I'm a
wonderful yeah yep you know yeah you're
right is some degree right I think is
pretty much the same thing it's our you
know I believe like Linux rules you know
the the author of the original dinners
kernel like he he never he never like
when you come to college he didn't have
a degree when he wrote the first kernel
getting out further theater you know
like so those are things that I try to
tell people that you just have to have
that that our ambition touch that that
push you want to do something and
definitely you up to it you can do it
it's
yeah what I'm saying I'm nothing that
you can't do it what I was thinking what
everything is that it is more work
because right now let's say right now if
you're gonna look in your area right
you're in
what was the Ontario Canada Saskatchewan
Regina Canada I don't even know was that
yeah it's it's province just better for
Calgary you get to see Saskatchewan okay
okay what area um okay so let's say what
will be a title of the job that you will
you know your ideal job that you're
looking for I do a job I do job will be
I have no idea job for real like I don't
I have nothing ideal I just I'm just
fascinated by the way things move just
love the thinker I I think I think of
myself more as a thinker don't think
apart put them back together and just
watch how things work so I really don't
have an ideal place I've been in Java up
in JavaScript and I have some few things
I've done in JavaScript and the web
framework as a whole but as we all know
that I'm not very good InDesign thing so
I really bad after people who really
have the eye and the spot for that I
mean I could build a website that it
would have good logic that the whole
presentation laughing gonna suck yeah
yeah I mean everybody everybody has you
know the pros and cons you know I mean
and what they're good and what they're
not gonna at least you know the good
thing is that you know exactly what you
focus on you want to just do the back
end you want to focus more on systems
and that's what something not I mean so
let me see um some people were telling
me about NASA NASA if you wanna if you
want to be part of the website coated
face.com send me an email we'll get you
a membership you know
for your journey as a HTML as a web
developer you know what I mean so
whatever you need you guys I would
support people sending me as like Joe
give them the course give him something
guy people's like guide him give him
something so an ask whatever you need
some you send me an email coding phase
at gmail.com we out here we trying to
help everybody out you know what I mean
so I know it's gonna preciate it
I know exactly how it is out there so
yes sir
so let me see let me start finding some
good topics for us to have a cup of -
all right you wanna go first yeah I just
was wondering because I tried looking
into the state of NPM and I don't think
I don't know like what do y'all think
about the state of NP and the package
manager for node what do you all think
about way these right now and was a
future for NPM what do I think about
MPM um I think iBM has been
revolutionary as far as like you know
bringing a you know a package management
to everybody because even nowadays you
see in every job it says no js' well a
lot of times they don't even care about
node because then I have a running node
what they care about is do you know how
to use NPM how to install with libraries
how to work with dependencies etc right
so I think what they've done has been
amazing I would like to see maybe
another competition coming up I know we
have yarn no I I don't know if you're
niz really a competition to NPM I think
it will be cool to see another package
management system out there like I know
I think Java has like multiple ones this
this different ones like you know even
Python team I think I like it you know
is like you can use multiple different
ways or even like with Mac you could
just you
homebrew I think this should be like one
that just unifies everything because
even with golang Golan has its own way
of of getting the packages or even a
crystal laying crystalline got shards so
there's like a whole bunch of different
ones out there I think this should just
be one centralized that every computer
in every system like in every company we
use so I don't know I don't know what's
the future for NPM I think like they
open the doors to you know the
possibilities in like letting people
know about using more package managers
but I don't know exactly what would be
the future if there's something else out
there you know I mean I would have the
same conversation now few days back with
friend ad that was about this thing of
NPM and because we're looking into
another package manager that it seems to
me that having everything centralized it
is probably not a good idea because NPM
has I would say Java screen would have
been out of a lot of much better place
right now as compared to languages like
Ruby and Python and even the new karma
elixir in the saying that there is a lot
more garbage in NPM than any order repo
out there and in a package manager.how
there's much more garbage in NPM as a
package manager I do agree with that in
the sense of like with NPM like you know
any bum sorry to call people bum any bum
and any person who wants to say hey man
I wanted to create the Pied Piper
package and now they upload it right and
then not only does just everybody just
please everything and it's just the
other day I was like I was I was just
well my friends were like we don't know
what's what's going on what's happening
at but it's a scary thing when you think
about it that opens horrors you know has
a lot of great innovation but it's in
time it's our own downfall it probably
is will be our own downfall because I
looked at
a library wonderful a cs110 student came
over and asked me that occasional good
in our website and she was at my wish
library should news and I was trying to
explain her at it it's not about the
library is more about on the line part
of the library should be concern about
the author how was made and what what
whoops
what's this what's what what talk was
put into the library before you use it
and she came up with all these component
names I've never heard before in my life
when I was library I was like I don't
really know about that and that prompted
an Austin few friends of mine to look
into it it was I was horrified when I
looked at the size of NPM and what
package is out there and when I started
doing in needs and house looking at
small those packages I was just
horrified I mean you have hello wall
they have trained we printed these print
that house but I mean they should be I
believe open sauce is good but it should
be a set and control to everything it
should be a limit where we say as an
open source community that we say yeah
you can push but at the same time they
it has to be a review before before I
commit they just push push push a review
before I commit push push a review
before commit that's what I think I mean
I I sort of agree with you in the sense
of like you know the mound of packages
that are inside of MP Airmen and repose
it's pretty much just ripples Reysol the
amount of repose that are on NPM and the
fact that you know so many people just
upload things that don't need to be
uploaded again you know it's like the
same thing with the problem with
JavaScript in general you know that that
is the main problem with every single
day somebody comes in and recreates the
wheel that was already created and I
also agree with what you were saying
about the authors sometimes you go into
a github or you might see like on github
Explorer and you might see a new library
is it has 10,000 stars right and then
you go in there and then you like wait
the code is horrible this thing has a
whole bunch of errors oh you know a lot
of times people give stars like stars or
candy you know because you know I did a
live I try to avoid get hug I think
github is more they do more like we call
it over here the sense the San Francisco
effect where you start up as a start-up
and you grow into this enterprise that
has monetized I believe we believe that
github is more social media then I mean
what are the stars therefore I mean like
big buckets should be should be in your
repository of the day I mean but I look
at things that shouldn't have any stars
and they out like I was looking at a
game a game engine that was phaser feyza
feyza yes game engine and what this
plug-in being with a store is two
algorithm doesn't Manhattan and a
Euclidean algorithm a it was horrible
implemented and the author had like was
it like three thousand stars on it I was
horrified like if these eventually lands
up in your phone in the game and people
use this thing and it's just oh it's
terrifying
you guys actually hear me by the way on
yeah
a my phone went day of me that school
school school Tyler's phone gave up say
listen I'm out I'll see you next week
you know but ya know definitely as far
as like you know a con which is saying
you're right in some cases I think
phaser Jas is pretty good for you know
for being open source and being free
it's not it's not the best it's not
definitely not you know what is it the
the Frostbite engine from from EA you
know what I mean like but that's why
it's not a real engine but that's why
those companies they're you know as like
so paywall like you could use the free
for low pay but if you want to release
it to the world you gotta pay you know
my understand I understand the logic
behind they said I was I was talking
about the the plugin that that an alter
world and github
oh the plug is modifying the algorithm
that was I had about 20,000 starter for
an old repository that and it would
algorithm was good it was a good
algorithm but it was wrongly implemented
and it had a lot of performance issues
and he didn't really think I was trying
to commit faster or just just get the
stars out there and what was horrified
me was the fact that he got 20,000 more
stars on something which wasn't well I
mean I could show you something I could
show you something here to where this is
something called react ID I talked about
this a few months ago this thing when it
first came out and even now it has seven
thousand seven thousand seven hundred
seventy five stars and react ID doesn't
work so what is the stars for you know
what I mean like you come in here you
try to download this and you try to run
this and this doesn't work it just
doesn't work so for them that I always
like his own beta I'm like yeah but why
are you getting stars if it's not if
it's not solving an issue is now nobody
has tested a nobody has given it
anything no as far as like you know with
github stars that you're right in that
sense of like hey these things are like
social media you know people give a
little like you know you saw a fat ass
real quick I'll give it a little like
you don't know that chick got eight you
know what I mean so that's how it is is
the same thing but oh yeah man we bout
to jump into the next topic just
appreciate a fact that you guys a door I
believe that oh you guys are the future
of everything javascript and web just
want to get you input on that thank you
yeah so let's see uh
was it that was talking somebody else
had another topic was a diamond sonic
sonic no a sonic Oh Sonic Sonic Sonic
let me see how long we got somebody else
in here we got a leak
I'll leave what I would I would up you
know Ally you ain't here man
we got secret characters man alright
guys so I wanted to also talk about a
new framework alright
Oh a new framework call amber amber a
framework I don't know if you guys have
heard of it no I know sometimes people
get scared people be like oh my god is a
new framework there's always a new
framework every single week got that
right yes amber so we got amber right
here so this is actually running with
crystal lang
oh it's a pretty cool framework if we
can like eat instead of the a I think
somebody in there no no this is amber
so pretty much it got a whole bunch of
contributors is it's pretty legit me
with crystal lang sure people get muted
okay oh yes so this is me with crystal
lang and there's a pretty cool framework
because it's actually very similar to
Ruby on Rails if you any of you guys
have ever used would be on Rails pretty
much what they did was they took a lot
of ideas from Ruby on Rails they took a
lot of ideas from Phoenix they took a
lot i d a--'s from you know even stuff
like express that I feel like they got a
couple of ideas from and what they did
was they just basically converted
everything into crystal lang if you
haven't heard of crystal and crystal
lang is pretty much like Ruby part to
write Ruby plus extra powers you know is
a pretty legit
programming language it's all
general-purpose you can do web
development you could do game
development you could do application CLI
applications whatever you might need
um this framework is actually made with
I believe is the MVC model all right so
it's basically it's basically you know
it's running the MVC model so if you
ever use something like laravel Ruby on
Rails you're gonna be at home you know
it's a pretty legit system they got some
testing they show you how to do
deployment they got a couple of command
lines CLI tools you know they have um
amber D which is deployed you got
encrypt you got generate just like Ruby
on Rails where you could generate the
models and generate the database you can
come here and generate you know whatever
you might need for that model you have
routes you have watch.watch is pretty
cool because it's like no daman for
nodejs
where once you do a change on the on the
server-side code it refreshes the server
so instead of you having to stop the
server and restart it again it
automatically does it for you and I'm
pretty sure if you guys have used my web
developer bootcamp you guys have have
seen you know watch right so yeah man
let me see hold on we got we got a sonic
sonic game peoples in the background got
a mutual real quick sorry about that so
uh so yeah so I wanted to know what do
you guys think about this this new
framework if you gonna you know talk
about this make sure you um you your um
you your your microphone and let us know
I mean what do you guys think yeah I
think it's kind of state action oh go
ahead
now may you continue he was talking
first okay
I think it's kind of interesting um I I
use was a larval and the PHP framework
so it kind of reminds me of that
especially with the whole generate of
functionality I did a little bit of a
ruby when I first started learn how to
code at the time it was a bit confusing
but I think this is kind of it's pretty
interesting from that standpoint you
know I'm generating and kind of using a
framework and I think frameworks are
interesting because you know it takes
out especially the whole like you know
NPM generate command line type feature
that most these frameworks how that kind
of takes out that work of just building
you know starting from scratch or
building a component or a feature for it
you can just generate let it run in the
background and you have to work so I
think it's interesting I I would try it
if if I were to get into Crystal Lang so
that's just kind of my two cents on it
yeah how about you Tyler I um my two
cents is well I'm not really into
crystal Lang so so I'm I don't really
see myself actually using it's like
framework but if I was into it I would
probably check it out though um it looks
pretty cool judging from the github it
looks pretty sick yeah I think look this
is a pretty cool framework I think
crystal Ling is not gonna be for
everybody is it's more for people if you
like let's say for example let's take it
like this if you need something that has
a lot of good performance and is pretty
fast and compiles quick then I will say
crystal Lang is perfect it's probably
the closest thing to see right as far as
like you know programming languages out
there right now if you need something
like concurrency and also to Crystal
link is gonna hold you down right I
don't think it's gonna be for every
single person out there but like let's
say like this are used to work in a
digital agency where
what they used to do was they used to
create advertising for a whole bunch of
different blogs right they used to have
a section it was pretty weird company
they had all type of stuff like that
they used to promote it was a marketing
/ digital agency / our advertising
company like there has so many different
things right now this company needed to
build like their own system the same way
how Google Ads Google Adwords and Google
Adsense half their their advertising
like you know when you go to every page
and it follows you the the you know the
advertising you search something two
weeks ago and then now they show it to
you again with cookies so they need to
build something like that and they
needed to serve up to acting like 300
thousand websites right um when you have
a system like that you can't really do
it in something like PHP like PHP is
gonna be bottle I can't handle three
hundred thousand concurrency requests
right now like PHP is gonna have a heart
attack you don't know st. so situations
like that you might come up and say hey
I'm gonna use something like nodejs but
no js' even at that is not even the
fastest one you know so even for
requests and going back and forth so you
might say hey I might use golang but
yeah you could go ahead and use golang
but what if you say I just love the
syntax of Ruby I love the same tax of
Python I love the the syntax of Crystal
length so that's when you would choose
something like crystal Lang / golang or
over any other programming language for
performance speed and the fact that the
syntax is something that you're
comfortable with you know what I mean so
this isn't for everybody this is more
for a niche of people that need
performance and need speed and even at
that like let's say right now you come
up with a social network right and
you're gonna build a social network from
scratch
would I tell you hey build the social
networking PHP if you know that social
network is gonna grow to be I don't know
a million concurrent users at a time on
a chatroom let's say you have something
like chat roulette right I wouldn't tell
you to create chat roulette with PHP
because it just Oh Cho couple be like oh
man I can't deal with this I'm about to
blow up right but I will build it with
something like crystal Lang or golang or
even no J yes right but now it will be
like preferences if you are like a Ruby
Python guy you would choose crystal lang
if you are more of like C type of guy
C++ a guy who was like okay I want
something more low-level and I want
something that the syntax is not similar
to anything else then I would choose go
Lang but if you are somebody who is like
oh man I'm just I just want to do a
JavaScript and nodejs
is there for you you know what I'm
saying so this whole framework is not
for everybody but the reason why I bring
it up is to make sure that you guys are
aware of all of these new technologies
that are out there and what's the pros
and what's the concert of them you know
what I mean so personally I appreciate
it yeah all right sorry go ahead
oh no I was just saying I appreciate it
because it's good to kind of know when
new technologies are out there just to
try something new this is something I
will consider trend sometime down the
road or just to like you know do a small
project to see you know how it works how
it you know how it takes how you develop
in it you know just something outside of
my element normally for something that's
like logic based that's like a back-end
I usually turn to like PHP and there are
laravel but I'm willing to you know
explore other avenues when it comes
technology so thank you for you know the
exposure this is something I definitely
will look into down the road
yeah no definitely you know for me I
think like crystal Lange is like the
evolution for anybody who's interested
in Roby if you're interesting Ruby
Python crystal Lang is the place for you
now the reason why you haven't seen it
that much out there like you know people
like what their Flags you know how
people saw this a new framework comes
out a new language comes out people is
with them waving the flag you know 50
billion blogs on it yeah exactly the
reason why hasn't gone to that point is
because they are still in beta but they
are like the final stages of beta once
it becomes 1.0 and it's a rat you know
because the the problem with the
language right now of crystal Lang is
the fact that right now you might be a
version 0.23 point too right tomorrow
they come out with 0.23 point 0.3 but
now something that you created yesterday
broke if you update it because they're
constantly doing changes to the language
and adding your features and optimizing
it doing Windows support giving it a
whole bunch of stuff right a whole bunch
of bells and whistles
so once the stable it says okay this is
1.0 and this is how it's gonna be you
know what I mean like when when
something is 1.0 like let's say for
example by versioning how it works at
1.0 that means that's how it's gonna be
steadily right when it says 1.1 or 1.2
1.3 those are just updates those are
updates and like little things that are
fixing bugs inside of that language at
that moment right it's not a really big
changes there's nothing that's gonna
break you know what I mean so once it
gets to that number one is a wrap you
get what I'm saying like this is like
one of the best languages out there I'm
telling you I never get hype about
anything I never hype anything up but
this is the same thing to happen like
five years ago five years ago but one of
my co-workers was telling me about
golang he was like yo this is
the next thing this is the next big
thing out there and I was like I don't
know about that Sun you know so I
learned from that and I realized when
something like this pops up I say I'm
gonna invest my time into it let's look
into it now this guy's into Michael is
into golang they're making $180,000
starting you know I mean there's guys
coming in I've seen guys that going up
to two hundred sixty thousand dollars to
do go leg you know what I mean so if you
come in you say hey I'm one of the first
ones doing this language I know the ins
and outs I know all the mistakes or all
you know or the pitfalls that it might
have then it's a wrap after that you
know what I mean like now you could call
yourself an expert you know there's very
few people ever saying hey I'm a react
expert the only people that can call
themselves a react expert are the people
that have been doing it since beta you
know what I mean because they know how
the whole system works or even angular
or or any other framework or language
out there the guys are really experts
other guys that's been there since the
beginning the guys that contributed to
the language the guys that you know put
into sweat and tears into it you know
but definitely I will tell you guys to
check that that framework out I'm
probably gonna do a quick crash course
for YouTube so people would check it out
and test it out especially if you if
you're looking to build like a real-time
applications crystalling is the best and
I found that working with amber it just
makes it easier because all you have to
worry about is just your running
application and in the backend
everything is already set up for you
like cookies sessions flash like
everything that you might need it's
already there for you
so yes sir I'm breeding over here I'll
be able to check it I'll be sure to
check it out Joe yes sir man oh let me
see who else man reading what people are
saying on the chat room so we're her
that you was talking about how we should
actually check I mean
and the problem I have is that I have
like so many other languages and
frameworks on my list there I want to
say I want to actually learn there um it
might be a well before I could even
check out there like crystalline yeah
definitely I know a lot of people got a
lot of stuff on their plate a lot of
things on the list
and that's why I tell people man listen
um I myself I can't go in there and try
to learn every single language every
single framework out there like I've
been trying to learn Elm like once in a
blue moon like whenever I have extra
time cuz I'm interested in it but do I
have the time to really learn it no but
what I do is certain things that are
very similar to each other like when I
already knew like let's say for example
Ruby on Rails when I jumped into larvae
or it was the same thing for me so I
already knew that I already know how
everything worked on it so it was an
easy transition if you already know
laravel then you already know Adonis Jes
so then it's just in in JavaScript it's
just the same thing but in JavaScript
and this is the same thing with Amber so
amber is now a copy boy is very similar
to Ruby on Rails so if you have use Ruby
on Rails it's easy to transition into
amber because you're already seeing
everything there you know in web
development I tell people at a time once
you know the basics and you don't
understand the fundamentals every single
framework every single library is doing
the same thing
everything is very repetitive so once
you know it once you basically knowing
every other language you know what I
mean it's like somebody that comes in
and tells you oh man I'm a Java
developer it's like yeah that's all oh
hey do this in Ruby they'll be like oh
man I can't do it
Ruby yes you can because pretty much all
you're gonna do is just you know return
back a JSON or return back we render
page or HTML page
arrey or file so it's pretty much the
same thing doesn't matter what language
it is all you have to do is just revise
over
syntax at once you do it once you
knowing everything tell people like
people ask me Joe man I don't know if I
should jump over PHP you know like I'm
focusing a lot on JavaScript and I'm
like focus on on JavaScript but jump to
PHP to understand the backend right in
an easier way than knowing it with noce
yes and then you could jump to know J
yes by the time you go - no - yes you
know how the backend works you got what
I'm saying yeah that's actually what I
did pretty much yeah I feel that way
because uh because it on just like I was
saying like since like Java was the
first thing I basically learned um once
I got into the web development community
and I started learning in JavaScript
like um it was kind of easy to me
because I didn't really have to like
learn like the like basic like um stuff
in JavaScript because I already knew I
like all of this stuff was like I
already knew what the bully ins was
functions
um um I already knew what the UH the
apparatus was your statements and like
all like that Jeff so that stuff wasn't
really like to hunt to me and then I
started to pick up Python like about a
month ago and I must say that um I do
like the Python syntax I do like the
fact that I don't have to add or
brackets I think it looks better without
brackets but that's just my opinion I
like it yeah definitely
I'm on I'm on the same boat man
listen I preferred the Ruby and the
Python syntax over anything else out
there is to me is just cleaner coding
and easier to read even at that like
there's certain things like a ruby they
if you want to return back something at
the end all you have to do is put it at
the the last line like you don't even
have to put into the word return on it
because the language already knows the
last line is what you're trying to
return from that method it's a pretty
smart language man but here guys I think
we've been here for a while about to
call it a day I really appreciate that
everybody thing here he had art man we
had a coffee and we had Carlos we got
Donovan Jake you already know your boy
Jake out here aka young coding face you
know your boy out here listen you guys
hear me can you okay yeah I hear you I
met but you know sorry we have to go but
listen
Oh somewhere this week we're gonna do
another one the night time for those of
you guys that cannot be here in the
daytime we're gonna do a little get
together again you know just talk about
web development talk about coding you
know right thanks for everybody for
being here Tyler boy Joey did you did
you make up your mind about that survey
800 word that's a good good idea to
pretty sure most OB people say a coding
phase key panel coding phase yeah it
seems like yeah I think I'm one of those
people that said that - yes yes so the
majority of people they're like yo keep
down coding phase man work it seems like
only thirteen percent other people say
so take it out of coding phase and put
it into another channel so what I'm
gonna do
behind the scenes I'm gonna talk to Jake
Jake tard and basically what we're gonna
do Jake is we're gonna continue
upload it to to the bytes right same way
how you been doing it yeah and but the
only thing is that what we're gonna do
is just upload it to there I'm gonna
make it Oh private and then I'm gonna re
upload it to the website so nobody's
gonna see
only just me and you some pretty much
we're gonna use that channel as a
personal place to upload the videos and
transfer between each other okay no
worries man sounds good yes sir you
already know man listen guys we here we
live is another successful show dropping
gems with coding face
you already know sit boy joke back at it
again Cody face comm make sure you
subscribe make sure you like this video
guys if you're looking to learn how to
become a web developer if you ty you're
just wasting your time looking at every
resource out there you just say hey man
I just want to follow one guideline get
my job and whoop-dee-doo you know keep
it moving if you're one of those people
go to the website try it out you could
go in there if you use the description
link of the description is gonna give
you 50% off automatically and you're
gonna be good you know what I mean so go
to the website check it out it's your
boy Joe back at it again coding phase
