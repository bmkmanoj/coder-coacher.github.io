back at it again man khodam face calm
alright so today we're going to start
with explaining what are all the files
inside of this project right a lot of
people send messages as a joke I'm a
brand new developer I'm overwhelmed with
all the files are inside of this project
so we got to start from the top to
bhangra okay so this is get this files
here are only forget to know just
basically keep track of everything
that's going on inside the repo all
right now here are shards this is like
package management right so it has a
whole bunch of different libraries or a
different projects that people have
created and I'm basically using the
massive dependencies right okay then we
have the asset in the assets folder this
is where you're going to make your
components for react this is where
you're going to put in your sass and of
course you're going to have this main
file that's going to import all the
other CSS that you might want to use all
right okay so this is the library folder
this pretty much has all the information
from camel you know database my sequel
all the stuff you guys don't have to
worry about it's just pretty much just
extra libraries that is going to help
you build a little cool projects all
right now of course you got no modules
these are all the small packages that
you might be using where I don't react
or with any other libraries like might
use later on that you might want to add
to your own projects that's where the no
modules is going to be yet then you have
public this is where you see there are
like static files so let's say an
example you have a JavaScript regular
JavaScript this is where your javascript
is going to be compiled to meaning here
you have to run this raw you know and
think of it like that but on this world
and then here is the one that people are
going to see on your website so that's
the simplest way to put
you got of course you're going to
understand more about this as we go
along with the tutorials and yeah so
yeah so we're gonna have the
JavaScript's here images here CSS here
and then we have to spec spec you are
pretty much just test you know unit
testing testing you could do with
crystal which is a pretty cool feature
that crystal lang has and yeah alright
so it's just touch think about it like
this after we build our app we're going
to do a little test where let's say if
the user is logged in you know it's
supposed to be true right so if it's
true this thing is going to say okay it
passed the test that's simple small
little things like that you know I'm
just saying it to you guys in a higher
level so you guys go understand and yeah
here we have two sources right this
where all your back-end work is going to
be at right so we're going to have rocky
here for now you guys don't have to
worry about nothing about this here are
basically the views is where you're
going to have your views for your page
so you got this includes this the layout
this is the pages then from there you
have your routes so like routes are
pretty much and let's say you want to go
to google com that's already a slash so
that's like the root folder of it so you
know right here we have the rendering
all this stuff I'm gonna go more deep
into it later on you know once we get to
route for ya you know you got the rocky
folder this you don't have to school you
know you don't have to worry your body
right now this to config here you're
going to put in your database
information this your errors whenever
you want to say hey if I they use
against a four four errors show them
this like hey whatever whatever ever you
want to put like hey you're not supposed
to be here whatever
you want to put right all of the stuff
you're gonna see you later on ok there's
the app folder where your configure is
going to be your control isn't going to
be your models is going to be all of
these things is pretty much like I said
later on you're going to learn that ok
definitely we have BMO are see which is
just a settings file for babel just to
transpire javascript it's just a
settings file you don't have to worry
fondling stuff the same thing as get
ignored that's if like I say you want to
ignore a file from your get up then you
put it in here ok then it has travis you
don't have to worry about that right now
you have to gulp file also i'm going to
go more deeper into this later on you're
going to be able to understand what's
going on with the goat I'll right but
here are the settings for the goat file
right and then from here we have a
license we have a readme you guys could
delete that as you know for your own
project what else we have this which is
just pretty much just showing you the
libraries and stuff for Rocky what else
we have shorts diamo this is where
you're going to put your dependencies
for shards stuff that you might need for
crystal leg all the stuff you don't have
to worry about right now I'm just
showing you guys about the folder
structures and what files are in there
but everything as soon as we get to that
point I will be you know going back into
it then two more in-depth tutorial body
all right then we have what pack this is
just basically configuration I built all
this stuff for you guys so you guys
don't have to worry about this because
you know learning web pack learning gold
learning all this stuff is still a
project themselves you know like you
have to learn that i will point but
you're still you're like beginners right
so you're just trying to code right now
you're not trying to learn another
library another
you know stack I'm just teaching you a
way that you could actually get up and
running with creating websites as soon
as possible and then as you go you catch
new things and learning things there are
going to be useful in every other stack
okay and then we have the yarn that lock
also you don't have to worry about that
okay guys oh yeah in the packages
whenever you want to add a package that
is being used by mpm or yarn you out of
here or you could do it through the
terminal by doing yarn add react or yarn
add read up all the stuff I will go into
the next tutorials all right i'll see
you guys with a little bit stupid joke
back on it again man Conan face calm
