at it again listen man we out here :
face.com make sure you like this video
make sure you subscribe
one more thing man I need you guys to
start sharing this videos already in our
digg.com Facebook Twitter anywhere man
anywhere that you know other developers
is that share it trust me
listen we're gonna do five projects
alright five projects that's gonna test
to see basically if you're ready for
primetime
are you ready to start going to
interviews like with this five projects
you pretty much if you could actually
get done all five of them you are ready
to start going for interviews we're like
I'm being honest so we're gonna start
with this you know five projects to test
web development skills alright number
one go to dribble comm choose the design
for a website that you like build that
in HTML CSS it has to be responsive and
close to the design you know close as
possible to the design right so you're
gonna come here to dribble calm and
you're gonna say hey whatever you want
to do like mess a web design right let's
say something cool a design that you
might like right like mess a an example
let's see Co school well that was fine
let's say something like this something
nice simple right are you gonna come
here and you basically you're gonna
build this of course you could choose
whatever design you want of any web site
and you know it's not stealing this is
just for you know for our practice so
you could actually take somebody design
and practice you know creating you know
your website right so you're gonna make
this into HTML CSS and you know and
that's it and make it responsive it's
not that not difficult right so if you
could do that and make it exactly how it
looks you know the same gradient same
colors in the background then you know
you're ready to move on
to the next one you know the next step
all right there from day you're gonna
create a to-do app you're gonna come
back here and you're gonna search to-do
app you're gonna take one with a nice
design something that you like write
something that you feel it's cool so
you're gonna come here
and let's say the same example let's say
something like this right
which is something simple right
you gonna take something like that all
right that was like something and those
are two new app that was pretty nice
okay guys you already know man
I'm doing this shit live man so I'm not
really this is like improvised I just
came up with this idea one of my
subscribers gave me the idea hey give me
five five projects man so you know here
you go you know final to-do app right
something like this right you have
whiteboard get get inspiration out of
this right and create a to-do app so if
you know single-aisle to-do app is just
pretty much something simple like image
is something like that it's like you
know you're gonna be able to write you
know a task you know be able to delete
it edit it you know and be able to see
what's inside of it that's what to do
what if not just you know google it
pretty much but created with you know
with HTML CSS and JavaScript okay
the first project was just HTML CSS now
the second project you gotta add it with
JavaScript I want to see some
interaction so something interactive for
this right so the third one is pretty
much you're gonna come to the Star Wars
API right sois pico right and you're
gonna take this API
and you're pretty much gonna get you
know like messing example people's right
you gonna get this API and from there is
gonna give you a result then from there
what you're gonna do with that data
you're gonna create a page that connects
to the API and basically display
something you know I don't care what it
is just if it's just the title if it's
just saying hey this is Darth Vader's
pager
this is Luke's page or whatever you want
to create you know it's up to you be
creative create something cool you know
so but the whole point of this is just
to see if you could actually know how to
you know Rita API and be able to connect
to it number four do some research on
JavaScript front-end frameworks right
right the pros and cons doesn't matter
just you know which ones you picked it
could be view react angular whatever
you're more comfortable with especially
for now for 2017 write angular tools and
pretty much create you know rebuild the
the first project and you know
recreating now but what a single-page
app right so it's that simple okay now
number five create an API with nodejs
and connect your number two project with
it so remember the to-do app that you
have to do in JavaScript I want you to
connect that to the nodejs API and be
able to you know post data into your
your server so you have to create
something I'm gonna say in Express write
something simple and connect it to a
database my C cool or MongoDB whatever
you decide right so it's pretty simple
if you could do those five things right
then you're ready to you know for
primetime it's that simple
like if you do five things from this
list then you're gonna be fine if you
can't do it then it means you still
gotta work on a couple of little things
you
just touch it up alright anyways guys
you already knows your boy job back at
it again
