it again man coding face.com
your boy is backing out and did it again
all right guys we here we live listen
what are the best tools in web
development people keep asking that
people keep worrying about that people
keep thinking the head man I gotta use
the best one I gotta use the best
framework I gotta use the best library I
gotta use the best editor I gotta use
the the faster framework the fastest
editor whatever right everybody wants to
use the best but the best is really
relative to whatever makes you a
developer right and who you are how
quick can you get a job done you know
cuz somebody can come in and say hey the
best framework out there is angular 4
right but it takes you two weeks to
finish a project and angular 4 but you
could do it in three days and react
right so which I'll show you pick make
sure you do it in angular because it's
the best and people say oh it's the best
this is the best thing that's out there
or should you use something that you
already know and you're comfortable with
right I say that because a lot of times
people always worrying about the best
and not worrying about the code you know
like
don't worry about the best tool worry
about which one it's the one that makes
you more proficient it makes you more of
a better developer which ones are you
comfortable with you know I've seen
people that can do the same job that I
can do and react number they could do it
in backbone am I gonna be like hey guys
don't use backbone because backbone is
is a bad thing to use what's going on in
other places you know like guys stop
worrying about what they use in San
Francisco what they use in in New York
worry about what you should be using in
your area you know this goes back to to
like you know what's this guy's name the
creator of you when he answered one of
my video he came in and left a comment
he was like oh that I'm hating on he's
like hey we'll never get you anywhere
and I'm like bro why are you talking
about like I can't have an opinion and
then he goes and writes back he's like
oh it's not about you have an opinion is
that you said that there's no jobs for
view GS and this and that and I'm like
bro you live in a bubble
first of all right so a lot of these
guys they live in a bubble like I live
in New York right but I don't live in
the New York bubble I don't think of
what development of what's happening
here in this little bubble of New York
it's what's happening around the world
right so he goes like oh yeah you know
Adobe get laughs they're using view Jes
and I'm like just because one developer
on those companies put it somewhere in
the backend and said hey I'm using it in
the backend now
now you're considering Adobe in and
whatever get labs and orders are the
companies you think like that's their
main framework no you know what I mean
like
it's like rain now somewhere in a
Netflix right in the whole stack of
Netflix somebody some developer out
there might say hey let's put a view jes
for this little button here he could do
that because he's just one little bite
right are they doing that for the whole
website no so to say oh they using view
de-essing every company is like no man
some random developer who wants to be on
the latest thing on the Internet on the
latest hype put it to a freaking button
right like you know what I mean so a lot
of people here they worry so much about
Oh what's going on in San Francisco
what's going on in in New York was going
on in you know Austin Texas I'm telling
you guys don't worry about what's going
on over there worried what's going on in
your area because that's where you live
like yeah you could look into it but
don't be like oh man we have to jump on
whatever they doing because if they're
doing it is the better route or if like
let's say an example if google comes in
and says hey we're going to jump on on
Pearl everybody's gonna start doing
pearl
why will you jump on Pearl when the use
case that that Google actually uses us
for the reason that they use it doesn't
go to you it doesn't go to your company
it doesn't go for your needs you know
what I mean like some people might not
need components they might not need
components they might they might not
need a single page app that's not just
because a lot of people are jumping on
single page apps which now they're not a
lot of people a lot of companies they
realize like finally then I oh yeah
single page apps is is completely
retarded having a whole website or
single page apps makes no sense so now
they notice in that and people are going
back to letting the server render things
which makes sense right
so
you know it's like don't jump on things
is because other companies and other
bigger companies are doing it it's like
a little bit weighing Twitter was doing
Ruby on Rails Twitter was built on Ruby
on Rails right people was using Ruby on
brows because then I oh yeah meant
Twitter uses Ruby on Rails this and that
right then when it's where to switch to
I believe Scala I think in Scala when
they switch to Scala people were like oh
man
we gotta leave Ruby on Rails because
Twitter switched to Ruby and red
switched from juvie arrests to Scala and
that's like man what the hell are you
guys talking about
are you having Twitter problems are you
having freaking 300 million users per
day using your web app no so why are you
worrying about problems that you don't
have and most likely you're not going to
have you know what I mean you know it's
like sorry Philippe Philippe or Philippe
Philippe to bring you up I got so pissed
off because yeah so like what I was
saying I keep saying the other day which
is something that I hear all the time
they're like oh like yo everybody's
using webpack everybody uses web pack to
export the CSS basically do they sass do
their same amplifier they do everything
through web pack and somebody told him
that and then somebody told them that
right but that's not really what's going
on right there's a few companies who are
doing that and then now everybody thinks
like oh this way what everybody must be
doing and it's like no that's not what
everybody's doing you know every company
has different flows every company's
doing their their own thing you know
it's like me myself I like to use gold
as a task management right just for me
for basically to know which test I
wanted to run at the moment I would
never put that through through web pack
because web pack doesn't have those
functionalities the way you can
customize everything exactly how you
want it you know I know people who still
use grunt right so it's like right now
if you don't have if you like apps for
you to do everything through web pack
makes no sense that's just being honest
if you're not built if your website is
not a single page app there's really no
sense for you to be building everything
directly through web pack at all but
this is something that happens in the
industry a lot of people worry about
these things they like me but what what
are they using New York why are they
using in you know I don't know mtv.com
why are they using on or nbc.com did
they probably using webpack for
everything is like no not really
you know what I mean because they're not
single page apps you know it's like a
lot of times things like that happens in
the industry man and it just you know it
gets passed down from one person to one
person to one person and then people
everybody keeps changing their minds on
things because they heard it from
somebody else
and they're like wait it's like you know
how I wasn't what's the name of this
there's like urban legends when somebody
goes like man you know from world
personal but okay Johnny cross the
street and he got hit by a car alright
you know it's like you're in class and
you've my own man you remember Johnny
from from third grade he came in one day
he got hit by a car
all right the next next year somebody
comes in and creates another story
Johnny came in got hit by a car freakin
a bump came and took his heart then the
next person comes in creates another
story and they're like yeah Johnny came
in got hit by a car
and then from there a bomb took his
heart and then he took it to McDonald
saying in a tea with some fries and like
stories keep on up every time that
somebody passes it around and they're
like yeah man what happen in in some
companies doesn't mean that's what's
happening throughout the industry like
me that's why I take on a more of a
global approach I come in when I give
you guys examples I show you guys things
I take the approach of what would be
happening in the world I wouldn't tell
you exactly hey this was happening in
New York I will tell you something
that's going on throughout the whole
world I'm not gonna come in and tell you
hey guys because in you know in my five
block radius
everybody is using react I'm gonna say
hey guys the whole world is using react
now that's it nobody uses any other
framework I wouldn't tell you that all
right all this stuff happens because
everybody's always worrying about which
one is the best tool and it's like stop
worrying about that I repeat myself stop
worrying about it worry about which tool
makes you a faster developer which tool
are you more comfortable with so you
know what I mean
good question Philippe says so why are
you teaching hyper app knowing no
companies use it because hyper app is a
tool my thoughts out and it's like this
thing doesn't want to let me in oh my
god this thing's killing me I found out
that basically if you're gonna build
something with JSX right or you want to
create
a small component on your page and you
need something that's super quick super
fast and you look I'm gonna make the
video real quick on my camera because
the service is horrible but I will see
you guys later because this is really
annoying all right love you guys I'm out
because I'm getting pissed off with this
