me myself in a couple of people's who
are also working on the Ruby on Rails
course that's what I'm up to right let
me show you right now shared the rails
blog let me share the screen with you
guys so there's the website this is the
first project on Ruby on Rails that you
will be building ok got a nice little
animation pretty much this is this is
the show page let me show you the home
page so this is the home page currently
there's the background how it is you
could change it however you want
you got your major full story here
different there you have a couple of
other stories you know all of this is
built with Ruby on Rails you know what I
mean different there we have you know
this other page which is gonna be our
show page so when you click on one of
the the articles in the front page is
gonna bring you to this so this is the
full blog post and yeah you gotta say
like it's pretty legit got everything it
was cool if you guys want to add to see
a portfolio you can add it to your
portfolio at the same time if you say
hey I want to reuse this code there I
want to use it for my own block use it
for your own blog you know what I mean
so yeah I'm actually releasing another
video where I talk why building a blog
post or owning a blog post building a
blog
a CMS for a blog is such a good practice
right it's a such a good example for you
guys to practice okay like it's really
legit man what's your opinion WordPress
WordPress is great is great for let's
say you know Johnny's pizzeria comes up
to you but hey man can you build me a
website you're not gonna go in there and
build a website from scratch it doesn't
make sense right so let's say in a
situation to come in we say hey we only
got six hundred seven hundred dollars
for you can you build me this for you to
build a back-end build the CMS built
everything from scratch it's gonna take
you way too long
and it's gonna be too many hours right
this person was a website simple clear
and just like responsive you could
literally take WordPress build something
super quick and get that seven hundred
dollars in your pocket
you get what I'm saying so that's why
it's really good you know WordPress is
good for people that don't know how to
code word presents good for people who
are like let's say you have a small
little digital agency in your
neighborhood right and you build all the
websites for all the local businesses
now you can come in and start charging
people you know a little quick 700 here
and there and then you charge them you
know $150 for the hosting even though
the hosting only calls you for the two
dollars per year you charge $30 for the
domain name even though the meaning only
calls you nine dollars to get you know
it's like you gotta learn how to hustle
on here you get what I'm saying
you gotta learn how how to think like a
business you know so yeah WordPress is
great for what it is is it great for
building a full application no it's like
you're gonna find yourself hacking at
WordPress constantly you know what I
mean so it's definitely not the best way
to go if you got a built if tomorrow
somebody says hey man can you build me
Facebook WordPress is not the place you
know you have to build that from scratch
let me see what else is it any big
business on southern themes in WordPress
yes you can make a lot of money selling
things on WordPress but you got to learn
how to do it
you gotta learn how to swing to your way
in the way how see a lot of people do it
is they create free content meaning you
create five six different free wordpress
themes right and each WordPress theme
you make it known all over the web you
send it to blog posts you send it to
theme directories for free and you think
oh man it's free I'm gonna spend time
building it but what you don't
understand is that those people that
downloaded those things for you now they
know you so now you could either have a
thing where instead of you giving off
just for free you take everybody's email
and you say okay I need for you to
download this free theme you gotta send
me your email so now let's say
everything that's free people get it
right it's just like my courses on udemy
all right I have a lot of stuff when you
need me that's free right why do I put
it on udemy for free why because
thousands and thousands of people get to
see it and if like okay they liked it
then now they search coding phase calm
and then they find my website where is a
paying website paying subscription so
it's the same thing with WordPress
themes you give out for free and then
you have your Prime
your premium your best of the best
cram was a creme of the creme whatever
you keep it on your website and you sell
those or you sell it on thing for viscom
you make your money like that you know
what I mean so that's just how it is man
but yeah man we here we live any
questions let me know man we here for
like well like 30 minutes we're gonna
hang out for like so 30 minute lunch
break you know
that's what I plan on doing while you're
trying to get on WordPress Barbara
trying to jump jump on da Barbara wave
or not the WordPress wave that and
become a Wix developer yes yeah that's
another thing too that's after you know
after I finished doing like a whole
bunch of like front-end stuff that I
want to do like react react router I
want to create a couple of more projects
and react then I'm gonna come back to
like sort of Ruby and I want to start
building stuff for Shopify
because one thing that you're gonna
notice there's a lot of jobs for people
who know how to work with Shopify so
many companies are switching up to
Shopify so what used to be the market of
WordPress a few years ago WordPress has
this thing called WooCommerce everybody
was using it and everybody's losing
using WordPress now people are signing
signing up to WordPress so what's
happening is that now there's not that
many people who know how to work with
Shopify if you are a ruby developer I
was reading this on a blog post I need
to share it with you guys there's a lot
of Ruby developers who are quitting
their jobs as Ruby developers to become
freelancers in Shopify in the Shopify
market because you make so much more
money let's say you come in and you say
hey I'm gonna build a a I think it's
like a plugin you create a plugin like a
OBS slider but you need to know Ruby and
you need to know how Shopify works so
you create this little plugin people
don't know most people don't know how to
do that on their own so they need to add
a slider turn a page you create that
slider and then now you sell that that
plug-in for five dollars five dollars
might not seem a lot but once you start
getting to a thousand people count that
you got what I'm saying so then it just
keeps growing so that's like a passive
income that's just there if you come in
and start making a whole bunch of
different
now you got like 3040 plugins making you
you know let's say each making you an
average of $900 how much money is that
you're talking about like $25,000 a
month you get what I'm saying like I
come in here and give you guys knowledge
I don't come in here and give you guys
bs man I don't come in here and try to
tell you guys man this is the only way
to do it no there's a million ways to do
it I don't want you guys to just go in
and start working at a company that's
wack you want to go into a company start
working there for experience for you
know for the experience to come in and
and figure out how things work your
first two three years should be at a
company but if you're somebody who was
an entrepreneur you already came from a
large company like you know I was I was
talking to Kelvin Davis like Kelvin
Davis you know something he already
worked in a company he already left a
good paint salary from you know from
before you can't go back and being like
hey man I'm gonna take a $50,000 job you
gonna say like you already tasted you
already got that little taste of that
good life you know when you taste that
good life you don't want to go back to
the bottom right so you come back into
this and you say I'm coming in as a
developer was a developer that's an
entrepreneur you gonna say you know what
I mean like we in here man we constantly
getting subscribers man but look that's
what I'm saying like you come into into
this game you know I'm changing the
whole game man I'm changing the whole
game I'm changing how people are
thinking about this I want people to
become entrepreneurs and I want people
to come in and make side income work at
your job work as a developer for a
company but also make your side income
you know the people that work it doesn't
matter you can look you could earn a
million dollars a year right but somehow
in life no matter how much money you you
get right your expenses are always going
to be about 70% of whatever you earn all
right so if you keep board with that
how much is it that you have to play
around with right how much money do you
have to play around with only 30% of
your income doesn't matter what it is
that you do a doctor is the same thing
you know I've seen doctors that come in
you know yeah they earn $300,000 but
look at their their expenses through
their life right they come in and they
freakin they buy a big-ass house they
buy a nice car all those things send
their kids to the best schools okay cool
but how much money do they have to play
around with you know a lot of people
live on credit cards man I wanna have
credit cards and I want to have money to
play around with you gotta say and the
only way to do it is to actually have
side income besides whatever you work at
besides whatever career you have you
should always have a side income you get
what I'm saying like it doesn't matter
what level you get to you know what I
mean like what's this guy's name
well Warren Buffett could be the biggest
billionaire you know I mean those guys
have crazy expenses no matter what level
you get to you're still spending about
almost 70 percent of whatever you're
getting at that year everybody does it
that's a human nature you know what I
mean it's like it's not like how people
think is like man when I get to a
million dollars a year you know I'm
gonna live on on $50,000 a year and the
rest I'm gonna put it into into a
savings account people don't do that
we're gonna people don't do that people
start going like oh man
I'm not going on coach let's rent the
jack you know what I mean like you know
the biggest artist in the world the
biggest rappers biggest pop stars they
all do the same thing they could earn
five ten million dollars in one year but
their way of life changes so now they're
expending about 70% of their home income
no matter what so it's not like people
be like oh I'm gonna take that I'm gonna
take the you know my jet blue I'm gonna
I'm gonna hop on JetBlue know people is
like oh cool we got money now let's
let's rent a jet you know what I mean oh
I could buy a Honda a caballo or
whatever
nah man let's buy a
half-a-million-dollar car you know what
I really people do that all the time so
it's just at different levels tomorrow
you might get hired and you might get
$100,000 but your expenses somehow you
decided to move to a better neighborhood
you decided to get a better car you
decided to freakin a splurge on that I
hate I'm going on vacation three times a
year and every time that you go on
vacation is $6,000 or plus your vacation
just for like three four days all right
people do that you get what I'm saying
so it's like they come in spend their
money so if you didn't have that extra
income coming in you don't got this you
don't got that blue cheese in your hand
you're not saying I learned that the
hard way
I learned that over the years so that's
why I come in here I'll break it down
for you guys give you guys life
experience the things that I already
learned I'm on a different level I
really learned all this stuff why do you
think you see me out here you're now
saying like it's all side income store
everything that I do is side incomes I
have my main income and everything else
is just blue cheese it's just you know
stuff that I could throw in my salad
that's how I look at it you know I mean
so yeah definitely a bar is like man I'm
moving to India only need $300 to live
good out there word I mean if you could
do it more power to you you know what I
mean
that's why a lot of people's look at the
guys that moves to timing right
my dream was to move to Thailand at some
point and I'm gonna do it at some point
I'm gonna do it for like a few months to
three months I'm gonna move to China and
we'll take the family you know you live
out there with 600 odd is he good you
got on saying so imma do it I'm just
waiting until I set myself up where
everything is already automated you know
what I mean but like I said man never
work just one job you got a half a side
income other stuff that's generating you
money because if you say hey man I'm
gonna get a hundred thousand dollars and
I say what do you do like those guys
that I'll be looking at all on like
freakin
on San Francisco right like this guys I
live out there you know that's why when
the other kid was he sent me that
comment I started laughing it's like
yeah I mean I'm freaking started playing
I'm like bro I've been to start up
playing and it's like guys out there
looking like bumps like to be honest
with you you know like guys is looking
out there like bumps like all the cool
for this you know pay the rent or they
go for it is go to you know good little
restaurants here and there but they
don't have money in their pocket you
know what I mean like even though they
earning a hundred thousand one hundred
twenty thousand because it's so
expensive out there the only people that
look that live good are the people who
are like the owners or companies the
guys who set up startups
you know the founders those guys are
good now you the developer you just a
developer do like just on rent and life
expenses you're already spending like
seventy thousand dollars right so let's
say after taxes you get a $120,000 in in
San Francisco right you get $120,000 in
San Francisco after taxes you probably
get like about honor eighty seventy five
percent eighty you know eighty seventy
five thousand dollars out of it right
out of like cash right now if your rent
is twenty-five hundred dollars per month
how much is that you know I mean you're
looking at now let's mine is like twenty
five thousand dollars then from there
you gotta eat then from that you gotta
move around go to or transportation you
know do all the stuff people constantly
paying for overs over there
everybody's addicted to ubers
everybody's addicted to post meets
everybody's a addicted to the uber eat
how much you think that cause right
there their money the money that they
have in their bank account is almost
nothing at the end of the month right so
it's like when people come in and be
like oh I mean this isn't there I'm like
bro that doesn't mean nothing you know
who who I really be like yo they doing
good somebody who's like in Oklahoma
right some do some random
some random developer in Oklahoma paying
$900 for a three-bedroom house with a
pool in the backyard you know paying for
private school for their kids for like
500 or $400 a month you know I was like
and paying for like four kids you know
those guys is the guys that you could be
like yo they doing good okay then
some guys they still making eighty a
hundred thousand dollars a year over
there in Oklahoma but they have the
quality of life they have our cash you
know a lot of these people live off
credit cards you know I mean like me I
don't live off no credit card my credit
cards get paid on Fridays you got on
saying like that's why your boy you know
credit just goes up constantly you know
I mean I came in the game knowing that
if you don't pay your bills on time if
you don't have your life in order
nothing else matters you're not saying
like I don't I don't splurge what I
don't have I don't buy what I don't have
I usually come in even like to this new
crib that we got I paid this whole
like four months ahead like three four
months ahead like it's like hey man
here's five months two months security
and three months ahead so all the money
that I make for the next three months is
pocket and then from there if I wanna
once I want to pay the rent out of pay
but you gotta think like that you can't
be going to two places you can't be
living life through you know I'm some
crazy out here right you gotta be
smart man so like I said you got a you
got a straight-up just like again get on
your to me site income man you know
look at Shopify Shopify is the next big
thing out right now period there's so
many people jumping on it everybody
wants to become rich everybody wants to
open up an online store so as that's our
time we're developers we actually know
how to code in buildings so name now we
come in and create applications create
plug-ins for them and as our hey man he
won a little slider that slides like
this and there
a little animation that goes like this
angles hi
you want that in you your website get me
$10 you know what I'm saying a thousand
people that come in give you $10 you
like gotta you gotta know saying like
you get your money and that's in you did
your service and that's it so look into
it Wix has a lot of opportunities
freaking Shopify there's a couple of
other Salesforce there's a whole bunch
of different platforms that give
developers that give developers you know
the opportunity to come in and sell your
product Facebook you come up with a dump
BS game you come up with a dumbest game
let's say um I don't know
a wife you'd be watching the Real
Housewives of New Year Z right create a
dumb game that is a quiz is a quiz right
it's just random questions and you know
if that's a game trivia create a trivia
game right
you put that on Facebook how much do you
know about the Real Housewives of New
Jersey put advertising on it man
people's gonna play that stupid game
right how much money you think you're
gonna make it from that it's just it's
just you gotta use your brain
this opportunities on everything man
there's opportunities of everything you
gotta get on your man you can't be
out here like like hey man I'm just
gonna be a worker not a man you you okay
your artist your creator when you're a
developer your Creator your artist your
rock star in this world you know what
I'm saying like that's just how it is
man and that's where I'm at man like
look take me take me as an example man I
really wish people would have seen me
you know from the beginning beginning
like for my first job but look my first
job was like $13
you know when people come in and be like
hey Jones you know they that was gonna
give me a job with this opportunities
internship it was like you know $17 an
hour I don't know if I want to take him
I don't want to take him I took it at
$13,000 for his job
nobody was trusting me because I was
like a self-taught developer I went in I
worked for 3-4 months
quit I apply somewhere else by that time
I already had to experience
I already got in that stamp on my resume
like oh he worked at a company already
as a developer click I was like oh peace
thank you thank you come again that's in
and I was out you get a say but you got
to learn how to make opportunities out
of everything man you can't just be like
you know I'm just gonna stay there so
it's like this times I'm like man I wish
I would have just you know came in to
youtube I was doing so many other stuff
like I had another YouTube channel which
I sold which I was talking about
relationships and and like real dumb
stuff like extra star stuff like it will
bring me a lot of income because for
whatever reason YouTube wants to promote
all the dumb in the world but
something useful like this like
education they don't they don't promote
it right so what's hilarious is I had a
YouTube like in you know from 2009 I
have music videos and stuff like that on
that YouTube channel I got rid of that
channel you know then from there
freaking what else I had millions of
views on that channel but now thinking
about it from now I'm like yeah I should
have just like documented this whole
journey you know what I mean like I
should just document the everything so
people could look back and be like man
you know those days where I was in my
house was like oh this sucks
you know I'm living my mom's and you
know I was like sure he's trying to come
to the crib I couldn't even hit it right
because my mom's room is right next to
it you know what I mean so like real
life you know me I'm not PC I don't keep
I'll be honest with people you know what
I mean like grown-ass man
in your mom's house you know I was like
you don't feel right you can't even hit
it right it's like like you know like
stuff like that psychologically it
really messes up with your mind so
that's always like yo if people would
have seen the whole process from bag
dancing now you know you guys would have
been like okay we see what Joe is doing
and like now some of you guys see what
I'm doing and understand it right and
y'all seen the process ya seen when I
was first came in here and YouTube I was
like still working full-time you know
working for the man clocking in is like
okay boom in dealing with
assholes you know bs now you see me your
boys out here I'm working on this
full-time I have my other websites I
have my coding phase website a half all
the opportunities I'm trying to get into
Shopify right now and as I'm learning it
and putting you know getting myself in
and I'm seeing I'm making profit out of
it making side income I'm coming back
and passing it right back to you guys
you know what I mean is like I'm out
here taking off the you know off the
tree come right back
I'm that dude I'm that dude going up the
freakin tree get you a coconut cut that
coconut come back down come back give
you capo chop off the top of the coconut
I hear here you go
I risk my life going up there for you to
drink this coconut juice you know what I
mean so that's just how it is man but
everything that I do here is for a
reason man go check out the website
coating face.com you're just learning
everything that you need to become a web
developer but that's not the goal for
this website that's not the goal for
what I'm doing on YouTube my goal is to
get you guys at the same level that I am
so you guys go in surpass means there's
guys that are like 19 years old in here
20 years old guys you guys have your
whole future ahead all the things that
you you learn from me
you can literally come in in like the
next four or five years but I tell you
like 23 24 you good
you got your whole life you still you
know you could be out here doing
whatever you want chillin you know
making you money becoming a developer
creating your applications creating your
own opportunities without having to wait
on somebody because another two guys no
matter where you go as long as you work
for somebody you're just a number all
right if you come into a company you
know yeah you know this guy's been here
for two years and then there's another
guy that's been there for seven years
who you think is gonna get you know fire
first who you think got to go win when
things get bad who's getting fired
the guy who's been here eight years of
the guy who's been here two years you
gotta say like it's not it's not
guaranteed man it's not guarantee so
it's like that's why I tell people come
in learn the skills and then from there
work be smart save you money invest into
things but the same time half your side
income half your plan B or Plan C plan D
blank EPLAN F like I have like so many
different plans so many different plans
and never there's one thing that I tell
people never have a huge plan half
smaller ones have realistic plans right
realistic goals don't come in here but I
came man listen I'm the next Mark
Zuckerberg I could create the next
Facebook I could create the next Google
nobody you leave that to that that's
something that the destiny is gonna
bring to you to be honest with you
that's that's a situation that is like
that's like one in the lottery if you be
like hey man it's like guys who who come
in and but I go they want to become
basketball players
now that's something that destiny leaves
to you you know the universe comes in
and sprinkles a little something on top
of you and somehow you make it out of
millions of people right I don't I don't
have goals like that my goals is smaller
goals my goals is hey I started I was
like 40 grand I say man when I make 50
grand a year I'm on to this touched it
oh man when I make any grand Oh touched
it when I make on your grand touched it
when I make a hundred fifty grand
touched it this year would make one
hundred seventy four thousand thats a
lot for somebody who's not even a
computer science major who's not even
like I'm just a regular dude you know my
little West Coast out here a BS have
phones you know the same highs it is
actually a good mic I'm not gonna talk
about the sanitizer this is actually a
good mic we splurged on this one but uh
I'm just gonna regular dude like how
about you you just some regular do
what's the difference between me and you
none you probably speak better than me
you probably look better than me you
probably smarter than me you probably
whatever you could think of you probably
better than me probably cold better than
me
sky's the limit you know what I mean
like that's why I came in here I was
like man I should just put myself out
there just to show people be like hey
man um like if this guy can make it I
can make it that's the whole idea behind
it now I'm not putting myself I'm not
putting myself down you know me I'm high
I did this one why I come in I say hey
man just to be relatable I'm just some
regular dude I'm not putting myself down
I'm just saying I'm just some regular
dude like that we all have different
talents but I'm just some regular dude
that's there's nothing special about me
okay I'm just a regular dude so why
wouldn't you be able to do or surpass
where I'm at like what have taken me
five years you could probably do it in
less time than that because I bumped
into a lot of roads there wasn't nobody
on YouTube telling me all of the stuff
there wasn't nobody on online there was
courses on udemy more courses on udemy
just teach you programming they don't
teach you life stuff you get what I'm
saying like nobody teaches you
the life things like you know like
nobody comes in here and tells you hey
man this is the things that work that's
what happened to me people you ask
somebody about their mistakes and things
that you know it's like right now let's
say somebody comes in and tells you hey
man you know I put money into big
connect always a big connect right
a lot of people won't even tell you that
they lost money and big connect right
they won't tell you that and you'll be
there asking man what you think should I
go in there and try to make some money
with bit connect the guy knows he lost
money but he won't tell you that life
experience and won't share that with you
so he be like yeah man go ahead listen
try it out I hate when people come in
and tell me try something out like
they'll be like they know they they they
pretty much effed up all right they they
effed up in there but they'll tell you
hey man try it out nah I don't tell
people
some where I lost money some
where I I I'm freakin wasting my time or
whatever I don't come in and tell you
guys go try it out there's a lot of
stuff that I tried out you know why do I
come in here and tell you hey man do
HTML CSS JavaScript right focus on PHP
focus on Ruby on Rails focus evil on
neck somebody asked me hey man go to a
bootcamp what do you think I should do
should I focus on nodejs
on the bootcamp or should I do the
dotnet bro dude net why do I keep
telling people that hey man no Jes is is
it's not the best way to go not because
I hate it there's a lot of confusing
stuff in it and at the same time it's
just for a junior developer is not the
best place and it's not the best route
right or especially if you gotta spend
$20,000 $15,000 into a bootcamp there's
so many resources for JavaScript online
that you could literally pay for $10 so
why would you go to a bootcamp and spend
that money I rather if I'm gonna go to a
bootcamp
I'm a spending on that net
right there's a lot of opportunities in
an enterprise and corporate companies in
net right no js' doesn't have that right
what a lot of people don't ascend to is
a lot of to know GS where people come in
and use no no GS is really when micro
services people really think like hey
they're using nodejs for every part of
the website
no look up how look up Netflix look up
Netflix tak look up Walmart stack that's
how people use nodejs right now for you
to get into those companies it is gonna
be a lot of work you're not gonna get in
there cuz everybody wants to get in
there so you could get in there but now
you it's like you're playing I don't
come in and try to give you guys NBA
goals man I don't do that
I don't come in and be like hey man do
this cuz you know someday you'll make it
to the NBA I'm more realistic I'm like
hey man how can we get you working
tomorrow PHP how can we get you you know
right now they're looking for a lot of
junior developers and Ruby on Rails how
can we get you in there this Ruby on
Rails this Ruby you gonna say you look
online you start looking and
specifically what are people looking for
no js' developer or Ruby on Rails
developer what I showed the other day on
a video which one has even more jobs
right people get confused between seeing
something on Google Trends then was
really happening on jobs who are hiring
I could come in and say hey man you know
freakin view Jes is trending trending
above a whole bunch of different
frameworks maybe even over backbone or
whatever but you will be surprised how
many jobs are out there for backbones
yes you guys it's like I come in and I
just give you real life stuff I'm not
trying to give you guys fake stuff I'm
not trying to give you guys a fake hope
you MBA MBA numbers man yeah man is like
I'm not coming but I hey guys you know
if you play every day you're gonna make
it to the NBA no doesn't work like that
now everybody's gonna make it to the NBA
but how can we make sure that you make
money how can we make sure you make as
much money as somebody that's in the NBA
that's how I look at it you gotta say
like I never worked at Amazon Go Go
Facebook
how can i still make the same money that
they make it you don't wanna say like
hey I make more than a lot of them
developers that's in there you get are
saying that's why that's when you hit
them with the the little girl emoji the
like you know what I mean like how does
how does that happen because I'm more
realistic I'll take a more realistic
approach to things
I don't just come in here and you know I
don't come in here and and think about
like a man like freaking astronomical
goals now I come in here realistic goals
if the astronomical things come to me
it's a blessing if we don't come to me
hey I wasn't expecting it you get what I
mean like that's how I feel like a lot
of people should think you know I mean
it's like you just work hard you do what
you do make you money you get your
skills up you come and create products
create different things for people
making money through their hey if this
opportunity at Google take it they they
hired you cool they didn't hire you who
cares
you're making the same money on more
than that person you know you know I
mean like that's how you gotta think and
once again it's your boy Joe back at it
again coding face.com guys go check out
the website man coding face calm and
everything that I teach you here I teach
a very practical things I'll teach you
everything that you need to learn I'm
not going to come in here and be like
hey guys you want to know what's faster
a for each loop or a for loop nah we're
not wasting time on that
because it's like when you're at the job
nobody is you nobody's gonna ask you
somebody comes in and ask you some dumb
question like that and be like hey which
one is faster a for loop or for each
loop that person should get slapped up
and I mean in a nice way it's just like
nobody cares about that the client
doesn't care about that the user doesn't
care about that nobody cares about that
you know saying how can we get people
working how can we forget people in how
can we get people making money how can
we get people being successful you know
the only way to trickle down things is
when people from the bottom get
opportunities and they go up to the next
step and sprinkle it down to the people
below it you know is this is not like
Reagan economics where people people
will come in for example you know they
will say something like this oh yeah we
gotta give tax breaks to the rich
because the rich is gonna hire the
pouring they gotta give money to the
people
no they'll hire people but nobody's
gonna get a raise nobody's gonna get
anything they'll you know they don't
even want you to get um how you call
this benefit I know people that have to
work two three different jobs because
most companies will come in and go hey
you're gonna work part-time because if
you work part-time and you can't work
past let's say twenty five hours or per
week because then we have to give you
benefits so at 25 hours you're like hey
man you gotta go home so now that person
has to work in that job you have to work
in another job that does the same thing
for 24 hours and then he does another 10
hours in another BS jobs three jobs he
has all right so it's like the only way
for us to do good and pass it down to
people below us and help each other out
is by basically empowering ourselves in
learning technology and learn
how to program learning how does it do
something even right now let's say for
example you come in you come to my
website you say hey man I want to become
a developer I want to change my life I
want to do something right it's become a
developer for everybody no some people
might just be like man this is boring I
can't be in front of a computer
I can't stay still I want to conversate
I want to socialize with people you know
what I will tell you I'll tell you hey
man
there's a lot of other opportunities and
technologies look into solar power like
this people are good with their hands
there's people that are not meant to be
in front of a computer right you can
still make 90 100 thousand dollars a
year and still work with your hands all
right
look into becoming how you call is our
technical well that was the name are so
this the other day on wire comm there's
a group of people who are taking
training to basically maintain the smart
cars all right you don't have to become
an engineer you don't have to become a
super technical dude it's just those
guys who are transferring from becoming
a mechanic who are actually going into
this colleges and taking those extra
courses to be able to maintain those
type of cars they're good they make 90
$100,000 all right without having to do
a whole bunch of stuff all I'm saying is
technology is where it's at
you know as I when people see that
Python videos pythons where is that no
no it's not just Python technology is
where it's at that's the future any
other type of job is replaceable all
right so start thinking kids
so anyways man I just went on a long
rant you know once in a blue moon like
this we're not getting this all I get in
the zone man I can't do nothing about it
man so any questions you guys might have
let me know man let's talk this
compensate man
ah let's see let's see let's see let's
see let me see looking at the stuff
people mr. Gatto Korean word man people
missing the regular car everything yet
okay you may baby smack is like Joe
don't put yourself down not me I'm not
putting myself down putting myself even
place I might I might even place with
everybody you're not I'm saying like I
don't need to be up here I need to be
here where the people is at because
that's where I'm at
no matter where I go I'm still in there
like waiting here like yo without side
you know I mean like we could still
don't matter where we go you know the
journey is gonna be here you guys gonna
see everything that I do I document it
right nowadays I document everything
like my goals my accomplishments the
things that I go down and things don't
go right
I share it you know somebody said man
drama phase calm it's not drama face
that's life it's real life there's good
days there's bad days there's amazing
days days horrible days but it's life
like what do you what do you guys want
like you know it's like I have to share
that let me see what else what else what
else what else
exactly it's tax time come up with a tax
calculator for refunds put ads on it a
very smart Kevin Davis
very smart let me see I need to make a
video about this I just remember I just
remember something I'm reading Kevin's
caring's are angry and comment so he
says man why rubies why why Ruby is dead
in most entry-level jobs won't consider
Ruby and then it's like entry-level jobs
prefer PHP instead of Ruby and that is
some way correct but wrong at the same
time I don't know if I should say this
because I want to make a video I want to
make a video about this I don't want to
share it right now and the title is
gonna be why are you looking for junior
level positions you get what I'm saying
I hope you understand where I'm gonna go
from there why are you looking for
junior level positions disappoint this
out is very rare to find that people are
not looking for junior level developers
when they put junior level developers it
means like they looked everywhere and
they're like okay man put this on the on
the description they need an extra hand
and they just they'll put it there but
it is very it's very important to to
have this idea is like why would you be
looking for a junior position alright
like those things rarely come around and
you rarely gonna see them there so don't
let me limit yourself to just looking at
those jobs
apply just apply to it I'm not gonna go
too deep because that's another video
that's a video that's a full video
that's like that's a perfect video
thank you Kevin angle yeah I actually
have wrote that down the other night and
then I I totally forgot man I need to
somehow keep track of all this topics
man you know what I mean
I gotta keep track of all these topics
man you know some days I'll be like man
I'm probably gonna get tired at some
point or like talking about web
development and like where am I gonna
talk about but it's like so many topics
so many situations like you can't like I
don't know how to explain it I was like
there's so many things so many questions
people want to know and I'm not saying I
have to answer to everything but it's
like a lot of them I do it's like I
already had those questions to myself
I'm like man you know at some point I
was looking for junior level positions
and then I realized I was like wait
there's barely any of those with that
you know what I mean like that that was
like a unicorn when you see that on the
listings like junior it's like that's
that's like literally a freaking unicorn
okay so maybe let me see what else what
else
