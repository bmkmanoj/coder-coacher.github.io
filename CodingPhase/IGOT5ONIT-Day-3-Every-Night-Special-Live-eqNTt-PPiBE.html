worked on my coding a little bit gonna
start working on my portfolio site while
I go through the rest of that
cult still force okay
nice try to get some extra practice in
and get some work done at the same time
cool man
what's up man you gotta you gotta grind
it off now if you had the chance to hop
on the coding phase comm check it out I
did I went through everything you've got
on on the HTML CSS course so far and I
checked out what other stuff you got
going on right there that's what's up
man
like I said to a lot of people's man
everyday this a bunch of videos being
added constantly you know when you sign
up for the course is right now is like
this like a special right now right so
it's like people get some to see this
and get to register now right all these
courses are being added daily right so
it also gives you the opportunity to
watch the course as we record it right
and not come in a year later and see
something that's super outdated or
whatever right you know you you're
basically watching it as I record it
every single day today I just knocked
out a whole bunch of videos I think I
did let me see how many videos like
there I'll tell you right now let me go
into the course let me see how many
videos like that okay we did 1 2 3 4 5 6
7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 17 videos
we did today so the course I believe
just as HTML CSS I think is going to be
about 32 so we're halfway there
hopefully tomorrow we do another 10 and
that they have to be do another 10 so
then I said that's done from there we
jump into the JavaScript and then after
JavaScript we jumping into the jQuery
after the jQuery we jumping into
advanced stuff I don't know if I might
just jump into react after that it
depends on I'm gonna do what people want
you know I'm gonna do a survey on the
website see which one the people want
next after HTML CSS and JavaScript
everything one jQuery a they were react
or what exactly they want I'm gonna give
it to him all right
well yeah man so was good Joseph what
today this weekend man um how's your
wifey she's good with grocery shopping
we picked out a name well at least the
first name so far it's Ava Ava okay and
I don't know I got I got the burden of
picking up the middle name so I gotta go
but other than that I've done some
reading hanging out with everybody in
the Gator and we've been working to set
up the discord so we can chat with each
each other as we're working and stuff
mmm with Matt Barbara other than that
like I said I went through your HTML CSS
course well you've got none of it so far
and what I noticed was that you break
things down very very simply and like I
mean Colt does too but he kind of like
you break down although the lingo all
the jargon and he doesn't do that for it
for you so like if you're not used to it
a little bit
you have to stop wait a minute let me
google this and see what the he's
talking about you know I think that's
really good because I was like eh that's
how and why he said she's gonna
interested I was like I'll probably have
you go through and look at Joe's course
before like you do anything else because
he breaks it down like very simple since
you know nothing about it yeah I think
that that's the idea behind is that you
know just come in and I'm giving even
mid mid wait I'm giving a video of like
advice up to people especially when you
get to the CSS I just finished uploading
that one where I'm looking at all the
videos that I did and then I'm like man
if I just started this this might seem
like a lot you know especially CSS when
you go through CSS reference that IO and
you look at that long list of CSS
properties you'd think in your head how
am I gonna remember all of this thing
and I just basically broke it down to
people like hey you don't have to
remember all of this information this
information you learn it as you go as
you create things it's like right now if
somebody decides to learn html5 right
and then going through html5 all the
tags are there right there's videos
there's all the oldest a bunch of
you go ask you need it you know it's
like when you look at every HTML tag and
you're like man I'm gonna have to learn
every the Allied is the nav there's the
UL what else this oh well there's the P
which is the paragraph there's the
header this footer what else I don't
know I don't know what I'm missing I
think I got nine with those lives I
could build a full website in the Ankeny
right so besides that I don't know what
else you know somebody will really need
a you know just to get started start
building websites you know this you
don't need to learn the whole spectrum
of HTML you know all the time I hear
stories when people come in for two
three months and then they leave it
along and then I come back to it later
then don't come back for another year
have you got a question for you Oh cuz
that's kind of talking about it with
someone else
Lana on your portfolio site like
especially if you're looking to try to
get hired at a company mmm would it
still be a bad idea or would it be okay
to put like contact info or like where
you can get emailed about doing
freelance stuff in the meantime or do
you think that was I kind of put off
people that's coming to look like if
you're trying to get hired at something
no that's there's no problems with that
everybody does that everybody puts a
contact page and that concept page is
pretty much like hey if you need some
work contact me you know everybody does
that you know only thing I do advise
people which I made a mistake a while
back let's put it in my phone number
don't put your phone number online you
saw something like Google Voice or
something too forward now you know calls
from your website to your phone
because what they do is they scrape the
internet for you know for emails like
let's say what developer right what
developer front-end developer UI
developer whatever it is there's
companies that scrape the whole internet
and then they find your information and
then they give it out to people who are
recruiters and other companies that want
to solicit you for different situations
that oh it's a high we got your your
number from one of our clients and this
and that you like wait what I've never
given my my number to anybody but it's
because they found it through the
internet so that's my only advice and
also to like when you put in your I mean
your emails fine but you know like
certain situation you know when you put
like something like a you gotta have
separate type of email so it was like
you have your email that's the one that
you if somebody needs to contact you
ASAP and they know you they could
contact you through there then there's
the email which is the one that you give
out to anybody out there where you could
put post it up on Facebook or YouTube it
it will bother you if this thing gets
flooded with emails you know because
sometimes you put an email like I'm
ready like hey send me send me this
information or whatever and then next
thing you know your emails getting
flooded by freaking recruiters and
 companies companies
alright so yeah that's not only advice
to it you could definitely do it so put
in your info there so if somebody wants
to contact you go ahead and then it's
nothing wrong with that no company is
gonna look at you and be like oh man
this person's also looking for freelance
like know everybody understand how it is
it's freelance jobs just more projects
to put on your little things yeah
exactly
let me see what else was this in here
man send me an email coding face at
gmail.com man Barbara come on up on real
quick man
you telling me you can't help on right
now come on send me the email man see
how's everybody doing man
you know what's crazy cuz it's like I do
random random live videos and then
everybody comes in and be like oh my god
I missed it
oh my god I'm freaking I sent your email
and by the time I already canceled a or
I stopped the whole live show it's like
it's too late man that's why you gotta
have this notifications went that's what
happened to me like Friday night I
stayed up to like 12:30 and I was like
well maybe he's not gonna do it so I
want to be like 50 minutes later I guess
you want to go do it and then yesterday
then I was up to like 300 and yesterday
I was at like 3:00 a.m. and I got the
notification like right as it was ending
I was like damn YouTube done me
over I just missed everything that you
said okay it come no I was saying that
uh like Friday night I stay up late
12:30 I was like well maybe he's not
gonna do it so I just went ahead with
the bed and I guess like you got on like
15 minutes later so and then last night
I was up till 3:00 a.m. just talking
with people and I did not get the
notification on YouTube or in my email
to like right when you was getting off
mm-hmm I was like youtube dumb you
boil
there was no hanging with the squad this
week it man I mean happens you know
that's why I'm trying to like even all
my favorite youtubers it's kind of crazy
like I don't watch other like youtubers
that much that do what development
because then it would be like too crazy
like you know go to work and do Cola
come on Duke creaking Co videos
do courses and then from there I'm gonna
watch youtubers who do cold like it will
be too much and too overwhelming for me
right I do watch a couple of people like
real cast there I like him he didn't
live video the other day said I was
dude
yeah he's legit I like him I really like
a lot like because he's similar to me
like you know what I mean he's like us
you know it's like some dude that you
know you could hang out away and be cool
with and at the same time he's not fake
he has a family he freaking he found
himself in the situation where he's
working for Microsoft like there's so
much cool in like for me like one
of the main things about here or are you
too busy not everybody that's here doing
these videos they actually work in the
industry like you know what I mean
there's people who don't work in the
industry and they have YouTube about
coding is like you're not in the
industry you know what I mean is they
yeah
what advice are you gonna give all year
it's ok yeah I watched this on free coke
camp and it's like so is everybody else
you know so but his channels legit it's
like you seen him from when he wasn't
even working to where he was like
learning online and you know it's like
so much man
yes after doing 15 years in the Army
yeah exactly
whoa we got barber in here Barbara what
up uh we can't hear you was the mic
where's the mic somebody give for a mic
hey hey what up hi we finally got you in
here yes finally freakin Barbara's
everywhere she's freaking traveling all
over the world we she don't have time
for us cuz I'm not a way out so she's
come back home to England I have time
okay you and this okay boys in here yeah
I really appreciate it you know I
stuff that people are doing like you
know III was like somebody told me
they're gonna open up a ready for me I'm
like oh cool like dope and like now we
have like people hopping on this Court
we got the Gator in to be honest with
you I want to set up your this court if
I would have known like you know people
was gonna use it you know I'll say hey
I'm gonna forget her because a lot of
people they know about github and this
and that but this Court makes more sense
you know cuz you go actually chat and
hang out okay
this course is more organized yeah like
the way I'm doing it I'm making it but
I'm you know I'm a p.m. so I'm very OCD
organized that way so different things
different rooms for chatting so Barbara
I was gonna actually I mean cuz so
you've been doing code or you think
sorta like I'm nosy what did you say it
breakup sorry I say that I wanted to
know like what's your background was a
story beginning when it comes to like
you're not cold because I see you all
the time and you've told me that you
sort of been around me what yeah like I
don't know exactly your full story so if
you can you share it with us yeah well
the just severe basically I've been
working in the games industry for the
last decade aside but it nothing to do
with cold yeah okay well I was I started
off as a Tesla then I went to lead Tesla
then hit tester and now I've just been
promoted to PM manager has been
interested in code nice you know so I
mean is there any games that you've
worked on that maybe we've seen I was
like I don't know is like oh my god
she's like part of Dao
like you know it will be like no I never
was like that is what I'm saying but
yeah I think that's really cool man
how is it over there England like is the
gaming industry pretty big or yeah it is
it's I mean the games industry is big
everyone really there's a lot of the big
companies have a lot of the main offices
here most most of the big companies they
main office is either Japan England or
America yeah yeah no I will figure that
because I'm like when every time like
even I think I think EA cuz I was
watching like the battlefront game and I
don't know if it's Angela Moore or
Germany where they have like this huge
 team and I'm like man this is so
cool because it's like you could be like
on the other side of the world creating
the textures and all of this stuff and
somebody could be doing the programming
here in California or in Florida yeah so
thing is actually so dope man a lot of
the testing is done in Europe yeah
most companies do that testing oh so you
you guys get the first games yeah right
Oh first look at that you know yes one
of the songs oh you're not crappy game
two years straight start please I'm sure

flappy bird it's hard to listen I was
thinking of you could like think I'm
moving to California no yeah no more to
County oh well you see out there
I mean can you guys see me governor yeah
we can Hannah yeah yeah I can't give you
Barbara you got Wi-Fi or do you have the
same services me Verizon like it's like
a running joke around here is like that
man Joe services it's not my fault
which takes Finiti bro to light Xfinity
y'all xfinity - all right I'm Warner or
whatever but I don't know man a man
their customer service is garbage but
their connection is legit yeah say we
liam got that over here yeah no it's
just crazy man well yeah borrow man see
you to the chat let me know if you've
got the one no no you know you got
connecting down you good so yeah well no
I wanted to know cuz you say you was our
moment to County you're not family out
here or no I don't have family out there
mmm I have a lot of friends and X :
cause out there Oh family okay I have a
job opportunity there which will still
be within the games industry my
hopefully I can do web web dev instead
I'm trying to get out of the industry
yeah I mean well when do you start with
you know what development well as you
know I was meant to start before April
kept scolding me about it but then I was
like oh yeah I will but then I went to
California and then I came back and then
you're like Barbara get on it and of it
I'm going coming again I'll do when I
come back I've been slacking a lot but
now I got the got the cult's course nice
so I just started on the JavaScript part
nice yeah man freaking I'm telling you
that course man is privileged a Kolb's
course is pretty legit
I love it you know
that's one of the courses that made me
who I am today and yeah I always
recommend people to just hop on that one
you know like when it comes to web
development is weird because you know
sometimes you gotta connect to to the
person and can that person break it down
for you like you know some people how I
break it down they might enjoy some
people might not enjoy but it's the same
thing was called with copes course some
people might like it some people might
not like it but you're going to get all
the information that you need out of it
you know what I mean like sometimes it
could be very detailed and you know but
at the same time I was like man you're
getting like such a good price for like
ten bucks
then you can't go wrong like everything
that he teaches you is the same thing
that they gotta teach you if you go to a
$20,000 boot camp like only difference
is gonna be like in three months but you
could do this in three months yourself
in your own house at your own time you
know so yeah definitely tell everybody
to hop on it man for sure you know
whoever for those of you guys that have
had our you know bad opportunities or
not these bad experiences and what for
you to meet some people be like oh man I
can't stand somebody's axe ain't no way
somebody doesn't break it down as good
as you know somebody else or you know
check out my courses man is right they
coded face.com
we they're right man somebody mentioned
to me that Colt had like a slight Lisp
and then ever since my told me back and
never been near it right it's like
somebody so everybody know you like
 die hitting doorway were you

few weeks back and so the guy comes out
on my table and he's like okay I ordered
my food I guess I'm a lamb vindaloo and
here's how hot you want it
and I was like well how hot do you eat
it and he's like you really wanted
Indian huh I was like hell yeah I want
an Indian hut he just looks at me with
these big eyes and he brings it out here
and he just sees me I'm eating my food
dad and with the napkin we're taking
check my one ebay he's like I've never
seen a a white guy be able to handle the
food like this I'm like this wasn't my
first rodeo man Indian food yeah oh
you're missing out
no missing out extra spicy so good
people that's never ate Indian food
always tell them it's like it's like the
Mexican food of Asia yeah no it's the
Caribbean shade of Asian yeah you know
what I would say they'll agree to
disagree
oh man yeah man so going back to cold
man like have you guys tried you know
like what languages you guys are like
thinking of jumping on like after like
let's say right now you you master HTML
CSS and you master Java straight where
do you see yourself jumping to I think
I'm actually I mean I'm gonna do PHP by
default it's my sequel but I think as
far as like the language this is outside
the neuron I think I'm just gonna stick
with Python man I went to this meetup
last Wednesday and we were going over
functions and arrays and just all kinds
of stuff because I mean you can use it
on backend stuff but you can make really
cool app so you can make desktop apps
and stuff at the same time and you
really don't have to learn any type of
new syntax and it's really versatile for
a lot of different stuff so I'm like I'm
liking it
yeah Python us Python is good I like any
part any language similar to Ruby I
enjoy it you know me though
yeah Ruby's legit because I've heard so
much good about Ruby even from like
three four years back when I you know
first was kind of off and on thinking
about has had a lot of friends tell me
like all this great should I do Ruby
it's so damn easy
it'll make you fall in love with coding
so I'm probably gonna have to get Ruby a
shot I don't know let me say Missy trust
side just see if it's the Wi-Fi here I
don't think so but I got actually family
here visiting in shape let me see let me
check this out
I'm gonna get my phone to come and be
like 10 bathrooms after all day
Lil Wayne this crazy amazing buckle here
you guys see mister service that's
acting up alright ya hear me man come
into the room wife he's not here on the
baby's not here no baby no baby he's not
here today he's chillin chillin with the
family oh yeah man
let's see if we got better service here
all right yeah so python is legit
I like Python like I always say I'm
jumping to Crystal Lang I'm trying to do
as many project as I can in Crystal like
once I finished doing all the tutorials
then all the courses that I'm going to
do which probably is gonna take like a
month two months once I finish those
then I'm just gonna jump into a crystal
man and then I'm probably gonna create
like a bunch of courses on react feel
like react is really hot right now man
everywhere I go is like I keep checking
my email just for the hell of it and
like people keep sending me freaking
jobs that I came in we know you do react
like we hiring know 100 10,000 20,000
it's like that's not bad I think people
should jump on it man just about every
job posting I see on indeed they're like
we we would like you to know at least
just a little bit of react or be willing
to learn it right yeah man it's gone to
that point it's crying I think at one
point it could pass like as far as new
new projects whenever somebody's
creating a brand new project most likely
they're going to do a react now if
they're working on legacy code that it's
most likely going to be on annular but
any new project any new website any new
company is always going to be a react I
don't think anybody else is gonna be
jump into the view bandwagon it's like
I've seen people talk about it
constantly online but online it doesn't
translate to the real world you know
but no power to them yeah man
let me see who's in a chat room yeah got
any questions man go ahead man let's see
let's get this combo ready man let me
see the machine or would you lie like a
smack to the face to the UK people are
crazy let me see your boy chars got five
days yeah let me see they general jazz
what up how's everything man I'll be
doing good man let me see your book kid
greatness let's add a man yeah kid gotta
join us chat send you a little message
see what that boy is going see what he's
doing this weekend
I kind of feel like I don't know if I
should do this somebody sent me an email
where they want me to look at their
portfolio let me see how I see
yeah I don't know if I should put it up
sometimes people send me emails to check
out their portfolio and like sometimes I
want to just like put it on live video
and like you know not criticize it like
super hard but just be honest you know
give them an honest opinion or what I
think on their portfolios and because
sometimes people create portfolios but
they just not ready for primetime
you know it's not ready to to be called
the portfolio yet because you don't have
enough projects you know you gotta
create projects like I always say I
bring this up every single time you
gotta create projects that look like
real companies you gotta think about it
if you're not a designer that's fine
you're not a designer
so take somebody else design recreate it
and create it for a company any company
you know locally or whatever and just
supposed to in your portfolio because
you want your website to when somebody
gonna see your website you want them to
look at it and be like oh this person
already works in the industry you don't
want it to look like oh he just did a
frico camp my frickin course you know
it's like if it looks too much blue
strappy then people know that you're not
in primetime you know it's like you
wanna you want people to think that you
already been in the industry for years
and and if you haven't been in the
industry for years you want them to
think like oh my god where this guy's
been he's amazing he can do so much good
work you know what I mean
oh yeah speaking of that Joe I'm going
to start working on the site today so
look out for then yeah deal did you get
the chick I'll go Cody please calm yeah
I started sitting watching the videos I
think I'll watch all of them that you
made yesterday already it was some good
content was kind of shortened to the
point you know what you know so much
rambling because I know a lot of times
when you start these courses you know
the instructors I swear take three hours
just to get to the point of the actual
material exactly that's exactly why I
didn't want to do and like I kind of
want to do something where even between
the introduction and between
introduction in the first video I might
want to do something like hey if you
already know HTML CSS jump to the
creation of the layout you know so you
don't have to come in and they have to
get beat in the head with the basics you
know because sometimes that is
annoying you go in you're like oh man I
want to learn how to do more complex
stuff well it's like they hitting you
with the basics and yet I'm a I just
want to skip this part you know what you
know sometimes I have to do it it's like
me trust me man I'm in there I'm
creating all this these videos of like
CSS and CSS positioning all of this
stuff and I'm like man this to me is
boring cuz it's like really like really
beginner level but then at the same time
it's like I know so many people don't
notice thing and even if they have taken
a course before they just haven't gotten
it broke it down to a way that they
could understand you know or a way that
could stick so yeah man did you know
jazz what up what up what's good sir I
was like me good still on the hunt you
know looking for a job working on
portfolio stuff
okay cool that's good what you did this
weekend not much just like yeah working
on the portfolio drinking some beers
right now just relaxing no I was
thinking about like our last
conversation one thing that I didn't
bring up
I completely forgot about like it's kind
of a I don't know if it's a gem but it's
just something to watch out for
especially for like guys that are just
getting into the industry be careful
with like recruits recruiters sometimes
because like for example I lost $10,000
and I'll tell you this story we have
basically like I was going through a
third party recruiter that was gonna
place me at the job is it's funny
because he's actually at MTV and we were
talking about MTV for a little bit the
last discussions and basically the lady
forget our last names like Goldstein or
something like that was recruiter and
she had her own company whatever and had
contacts with an MTV so the way it
started was you know they she said yeah
we can place you there like fairly
quickly order and I had interviewed with
MTV a couple of months before that
directly with them as opposed to going
through recruiter whatever and at the
time when I was going direct with them
it was a little more challenging because
like I know they made you go through
like all kinds of and whatever in
order to just you know start working
with them and they're you know it's
really slow process whereas if you go
through a recruiter then there's less
hurdles and stuff whatever because they
figure it well you're not employed
through them you're employed through a
third party and then that third party
can let you go whatever and there's not
any worries about you know lawsuits or
you know any of that stuff whatever
since you're actually employed by a
third party so anyway I was going
through this third party recruiter and
she's just like yeah I can you know we
can set you up like 75 dollars an hour
whatever doing flash ActionScript and
and I'm like alright cool cool you know
I mean I tried you know interviewing
through them before it didn't work out
whatever leg or they were just taking a
really long time and I ended up grabbing
something else so I didn't really like
follow up with them and you know within
I don't know like a week or two whatever
like I started with them and
and so what ended up happening is they
were supposed to pay you know the lady
was supposed to pay me through her
company like with every two weeks
whatever so they missed the first
payment and and I was like what's going
on I've gotten paid yet for this work
and she's like yeah yeah we're gonna
there was always like excuses like yeah
there's like some deal with the
paperwork whatever we'll get back to you
well you know get back to you pay pay
with you or whatever so like I continue
to drag on you know towards like a month
and I started getting paychecks but it
was there was always like a month delay
between when I like actually did the
work and when I got paid and this went
on for probably six months to a year and
then like after a while something
happened where there was like another
person that was working at MTV that
finally he he's just like you know I'm
getting scammed or something like that
so he tried like talking to MTV to buy
out the contract so that way he could
work directly with them and at that
point they realized that she is kind of
a there was like some kind of scam
whatever and so I you know I at that
point soon as I heard that I'm like you
know what I'm gonna stop working here
like I'm just gonna not come in anymore
until like this gets resolved whatever
because I don't want to like end up you
know not getting paid and whatever for
the work that I'm putting in though so I
stopped working and everybody at MTV
totally understood they're just like you
know yeah did you not get paid like why
you know like I wouldn't be coming
either to work if you not get paid
though so yeah I you know I took off for
a couple weeks and in the you know
during that time they had bought out the
contract whatever so that I can start
working with MTV directly you know they
offered me a full-time position there
and I actually declined a staff like a
full-time salary position I said you
know if you guys want to you know
continue paying me hourly you know the
way that it was supposed to be set up
cuz I just at the time I just wanted the
raw cash like I didn't want yeah and it
ended up being like kind of good because
not only did I get the raw catch but I
also got all the benefits associated
anyway in the end like I ended up
getting having to get a lawyer they sent
a letter to the lady and stuff whatever
but she was just basically running this
huge scam this fraud on you know a bunch
of people at MTV
they you know had me sign a thing that I
wouldn't go after MTV for the money and
 whatever but I mean that that's how
then that situation ended up so
basically just a warning for like you
know there's especially if you work in
large cities whatever there's always
gonna be you know the potential for
people that try to take advantage of
developers you know and so it's
something you know just keep an eye out
you know there's definitely people just
just gotta be careful with what they're
doing in general you know like you it's
sometimes something that seems too good
or they too much fuckup like you know
it's not right because any decent
company is going to have everything in
order like if they don't have a a you
know I call an HR person that is on top
of it and you know I've seen situations
I given myself like a few jobs ago like
I think I had told the story where this
guy he told me that all where we're
going to pay you you know 80 something
and but you know we're basically going
to pay you as if you're getting 50 you
know every month and then we're gonna
give you a big bonus in July and I was
like cool whatever you know I wanted to
get the hell out of the city because
that was my thing it's like people know
we're here now like I just didn't want
to work in a city it's not the
environment that I want to be in so then
the guy was like whatever pull didn't
give me the bonus so pretty much I
worked for like nine months for almost
near near nothing you know to me is
almost nothing like $50,000 right now is
like nothing right knowledge
that you can do with you out
here in New York that's what it was like
earning 30,000 20,000 somewhere else you
know yep like I didn't get Catholic or
well I was just gonna say like real
quick you know the thing is even with
large corporations you have to worry
about like the recruiters you know that
place you have to learn you know cuz I
figured all right this is on this has to
be legit like you know I mean empty like
I just put my trust in MTV that like
whatever business that they're working
with recruiters that
they're working with you know it's gonna
be on the level and you know there I
wouldn't have to worry about any of this
stuff but you never know I mean you know
people get into situations even large
corporations you know and and so just
have to like like in my case I probably
should have caught on that there is
something up because like the lady
didn't have like the most legit website
and you know when they sent me the
contract it was it didn't look as legit
as like you know maybe some other
recruiters whatever going through their
companies before so yeah I don't know
like you know in a situation like that
where you're offered a opportunity to
work at like you know what you consider
you like a like you know an awesome
company environment to work for whatever
you kind of want to take some you know
some risks and stuff if you think that
the payoffs gonna be good in the end but
I don't know it's just something to
consider them you know in general those
great uh you know opportunity like I
don't know like you said you worked at
empty I don't know if you got a chance
to go to like the Christmas parties and
stuff but man it's like off the hook
sometime you know like especially like
they let you I mean they you know on
Fridays we just chill like Pete I gotta
have a bottle of whiskey on the
windowsills like people will be drinking
the company it's a lot of young people
you know what I mean it's not like you
go to a company and it's a whole bunch
of old heads and and people don't
understand how it is it's like it's work
so long as you do your work you're gonna
be good you could chill you know oh yeah
freaking and so yeah kid green is go
ahead say what she was gonna say oh yeah
first of all was good everybody I just
showed of late come I just got off the
court
yeah but this song recruiter hit me up
or whatever about like a job I emailed
them back whatever he said like thin me
since I get portfolio simplifies you did
fussing it's like to fight it's
kind of know
cut it off cut it off let me see
it's good now yeah yeah yeah yeah so you
had this recruit like Indian recruiter
hit me up or whatever so oh I this is
the this is the proposition for you this
is what we go on try it out here you
gotta keep you don't have to keep the
mic there cuz it's cutting off for some
reason I don't know if maybe the Y is a
little new society follow me or maybe
the Internet the horizon it's the
horizon man I'm telling you god damn it
they try to sabotage my show they be
hacking you bro I'll see I got sprint
you know my covers a decent over here
yeah you should is not bad you look good
you you pretty crispy Joseph he's okay
he sometimes his thing is a little cut
he gets a little cut but mine's on our
minds I think it's all right it's just
certain situations if I'm outside over
here I'm done there's no service at all
it's a curse it's spreading yeah man let
me see my see you good kid greatness I
want to hear the story man I say
spectator gonna have to be expected to
either watch through this whole
sorry kid we can't here tonight he's
gonna have to type that story email that
she's having it narrated by Morgan
Freeman
yo Digital jazz gotta I don't know his
quality sounds good though like I don't
know if you got a mic what you got did
you - you want a headset when a headset
what type of headset I'm about to buy -
uh-huh
is it like a gaming headset or it's on
HyperX it's like it's a gaming headset
HyperX hype reax I think it's like cloud
- some like that I just found what my
quality was trash was because my mic was
set going through my webcam instead of
my headset oh yeah got him I know I
don't know what the fuck's up - hadn't
changed my brightness and HyperX cloud
to $100 for that's it it's
really good though I mean so you could
like somebody could be killing someone
in the next room you can hear it like
there's like noise cancelling inside
it's like it's top notch
yeah HyperX is good let me see my head
that's mine - mine list my Amazon list I
have this thing man I freaking I've been
buying so much lately that it's
like this doesn't seem like a lot
but it's like man I just don't did it
this week I bought so much I gotta
cut back man you know because it's like
then I gotta explains why he like man
wait at $2,000 go she's not adding what
man wife he bought this for me for
Hanukkah dude I was so damn surprised I
was like damn this is $200 a headset but
it's good I just really wanted it
because you can change the colors and
 on it and it's wireless but uh come
to find out it has 7.1 Dolby surround
sound so like if I'm playing in there
call a duty and and I have the
surround son on if they're coming up
behind me like it plays just in the back
the headphones or if they're like up
above it's it's like at the top of the
headphone so it's like you know where
the are it's already don't ya
that's why I gotta get in today man guys
they'll be giving more things for Joel
to buy I'm adding this thing HyperX I'm
adding it right now to the list so
by next week I had my SSDs HyperX HyperX
yeah I'm surprised because it sounds
pretty good man and cuz right now I have
two blue Yeti well I'm really starting
to think like yo the blue Yeti sounds
like and I really want to just say
I'm gonna take it up a notch
you gotta get that audio techni yeah see
I see I see I thought about getting a
blue Yeti but then I was nervous about
like the audio quality no it sounds like
 man I mean to me some people say is
better than the what comes with Apple
right but now I'm like I don't know like
I'm hearing other people's quality of
audio and I'm like I want to get a
better better mic and this are HyperX
cloud so how does connects is this
like a regular Hey
okay oh you mean that's why
yeah the HyperX headphones are known for
their mic quality I'm looking at it
Amazon right now I'm like oh man I'm
about to click that one click Buy button
or later then it's like a full headset
as opposed to you know just earplugs and
then you've got like the mic that's kind
of like in the corner like after after a
while I've gotten used to it but you can
you know your peripheral vision you'll
be seeing like this dot it kind of in
the corner of your eye that's the only
downside but yeah in terms of quality
though like he really can't beat it it's
really good you know
I got there's a lot of that I gotta
buy this week either might if I don't
buy this shape I'm out of tomatoes try
don't buy this I'm going to to buy
another mic another microphone and sell
my blue Yeti because I just don't like
the way how it sounds like it sounded
good before like but now I feel like if
I really want to take it to the next
level I should get that that premium mic
you know believe this yeah man so what
did you guess what you working on I mean
as far as like it's um there's two
projects one is an e-commerce site and
then the other ones probably it's gonna
be like content management systems with
video like video player videos from
YouTube but yeah it's gonna be you know
it's so that ones laravel PHP and Python
and and the e-commerce is gonna be no
js' and at some point I've got a tackle
man just like so much with the
reactor right so like I had and I
haven't touched it at all
so I need to delve into the react stuff
so that way I can like start messing
around yeah you're asking about like you
know what kind of tutorials you should
make whatever like I mean I don't know
how much you've done with I know you
work on an e-commerce site how much
you've done with the reacting like on
the e-commerce table that say the
shopping cart and things like that but
that's the type of stuff I'd really be
interested in you know that's all a blur
right now our website is not completely
done with react because we decided to
use it as need a basis so cuz sometimes
there's a downside so having single page
apps like something that people don't
want to stand like sometimes single page
apps can get complicated especially how
big the website is after looking at it
and
going over the side wheels like man if
we make this into a single page app this
thing could become a nightmare to
maintain you know because everything on
the side will have to be titled
JavaScript but what we decided was I
hate we're going to do a hybrid how
Airbnb does it Airbnb whole website is
is done in in Ruby on Rails and then the
pages load through Ruby on Rails routing
system and then on every page there's
multiple components so depend on what
page it is that reacts to it right but
we what we didn't want to do it where we
like okay we have the react router and
all of this gets too much you know
sometimes it's cool I think it's cool
for like certain things like this this
website called GA that M eat game I
don't know if you guys have ever heard
of it do you yeah if you guys can check
it out g8 got em eat a dinosaur really
good work when it comes to a single page
app when it comes to a single page app
this is like the definition of it like
this was supposed to be a single page
app everything on it works they got a
whole bunch of games
everything is html5 and CSS I think I
don't know if they use well they
actually use angular right it's angular
and nodejs and connected with socket IO
for the WebSockets but besides that like
the page is beautiful everything works
the signup works there's barely any
hiccups like if you go to I think was at
Walmart Walmart calm I forgot which
website wasn't that they did everything
single page app and it was like a really
bad bad website and then on top of that
they had everything nodejs
which you know people think like oh no
js' is the future and this and that but
the problem is is JavaScript
you know what nodejs did is great and
the way how npm works and and everything
the whole ecosystem is great but it's
just JavaScript and in general it's it's
a it's a floor language it's not
it's not something that's solid you know
that's why people gotta come up with you
know like dark Jas or type scrape or
flow and so many different libraries to
make the language work as good as they
should but I don't know that's that's my
my two cents on it so yeah my company we
decided we're not gonna do the whole
website single page app like I mean I
don't know but I would assume that it'd
be better not to do it as a single page
app because then you there's like a lot
of SEO stuff you'd be missing out
exactly that was another big thing too
which was a huge huge part of what we
transfer the website the whole website
used to be in in Perl right and then we
actually transferred it to equalness to
laravel so how does that work cuz i
noticed like a lot of the extensions are
still HTML so i guess you just have it
set up so that we dodged him out process
as PHP exactly yeah and right now the
whole website under the hood is
brand-new like everything is brand-new I
mean because from what I say you already
been to the website but yeah everything
under the hood is brand-new now the
design that's on it is still the old
design like the new website that's the
what the new design is gonna be rolling
out in the next few weeks
cuz before we did the change we needed
to have it exactly how was the inner
original work like we even kept the dot
HTML like everything is the same it's
just under the hood everything was brand
new and it works better and there's no
bugs
like the whole website was full of bucks
man like it was really bad like my baby
was I don't know
do you try the trial yeah yep
yeah that was my baby like I remember
watching one of your videos and you're
talking about how like the mathematics
and stuff involved would like the yeah I
could totally understand where you're
coming from with the website that was
there before they had a version that
wasn't flash so the guys that did it
were they did it to flash and then
somebody came in picked it up and did it
through jQuery which was a
 clusterfuck like when it comes
to a complicated app like that like it
looks simple like somebody comes in and
they're all you upload a photo you place
it in the person's eyes and isn't that
and that's a voila
everything works right it's not like
that man vishay is a clusterfuck and
what the people had there before was
really bad like they did a through
jQuery and then the whole process was
you upload a full a photo to the website
and then on the website it would do
multiple reloads and multiple saves to
basically calculate where the eyes were
where the glasses was supposed to be at
so what I did was I created everything
in the front-end but then at the end
that was problems because JavaScript the
way I'm in the front and basically
JavaScript and CSS the way how they work
they kept rounding the numbers like
let's say if you if you say hey your
eyes is at this location and it's 50
6.36 44:17 right you need that
information after those digits right you
can't have that rounded down to two
digits right and JavaScript will do it
and then when it goes to CSS it will
round it out to two pages so the
glasses
we'll be constantly off and I'm like man
I hated that and then I was
at the end I said you know what I'm
gonna take this this glasses
point put the pointers in the person's
eyes different they upload it to the
website through PHP um basically merge
the photos together put in the right
space and then return it back to the
user as an image you know because it's
just like doing all this shit's with
Java scale to JavaScript it was like a
 nightmare man how do you have to
build applications like that have you
know before once in a blue moon I mean
that's one of the main reasons why I
didn't want to go to title my
god like before this company I was I was
like getting cold from a lot of
companies right and then title call me
in and they're like oh we want you to
work we want you to work on this
brand-new audio player that we're
building and this and that and me I love
building websites I don't like building
specific apps like this one right I
hated that sure so when I went to the
title in an interview and everything
they wanted me to stay there they
explained to me like what was gonna be
my job for the next year and a half
which was just gonna be a audio
player and I was like I don't want to be
working on this shape so I left that
 alone and then when I came to this
company that told me oh we're gonna be
working on you know laravel switching up
the website and this and that and then
when I started working here as soon as I
came in they put me on working on this
thing and I was like what the I did
not want to work on this type of I
want to work on the website I don't want
to create you know JavaScript
applications to me that is
boring a lot of up you know
so it's not my thing you know what I
mean like I like building websites
I don't like building little
applications or little components and
then you spend months on it trying to
perfect it and I mean
that's how it is in every job but I
freaking hated it you know once I finish
this trial it took me like
seven months to build it complete you
know and thank God we're done with it
you know
now everything the logic is it's done
behind it so you know when the new
website grows in all I have to do is
just change the styling the views but
everything all the masks all the I
need to do it's already done you know
sorry it's something like I'm bitching
but that's just like you know everybody
has their thing there's people who like
I call it there's people who like doing
just the database there's people who
like doing the designs there's people
who just like doing the HTML CSS there's
people who like doing cool animations my
thing is creating the pages I hate
building just small components that you
gotta spend months doing it in truckin
remastering and making everything work
 every browser and mending things
you know what I mean so that's the
boring part about being a web developer
sometimes you gotta do some boring
hey man so what's good peoples may
acquire yeah muting the mics in house
listen I still want to know what those
indie recruiters be doing it did yeah
what's the story kid yeah yeah I want to
hit a 30 go ahead oh I so yeah so hit me
up and his proposition was like this yo
this is what we're gonna do you're gonna
come gonna give you two they're gonna do
like some interview some
interview process
well after that two months you got
and train Java you gonna learn Java and
you learn net and we're gonna give you a
salary of $1,200 a month why you coming
to the office training for the two
months after the two months this is what
we gonna do you we're gonna get take
your resume we're gonna put that you got
five to seven years experience and then
we're gonna shoot that
all around the United States as soon as
the kinda picked you up like he said
we'll give you $50,000 or the math thank
you you got to figure out where you
won't live it and you only gonna get
like $1,000 to relocate to whatever
 location you go and I'm like
your son like why the are you gonna
say I got five years experience when I
never had a job before like now
this is how the industry work that you a
new guy you know nothing about this I'm
like my eyes I'm gonna call you back
yeah that should happen a lot you know
like do ya like cool like that's that's
what that's a real thing so yeah that's
nothing you're paid you know they get
paid when they put in somebody in there
you know sometimes they look at it as
like I say right now an example somebody
puts a company a company post a job
description on dice calm right
recruiters hit that company up and like
okay we could bring you the best you
know the best developers and
this and that when they get there they
get the job they what the first thing is
they just gotta get somebody in there it
doesn't matter who it is doesn't matter
if they got a lie doesn't matter if this
person is Neal or this person who's been
here for 10 years
their job is to just basically get you
in there so they could get paid cuz
every time they got somebody in it costs
the company like ten fifteen thousand
dollars because most companies don't
want to go through the process of
interviewing and hiring the person so
what they do is they they get you in
through this this contract work you know
and if they have to let you go they just
call up the contract company the
recruiting company and basically not say
but that's like normal man they stay
doing that all the time
so they must be making Bank so I guess
this dude was telling me like yo he got
cuz he's gonna say oh it was gonna lie
so I got five-year experience and I
looked it up like dotnet like you got
like five years finish you can make easy
like six biggest and they said there you
only gonna make the max you can make
since you a new guy is $50,000 so they
pocket in $50,000 and he said he already
had 11 people signed up for the next
cohort so that's crazy
you know that's are they doing man they
they get you in there they they set you
up you know you could go in there and I
mean they don't care and you're the one
that's gonna get embarrassed when you go
in there and I job and I think what you
doing that you can't do like that's
just how it is you gotta be careful you
know you gotta find like the right
recruiters or the right contracting or
tempting company that can do something
for you you know it's not gonna set you
up for failure or be embarrassed because
sometimes you know I forgot what was the
company but there was like a company
that they sent me when I was a brand new
developer and they sent me to a company
for it was like it was to do HTML like
audio books not audio books or PDF books
right and when I got there at that time
I wasn't even that good with JavaScript
I was like my first year and I went in
for an interview whatever but the
recruiters talked really good about me
oh this guy's been doing JavaScript for
like three years four years and this and
that and they put me to do something
super easy which was basically depending
on the params of the route depending on
what was on the route and the URL of the
route basically I needed to to add a
title now add a title out of the sky
chin of the book and a whole bunch of
other little things right but now
looking at it I'm gonna get that
was so easy and I panicked
I was like you know I can't do this
I was like it was like my first year cuz
that whole first year all I did was HTML
CSS so I wasn't thinking in my head I
was like yo this is so complicated
I gotta read the route I gotta read the
the URL and get the information from
there and I was like man and whatever so
I quit I was like y'all can't delicious
I was like you got a googly googly away
no I was I was doing it but then there
was there was a lot of it's not as
easy as I'm making a seam right now but
it was mostly to do like things with
basically getting there from the URL
getting the params getting the
information finding it in an API that
they had so I needed to use Ajax which I
didn't know either you know like I know
a query you know you know like I know
how to I had a class remove a
class make an animation or make an
accordion make a slider little like
that the little shits that you learn in
the beginning you know I wasn't like my
brain wasn't made it wasn't at that
level where you could start thinking
about how to solve complex problems you
know what I mean but this person is
recruited sent me to that company
knowing that I was gonna have to do math
difficult and they set me up for
failure you know what I mean just to get
that extra money cuz even after if I
quit they still get paid you know what I
mean and I even know that I feel like if
you had to stay there for at least like
three months six months when I was at
that bridge I think it's like two weeks
if you say two weeks in there like I was
there two weeks
I think the first week was it was like
training you gotta know get to know
everybody in the building what's it like
and this and that then the next week was
like introduction to how the projects
and in their dev environment I didn't
even know how to you
get back then it's like I used to do
everything through FTP so I was like no
so much I didn't know on that first
job wasn't my first job I was like one
of my first jobs that was like a real
serious position as a developer it
wasn't just like okay the junior
developer no they wanted a developer
like that's why I tell people on my
video where I talk about the three-month
boot camp
like people think I your developer when
you go in for three months you're not a
 developer like to become a
developer it's like somebody who knows
how to solve a problem who knows how to
look it up who knows how to break a
difficult problem and break it down to
pieces most of those guys that do three
months they don't know how to do all
that cuz I didn't know how to do it
in three in three months and I'm
not saying that there was like a
limitation or that I'm done I'm dumb and
I couldn't do it it's just I didn't have
enough time there's so much things that
you gotta learn you gotta learn Ajax you
gotta learn how a P is works you gotta
learn how objects' work properly like
there's so much that you can't
learn in three months it takes time and
the only way to learn is building
projects you know I'm at that remark now
like I did like anyone mark this path
like like a couple days ago hi yeah I
hardly knew going to boot camps and then
like just getting a job like I know it's
cuz of like they getting it off with a
prestige at a boot camp I'm I not even
hurt look this is a day a lot of times
there's guys who who have been calling
for years right I'm gonna say you for
example right right now you're you're
learning how to code right this whole
year you basically busting your ass you
know how to code and try to get a junior
position right get it right but then
next year you're like oh you can't find
a job but you still don't feel confident
so now you go into a boot camp and
you're like oh I'm I'm a brand new
developer and I want to learn and I
wanted to listen that right so they
teach you the basics of HTML CSS which
you already know
teacher JavaScript with you you already
know right
and then they teach you no js' now you
come in there and then you you was
already ready to start going for
interviews but you didn't go because in
your head you thought that you need a
certificate or you need a college degree
or you needed somebody to sign up for
you and be like oh and be like oh this
person is really good
most of these guys that be going to
 boot camps it's not like you
meaning they're not like starting from
scratch is people who have been doing
this for a while and they just not
secure on it like the guys start
starting from scratch at the same level
that you was three months ago
you see them they're reviews
online they'll be like oh how the I
can't find a job and this and that and
it's like it takes time you're not ready
you know what I mean
but when you see a commercial boot camp
they're like oh this person got a job in
three months yes sometimes people are
lucky sometimes people fall into good
positions that they don't need to do
complex things but uh guys that work in
companies what you gotta do complicated
 they've been doing this for a
while man that that's the idea
that you can learn or - in three
months and build like two projects in a
 boot camp in three months and
learn all of that show people be
lying it's like this is like right now
you don't think that it will feel really
good it's like right now I'll come to
you in blank and tell everybody hey man
kick greatnesses of prodigy he learned
all this in two weeks this kid is
the smartest kid in the world
this isn't that some people they like to
get that that feeling of getting
attention and getting people to to
praise them they'd be lying like
I don't know if you heard that story
where I told they were there was this
kid that he wants a full stack full
stack that what Keith
oh no that's another that's another king
he had the same situation where he just
started from zero
he wasn't like everybody else that was
there that they had experienced he
started from zero he went in he was like
a I think like he set up how you
call that a seizing like that and
he's like oh you know what I'm gonna
become a developer so he started from
nothing like not knowing HTML or CSS
nothing right and he couldn't get a job
then
but the situation that I'm talking about
right now is about this other kid that
used to work with me and he was super
fake like super fake like super duper
free I'm not even gonna like we was both
for his job he got there before me and
then I got there and he was there for
like a few months few months before me I
went in for a job interview
and I got the job right away at that
time I wasn't like that great on PHP I
was a really good front-end developer I
wasn't that good in in PHP I was like
two three years ago and then he he came
man the guy that owned the business
hired him because they found him on a
sorry on a trade show like a jobs show
you know when they do those job
market where people go in and or
career fairs career fairs yeah so he
went to one of those shits and basically
he went in and he was like oh I'm a boo
I just graduated from boot camp I'm
really good at javascript I'm really
good I no js' hire me so they wanted
somebody that knew no js' specifically
90% of the people that know no js'
they're not gonna work in the lag right
most of those guys they gotta move to
the city because they want to live in
the city and get that city life right
now him he wanted to work in in the
linemen just like me so he got hired at
this company because he's the only
nodejs developer that they could find at
the moment and they need her nodejs
developer
so that's his backstory on you two
months later I started working at this
company when I start working there he
constantly would be like always like oh
I'm a brand new developer I only have
five months I've never I've never done
this before I've never worked as a
developer I've never coded this and that
right I did some research because it
just seemed weird to me and that's why
one of the reasons why I'm so against
the boot camps because they be
lying because I met two people I'm gonna
give you that situation then I'm gonna
give you another situation he came out
he was telling people that he only been
coding for five months when I started
doing research and I started looking
into his history I looked online I
looked up his name I looked up his
resume I looked up his LinkedIn looked
up his high school because I'm I
know what the I'm doing I'm like yo
I'm gonna find out where does this kid
come from because there's no way that
somebody knows as much as he knows just
by going to that boot camp right so I
figure it out found out the kid had been
getting awards in high school
since freshman year about coding in Java
coding the in Python and then he
decided to say oh I just started coding
five months ago to make people think
like he's like a prodigy you know like
he wanted that validation that
validation and as a bro
like I just did the research and
one time I I told him about it oh that's
not me that's not me so his face went
white and he was like he has long hair I
don't have long hair I'm like yeah you
 dickhead and then I looked up
another picture which says his name on
the on the high school thing and
I'm like bro it's on your high
school and it's like it's easy anybody
who did this the research and just
searched your name will find you
you're getting Awards in high
school and you're 25 years old you
probably been coding say
the age of like 14 15 years old you know
what I mean me I'm tired
no no because he did he could do his job
he he was a good developer he wasn't a
bad developer but the idea was and the
problem that I had when it was the fact
that he was still lying about it like
bro you don't need to get
validated you don't need somebody to
tell you like oh you're a prodigy like
they won't always be like oh like the
manager will be like oh man this kiss
Steven he's marrying it he only has five
months and look all the things that he
could do and I'm like wait this is
 ridiculous and then yeah and I'm
like yo this is some so I'm
pretty sure a lot of people who also go
to these boot camps cuz I've seen it let
me see I'm gonna go through my comments
right now I'm gonna show you guys some
 I'm gonna show you guys some
somebody sent me a comment or in the
comment is exactly on the video that I
did about boot camps and you're gonna
see this how a lot of people think this
is how a lot of people think
okay let me share my screen well after
the last time we talked like I remember
you mentioning that kid Keith ban shed
and I went and I actually found his
video coding boot camp lies no shortage
of developers whatever but yeah it comes
down to like the market like what you're
saying you know you've got to know your
market like what opportunities are out
there whatever it is exactly it's like
get into the whole boot camp thing
thinking he's gonna get a job right away
and whatever and drop like however much
money at it I don't know twenty thousand
dollars or whatever like you can't you
can't go in there blind yeah you got an
or lean it does another leg yeah what
jobs are out there and what its gonna
take in order to get them exactly it's
like you go into a no js' boot camp but
everywhere around you is java and
 c-sharp is like you should know
that you got a user brain well
in this case in this kid's case he
went in for Ruby like you want to do
Ruby I don't know like I don't know if
it's true but for everything that I'm
seeing on the net is that Ruby's dying
and I know like you know it's hard to
say with certain technologies die
whatever cuz there's ups and downs and
 but from what I can tell Ruby's not
the type of technology you want to get
into right now there's a lot of other
options whenever and so for his
particular market yeah I mean if he
knows Ruby's applying like four to Ruby
jobs and there's not that many jobs
there yeah it's not gonna be able to
find anything so I ended up like getting
into SEO because you can find anything
anything in terms of development that's
yeah so I mean look at this comet right
so this comment is about thinking of
going to a boot camp read um you gotta
watch this that's something like that
that's the title of it right so his
communist
thank you sir boy employers have
expectation paths it's half expectations
on I need a piece of paper so that's why
he missed a comma so he needs to say I
need I need a piece of paper to prove
I'm worth hiring aka a degree or
certificate 99% of the people they
really believe this this is not like
you're going in for a lawyer's
job you're not going in to a hospital as
a doctor you're going in as a developer
right now is can you do the job do you
have real experience do you have real
websites if you show me that I can see
it's not about hey I want to this
college I want to this I've seen people
who I know more than them and they
 gone to like Ivy League schools
and I'm like how do you go to an
Ivy League school study computer science
and I know more than you you would think
that this people was really doing work
like extra work what they do is a lot of
times people go to colleges or even the
boot camps and they do their projects in
the boot camps or projects in the school
but then they don't go and take out
extra three hours to do work on their
own at their own house so me that I'm a
 bust my ass every day
are code for like eight nine hours or I
have
I do something in general - about code
 I know way more than those
people because I have more hours in you
know what I mean it's like you can't you
you can't compare yourself to somebody
who has 10,000 hours you know what I
mean like it doesn't matter what school
you went to every school is gonna teach
you the same it doesn't matter what
school you go to
doesn't matter what book can be go to
you're still gonna have to go through
the process of building the school
just gonna give you good
professors and the good professors is
gonna tell you the same shape here's a
 variable here's a
function it's like that's it you know
what I mean yeah yeah the only time I
like degrees are important whatever like
that gone for some kind of like a data
scientist visit they're looking for
advanced degrees and mathematics and you
know like in data mining or
whatever and things like that like
that's when it matters but in terms of
like web development yeah I mean I've
got like a wall literally down my
basement or whatever is kind of like an
office I've got like a wall of like 12
certifications and different technology
I do employers care about that hell no
and the thing is is that like after
you've been in the industry a while they
only really only care about the last ten
years you know the last ten years what
you did you know you could be in the
industry twenty thirty years and I don't
give a you know they just care
about like what can you do right now
what have you done you know what are you
having your portfolio what do you have
like recent work or whatever in
technologies that's what they base you
know hiring you on you know what can you
provide to the company right now that's
that's what they care about no exactly
that's what I'm saying like people just
gotta understand like gray now is the
golden age of the web prey so you just
try to get into this thing as soon as
possible this thing is not gonna be here
forever
and yes at one point is gonna be
overcrowded because if people start
deciding and opening their eyes it could
get crowded but I still don't believe
that's gonna get to that point because
nobody wants to put in the work this
 takes time nobody wants to be in
front of a computer you know how long I
was on a computer
I will come today at 10 o'clock in the
morning
I started working on my website from
there I started doing courses which is
 related to coding right and I do
this every day no matter what
because I wake up in the morning go to
work now code until 5:30 6 o'clock
sometimes 7 o'clock right and then I
come home do code again and then from
there come here do another video
recording video or do a live video and
talk about code most people don't do
this you know there's certain
people that that really go hard the guys
that you know like the guy that created
react like Dan aim every month that I
was looking his profile he's been doing
this since 12 years old at the
level that I'm doing it now like I just
started being like this like three four
years ago you know like coding
constantly and working on if I
would have been doing this since 14
when I first started getting my passion
to coding who knows what a fuckup I
would have been by now but I just picked
it picked this thing up right now so
those kids who who are picking this
up at 14 15 years old and continue with
that passion those guys are they
end up being like geniuses you know
because it's the more you you work and
the more you code the better you get in
the better ideas you start getting no
this is not something that look it up
like look look up Elon Musk like he you
don't he didn't start to coding
this the other day he's been doing
this since like ten years old you
know so it takes time guys and that's
what tell people you gotta you gotta put
in two hours you to Barbara I'm watching
you you got a deal you gotta get into
this man even if I know it's hard cause
you work full time and you got other
things personal life but yeah you've got
to get into this man it's like this is
the time there's like yeah I'll quit
your job you know I thought about doing
it I thought about you I thought about
just taking that money yeah and it's
like grinding out literature right yeah
a living like a loser bro I would
seriously consider it
consider it because don't ya the only
way I would say is if you don't have no
responsibilities if you don't have okay
if you don't have a rent if you don't
like you have now you got to pay
for just quit that job
and just go back to your mom's house for
two three months get enough knowledge
where you could be like a you know be a
 junior developer get higher
somewhere for $18 an hour then from
there start working three months later
leave that job cuz you don't owe them
nothing and then working another
company make 35 you know and
just keep growing like that build a nice
portfolio build a nice resume where you
can say hey I work for this company like
when I put on my like yeah
I work for this company I work for
website star still up like you know I
could go to websites from
Universal died day and they're still up
there music artists that I
created websites for they're still up
and people could look it up and it's
like those just look nice you know but I
see it takes time to get there and the
only way you're gonna get is if you
start working and start going to job
interviews being in your house and
thinking oh yeah
maybe one day I'll get into this that's
not gonna get you nowhere you gotta
 do this constantly man it
really bust the ass no but what do I
know
okay there's somebody like
people who say commie is like
what do you know where do you work at
you work on YouTube I work on YouTube
I'm like in my head I'm like you don't
 this guy's like it's like you're
constantly doing live videos at twelve
o'clock one o'clock
you don't work anywhere oh man
yes I guess I get to eat
mostly to a computer and the slate can I
go outside from his office work it's
like yeah Salieri's I'm looking at the
Internet gangsters yeah man I'm like
laughing I'm like yo it's people
and there'll be like people that never
worked in their lives and then I go
they've never done this before and
then they're like oh man you
work on YouTube that's your job you
don't even know like all the work I
 do is talk to the wrong guy you
should be talking to clever programmer I
want to know where he worked at no no
not simple programmer clever program I
mean this is watching that's nothing -
it's like CC ma and then they take
ideas they take from here they
 implemented to their channels
they do sneaky right
and then on top of that do you think
they really think did a and I'm
like bro it's easy to look up somebody
right and then you're like where's your
 history where's your job history
where have you worked at like it's easy
to find somebody you know what I
mean like people could literally go
online and see when I first started and
when I first just got into the industry
and you will find a post in team
treehouse on my first week first
few weeks right and it's like then you
will find another post which was our
months later after I started working and
I'm like there's a history there you
know people can look it up you know what
we'll also take their time you
know you could go and look up creative
circle and see the places people
have worked on you will see what a
I worked out you know what I mean like
you know I'm just like okay cool y-you
know it's like the same thing I think
now everybody on here on YouTube works
as a developer full-time it's like I
work on this ship full-time like you
know it's like that guy Edwin Diaz man I
don't know if he's ever worked is like a
developer I think he's just like crazy
courses I don't know what else he does
but I think I think he's done it I think
he's more like a freelancer like a
wordpress type of guy maybe like you
know like I know for sure it's not like
any major companies and like that
is more like a freelancer and you can't
be mad at is it's a good hustle it just
sucks because somebody goes in and buys
a course and be like oh cool you know
I'm gonna buy a course and then next
thing you know the courses it's
 no respect for the person
who bought the course it's like wakes up
in the morning is like I'm sorry guys
I'm doing a whole bunch of mistake up I
miss my coffee you know you know how
many mistakes I made I made
mistakes you know what I do I delete the
video every recording you know nothing I
mean that's how I was that when I came
across simple programmer because I say
all his videos are about business yeah
and all that kind of stuff which his
videos about business stuff is really
good and matter of fact they was good
enough he wrote this book called soft
skills and like it's got a lot of just
like life like bounce like
balancing your time out all that
like it's got a good everyday like
you don't typically sit down and think
about on how can you improve and and do
this and you know setting goals and
and it's really legit but I just
remember thinking
how does your name gonna be simple
programmer and I've never seen a damn
programming video about you coding you
know well I mean he he charges for that
she and he got speedy well he said when
he does I'm plural site yeah okay his
courses he got some legit courses on
Pluralsight I mean he's he's been around
since God knows when I remember being a
little kid and I heard about John so
miss he just happened to now bringing
all that business that he got in
all the internet savvy that
he has over the years and brought it
into YouTube and just you know
implement all that into it but only
thing I don't like about his channel and
I'm just being honest
it just it's too much of everything it's
like too much there's nothing it's
called simple programmer but then he has
video not everything yeah he be going
off on some wild like yeah he was
talking about some random like societal
start like I was at the mail movement or
something you know I respect for him
though because like I mean some of the
motivational stuff that he does and you
know there's some things I'm like agile
programming or like agile process and
like there's something and yet the
motivational stuff and alone is like no
that's what I'm saying I think if he he
will keep things like I think if his
channel was mostly like let's say if you
call something simple programmer is that
right now this times I wanna
talked about games or I wanna talk about
 while I now with my friends it's
like I'm not going to bring that to this
channel cuz then people who are in this
channel are here because of code right
if I want to create something about
motivational speaking and now or I want
to talk about a book reviews and
like that
I will put that on a separate channel
and
say tell people hey guys check out my
personal channel you know a John
psalmist dot-com or something right
that's what I would do but the simple
program when I subscribe today I was
like I wanted to just listen to
code I don't want to listen to a
motivational book I don't want to
hear about how to get a girlfriend he
said I prefer Eli the computer guy yeah
at least he sticks with stuff just about
technology hey Joseph you breaking up a
lot yeah my god I was kind of soon
goddamn Verizon I mean is I is this is
just a little bit choppy boys all right
they all sent like Lamont in the chat he
was saying that he preferred Eli the
computer guy I was like at least he
sticks with stuff about computers yeah
in text years ago bunnies I need a
girlfriend yeah no I think what he likes
him is another one he's like the
grandfather the Eli I think he he's
really good for a system administrator
videos and like IT work cuz I remember
when I was working as an IT I was
watching his videos but he's been around
for a long time you know he's been
around since like the beginning of
 YouTube as like him and the new
Boston the new Boston also is another
guy who he came in he ranked in he's
like hey he's like always gonna get a
bunch of views you guys like a million
views a day or some like that he's
good he don't never have to work again
you don't have to do not rush it yeah
just seems like simple programmers to
try to be a life coach he's trying to
get on that 20 Robbins type yeah I
did yeah
the oversaturated market though yeah
it's hard no I thought over that it's
mark everybody wanted I don't know I got
there's a lot of like shitty like
motivational speakers out there yeah
he's like focused on the per like
programmers that are looking for
motivational speaker like I mean to be
honest if I'm looking for code like a
coding type of video whatever I'm
probably end up taking a course or like
reading a bit like you know paying for
something or whatever to do it like the
reason why like for example I came to
Joe's channel is number one yeah like
there's a motivational aspect to it like
I saw what Joe is doing I'm just like
you know if Joe's doing this stuff like
I can get back in the game and you know
get back in this and like you know
I can learn and he's laying out exactly
what I need to do in order to get back
into the game and you know and then like
there's the career advice aspect and
like you know advice in general whatever
you know I see that and then I see Chris
Shawn you know he's basically doing like
motivational stuff in his videos doesn't
really like delve into any you know
deaths in terms of code or anything like
that and you know there's like a couple
other channels like that if I'm looking
for anything specific then you know I'll
look for like this specific thing that
I'm looking for or I'll just take a
course right like like more niche like
like motivational speaking not just like
a broad spectrum yeah yeah well I mean
there's there's motivational speaking
then there's motivational speaking
specific to the career that you're
looking to get into right you know I
agreed to it what would you then say now
on that like the only thing like I kind
of got like a problems like motivation
they got a problem like motivational
speakers but the only thing is like it
seems like a lot of rah-rah stuff like
people who sit here listening to Rawat
for like eight hours and not cold
mm-hm yeah another problem I got with
that like when you go to like those
channels who's like they feel like they
doing clever I like this a lot
oh I'm motivated app em yeah not you
nothing
I'm saying that's only problem I got was
like rah rah people like Tony Robbins
they old
you gotta spend $10,000 to jump up and
down they all I'm a bottle jet but I'm
like no I'm not yeah I'm listenin
Garrity
I mean I'm gonna make a million dollars
next year and then you go home and you
couch it like I read it like yo buy a
 course on udemy it all the
motivation which I can stay here and
grind it out and I'm gonna get it though
I'm not gonna stay here and go ah yeah
yeah that's why I like ET you know he
does that thank God his Monday series
like you give you like ten minutes and
tell you to go work you know not just
watch this videos all the time ya know I
think the problem is like this it's not
only you know the channels the people
who created these channels and in
YouTube and all that stuff it's mostly a
lot of people who who like you know even
some of my own subscribers there's
people who come here and they love to
watch me coming here and give them
motivation or find out what I'm doing it
and how my life is going if I'm doing
good I'm doing bad whatever it is right
they enjoy chillin with me hanging out
right and that's great but at the same
time I tell people I'm like hey the same
time that you put into watching not only
my videos Krishan videos a simple
program are so clever program Chris
Hawkes who arrÃ¡bida a casa Daryl
tough cookie talk Andy OH
now everybody right everybody all the
time that they put into watching
everybody I hope that they're putting
that same amount of time into coding
because sometimes you fall into this
trap of just watching on YouTube
and you're not coding your you're not
gonna get anywhere by not coding and
creating projects and like I tell people
I told people hey create this five
projects of you know the restaurant the
real estate the digital agency the
e-commerce I tell people like start
building those things is the same
as the courses that I put up right
before I was putting tutorials here on
YouTube
nobody was doing
most of the people that were coming in
they wasn't doing it so then now I'm
like I want to create courses I want to
create videos to teach people teach
those people that are actually going to
take it but it's kind of weird because I
have everybody's information I have
everybody's email so I know from the
usernames and on YouTube and the emails
and just everything in general I know
who actually takes two courses so what
are the good things about this is that I
get to see who actually is doing work
who actually going through the tutorials
because before I didn't have the
information right sorry and um and
people like always have me pissed off
because I'm like man you guys don't
understand that if you don't do work you
can't get nowhere it's good to come here
and get motivated but at the same time I
don't want you guys to come in and just
watch me and not do any work or come
here and be like I'm gonna do I'm gonna
do work in the weekend or we can come
see go hang out with your friends and
then you know I'll go next week but
throughout the whole week I'm gonna
watch Joe like you could do half
an hour 20 minutes each video of a
course it's usually 10 minutes so you
telling me in one day you don't have ten
minutes to go in there and if I can
start doing it you know what I mean like
this is something that's gonna change
your life
and when it comes to motivation
motivation expires motivation goes away
like you know that's why a lot of people
go to all this or people like
tony robbins and gary vee or the Sheikh
because they can't get that motivation
from themselves they're like man like I
want to go to the gym but it's like I
don't like I don't want to go to the gym
you know what I mean so I need a
 trainer to take me to the gym
screaming at my face and tell me
to workout and if he's not there
I don't work out right so that what
people need to do is take that off
their mind and be like I don't need
nobody like I could watch this person
across this jutsu
get what I need once a week to you know
whenever hit the person drops a video or
even driving like you you don't have to
watch all my videos you could watch my
videos put it to play on the car as you
drive into work or you driving somewhere
else or you on that on the train you can
listen to my videos but when you get
home and you're in front of the computer
don't just stay watching my videos start
coding or start coding and have a
playing on the side you know what I mean
like take this time to start building
shame and don't don't let time pass by
and you're gonna be like oh all I have
to show for is a freak Oh camp
certification or some like that
like that doesn't mean anything a
lot of people doing a frico camping that
 doesn't mean you know yeah
I've been I've been guilty of that
myself and that's why I like over the
last few days I've been like just trying
to go extra hard make up for the time I
was losing just by getting caught up on
you know you know I'm not
telling people hey leave my channel but
at the same time is let watch me and at
the same time don't just binge watch
 YouTube for four or five hours
it's like okay you just watch all my
videos and then you jump to a simple
program and watch all his videos and
then you go watch somebody else's videos
and next thing you know it's three hours
right you coulda just did the for
half an hour watch people's videos for
half an hour and then cold for another
three hours
you know what I mean like it's you got a
cold man that's cold it's okay I'm gonna
start working on my it is getting late
guys
yeah it's almost 4:00 a.m. oh oh oh ow
sorry Barbara kept you up
I'm doing to you what I'm doing to you
why do - Matt keep them up to like five
maybe like I got classing four hours
yeah man but now you know I don't want
to like we wouldn't take this charge oh
I don't want people to get take it you
know the wrong way it's just I don't
want you guys to really bust your ass
and you start calling man because it's
gonna pay off
trust me give yourself three to six
months even three or six months you
don't see your progress but you really
bust your ass go do something else I
give you that that pass of like okay you
tried it it's fine code is not for
everybody
notice it's supposed to be for the
people that you know that can really
work hard and push themselves if you
don't find that and you then don't just
stay there and be like oh I'm just gonna
keep on trying every two weeks i'ma
coming for one hour
no just knock it out the way man the
cold even cold sore web
developer boot camp you can do lessons
in three weeks if you do it every single
without having to do it every single day
you could do it two days out of every
weekend and just knock it out but okay
at the two days that's eight hours eight
hours that's sixteen go the next week do
another eight hours and eight hours and
that's it you're done I think the course
is only like 32 hours or some like
that
so no it's like 42 42 okay
so 42 hours so then you could do less
 in a month
every weekend for eight hours
just knock it out man you know what I
mean or you could come to coding phase
com- is not that long I'm not doing it
for 42 hours I'm giving you the
 that you need I'm not gonna give
you like every single explanation and
Under the Sun I will give you what you
need to get you start and get you that
job that's it you know what I mean so
yes up to you guys man but I really hope
that there's more people out here taking
advantage of their time you know you
only live once man you know you don't
want to say hey I was a I was a
taxi driver or whatever what I was
 job everybody works
no yeah I'm not get a chance to go to
some awesome vacations yeah I'll answer
Hawaii I used to live there for like
five years
oh when I was working at MTV to go to
Hawaii I was like hanging out with my
friends we're all just like around the
table cooking steaks and drinking beer
smoking cigars like I remember I'd like
called up TV I'm just like yeah I'm not
gonna be there for another week or
there's something to happen and we're
all around the table so I can drink and
put their beers over here like a TV
it was the main island oh yeah yeah
that's where I was I lived all over that
place I lived Waianae Waipahu downtown
Waikiki up in the mountains in the hood
yeah I lived in wine I'm it crazy a
Samoans no I don't call me damn Halle
which is like it's a derogatory term for
a white person it means the breathless
one but you have no soul being a web
developer opens up all kinds of doors it
allows you to do like I drove all
up and down California coast
my family was able to pay for the entire
family to go on vacation for like three
weeks we just drive up and down the
coast in California
yeah gives you freedom you know I mean
it's worth working Shay you got to put
in the hours but
in the end like the rewards are pretty
good in take some vacations I like to go
to Colorado hike part of the rock rocky
mountain trail go up to Seattle and just
go around a few different places now man
that's what I'm saying like people just
got out they gotta work when you do some
work and it's gonna pay off like it or
not you know this there's no way that
things could go wrong if if you don't
try you know so just try give yourself
that chance to say okay I did it if I
failed I failed but don't just wait on
you know somebody else to give you a
certificate or don't just wait until
somebody comes in and be like oh you're
a developer now no you go in and you
start working hard so I put in all your
your cool projects on your
portfolio and then just get
hired man it doesn't matter if you get
hired for a job as your first
job once you're in you're in the
industry that's it like nobody can take
you out unless you like they find out
you're like some sexual predator
so just like that I was I was reading on
this thing I don't know you know I saw
it on the New York Times there's there's
like freaking high college supposedly a
bunch of of guys who are in the tech
industry who are harassing women and
doing a whole bunch of and like
those guys are being called out for
flashing yeah are you pop like the CEO
of uber well he's one of them but this I
mean he's a CEO you can't stop
him but this other developers like there
was this girl I forgot
name some Asian girl that she was saying
that she went to a venture capitalist
capitalist to basically get some funding
and the guy just grabbed her and kissed
her and said that he would do it he's
gonna send her send her the money or
whatever but there's like so many
stories if you read it like there's so
much that it seems like girl's been
going through so those guys are getting
exposed you know they're getting exposed
because of the up that
they're doing you know cuz people think
like this is like the sixties of the 50s
the 40s where you just be like okay
honey
slap that by me like go get me that
cigarette you know like those days are
over and man you can't be doing
like that you know it was wrong back
then and it's wrong now you know I was
like I just think like in general like
people just gotta be just be a nice
human being that's it that should be
just like learning stories when you go T
free and speak to all the good states
mm-hmm now the stuff they say is like
whoa it's how is this even happening
nowadays ya know and I think I don't
know I think it's more like a power
thing so cuz guys feel a certain way
that I go I'm just gonna um you know I'm
her boss let me try to get that but yeah
at the same time is like when well
there's some women out there that are
pretty ambitious and they're willing to
do all kinds of things to get up the I
mean you know that's the truth like I
remember going to you know a Christmas
party at MTV and like after it was like
an after thing at a bar and one of the
VP's was hanging at the bar I saw like
three or four girl
this guy's married there's like three or
four girls like sir having this dude and
I'm like you know like it's obvious and
then you know I've seen some girls there
too that were like you know there's
they're not she's that this one grows
networking she'd like I mean all sexy
dress whatever and there's an intern and
it was obvious she was looking for
away in way up yeah yeah oranges apples
that's two totally different subjects so
I'm just saying it does happen
joke but Joel's not talking about that
he's talking about women that are just
there to do the work and they're getting
harassed ya know it just happens I think
that both sides is just up you
know because in one side I cannot say an
example a girl could just be this
brilliant girl who's super smart went to
a really good school and she goes to
this job next thing you know the
one of the managers like her or whatever
and it's like they think oh well she's
my support and I could just talk to her
and be like you know what let me try to
get in that you know and then she goes
wrong and then she gets up and
then there's other situations where it's
like this women who who are just sleazy
and just give a bad rep for the other
woman you know mess it up for somebody
who's there to really work you know what
I mean and that's exactly my point is
that there's gonna there's people that
will make it harder for like the
hard-working women that are actually
looking to you know be serious about
their career yeah you know I've worked
with a lot of women that are serious
about their career and they're just
there to do business that's it yeah yeah
yeah I think they can't just assume oh
because this one woman was being like
this now I can yeah yeah that's a that's
a problem when when you know we're
freaking guys is like you know sometimes
you you get into this song where it's
like cuz there's what I always say all
the time no matter how much people try
to disconnect animals from human like
we're still animals like people keep
acting like we're not but we're still
just animals out here like you
like it or now we just happened that as
society we've came up with certain rules
and certain things that we say hey this
is acceptable this is not
acceptable right so people just
don't know how to control themselves
there's certain urges they're like okay
if you like somebody you don't have to
be salivating you're like oh my
god it's a hot girl here I forgot who
was it they're like oh my god maybe
maybe maybe the joke but at the same
time it's also like man then April is
like I haven't seen April you know what
was the last time I seen April online
you know so maybe she's like now she's
like one of the people that stay quiet
and don't chat like there's a lot of
girls who hit me up but they don't chat
right so Barbara is like one of them
I forgot this other girl there's like
one other girl - that always I think so
she always comes but then besides that
it's just a whole bunch of girls who are
just quiet and just like they come here
but don't interact because it's just
like in games you know you play
Call of Duty you hear the girls voice
you get excited they don't want to play
with you because you're a girl
yeah oh my god is a girl room is like
did your daddy let you out today you
start young you know like well I go back
to the kitchen or something yeah like
you start doing crazy huh
you know it's like I make a sandwich
yeah the kitchen there's not gonna be
reckless on but like EleFun do that do
that they they don't get girls like you
yeah they don't get girls I did they
don't see like they don't see girls like
baby they like it slow me with a girl
walk by they curl up into a ball
[Laughter]
so many people pathologist I ever teach
them no manners
hey any streets and in these YouTube
channels actin brand-new like they were
 born yes big have no recollection
of what it means to be a human being
it's like what you guys said
online thugs do any of that
no call me a coon on YouTube ones and I
was like hell no they won say to my face
ya know that's how it is that's how you
know you can go online online people
start doing crazy you know even
like certain communities like if you're
freaking dues back in the real world you
get together with those bags online
you're like we're stuck
where's the Trump supporter and
there's like let's just join in and you
know I have to bring it to trump point
it happens like that you know it's
like people is like shape stars
going together it's like a bad
virus like little virus get together
next year next thing you know is
AIDS so it's like happens you know
what is the internet man exactly have
you seen that picture that mean going
around Facebook where it's like he's
like come at me you douchebag
I'll you up I'm jacked and
at the bottom it says Stephen forgets
[Laughter]
now people just gotta learn how to be
you know be regular human beings you
know respectful I like I'll be honest
there's been times where I've been I've
said some online where I'm like I
think about it like man I shouldn't say
this but it'll be like I don't know
like some real sometimes if I say some
crazy online it's like really funny
like that's the only
timed I'm gonna say it's a really really
really up right but I have
my name on it
like I don't I don't hide it I don't put
it in a icon I don't go and
 high from it you know there's
people who talk and hide themselves
it's like if you talk keep it it's
like only that's it you know like I got
love like I don't know if you guys go to
WorldStarHipHop right like I wanted to
do like a show right where it was just
like me going over the comments
on worldstar like there's no crazy
comments and they're like let me see oh
yeah I love that there's like
some crazy ass videos that I look at I
look at them I'm like yo people
are crazy the comments that they write
is like they really go in there and
think about it and then people the
comments are so good that people go and
copy it and repost it you see them here
pissed all over like damn son you
copying my comment I just saw this today
I'm gonna try to be PC here it was this
black guy who was vertically challenged
he's like yeah man I'll be out here in
his other bingo games cuz I grabbed him
by his head starts throwing him up in
the air like this in child abuse
I was in it I have seen the but it's
just the comments you know comments get
crazy people just gotta know how to
 I I feel like they should have a
thing where they you you have to do a
Facebook day Facebook said nobody's
gonna use fake names it's like if you're
gonna create a Facebook somehow Facebook
knows if you're creating a fake facebook
like it was like that yeah and there's
no saying just you can't go in there be
like hey my name is Josh Smith right and
then next thing you know you upload a
photo somehow Google has this algorithm
that I'll tell you like you're you're
not this guy you know - Twitter's the
worst oh yeah well they got oh they got
dogs you got trolls you got I mean like
that's the place where if you want to
get you know Rick like you know they'll
 destroy you on the Twitter oh
yeah there's definitely some crazy
in Twitter I mean that's what stay off
those social medias I go to Instagram
but that's because I want to share that
little photos family or situations that
I'm in whatever but I was watching this
 on the news today that some lady
she got killed because she was like
posting online like oh thank god
that I'm doing good now you know I'm
making six figures now and it was in
Florida and somebody showed up to her
house and and basically shot shot her in

so it's like you don't even know and
that must have been somebody that knew
her because then I owe you money now let
me see that let me go in there and you
know try to rob you and
that's why it's like well girl be
telling music oh you shouldn't be
putting out your business on the
Internet yeah well I got the ratchet
like this a big different I got somebody
come
yeah somebody's gonna pop off
like somebody's getting their head
chopped off like you know I will show
some sherry now but we are used to if I
had switch now but that's like a while
top you wanna kill you sometimes you
gotta protect yourself man you gotta
 have the Second Amendment is
there for a reason like they can't find
you lacking out here like somebody's
gonna try to kill me we gotta bulk on
 goal on this man it
you know what I mean like that's why you
know England
I hear there's no guns in England like
yeah yeah yeah
I do that's crazy
I don't like majority I think
were they Australia don't have guns no
more so they shutting that
down what is different type of people I
think like they're probably nicer like
people haven't they don't know what
America is really like you know what I
really like yeah there's a lot of
studies yeah I hear that I hear that you
go to a club and people just they
creating shanks and the bathrooms they
come back checking people up this huge
yeah I watch this documentary one time
about this guy who was like a gangster
in London he was just like he's like
I've been stabbed 17 times I I
know Mickey way like I don't know some
guy things in one week last month just
in my area this tiny little area and you
live in crazy you live in the law
siowiy liver muscle North London yeah
where I mean there you grow up there or
you move there after London when I was
nine okay turn off London and was it is
your family all from England or can you
like say hey there's like I have family
from other parts of Europe well my
family is Portuguese okay bono ah but I
wasn't born in Portugal like in the
mainland Oh Island an island called
Madeira oak I know if you guys know
soccer but is a very famous soccer
player called Cristiano Ronaldo yeah
everybody knows who he is
yeah I was born like in the same town as
him down the block in shame and I used
to play yeah I know is that how it
usually is if you live like in a small
town you most people know each other
it's like the island in the mountains
yeah no that's not man I moved here when
I was mine it's a London new
opportunities new world yeah man is like
me I moved over here to the US and seven
years old I was actually born in
Dominican Republic
I have par bazillion and I have Spanish
descent like my grandfather's are my
grandfather and grandmother
they're from Spain oh this weird and
then I just came out like this and then
my father is Brazilian but he's black
you know so it's like hey I got the
little Shrek can you speak Portuguese I
know I know certain things I know like
boom dah
I know what else do I know like if
somebody talks to me cuz I grow bad in
the ritual like people there was a lot
of Brazilians too so as I got no I know
some of them so there's like it's weird
because it's like I know more Spanish
because I grew up with my mom's you know
so yeah that's where I pretty much grew
up at so that's that's what I know but I
know like start your little things you
know Spanish yeah yeah yeah because this
is similar but kind of different though
Portuguese is like you is like you're
almost like singing it's like a singing
type of languages like you know what I
mean like this is certain like little
syllables there's a lot of different was
it's people think the difference between
Portuguese and Spanish is the difference
between British English and American
English but it's not yeah this is much
greater than that you know it's very
their prayer yeah
it's to the point where the two
countries what wouldn't be able to
understand each other's language but the
reason why Portuguese people can
understand Spanish is because you know
Spanish culture in the Latin communities
is the number one culture right yeah no
I mean the Latino countries and
communities Spanish is the main culture
the food the music everything so in the
Portuguese countries like Brazil and in
Portugal we still watch and listen to
Spanish stuff yeah okay that's why we
can understand Spanish but they can't
understand Portuguese because I'll be
little sauce stuff yeah I mean I listen
to a lot of Brazilian music like
when I like really got into my shape
like you know like I used to know like
not a lot but used to like pretty much
defend myself when I came to like Brazil
well Portuguese's all your mouth has oil
on your arm oh oh boy oh yeah oh yeah
amo o Brasil so it's like I have a
little something you know it's like yeah
boy it was free money I'll teach you
some more well you know it's like I was
like the Brazilian music you know a
funky just like just I love that
like a I don't know I love it my
girlfriend hates that but I love it
see this is gonna sound weird as I
love to listen to a lot of soca Trinidad
yes that Island music it gets me going
every time
yeah no sometimes I think which is weird
you know when you think about it if my
computer dies dies I love everybody here
because it probably might die in like
the next few minutes and it's already
late so I'm just gonna end but I was
gonna say is is weird because in the
u.s. like nobody listens to other music
from other people's countries or other
cultures but in other countries they
listen to the US music and they don't
understand what the they're saying
right right so you know I think if you
listen to socre you listen to dancehall
you listen to for game arranged a you
listen to my cha cha you listen to yeah
man
but you know you think you got it you
got a be more culture people need to be
more culture they need to learn more
about other people's you know cuz I feel
like even racism man in classes and it
all comes from not knowing the other
person you know if you don't know that
person it's like you make assumptions of
oh this person is like this this person
is like that but if you try to trip on
learning about that culture then you're
like oh I know those people
that's one of the things like I did not
expect when I lived in Hawaii was that
all their modern music is so reggae
influenced and it's just it's like do
you listen to these old like Hawaiian
songs like you think like Elvis movies
in this little ukulele stuff but not and
they got these reggae riffs and got
people out there were still drums and
 on the Waikiki strip and I mean
that shit's fine like I've always loved
like reggae music since I was really
little and my mom had a freaking a Bob
Marley vinyl on the thing just I just
always grew up listen to all kinds of
different music yeah listen up my oldies
but like when I'm talking to all these
are like Motown so I was like Jackson 5
and that's creamy just all this
different stuff and I just good music is
good music I don't care if I understand
the word solid
I was into a lot of Mexican music and
people assumed that oh I understand what
it is because my last name is Perez
little quick history on your last name
whiter than white
that's a and then you have Perez there's
some history there somebody was hitting
saying you know yeah my mom's first
husband was Mexican and she had my
sister I'm the youngest and basics
basically she had my other brothers and
sisters and then they got divorced and
then she had me soon after the divorce
but her and my dad wasn't married at the
time and since they wasn't married she
wanted me to have their last name that
way none of my brothers looked at me any
differently mm-hmm so I mean it just
ended up that way and I used to catch a
lot of flack for it growing up so I mean
like when I moved my parents passed away
I'm in Florida I just remember every one
school
 you gringo you think ass
Latino so I have I had no I had no
friends that were Hispanic at first I
was poor and I lived in the ghetto so I
had no white friends and so I just
started hanging out with the Haitian
kids because that's all it lived around
me in some story man no I thought it was
like Cuban I was about the same like you
mission but I mean is that really counts
pain user Caucasian yeah word that's
right
that's why me like I'm half black and
half white when I come in a man hey yo
boy yeah I'll be telling people is a
young i remembers kid in high school
will be like man you ain't black I'm
like black word counts god bless me you
know where me like god bless you
listen God bless me any girl could test
for him but I hate he's black let him
rock you know what I mean so that's all
wise man like black people have like
these are so much for culture like
people don't even give them credit
everything for the concert they
don't even get no credit man like like
god bless Africa man like it you
know I mean like everything like
everything the black people do
is like gold it you know what I
mean is like you like it or not people
 hate it it's like man that's in
it we there was no wall
imitates anybody I'm like you think of
most musical genres jazz blues rock and
roll it the black people rated it first
yeah yeah
even the instrument
look in the making public all the
instruments are basically they come from
Africa like the drums to tambora
oh there we go it was good too I
wouldn't change like I'll just having
that vast cultural experience bringing
up how I grew up in my life because like
now I just feel like I just go anywhere
I want to go and it is what it is you
know because I don't I don't see color
when I see people if I see a mask in man
I see a woman I see a woman and sadly
other people don't always see it that
way which will you know because
sometimes I get caught up being places I
probably shouldn't be you know yep and
that's the thing like I think cultural
differences are the things that should
bring us together as humans because it's
like they got the other pieces of the
puzzle that we don't know about and we
don't get to see and rather than hating
each other because the difference isn't
marking each other because our
similarities it kind of be the other way
around where it's like you're exactly
like me why do I want to be around you
it's not gonna benefit me it's not gonna
challenge me it's not gonna make me grow
as a person and have a wider range of
ideas and and stuff so I don't know I'm
just kind of feel that though okay guys
I'm gonna have to love you and leave me
it's almost 4:30 a.m. okay yeah get some
sleep get out of here too that way I can
get up early maybe do some coding before
work all right tech thanks for the story
