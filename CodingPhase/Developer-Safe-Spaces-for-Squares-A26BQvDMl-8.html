man coating face Kamiya boys backing out
and did it again I'm over here my role
you know
the curtains and the bed and just like
laying down and isn't that alright but
I'm reading through comments and I bump
into this kid can't chew up well he says
I am an FCC student after two months of
free search ask I got my first job as a
junior front-end developer okay most
people just doesn't understand FCC
Theory all right instead of babysitting
you like every other website FCC throws
the problem at you instead require you
to do research Reid asked to solve the
problem which mean if you too lazy to
use your brain you effed up everyone can
have their opinion but I really don't
like the term trap you use for FCC and I
am I'm subscribed by listen guys there's
the clear example of somebody who I
don't want on my channel it's that
simple
like let's be honest if the word trap
makes you feel like I can't watch this
channel there's so many things that I've
done on this channel and that little
thing is like that's where you draw the
line you like that's a he crossed the
line guys we need to stop being fans we
need to stop being you know just a hose
you know I mean like stop being fans of
brands stop being fans of frameworks
stop being fans of you know whatever is
Xbox vs ps4 and if you're nine the Xbox
seen a few because I'm leaving because
you like ps4 guys everybody has their
opinion right now if you just came here
and one little thing like this just
makes your head explode you're not
supposed to be here
this is not a channel about
being fake there's now a channel by
being censored of opinions this is not
about coming in here and be like oh man
you don't like my framework I'm leaving
like you don't understand the channel
okay I don't even know how you found my
channel right right kind of and this is
not to say hey I don't want people in my
channel and this that's not it's just
there's the clear example or somebody
that makes no sense
you're telling me me as a self-taught
developer somebody who's gonna learn
from scratch I'm gonna come in to free
cocaine spent you know 30 hours let's
say 70 hours on the website trying to
finish something right and then on top
but I have to spending 30 40 50 60 70
hours in there I have to constantly keep
looking in other places for answers yes
that happens in every single platform
right that happens everywhere where you
gonna have to look online for other
things that you're gonna have to look at
the documentation you're gonna have to
ask questions on Stack Overflow you're
gonna do a whole bunch of stuff right
but if you watch the video that I made
be careful about falling on the trap of
free cocaine first thing that I said in
there was the platform is not bad was
bad is the fact that people are falling
into this thing where they just go to
the website they take the courses they
take the the knife in the courses
there's just examples from documentation
right so this go example1 example2
example3 example4 and then they don't
know how to build a site at the end of
the day you could go through that whole
thing that whole map and still not know
how to build the site right I'm not
saying for you not to go to freako camp
what I'm saying is go to freako camp but
don't go there following it as if God
gave you that list no because if
somebody teaches you HTML doesn't
manifest coke atom e frizz free cocaine
you to me team tree house wherever the
hell it is
just say hey I'm gonna follow each one
one one one one one one one one by one
as if it's Netflix and you're like I'm
trying to binge watch everything I'm
trying to bench finish things as soon as
possible
you got to start building projects on
your own right so don't fall into the
trap because when I say the trap is 80%
of the people that go to freako camp
fall into this trap of hey every day you
know from seven o'clock at night to nine
o'clock at night I'm gonna do two hours
on freako cameras going one by one right
but then they don't build anything they
don't have a portfolio that I'm building
a website then we have a a github pages
so that's what I'm talking about falling
into a trap like why would you spend 60
70 hours let's say an example let's use
a calculator because I like to bring out
the real numbers okay let's say a
calculator all right three hours let's
say two hours somebody that works every
day two hours per day does let's say and
two times five is ten
all right that's one week right now
let's say a one week time seven how much
is that that's like a month in three
weeks right you spend a month in three
weeks on freaking camping you still
haven't built anything you finish the
whole thing and then you're like okay
cool now we're gonna start building
things and then you realize wait I
forgot everything that I learned from
the beginning because I didn't put it to
practice following little examples here
and there is not gonna make you a
developer all right now if I Kenneth
Shore who I have never seen have never
seen him con me I have never seen him
leave a comment on a chatroom or
whatever right I don't even know if this
dude really follows the channel right
because if he did follow the channel he
wonder stand what this channel is about
it's just to be honest and have honest
conversations with people about what
development and programming in general
right if you can't take it you know this
is not
a place where you like man we need to
have safe places to talk about what
development no man just get out of here
you're not supposed to be in here this
is not a freak channel there's not a
channel that you're gonna come here and
start seeing top five reasons why
JavaScript is the best language you're
not gonna be finding that there might be
one of those videos once in a blue moon
but this is not about that this channel
is not about that I'm not here to give
you you know false positivity
you know forced positivity all the time
right people are expecting that like you
know I was like I understand people have
hard times in their own personal lives
and they look for YouTube to be as an
escape you know a place to entertain
themselves a place to enforce themselves
but when you live in this world where
you say hey I'm gonna be around people
that all uses that I use only Xbox right
I want to be around people that only
used ps4 I want to be around people I
only used to react I want to be around
people that I only use angular I want to
be around people that only used with you
right then you already messed up in your
life kid you know I mean like that's on
you you know what I mean like and I
bring this out as an example for you
guys to understand like what this
channel is really about I mean like I'm
here to help people out man I'm not here
to try to change your mind you know I'm
not here to try to completely motivate
you like if you don't want to learn how
to code you you could know how to call
on your own time you know right you can
come here get your your experience from
here and get your entertainment from
here that's on you all right
but moments like this is where I'm like
man did he really follow the channel did
he understand the channel is like bro
you're the definition of a square like
literally like I'm being honest like
you're a square bro like you need to
understand and get out of that little
box like you need to come out of the box
and
that was going on in the world like
understanding video look at the video
look at what's happening to people just
because you got a job in two months we
don't know your background right we
don't know your back we don't know what
you've been doing there's another thing
too where people come in and they'd be
like I got a job in one March and then
you realize oh yeah they used to do Java
they used to do other programming
languages and then they come here but I
oh yeah I just started doing what the
front of my name I got a job in my first
March and it's like are you comparing
yourself to somebody who has never done
any type of programming or you just want
to be acting as if you're a prodigy and
that's like I'm be honest that's one of
the people's that I hate the most those
people that want to act like they're a
prodigy like they're something special
because I got a job in a month I got a
job in two weeks but then then I'll tell
you the full story behind it right now
Kenneth I wish you the best uh you know
I'm sorry to put you on blast but at the
same time it's like man you know when I
don't subscribe to somebody I'll be like
cool I'm out I don't even tell nobody
like I don't subscribe I just
unsubscribe I keep it moving and I say
and usually has to take me to a really
space of like I can't stand seeing this
guy no more right because of a situation
of like oh this person's racist this
person is he might be giving content
that has nothing to do with what I first
subscribed for situations like that make
me unsubscribe from people but because
somebody used the word trap which in
reality it is a real word for it free
code camp that's happening to people and
nobody's talking about it I'm the only
one that talks about it I'm supposed to
be real and give you the positives and
gives you the negative of different
websites different platforms just
because you're a fan of it doesn't mean
that you're like oh man F this guy Joe
like you don't like free coke amp
it's free who doesn't like free it's
like it's free is great whoop-dee-doo
like you know people are acting I guess
if freako camera is like the second
coming of Jesus it's just a regular
website personally if I was to choose
between from coke Adam II and free coke
app I will use from coke Adam II right
if we're talking about free let's go to
coke Adam II I like it better than free
coke it not better example looks better
it's more cleaner it's more clear they
help you build real stuff not just
follow the documentation so that's all
I'm saying
now if you if you feel like a certain
way because you know somebody talked
negative about your favorite platform
bro this is not the place for you
I tell people all the time you know you
gotta learn how to actually live with
people and work with people that don't
think the same way as you right you
can't be in this world of this person
that doesn't like what I like so I'm
gonna leave that space because I need to
be around the people that like the same
things that I like like that makes no
sense you know what I mean
it's like I always bring this example
Xbox vs ps4 or Xbox vs ps3 whatever like
people are so quick to be like oh man
Xbox singing o P is 14 as I bro you
could still be around people that like
ps4 and you can still be around people
that like Xbox doesn't mean that you
need to go on a bubble right this were
one of those things that's wrong with
society now and it was wrong with the
internet it's the fact that you could
literally escape from the real world and
just say hey I'm just gonna be in this
box you know it's like people that I
just want to be in and you know this fox
news oh hey I want to be in and MSNBC
hey I just want to be on CNN and people
choose
what they wanna know about right people
choose what was really going on like if
right now somebody you know somebody
said with what was it the thing from the
shootout and you know Vegas somebody was
talking about that oh this is fake news
and it's like wait what you know I mean
like this is the same thing it's this
guy you know I mean like people choose
to be around people that believe in
whatever they believe like that's wack
man because it doesn't help you open up
your mind it doesn't help you understand
that other people doesn't help you see
other point of views you know what I
mean like how can I put myself in a
bubble in a square why you want to live
in this square with all the squares you
know when you have the opportunity to be
in a channel with diverse whereas
different type of topics where it's
different situations every single day
where somebody comes in here and gives
you real life experience when somebody
comes in here and gives you real life
advice like you know I mean like just
because somebody talked about your
favorite brand
those people who are here who they love
angular they know I'm not a super fan of
angular but they like it they stay here
right there's people that love view GS
and they know I hate it and they stay
here right because they know there's
more constant there's more to life than
just one little thing when you over here
you know drowning on a cup because
that's what this kid is doing he's
drowning in a cup he's like man you
talked about free cocaine you can't talk
about free cook leave free okay below
nobody should talk about freak okay guys
man this is not the place for you man
like I'm being honest you want real
conversations or do you want something
cater to go to a
freako camp channel right you know this
uh I mean this I'm not gonna mention his
name but you guys should know it's like
the freak old camp kid like go to his
channel you know what I mean it's like
there's something that who wasn't this
girl oh yeah tough candy said you know
you talk about freako camp and it gives
you a lot of views and it's true yeah I
kind of stayed away from even mentioning
it because I really disliked a group of
people in there in a frico camp world
that is just like super fans and I don't
understand why like I could've gave you
or is it w3c schools until you hate
follow lists and you would have gotten
the same experience as freako camp I
could have sent you to CSS reference
that I owe you would have gotten the
same experience I gotta send you to coke
Adam II and you were a guy in the same
experience so I don't say why is it that
people are such like in this community
they're like so defensive about it and
st. Browns and calm down it's just a
website I don't see nobody here crying
for Coke Adam II I don't see nobody
cryin for team treehouse nobody's crying
for you to me like calm down it's just a
platform kids you know everybody has
their own opinions man like you know we
have to also respect it and and just be
like understand that people have
different opinions and when I talk about
something it's not because I want to say
it's my opinion what this times that I
talk about things in in a negative way
or a positive way and it's not really
talking about me because I have a job
you know I mean like I I've been doing
this for a long time by god I'm already
good this is warnings to the people that
are starting up like who cares you know
like who cares about you know if I have
a job if I make money for what the velum
who cares about that
I'm warning people from not falling into
that trap off I'm just going to go in
there
and just follow the math follow the
whole thing and then realize oh I don't
go I can't get a job I don't have Pro
all portfolio I don't have no skills you
know like you know what I mean is like
people also too don't understand this
said a little thing called cold luck you
know what I mean like everybody could
get it you know everybody could get that
little piece of luck you know I could go
right now and be like hey I'm not a
great goalie developer but I have
experiencing in programming I've been
doing this for a long time and show up
to a company somebody like me I smile to
the right person you know they gave me a
pat in the back and said you know what
we like this kid let's give him a chance
let's hire him as a junior golang
developer people keep forgetting this
that aspect of the game right where it's
like you could get a job without knowing
that technology and just by the the
simple fact that you showed up that day
it was a sunny day and you know
everybody how was having a great day you
make a joke this person likes the
Yankees you like the Yankees now you're
made a conversation then you like you
know what let's give a chance to this
guy but that doesn't happen to everybody
right so because you got a job in two
months because a frico cam doesn't mean
that 98% of the other people are getting
a job in two months after freako can
they not stop focusing on your
experience and but I owe my experience
my experience was this and this is what
happens in the world
no this also little thing that is just
luck and when I say luck is just like a
random variable like we don't know who's
gonna get it right
like 10 different people who go to a job
interview and one of them is gonna get
that job they all prepared they all have
portfolios all have skills but one of
them is gonna get that job do we call it
a little bit of luck
yeah somebody's gonna have that right so
that's what I'm saying man it's like I'm
just wanting people to just really think
about you know about like you know
freako camp and just build stuff don't
just follow along it's the same thing is
when I tell people when they come to my
website don't just follow along and not
build anything in between like if you
come in and take the html/css course
build something was done if you come in
and you see you take the JavaScript just
build something with a creator a pop-up
creator a freaking a motor or a freakin
manual drop down menu something to
continue your growth but don't just
follow along like this is Netflix and
you try to binge watch it and then you
expect to have a payoff at the end of
the day and going back to this kid is
just like Brenna Lake you know I don't
mind people unsubscribing but what
bothers me is when somebody who we've
never seen who has you're not part of
the community we don't know you you know
what I mean like we don't know you you
don't comment you don't show up in a
chat you don't leave like see your ghost
right if a ghost decides to leave Leave
we don't know you you know what I mean
is like for the dumbest idea of like is
I hate for this word trap because
everyone freaking freak oucampus one of
your favorite ones
whoop-dee-doo go to a bubble a frico cap
if you want to be around guys who just
say free coke Amber's the best in the
world then go into that bubble yourself
over there we don't need people like
that in here bro and that's it
how did it day everybody sorry I like to
really just like I was gonna leave him a
comment back but then it's like why when
other people might get something out of
this right whoever watches this I want
you guys to take something out of this
video which is you don't need to be
around the same people as you all the
time you need to be around with
diversity people that think different
than you people that have different
opinions and you're people that look
different than you people that have new
ideas like that's what you want to be
around because then you're just putting
yourself in a bubble and like this dude
you're putting yourself in a square in a
roomful of squares so that's what you
want
so go ahead see you guys later guys and
by the way go to my website or check the
links below coding phase com I have a
couple of links directly to you to me to
the best courses on udemy so yeah I'll
see you guys later
