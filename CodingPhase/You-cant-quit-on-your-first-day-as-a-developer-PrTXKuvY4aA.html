again man coding face.com your boys back
in I didn't did it again listen guys
there's a message to all windows users
guys listen to this I want you guys to
really understand what you're getting
yourself into when it comes to web
development let's be honest in Windows
it is harder to set up things right you
have to set up their environment and you
know nodejs might not work exactly how
you want it there might be certain
commands that you're gonna see online
where you're gonna be like oh what the
hell is did this little dollar sign the
little dollar sign means is in the
console log or the terminal right
there's certain things that you gotta
see online like 90% of of development is
really geared toward armed Linux and Mac
right when you see a tutorial online
that's what you're gonna find right you
might see somebody who comes in and goes
through the whole one-hour set up of you
know teaching you guys how to set it up
on Windows and doing a whole process
guys I'll be honest when I was using
Windows that used to be the fun part the
fun part was figuring it out you know
there's some people's that are quitting
you know they're like man I can't set up
the the started King guys the starter
kit is not something I'm you know out of
this world
I'm not telling you guys hi guys setup
Python setup Ruby on Rails setup all you
know the Java a Java system guys we're
doing the basics in stone ojs that's a
you're not building something super
complicated I've gone to companies right
where it's taking me two to three days
to setup my local environment you know
going through the whole process of
installing everything cuz they give you
a brand new blank computer and say hey
here's a computer
you gotta install it right you install
your Windows 10 you installed all your
no js' you install all your your
programs that you need
your Photoshop you come in connect to
you know the security there's a firewall
you got to go through it's a big process
and you're telling me you're so quick to
quit because you can't get your starter
kit set up when the starter kit is
literally a like a thing to preview you
don't need it like it's optional and
people are so quick to quit they're like
man this is so hard to set it up guys
you're gonna need no js' if you're a
developer you're gonna need no js'
you're gonna have to learn how to
install nodejs on your Windows computer
you know I apologize that you know I
don't use a Windows computer and for any
of you guys who are you know maybe the
real cast is Darrow who's on you know a
real Windows user and like he really
knows his stuff he works for you know
Microsoft like he should know all this
stuff right if yo or even Matt or you
know any of you guys who already have a
setup listen guys send me a message send
me a comment right here who could do
this for me who can go and record a
basically a video simple video of
installing nodejs starting the starter
kit which is really much it's pretty
much the same NPM install that's it
running if anybody can do that I'm
willing to pay you guys you know I know
something or I give you like a year
subscription free something whoever
wants to help me out to help these
people out because people are so quick
to to quit man and I'm like man I just
don't understand it I'll be honest I
don't understand it because you have to
understand what development is not easy
what development
it could get hard the situation that's
gonna be hard you're not gonna be able
you know if like with I believe in
companies like I told you taking me two
days to set up everything local
environment setup gay connect to or
bitbucket
do so much stuff so many programs that
what if I be like on the first day at
the end after eight hours of setting
everything up and I'm still not even
working it right I still haven't caught
anything
hours what if I just go like this is too
hard man I'm bout to just you know I'm
gonna go to another company that's
easier guys the world doesn't work like
that
you just have to make it work for you
you have to go in there and go into
Windows guys this look the world is like
this this 80% of people on Windows all
right do you know how many developers
are out there using Windows and they do
all of the stuff that you're doing this
is the basics NPM install that's it
that's all you have to do npm run watch
you know it's like you can't just be
like I'm quitting you know it's like I'm
going somewhere else where it's easier
you're not gonna make it I'm being
honest you're not gonna make it in this
industry at all and it's not because
it's like oh this I'm doing in a hard
way I'm actually doing it in the easiest
way possible NPM install everything's
already set up for you
you're not installing anything you're
not building anything from scratch you
coming in and just saying hey I'm
downloading this then for an install
node then after you install node
installed um gulp after gulp definitely
you say npm install and then you say npm
or run watch that's it that's all you
have to do you don't have to connect to
a get you don't have to connect a big
bucket you don't have to download source
tree you don't have to connect to JIRA
you don't have to there's so many things
that goes into web development setting
up an environment you get to work
that if you're right now you're so ready
to quit and be like man I just can't do
this man this is not built for me like
bro I really cannot help you you know
it's like I feel bad I know I got a
couple of girls who send me messages
like they can't set it up or like they
get in this error and I'm like you guys
gotta figure it out it's not even like
sounding like I don't want to sound like
a hoe I'm gonna guys just like here's
the tools if you figure it out guys you
have to go in you see the errors that
you get every computer is gonna be
different
this is no js' there's the beauty of
javascript you might be running an older
version
no Jia that's just how it goes guys like
you have to look online like right now
how to error on my web pack right I come
here I look on the internet I found the
answer as I hate maybe I should you pass
we solve their name and then whatever
right like you have to learn how to
debug you have to learn how to look into
things
like you can't just be like so quick -
quick you did the first part guys like
you know what I mean that's like going
to the army and then somebody tells you
hey you got to put on your uniform
and you go like oh man this too hard I
don't know where the boots at I'm
quitting like how are you gonna go
through the whole training are you gonna
go or you know - two days of non sleep
or you know like how are you gonna make
it through that if you can't even put on
the uniform you know what I mean so guys
don't give up and like I said everything
that I'm doing is optional as far as
like all the stuff that I'm doing is
optional in the starter kit you don't
have to do the starter kit at all like
you don't have to do it now for
something like react or or like my say
like this hyper app you have to use the
starter kit because all of this stuff
needs to get compiled this is done for
you already
a little stuff setting this stuff up
gulp setting up wet pack all of this
stuff if you guys think just running MPM
install it's hard try doing all of this
stuff try setting this whole environment
for you guys like it takes a while like
that's how web development is nowadays
you know um I had somebody hit me up
he's like man I'm not gonna do it or
Adam because I'm used to a tool to do it
through brackets and it's like bro
brackets is discontinued like I hope you
do understand that like brackets got
discontinued a while ago like they're
not doing no more updates there's no or
good packages for it everything is
pretty old so but if you want to use
brackets go
had but at the same time bro is like man
it's like right now if you tell me hey I
want to use vs Coco I use it if you want
to use anything else out there go ahead
use it right Adam is just a text editor
if you want to come in and use notepad
plus plus words and no plus plus or
something like that use that you want to
use vim you could use that tool this is
just text guys this is just text right
here whenever I write something here
this is just the console log this is the
terminal you don't have to use it in in
freaking how you call it in this thing
is Adam at all yeah it's like stop
drowning and like peace and you know and
stop it's like there's a thing that my
mom used to say back in the days man
stop drowning in a cup people are
drowning in a cup of water like how are
you drowning in a cup of water bro like
you gotta you gotta solve your problems
and and just get it done man it's like
I'm being honest guys if you can't get
past this thing like I don't know if
this is for you I'm being honest like
people would be like yo man it's just
it's getting hard setting it up and it's
only I'm telling it's about ten people
who having a hard time and out of those
ten people maybe four are ready to quit
out of literally like 2,000 and
something people are on the website
right now only ten people are having an
issue and out of those ten people maybe
four wants to quit and wants to do
something completely different no
they're like I just want to get a refund
because I just can't set it up and I bro
yes you could get the refund whenever
you want it but you will be here you're
drowning on a cup man like just calm
down relax you're gonna get through this
I understand you want to start coding
right away but you have to set this up
it doesn't matter if it's right now if
it's gonna be two months from now when
you start doing OGS or a month from now
when you start working with JavaScript
frameworks you need to learn how to run
NPM install I can't help
with everything in there man I really
can't because there's certain things
that it's like it's like common sense
it's like you have to start learning how
to debug things man I can't be a
personal technician for you to go to
your house and be like hey guys like you
have an older version of nodejs
hey maybe run MPM the dash G up day or
you know like I can't do it for you you
know what I mean
like I can help you out put that's why
the Internet is there guys like you come
here but like how to install nodejs
on windows look a very easy thing it
shows you right here test it out hey no
no that Jas is already installed all
right how to update no GS download the
Installer that's it like it's not that
hard you know people are having issues
in it's like man I don't know how you
gonna it's like you going so I'm telling
you it's like going to the army you show
up at the army and you're like man
trainings about to begin and then Peter
the person tells you hey man put on your
uniform put on your boots put on your
shirt put on your pants all right not in
that order of course but then the guy
one guy goes like hey man I my shirt is
missing a button I'm about to quit then
I'm gonna look at you like you're crazy
you know and then somebody else comes in
was like I don't know how to tie my
shoes they're gonna look at you like
crazy like bro this the army what do you
expect like you're supposed to learn how
to debug you're supposed to you know hit
the ground and be like yo I know it's
gonna be hard I know there's gotta be
things that are gonna be a curve but you
just don't be like yo listen man I'm
quitting the army I'm going to the Navy
because you know you guys got me on the
ground like what no matter where you go
is still gonna you got still gonna have
to go through the training you know what
I mean so
you know I feel bad I really do feel bad
because it's like you know I know if
people want to do it people want to get
into this but you know it's like
sometimes you know that's why a lot of
developers would be like man this is not
for everybody man it's just not because
it's like you can't give up if there's
like a a puzzle guys when you have you
gotta go step by step right take it from
from me right if you're coming in and
you're installing nodejs okay no J is
installed all right try it out see what
happened if everything goes through NPM
install everything went through okay
that's another check if when you run NPM
run watch gives you an error right if it
goes through i'ma show you right now if
it goes through like let's say all of
this stuff if it shows this you know
like two files change or like let's say
I'm gonna clear this out so MPM run
watch all right let's say from here if
it went through this whole thing right
here with such styles webpack browse the
sync and it says finished browser sync
that means you're fine
everything is fine right now if you're
going through here and it stops
somewhere down here that means it's
something with wet pack right now you
have to look into your computer and be
like hey you know like what version of
node you have what version of web pack
you have you gotta go into your package
JSON look at the things are here figure
out what's the package that's there like
little things like that man like it's
just like I don't know to me it's common
sense cuz I've been doing this for
awhile but at the same time as like I
went through this whole thing when I had
to do it through windows I know it was
hard I've had to you know I've gone to
companies with they're only half windows
and you're forced to use Windows right
but it's like man you have to also
debug things and fire
things on your own like this isn't uh
you know this isn't a thing where I'm
gonna hold your hand through this whole
process I'm supposed to show you how to
code I supposed to show you the tools
that you need right if you have
something on your local environment
which means your computer that's
stopping it you have to figure that out
and figure out how to upgrade something
upgrade a package or upgrade oh anything
right you have to figure that out
you know it's like stop looking for
shortcuts I'm looking for the easiest
things out there web development is not
easy if you're thinking that this thing
is easy and like easy peasy you're like
oh I'm never gonna bump into problems
quit right now anybody who's having
issues right now
on setting up no GS let me know um if
you want a refund I'll give you a refund
you know and you guys can go on your
merry way like I'm being honest because
this is like if you can't pass the most
basic stings like running NPM install if
you can't run through that guys I can't
help you out because I'm showing it to
you and in a very global way we're
literally if you use it in nodejs
in Mac you could using Windows you can
use it in Linux you have to also use
your brain this is a requirement like I
can't put that on on a description like
hey requirement know how to use a
computer requirement know how to use a
text editor requirement having to use
your brain like it's gonna look crazy in
the description if I put that you know
but it's part of the job guys so I wish
nothing but the best
I'm gonna try to get somebody here who's
a Windows user who I was a Windows user
send me an email right now so you could
we could basically create a whole video
for people just to install the NPM
starter kit like the whole web developer
starter kit like to me it sounds crazy
that I have to go out of my way and
create like a whole
like a tutorial on how to do that the
web developer started when this is like
the basics guys like this is like
somebody it's like the same thing like I
told you about the army this is like the
same thing as going to school you go to
school and then you like yeah somebody
tells you hey man you know your pencil
here's a pencil and then the pencil the
end of it the little let it breaks and
then you're gonna oh man the lad broke
and the guy goes like yeah just used her
the sharpen over that now I gotta get up
my seat I'm quitting this school is not
for me I'm out of here like guys you
know what I mean like I'm trying to help
you out man but you gotta help yourself
out too man like you know it's like I
gotta create a video on here's how to
take a pencil you get up from your seat
you go to the sharpener you put it in
take it out make sure you don't put it
in for too long
make sure you take it out and then after
you take it out you look at it look from
every side see if it is sharp enough sit
down go back to your seat right with
your pencil and don't press too hard
that's how it feels guys like this is
like the basics I shouldn't be having to
create a tutorial on how to sharpen a
pencil
like you know what I mean you have to
use your brain I can't tell you hey turn
on the computer go to a like I'm sorry
if I'm sounding like an asshole it's
just like mind blown for me when people
is like hey man I'm quitting because
this is too hard like bro if you think
this is hard you don't know what you're
getting yourself into
anyways man it's your joke coding phrase
calm aka I do this a cait your boy man
I'm here number positive energy but at
the same time guys man like you gotta
know what are you what you're getting
yourself into
like don't jump into this if you don't
know that you're gonna bump into into
roads like you know like there's so many
different things that's gonna happen
like you might you know everything might
be going you know yeah I learned HTML
CSS write this JavaScript guys is real
programming out there
there's like loops there's like things
that you're gonna have to use your brain
there's like nested loops this is gonna
be like stuff that you're gonna have to
be like hmm I'm gonna have to use a
another part of my brain for this and
you can't just be like hey I'm a quick
you just can't you just have to go
through it and learn it and figure it
out guys I don't know how how you guys
want to do this when when you know
unaccompanied
there's a million errors man there's a
million problems like literally every
single day so if you just be like on the
first problem as I hey guys
could you turn on the the server the
server doesn't turn on you oh my god I'm
about to quit because the server cannot
turn on bro you getting kicked out that
company that same moment alright guys so
anyways I love you guys superboy back at
it again : face calm please
a real casted arrow or Matt hit me up um
or any of you guys who are willing to
basically go through the whole process
I'll pay you somehow um we'll figure it
out so like that we could just create
like a whole tutorial on how to do this
on Windows because I really did not know
that people were gonna be just giving up
I don't want nobody to give up because
they can't set up the NPM install like
literally I don't want nobody to give up
because of that so I need your help
you know Windows Masters right guys that
know how to make this thing easy how can
we make this easier than what it is
right for everybody all right
guys send me a message send me a comment
