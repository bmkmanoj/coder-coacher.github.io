can I do this I can't your boy okay I'm
going to teach you CSS the simple way
man the money way that way all right so
let's get it okay
what is CSS CSS it's pretty much you
know your style so like I say you come
to a website like idea all right all of
this is made by CSS you see how this got
colors the size of the font everything
that you see is made by CSS the size of
this images you know anything that you
could look at is basically made with CSS
so how do you basically call CSS it's
very simple so if you haven't downloaded
my website you know what developers
starter kit make sure you download it
there's that project so you start with
this all the projects in order to Tory's
that I teach you start with this so you
could actually be on the same page as me
and then you and you know you don't get
lost okay so let's say an example you
have two ways to write CSS you could
write CSS by doing a style tag and say
hey let's say an example body background
alright see the body's background turn
right right now let's say an example I
want it okay we could actually put it
here pretty much just here or if you
have a file you could put it in
something like that
usually you put it into a folder named
CSS and then main that CSS so let's say
an example I have in public and then you
have a main dot CSS right there right
but for now because we're using sass
just basically it's CSS but just way you
know what extra features right for now
that's all you need to know
but if you're following here you could
write regular CSS here so let's say an
example we wanted to change the
background red or even change a blue we
do it right here so what this does is
you see it changes the page okay all I
did was just basically save the file I
could go in and say hey yellow and
that's it you know what I mean so that's
CSS CSS is just pretty much the styling
well let's say an example I wanted to
create a box let's say box and then
decided say hello alright inside of it I
could just go in there hello background
black border radius 5 pixels now let's
say height 100 pixels width 100 pixels
so what that does is creates a perfect
square
alright so let's see why is there two
squares now we have to expect this
because this could be a bug all right
that's too low
okay there you go all right so now you
have a perfect square but with a little
rounded corners and let's say an example
if I wanted to Center this at the plane
margin zero sorry nice so there you go
so that's a perfect square right there
so that's we'll see you sense this it's
just pretty much it's just styling you
know what I mean
just putting styles into the tag all
right guys so keeping a lookout for the
next video I'm gonna show you how to
target each individual tag by itself by
a very specific way you know what I mean
okay any questions make sure you leave a
comment let me know what it is that
you're feeling about this video if not
it's cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
