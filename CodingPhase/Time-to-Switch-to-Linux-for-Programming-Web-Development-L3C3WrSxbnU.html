at it again man listen today I'm gonna
do something crazy no no I've done this
before kind of let it go
but this time I'm gonna try to stick
with you know what I mean so pretty much
what I'm doing is you know I'm gonna
switch from Windows to Linux right I
hate Windows you guys don't know and I
know about me that I'm straight Mac but
I have this machine I have a twenty five
hundred dollar computer a PC which I
bought it just to play video games and
video editing and I'm like you know what
man I'm about to start making you know
some coding here make some tutorials for
you guys but I don't want to do it
through the windows side so what did i
do I want to go boom - all right we'll
keep calm click download click on that
stop and then I downloaded the app right
download of this CD when you click that
basically you get to download an ISIL
which is somewhere here and put it by
date sort by date all right so it's
right here right
so pretty much I downloaded this right
and then I have this program call VMware
Workstation which basically it lets you
have like another computer inside of
your computer so instead of me having to
go and install Linux inside of my hard
drive I could you say hey I want to have
it virtually all right and that's what I
did that's how I got this it's like I
have another computer here right this is
pretty cool right
yeah so I'm gonna try to do this you
guys are gonna actually look with me and
try to see if I could actually do this
you know because the last time I try
this it was just a headache but I just
don't want to cold with no windows I
feel like Windows and
for losers now I'm playing with you guys
I know a lot of you guys have windows
but I just don't like it I don't know
I'm not going to let it read it so it's
like you guys are actually walking in
with me through this whole journey of
switching from Windows to Linux right I
don't know which one Debian or rpm I
don't know what I mean so it's like okay
let me see real Enix was it at all rpm I
don't even know what searching for all
right okay that data fall let me see
Adam okay so Debian is equal to I guess
hey I'm so crazy I gotta know this stuff
guys
I really don't feels like I'm just like
you guys now I'm like a brand new
developer trying to understand this
Linux cuz I like how Linux is a normal
like it's all nice and pretty and I
think you can move this to the bottom on
the tin
hold on I was like I don't know
I'll do this later but yeah let's see
okay so looks full alright
see ya oh good alright stalling oh my
god this is so annoying
maybe I'll fast for it maybe or maybe
not maybe you guys I'll force you guys
to watch this waiting right well the
thing is tall okay and installed I don't
know how I could bring this up okay okay
that's my files right Ike I should come
here and create pada oh shoot oh
I'm gonna be a busy money
there you go we in the game now all
right how can I bring Adam here you can
make lock to lock lock yeah terminal
blocks illogical there you go all right
let me see
so what I first did guys okay easy okay
I'm gonna go through it so you cool guys
actually see
why's it um basically I search here this
is where you got all your application so
I some King here play terminal right got
the terminal once I came here that's the
root folder so it's like when you see
that little squiggly line that means you
had the root so well then what I did was
pretty much created and kdr and I
created a cold that's why I usually like
to write my code right on the the root
of the computer the whole folder of the
you know whole homepage all right guys
you guys guys who you following me
everything just like my journey - you
know coding Linux all right
so okay what do I do now so I got cold I
got a lotta all right so I'm inside so
let us do this because I'm gonna start
doing a you know Instagram well let me
get out of here Instagram clone which is
that the next project guys well so yeah
I'm gonna build this for you guys and
teach you how to do it
pretty simple right alright so let's get
back into this click here hi
what else do I do now alright yeah
don't I left I left means show me what's
inside of that folder so right now what
we did remember we asked the route from
the Phoebe means change directory right
so when you click a left and show the
auto-5 of the files in the folder that's
inside of it right so as you can see all
these are folders this is that I
guessing is a file so okay you're going
to go into code to see CV code now
you're inside of code you see there's
nothing inside of it but let's make
another one make directory Instagram
close all right so we're gonna see yeah
clicks LS and then shows me that there's
a fall down there so let's go my part
I'm gonna delete it
she had to leave it now I'm going to
recreate it but with a shorter name
because I want to have to write all that
so I'm going to do things to clone all
right all right so CB info click clear
it clears up all of that mess that we
have already cold right all right so now
we're in here now let's get this party
popping okay open a project all right
the project calling phrase called
oh sure
this is what that bad one fat mucho open
another project but inside it up oh
there you go okay
I actually like this it's pretty smooth
my first time actually trying to code
inside of Linux I downloaded Linux e4
and I had difficulties but I guess who
brutal is pretty legit now yeah guys so
that's what I did so got own Linux this
is what I'm going to be coding this
Instagram tutorial for you guys alright
see you in a little bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
