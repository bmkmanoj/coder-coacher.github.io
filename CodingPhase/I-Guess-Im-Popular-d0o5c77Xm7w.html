of the IT department uh I guess you can
call me the super duper senior I'm like
the super duper senior developer in a
company right now which is kind of crazy
because there's something a position and
a role that they not want I like to have
as little as possible of
responsibilities in my life just because
my life is already stressful enough I
have a lot of stuff that I gotta worry
about you know
last thing that I want to be worrying
about is you know hallo hallo you're
gonna see this man only here in the
Rhineland you're gonna see this like
look at a squad look at the squad squad
up this this gooses and
ain't nature my god like they really
think they run the streets you go they
got the squad out here
and then they wonder why they get run
over because they want to be in the
middle of street acting himself guys man

review of everything that i've done
throughout the whole week I don't know
if I should do Sundays or Mondays but
you know whatever today is what Tuesday
Wednesday Tuesday because I didn't work
on Monday consult basically I'm a cool
I won't release the video today so it's
gonna be called this week on coding
phase calm
maybe I'll hit him with it with the
Dragon Ball Z voice this week oh coding
face comm a bunch of bunch of
tutorials man got me man I'm not
supposed to curse in his videos man
every time I curse I get flagged man
this sucks
it's like I can't be myself this really
sucks man
but yeah man Oh like I said today is my
first day being head of IT my head is
already hurting me is really annoying
and I don't like it I don't like
responsibility man I really don't
because I like to code I just don't want
to be responsible for everything like
you know one of my my friends was like
man it's only progression mandus at some
point he was gonna have to you know take
over and I'm like yeah but doesn't mean
that I wanted to do it now you know what
I mean like I didn't want to do this
 man I didn't want to do this right
now right at this moment especially
because the web site has so many bugs I
didn't want to deal with that right now
and it's like all those bugs who has to
fix it
me of course you know I'm gonna be
responsible right now you know what I
mean so that's the whole thing
but yeah
besides dye everything's good man is a
good day I hope you guys have fun you
know there's so many people on the
website it's not even funny
there's so many people on the website
like it's crazy I never thought I would
have this many people on the site man I
told you guys the goal is 10,000 people
man if I wants to get 10,000 people
signed up for the site and I'm not
talking about just signing up paying
users I'm talking about you're signing
up people who just restr register I need
10,000 that's it and I'm good after that
I'm doing this full-time doing YouTube
and and basically all the courses full
time I want to do like there's so many
cool ideas that I have but I don't have
the time since I work all day and then
it's like I wanna like literally I wanna
take money that I have from our savings
open up a studio like a filming studio
where I will go in I don't know either
rent it out to other people to like
other youtubers like have a working
space you know what I mean a place where
we can have the subscribers comfortable
pass by if you live here in New York you
can pass by the studio hang out with me
stuff like that let's see I think I can
make it happen if I get 10,000 people I
can do it
because even though 10,000 people might
register then how much is that if
everybody goes in and puts in I don't
know let's say it's $5 and then that's
five hours and then credit card fees and
teachable dot-com fees that's like three
dollars per person that's how much I
really make you know when I'll tell you
guys like when I put in the final of
specials aren't really making anything
people think like oh man Joe is gonna be
killing it
nah man I'm talking about three dollars
man that doesn't for me to make a
thousand dollars calculate that you know
how many people have to to really sign
up and just to make $1,000 so right so I
really want 10,000 people to sign up you
know and out of those 10,000 people at
least 4,000 to be paying students if I
was to have that then it's a wrap then I
can do this full-time you know I could
come in create content every day get to
rent our studio I will buy even better
cameras better lighting I will have I
want to have like make this like a a
network not just of me I want to have
other developers like I know this other
developers I know that would love to be
doing this but they I got it I will have
to pay them you know what I mean so for
me to pay them and be like okay man for
every video that you make for Android
like listen somebody wants to teach
Android I will have to pay them right so
I will pay them like are like 20 bucks
for every video you know and then I will
have my studio where people come in
record at the studio
a good quality content but at the same
time always be creating new stuff
because one of the problems of like
let's say team treehouse scene treehouse
the quality that they have is great
because they shoot in a studio they make
good quality videos a lot of animations
you know all that stuff is cool but the
problem is that they're they're
constantly behind like when something
comes out that's new in the industry I
right now Brendon framework comes out
they're not I have a tutorial for
another year you know and that's one of
the reasons why I was like man I can't
mess with team treehouse they always
late you know what I mean so what if I
was to make you know videos that would
be relevant at that moment not make
videos I'd be like oh yeah as I create
our HTML CSS course and then forget
about it now it's like I want to
continue making more videos cuz even
even you guys right you guys come in and
take the course but just following one
project it's not gonna get you to become
a master of it you gotta create at least
four four different projects so even
though I do the HTML CSS well of course
one project then in that that same
course I will add another four projects
inside of it and then I will get the the
user or the student so to learn even
more like that's the ideas that I have
man like I'm trying to kill the game I'm
trying to do like something cool do
competitions go to meetups you know
sponsor kids do hike all this
as any moves yeah what's the name of
this I hate what I have something in my
head and I forget about it what's the
name of that thing where when you go to
college and they give you like a grant
oh my god I can't believe about I can't
remember this freaking word oh my god
I'm have to look it up college grants it
is embarrassing I forgot the name or
it's not like financially it's like you
give him grants I forgot the name
I don't know I came to finding Google
but what I would just give out free
money for kids to go to college you know
do they you know
tuition paid the tuition pay for their
books or something you know what I mean
like that's the idea this is guy who is
the second richest black
african-american he's like the second
billionaire Richard billionaire from the
United States he's actually a computer
science major and then he went to I
forgot her I don't know if it was what
was the name of our company you know I
don't know if JP Morgan I don't know one
of those big funds and basically the
guide you became a super multi
billionaire and like he helps out so
many people and gives them grants and
gives them you know free tuition
what is it it's a camera yeah but what's
the fuzz ball four so microphone are you
taping us right now yeah yeah life we
