just straight turkey sandwiches right
like it was a little bit too much man
yeah man I was like for a whole year
people will be like damn choke-o you eat
turkey sandwiches it's like yeah man
that's what I could eat man just reading
what everybody's saying you know when
are you dropping more portfolio reviews
probably dropping one tomorrow today I'm
dropping a new video call missed
opportunities where I talk about how I
miss an opportunity so that's what I'm
doing today um we already dropped the
video for Python so every day at 9
o'clock in the morning a new Python
video is going to be released here on
YouTube
if you guys haven't noticed that's the
trend that's where things are being
scheduled to so every single day 9 a.m.
there's a new Python video listen I
don't know my my channels popping now
man I don't know what's going on I wish
YouTube will give me a little bit more
love but somehow people keep finding me
man you know we keep getting new
subscribers the website is growing
everything is growing you know
everything that needs to be growing its
growing you know what I mean we live in
that good life right now so what up JC
Rodri what up from from Las Vegas
you took never shows when you go online
yeah that's how this man JC Rodri is
like yo thank you for the Python course
listen I'm surprised somebody likes a
right cuz I keep getting like crazy
comments people is like yo it's like
eight man I thought you say you're not
supposed to learn with Python and I'm
like nah that's not what I said
what'd I say you want to become up the
web developer right and you want to find
a job right away the best choices for
you are PHP Ruby on Rails if you want to
become a web developer right Python is
good for what it is right for software
development for machine learning like
it's a very powerful language right but
it all depends on what you want to do
there's people here who are not like me
and you you again what I sound like when
I came into this thing I was like yo I'm
in a rush to get a job I need to get
money I need to do this and that that's
why I started focusing on web
development because the entry-level to
becoming a web developer is so much
easier than anything else right but at
the same time if you are a developer who
been making websites for five ten years
at some point you're gonna get bored you
gotta want to be doing something else
you want to do so software you want to
do phone applications you want to do a
whole bunch of other stuff game
development whatever it is right so you
always want to challenge yourself if you
feel like you stuck somewhere doing the
same thing then you're gonna continue
growing with something else so that's
why I created the Python courses because
people wanting right for a whole year
people were telling me Joe please do
some Python do some Python I've been
like nah I want to focus on doing all
the things that people need to get jobs
right now right so all those videos are
already done right I did all the courses
for PHP I did the courses for moving
rails I'm doing more stuff on that right
of course I always tell you guys to
JavaScript or react of course but at the
same time it's like I already did those
videos like I can't come in and keep on
doing the same
HP videos and doing the same JavaScript
videos like I have to come in and create
something new cause if not I'll be bored
oops
I'll be bored with YouTube you get what
I'm saying like I have to do something
that I'm challenging and I feel like I'm
having fun with it you know because I
don't want this channel to just be like
oh just me beating down on people's
heads like hey man this is what you need
to get a job some people just don't care
let's be honest some people are out here
like hey man if they listen to me they
would they would have had jobs right now
right but there's so many people out
here that is just like they just love to
code they here for the love of code you
get what I'm saying
that's why they here in song yeah
so it's like at the same time I got to
create content for them you know Chris
Sean without without we got Chris Sean
in here
Shawn right now I was having his
breakfast right now man right now he's
in the West Coast right now what Thomas
is like four hours behind so I was like
8 o'clock in the morning or 9 o'clock in
the morning over there in LA you know
Jack's at says more react counter for
the website will be awesome
yes man go check it out go go check out
the new course that I have there which
I'm currently building I'm doing it
right now I'm gonna show you guys
exactly what I'm talking about
so it's like for those of you guys that
enjoy react like I have a react project
that I'm building right now with you
guys like we have imma show you right
now give me a second show you how many
videos we already do
it's called learn react by building a
Craigslist clone okay so we have in the
curriculum right now
we probably have like four hours of
content already you know so I'm gonna
share this with you guys so we have two
introduction we got setting up a small
node.js server we have building the
website out of the images out of the
design it's a pretty modern design for
Craigslist and we're using all the
latest things from CSS meaning we're
using CSS grids we're using Flex boxes
so pretty much everything that you need
you know you using react you using react
router like everything that you would
need to get you started and get you
hired is there right so if you already
took the react course which is like a
beginners course right it's like a quick
introduction to wait like this is the
perfect project to continue after all
right if you go to the timeline if you
haven't gone to the timeline guys and
you want to figure it out how long is
gonna find it's gonna take you guys for
actually becoming a developer how long
it's gonna take you to learn all this
stuff
go to the website guys literally it's
right there coding phrase calm you come
to the site you click on timeline oh by
the way whenever you hear that sound
that means that was a new subscriber we
popping out here okay so so you got the
timeline right then from there you click
on front end let's say you only want to
do 20 hours per week then it tells you
exactly how many days is gonna take you
to actually finish every single project
right and you use this as a checklist
alright so you could come here and say
okay I completed this completed this
completed this and as you click on
complete it tells you how many days how
many hours are still left for you see
total I was left to study 51 44 or 42
jQuery I'm checking into JavaScript
plead it yes six if you keep scrolling
down oops
keep scrolling now you gotta build a
restaurant web app what else react
JavaScript quick and easy learn react by
building a Craigslist clone and there
you go that's just a front-end all right
if you wanted to do how to do back in
then you will click on back and do the
same thing click Next and you'll see
Adam text editor learn PHP Ruby Ruby on
Rails and alright you want to become a
full stack which means you know both of
them you know the front end and the back
end it will tell you how many days is
gonna take you 21 well 29 days which is
like 30 days and then usually people
will spend like an average of five days
per week actually studying so then every
day you will spend about four hours and
that's like 20 hours per week which is
what you were saying and then it will
tell you how many hours you have left to
study 118 hours all right now like I
always tell people once you you finish
studying and you finish learning how to
code that doesn't mean you your job is
done right now you have another month to
build a solid portfolio meaning you
gotta come in and build all of your you
know all of the projects that you need
right cuz yeah you could come in and say
hey I'm gonna go in and take all the
projects that I did while learning how
to code and put it to your portfolio
yeah you could do that but you're not
challenging yourself you're not testing
to see if you really know how to do this
things right if you really know how to
build this web applications online right
because the last thing that you want to
do is hey show up to a company and
somehow you get hired and when you're in
there you're like oh shoot I don't
know what to do like I gotta go on my
YouTube videos I gotta go my guru I mean
you could Google stuff but you never
want to be in that situation where
you're like oh my god I don't know what
to do you know what I'm saying like you
want to be able to to know everything
you know so just because you took the
course doesn't mean that you know how to
code it you have to test yourself on the
second month so if it takes you a month
to build to go over all the courses give
yourself another month to come in and
build one project per week a full
application per week right so anything
that that takes you you know two hours
to build should never be on your
portfolio that means that thing is not
worth it because anybody could do that
it's not gonna show you you know show
that you're a really good developer to a
future employer is just gonna show like
oh this person know how to build a
little you know a little plugging a
little thingy
you know people come in and try to put
up here's the JavaScript clock it's like
nobody cares about that right like
nobody's hiring you to build JavaScript
clocks at all right nobody cares that
you could come in and say hey I'm gonna
connect to this API and I'm gonna show
you all the posters from Star Wars right
like nobody cares about that you could
connect to a the movie DVD API right
like nobody cares about that you gotta
build a full application around they say
okay I connected to the IMDB database I
pulled up the poster I'm able to have
users signing up for the website they
get to put it into their own their own
sections to save the images they get to
come and create a new new stuff like you
know it's like a whole process I mean so
yeah man so don't put a JavaScript
JavaScript clock on on your portfolio
man nobody cares about that that's just
being honest man but yeah man any
questions you guys might have asked me
anything
isn't full effect so you could ask me
whatever you want
we here on the lunch break man lunch
breaks this for me hanging out with you
guys me just chill him with you guys you
know enjoying our day see what I'm gonna
build for the rest of the day you know
she was was a kneel on Cody face calm
she was going on in the industry
so yeah men
you
so let me see I'm reading I'm reading
reading reading the comments
hello which react project from your site
should i do first
listen start from the first one which is
react quick and easy and definitely I do
the new one that I'm building right now
let's call learn learn react by building
a Craigslist clone do that one
I will also recommend doing the hyper
app and the restaurant web application
like do both of those because everything
that you learned on that one you're
gonna be able to use on your react
course alright and then it actually
teaches you like how react works even
better than anything anything else like
I don't know how to explain it but it
just it really works like you know you
understand how to pass down props how to
pass down functions and it's like it
just works
alright let me see what else I'm reading
your advice on learning PHP for junior
developers has been very helpful
between very spot-on yes if you're a
junior developer like you need to have
that on your back pocket right like PHP
is like it's like how you call it it's
like a swiss knife it's like you have
that in your back pocket for any
situation right somebody's gonna come to
you and say hey we need you to build us
a quick application
you know PHP build it for them
somebody's gonna come up to you but oh
we have a WordPress website and can you
come in and maybe build a little small
plugin yeah I haven't teach you
WordPress but because you know PHP you
could look at the documentation of
WordPress and now built a plugin for
them because your understand PHP right
you don't know the WordPress framework
right or the CMS but you do know the
language the PHP language which is
actually better a lot of people start
with WordPress and don't even know PHP
so many people get get hired as
WordPress developers and they don't even
understand everything about PHP they
don't understand classes
object-oriented programming they don't
want to stand under that stuff right and
people get hired so why wouldn't you get
hired somebody that knows PHP and
actually could be very productive in a
company you go what I say so definitely
check it out Joe after completing the
social media project do you think I can
start applying for jobs or should I get
more projects together you can start
applying for jobs at any moment that you
feel you're you're comfortable right if
you feel like hey I could give you a
design and you could build that then
you're ready that means you're you're
ready to get hired at some type of
entry-level position right there's a lot
of jobs that they just want somebody to
help out with a little bit of the pages
like let's say they have a senior
developer who really knows his stuff
right but he don't have time to go in
there and build all the static pages
that's a perfect job for you because you
know how to do that you know what I'm
saying so it's like you gotta start
applying and see which jobs take you no
matter what right now if you want to
come in super prepare finish all of the
courses give yourself a month right to
finish everything and then from there
apply for jobs and be like okay cool I
know everything that I need for you know
what develop me anything that people
gotta throw at me you're gonna know all
right and one last thing that I want to
finish after after I do this new
Craigslist clone application that I'm
building with you guys on the website
I'm gonna do an e-commerce site a full
ecommerce site right I don't know if I'm
gonna do it with PHP or I'm gonna do it
with no js' cuz people been asking me
hey fin it can you come back and bring
back up and nodejs
course so what I'm gonna do is I'm not
gonna do the same node.js that we did
before which was a portfolio what I'm
doing is something completely different
but we're gonna learn it with Adonis GS
because I feel like as a junior
developer you need a structure you can't
go in there and try to learn everything
about nodejs just you
Express because it's like if you're a
junior developer you don't understand
how HTTP works web development works
going into nodejs is like it's like
somebody telling you okay
he are like he is a screwdriver here's a
here's a knob and here's like a computer
build us a website it's like there's a
million ways you can do a website with
no js' and express right so it's like
which way is the right way right when
you're a junior developer you should you
should now be focusing on that you spent
so much time on like oh should I use
fetch
should I use Axios should I use this and
- should I use this library should I use
a body parcel should I use the new bar
body parcel should I use a cone should I
use a freaking Express should I use er
beasts should I use V or is a ejs or
something like that or the template your
own template language for nodejs
should I use J's should I use a
nunchucks like you get what I say like
there's so many different things there's
like too many options as a junior
developer is like wait teach me the
programming side teach me the web
development side I don't need to come in
here and learn 50,000 libraries right
and that's the problem with nodejs so
it's like if I'm gonna teach no js'
again what I'm gonna do is put a
structure to for people to be able to
understand this right and I'm gonna give
a big warning in the beginning it's like
hey man I'm not responsible to get you
to install nodejs on your computer if
you cannot get through this part that's
out of my hand there's so many people
send me messages like yo oh could you
walk me through how to install no js'
I'm like there's a video on that you say
put still not working I'm like okay but
I cannot do everything for you right
like you got to learn how to debug your
own computer you got to learn how to go
in there and solve problems cuz when you
go to a company they're not gonna be
somebody in there who's like Oh
there you go no subscriber nobody's
gonna be in there like you know holding
your hand they expect you to find the
answers like you're a developer
developer portal quote is also like IT
right when they give you a problem
you're supposed to find the answer right
not you asking somebody else like oh how
do you install nodejs it's like I need
no J yes for this but I don't know how
to install it because on my Windows
computer it says this isn't that is I
bro I can't hold your hand to every
single part of of the process maybe
because it's like I like I could show
you in a general way where 80% of the
people are gonna find the answer right
away right it's gonna work for 80% of
you guys but if you have a weird Windows
computer if you have a old version of I
don't know of Java installed in your
computer if you don't have Python 2 or
Python 3 installed on your computer and
for some reason it doesn't want to
install no G yes I'm not responsible for
that right so it's like that's one of
the things where I'm like yo man I want
to help people out but that's why I kind
of stayed away from nodejs cuz like
people have so much issues to install it
please make PHP tutorials for beginners
please Akbar is on my website if you go
to my website is all there it's called
PHP seven and lerigot so it has
everything
so let me see what else I'm reading
everything
John Hay says just finish your HTML CSS
course like Terrell are going to dive
into them next course tonight I'm glad
that you enjoy it man
trust me look the beginning of web
development is as easy as kind of boring
but when you start getting to JavaScript
once you start getting to PHP once you
start getting to Ruby that's when you're
gonna be like oh shoot like this is fun
like this is interesting because it's
like it's like if you like building
puzzles and like you find you like
finding the the problems or solutions to
problems and you like finding like that
last piece of the puzzle and you're like
okay you put it in and you know you like
the complete image you got that that
exciting feeling inside of you then
you're gonna love web development trust
me like this is just the beginning you
just HTML CSS there's so much other cool
stuff like that you're gonna learn so I
just continue
you
my question is what language should I
choose I am in a dilemma PHP or node I
just don't know I appreciate your
opinion
look this is KR CK boy he asks me that
all right listen I'm gonna be honest
with you no J yes a lot of times it's
for the people who say oh I already know
JavaScript so since I know JavaScript
this is all I need so I'm gonna try to
build everything in JavaScript and it's
like more difficult in way than what it
is right then what it needs to be
there's a lot of options there's a lot
of libraries there's a lot of different
ways of doing the same thing right every
single instructor is gonna teach you
know J is completely different than the
next person
right so for me I don't think that
nodejs is the best way to start with
right you gotta start with with
something that is pretty much like
everybody agreed upon like hey this is
how we code this how we build things and
that's it right with no J yes to me I
feel like it's more for somebody who's
more experienced right people try to get
into nodejs at first and then they
realized number one they can't find a
job because the jobs that are out there
they're looking for somebody who knows
really a lot of JavaScript right and if
you just started it's gotta be hard for
you to get that job
now with PHP it's easy and there's a lot
of jobs right and at the same time you
can learn it you can learn in like in
less than a week and be productive and
basically build everything that you need
to build you got our saying without
having to deal like oh should I choose
this library should I use this thing
should I use this other thing it's like
nah just stick with PHP at first and
then as you continue your growth
definitely jump to know J yes
but that's my opinion right that's
another than to like somebody some oh
your opinion you say this but people in
chorus say that people are ready sadism
listen that guy's this is my opinion
from me just being honest with you guys
right this is just me being real with
you guys
all right most of the developers out
there that you see on Korra you see
already even here on YouTube everybody
chooses things for what they like right
I could easily be like hey guys I want
every single one of you guys to focus on
crystal Lang even though there's no jobs
right because that's my favorite
language right everybody's gonna be like
oh yo but there's no jobs for crystal
Lang and it's like nobody stuff though
you know the programming language of the
future just the one that you need to do
and it's like that's my opinion
right that's what people do online when
I come in and I give you an advice it's
more of like hey guys I'm I've been in
your position of learning things on my
own everything that I'm telling you I've
learned from my mistakes right I've
learned from learning and focusing just
on JavaScript and just on nodejs even
when no J's was just like basically beta
nobody was using it I was focusing just
on no Jes right before I even focus on
PHP
so it's like that actually stopped me
from getting jobs that I could have been
doing in the backend right cuz I didn't
know PHP I didn't know other languages
right so I'm telling you guys from
experience as a social developer as
somebody who's not being biased to any
language to any platform to any
framework I'm just telling you what it
is right as a junior developer right a
lot of times guys come in and but oh
that isn't that it it's like their
journey is completely different right
somebody who is a computer science major
electrical engineering major his journey
is completely different than yours yours
is learning online yours is learning on
udemy yours is learning geocode aphasic
are yours is learning on team treehouse
wherever the hell you go right your
journeys complete
be different than somebody who is like
oh I went to freakin this University his
journey was completely different than
yours his advice is not gonna work for
you you get what I'm saying so now do
you want to listen to me
the guy that went through everything
that you're going through or do you want
to listen to some random guy on Quora
calm
who's telling you some stuff where he's
like oh he his journey is completely
different than yours it's up to you
right so yeah
so let me see what else Joe look like
I'm reading people with John Hayes
project Fox online it's at the beginning
of building the social now so that's
what's up and you just started
Oh me I just subscribe like five minutes
ago after watching the three months
bootcamp video just wants to
say thank you for saving us money Real
Talk listen guys that's all I'm here for
and trying to save you guys money and
then you know cuz I'm telling you all
the stuff you can learn it online like
even if you decide okay Joe you're cool
I love your advice I love everything
that you do but I want to learn for
somebody else that's great but do it
online like if you want to become a web
developer like the resources that are
online you can't even imagine like you
can't put down on a scale right like a
lot of times you're gonna be more
advanced than somebody who's graduating
from school I mean when I was going to
my school right I was like so advanced
because I was learning at home
then everybody in the school like no lie
like now on like nah like Java and stuff
like that I was talking about the web
like I was doing like advanced stuff
advanced CSS I was creating amazing
layouts stuff that was blowing people
out to boxing in my school and everybody
what they were doing is like oh here's
an HTML tag here's the link tag here's
the meta tag and as I bro like you can
learn this thing in like literally in
one minute you know what I mean like
there was times like I will be I never
forget this I was an HTML 101 right in
my high school right and the teacher was
teaching the the boilerplate of HTML for
a freaking week for three days we have
for three days she broke down the head
tag right he took a one whole day to
just talk about the head tag right took
her another whole day to talk about the
body tag took her another whole day to
talk about divs and h1 and h2 h3 h4 h5
h6 right so cut three days to just talk
about those little things raining
those three days every course every
class was actually an hour and a half
and I'm like this is ridiculous because
I learned all of this stuff online and
literally in one video of ten minutes
right but that's how they teach in
school you know the process of
stretching something that they could
teach you in one class they stretch it
for six months right so it's like
learning online is so much better
because you could focus on on one
specific subject like right now let's
say you want it to be calm I don't know
3d artists right if you go to school to
become a 3d artist you gotta take a
whole bunch of extra classes that have
nothing to do with 3d artists right
before 3d rendering whatever right it
has nothing to do with like you know you
have advanced English classes advanced
freaking math I mean math you need it
but um maybe math philosophy psychology
a whole bunch of that you don't
need but because you learned online you
bypass all that stuff and you just focus
on those things that you need to learn
right and it just makes your life so
much easier so that's the same thing for
here for you guys becoming what
developers like going to school or going
to anywhere else like I'm not trying to
here you know trying to rape you guys
I'm not trying to charge you guys like
crazy like everything that I do is just
like bare minimum I say it's better for
me to have 50,000 members of coding
face.com at let's say
five $10 all right per month right then
me say I'm going to build Google Ads
Facebook Ads
I'm gonna promote this on on XYZ groups
on XYZ Channel and I'm going to
basically coming here and sell to five
people each course for $1000 it doesn't
make sense you get on sailing but that's
the the model that a lot of people have
on here they wanna come in here and say
hey all of this stuff here you're gonna
get a hundred thousand dollar job which
can be possible right but if you need
the job as soon as possible is like and
you don't have no money where you gonna
find a thousand dollars to pay for a
course where you gonna find five hundred
dollars to pay for a course right
there's people out there that don't even
have a laptop and they taking gnomes to
go pay for a course for five hundred
dollars which makes no sense to me it's
like you don't even have a laptop i buy
yourself a laptop and spend $10 on udemy
like use your brain you get what I'm
saying like sometimes people think
because something is cheap there's no
quality in it I'm seeing a lot of
people's courses and I'm taking a lot of
stuff you know what's the difference
between my courses in other people's
courses a lot of people come in they put
a lot of charts they put a lot of slides
they put a lot of things that are
already in the documentation right all
of my courses they're not supposed to be
super long they're supposed to be
straight to the point I don't want
nobody to come to my website oh cool
we're gonna go through three hours of
theory three hours of slides of
explaining this right here this line
right here is the name of the function
this right here is the keyword function
this right here is a parentheses this
right here is the argument now you don't
need that you just look at it you say
okay this is the function this is a
variable this is to how we write a
function and this is where we put the
argument that's a
your brain is smart enough to understand
that and pick it up and be able to keep
it moving and start building things some
of us don't have to luxury till you stay
in a course and be like oh I'm gonna
spray for hours of looking at slides
that's the only difference between my
courses in everybody else's course I
don't push slides right I come in I
teach you guys with projects I teach you
guys with real things that's gonna
happen in real life and somebody's gonna
actually hey or Johnny could you build
me application with react and we also
need the application to be able to press
back so when the user press back he
comes in and he gets to see all of his
things they're the only way he's gonna
be able to do that is by using react
react router and some redux right so
it's like those are the things that I
teach you I come in I teach a real life
experience real life projects that you
would use at any company or any or any
job that you go to without the BS of a
million slides a million explanation of
on things that you could have freaking
thought of searching that yourself on
the documentation you go what I'm saying
like you don't need somebody to come in
and read you the documentation at all
you don't need that you need somebody
that comes in and breaks down things
start difficult break it down easy for
you to understand it that's what you're
paying for
you're not paying for somebody to read
you the documentation you gonna say so
yeah
you
let me see so what else reading people's
things
so yeah Alex Duran thank you for
subscribing thank you for signing up I'm
just here to try to help you guys out
man I'm here to do what somebody should
have been there for me right somebody
should have been on the Internet I don't
care who would have been somebody should
have been on the internet explaining
these things easy with a real life added
to real life situations and explaining
it just in a normal way like we speak in
English language out there and we just
speaking regularly right like why do we
need to talk like hi guys this right
here is a function like I just speak to
me like I'm talking to you like a
regular dude you know but some people
they like that they they think some
people they think if a course is
expensive it means that it's good if
somebody's talking to you like a robot
that means that he's articulate he's
he's explaining very good and if you
have a British accent if you have a
British accent you're the most perfect
instructor out there so it's like people
are kind of dumb it's all about facades
right like they don't understand that
you're actually wasting time and paying
for something that is mediocre you know
but that's how it is
um let me see what else I'm reading Joe
appreciate your website any chance more
materials being self-employed developer
self-employed developer let me see I
don't understand that question
maybe you rephrase a and re put it
online
let me see Andrew Warwick is like yo I'm
listening to Joe driving home finally
got the notification yes sir man some
house sometimes Google wants to be nice
you know
so let me see what else
have you ever you have you ever heard
PHP brunner I don't think so
what I've questioned about learning to
work we'll see it says would it be wise
to start learning with reset or
normalizing should I learn how to deal
with default CSS and overwrite them now
you should definitely use a reset man
like don't try to reinvent the wheel
guys like everybody uses our CSS reset
every single framework that you see out
there bootstrap Bomont IO like every
company has a CSS reset just used to CSS
reset all it does it just takes away all
of the default styling from all the HTML
tags so take it off used to CSS reset
and I say don't try to rewrite you all
CSS reset is like there's no need I was
like you're you reinventing the wheels
like now
Kelvin Davis like yojo dropping gems
over here hit that like you're my man so
sauce word man give me some likes man
show me sorry man
pretty Martinez like yo damn you took
them me dirty today we see through a lot
of schools waste time unnecessary
classes yes Oliver see I went to
university and I want to learn oh no I
went to university and what I learned
for years could have done with a year
learning a lot pay for the piece of
paper yes sir me too if I wouldn't know
a lot of stuff like look my first degree
sense and my associate says programming
and systems right that took me two years
to do that whole associate's degree I
couldn't learn all the things that I
learned in that school in LaGuardia
Community College the worst school in
New York City pretty much I could have
learned that and literally six months
the whole two years six months
but that's how it is that's how they get
you
let me see thanks prizes online feel
struggling with it is he answering
questions in the chat yes sir that's
what I'm doing
let me see hey Joe longtime viewer I'm
having trouble finding one guy know one
of your videos talking about digital
Nomad guy it should be there which one
you will you're talking about cuz I mean
this I used to talk about what's the
guy's name level style and then there's
Johnny ft if you want to know more about
those guys like check that check it out
search online levels that IO and then
Johnny
ft he's like one of those people that
you could definitely let me see if I can
find for you you could definitely learn
a lot if you're looking to become
become
you
if you're looking to become like how you
call this like a drop shipper or you
know just work from home work online
like check him out Johnny ft for sure
let me see what else I'm reading the the
message is the comments on the chat room
ah let me see
about whether we should put the projects
we learned on entry-level portfolio when
starting to apply for jobs look let's
say you are my website right you're
learning at first you're not gonna have
projects right you're not gonna have
projects that you could say okay I built
this project from scratch and this isn't
that so
add the projects that you getting from
my website to your portfolio
okay now you add those projects to your
portfolio but then once you build your
real projects then you remove those
projects at the newest ones that you've
created you get what I'm saying like you
gotta have something on your portfolio
you still even when you're a beginner
you still want to have something that's
why I tell people even though they have
like little clocks and little B S on
their portfolio when they first start I
tell them okay this is not that bad but
in reality you should have projects in
there not just like a little clock a
JavaScript plaque or whatever you want
to have real projects so what I tell
people is while you still building stuff
with what you're still learning have
something there but you know at some
point you got to understand you cannot
be a professional with a clock on on
your website
oh use a JavaScript clock no I mean like
you're a professional you want to look
like the big-time man you want to look
like the guys who are getting a hundred
thousand two hundred thousand dollars
right you want to look like those guys
even though you've never worked in a day
in your life as a developer but you want
to put that that that image out there so
you want to come in and create cool
projects and then show it off
Michael Ben which one of your courses
related to ecommerce Jo
Curley because like I said a long time
ago I haven't focused on e-commerce even
though ecommerce is very important
extremely important to be honest with
you guys I haven't added ecommerce
because I have to grow the audience
right all of these people that are here
they're like really beginners a lot of
them right so they don't even know HTML
CSS or JavaScript so I have to teach
them that right before we will start
building ecommerce sites or even more
complicated things I have to create
those courses and those videos first
right to knock it out because most
people are beginners right now by the
end of this year we're gonna be advanced
right all of the beginner courses are
gonna be completely done I'm washing my
hands from beginner courses everything's
gonna be completely done for anybody
from now to the future if they need
beginner courses all the beginner
courses are gonna be done right by the
end of the summer I should be done with
everything and then from there on all
the more advanced courses are gonna be
coming in meaning you more ecommerce
sites working with electron working with
react native right the reason why I
haven't jumped to react native is
because people are still excuse me
people are still not 100% comfortable
what's react so I have to build like two
three projects that they build and react
and then they become super comfortable
with it right I don't want people to
keep jumping to something else if
they're not comfortable with what
they're learning first you know what I'm
saying so everything on my website is
related to of course that was there
previously right the whole website
itself is going to be in a way where you
take one course you take the next course
and then the next course that's below it
has all the same things that you learned
on the last three pervious courses right
so like that every time that you take a
new course all you're doing is real
reinforcing what you already learned and
at the same time learning a new subject
like learn by building a real react
Craigslist clone the new website that
I'm doing right now a new application
that we're building is really going over
all the things that you already learned
every act quick and easy all the things
that you already learned in the the real
estate app right and then from there now
introduces you to using react router
okay so we basically is like going over
everything that we already learned but
building different projects you know
every project becomes a little bit more
advanced more difficult more complex so
it's like every time that you go into
the next level you learning everything
that you learned from before but without
having to have the the instructions like
let's say when I did the react course
the first one quick and easy I'm going
over every single thing about react he
is the props he is how you past the
props he is this this and that
right there from there we jump to
working with the with the real estate
app right this is how you work with
forms this how you coming filter data
that's how react changes depending on
the data right so we did that now on the
Craigslist clone I'm not explaining how
to come in and work with forms I'm just
building it I'm I'm coming in and
building it with you it's like okay this
we're doing a form that I are we do it
right I'm not explaining how props get
passed down to the components because we
already did that right every course is
expecting that you already know this
thing's right it's already it's like a
requirement so take one course you need
to have the requirements will be HTML
CSS sass gulp like all those things are
requirements to take the next course you
get what I'm saying so
ecommerce is gonna come probably how no
maybe like a month or two I have to
knock out all the things that I need to
do for for people to continue learning
and becoming professionals first and
that's it so let me see I'm reading what
else straight to have no developer life
logs thanks Joe
I'm reading reading reading reading
magical Kabbani I don't even know what
magical kobani asked let me see
so I guess magical kobani asks the
question but I don't know what was the
question let me see it doesn't say I
can't find him magical kobani
it doesn't say anything let me see okay
so there's a question that magical
Kabaddi or bikuni or something like that
white people don't why don't you guys
have regular names like James Smurf or
or you know Johnny banks or something I
don't know
magical but Connie or something like
come on man's mad difficult to say okay
so he says what is better to get a job
quicker focus just on front-end or
back-end or focus on mastery or learn
learn both and both of them so you can
apply for more jobs you have more
technologies on your resume all right
you want to focus on front-end right you
want to focus on the front-end that's
always gonna be the first thing that's
gonna open the doors for you okay now
after you already know the front-end and
somebody gives you a design and you
could build anything you want to be able
to know one framework it doesn't matter
what it is if has react or angular one
of those two those two frameworks are
the ones that you need to focus on I
will say they react because of react
opens doors to more things but you
should also know the basics of angular
and it's the same thing for angular if
you want to focus just on angular know
the basics of react okay and then from
there you know just continue and your
first year your easiest way to to get
into the industry is gonna be through
the front end right now your second year
you want to be able to say hey I know
the back end like the back of my hand so
the whole first year what you are a
front-end developer you should also
learn the backend because every company
has a back end right at some point
somebody's gonna say oh man
Johnny's not here today damn the back
end developers not here so we don't know
how how to work with the database if you
come out of nowhere and say hey guys
I'm a funny guy I know how to work with
my sequel people's gonna be like he
knows my sequel he's valuable to the
company you get what I'm saying so it's
like that's how it is it's like you want
to be able to know the front end to get
your job right away and know the back
end some of the back end you don't have
to be an expert but some of the back in
it and understand how the backend works
right I will say focus more on the front
end right and then from there do at
least one of the courses either PHP or
do Ruby so you who at least understand
how the backend works right and there
from there just you who apply for
back-end developer jobs you know
Hey Joe I have 24 hours of cold what
project from your site do you suggest I
should do Ramsay Jordan well Ramsay
Jordan what I will say is you have to
find the one that you're up to right if
you know HTML CSS and you know
JavaScript okay keep moving until you
find whatever you don't know right I
don't tell people to come in and try to
learn every single course on the website
if you already know HTML CSS there's no
need for you to take the first course
which is the social media site you don't
need that you want to keep on learning
the things that you don't know you're
gonna say there's people that come in
and like they know JavaScript already so
it's like okay you know JavaScript so
focus on Gope learn gulp so you could
build your own starter k then learn es6
then learn react like you know keep
going like that
what do you think of up work as a place
to find work I mean up work is cool but
you know so much competition everybody
in the world has an up work freakin
profile it's like you're dealing with
the whole world the best way I will say
is try to look for remote jobs finding
like little jobs like online it could be
cool but I don't think it's profitable
for somebody in the United States now if
you live in freaking in Dominican
Republic you live in the Philippines you
live in and I don't know Thailand or
whatever you are right you can go to up
working and find a job that pays you $10
$15 an hour that's way more money than
you will make in your country right so
it makes sense but for u.s. citizen u.s.
resident somebody who's here legally
pretty much it's not worth it
so what Dada says that's the goal
cutting face what tips would you give to
a do like me I'm pretty good at Java and
seek who understand the basics of HTML
CSS and JavaScript how do you get real
experience um I will say man you already
know a lot of stuff if you're
comfortable with Java and sequel that
means you pretty much know the backend
so what I will say learn PHP and
clarabel or Ruby on Rails depending on
what's closer to you like let's say in
your area what type of jobs are there
there's more PHP jobs focus on PHP
because it seems like you already know
more the backend side of things and then
I will say definitely learn react okay
yes Kelvin Davis you hear that people
free ground by the end of the year we're
gonna be working on advanced projects
that's gonna be dope means we are no
longer journey developers we can get
those mid-level jobs yes that's one
thing that people don't understand to
like even though you might not be
working at a company for a year two
years right your first year your second
year even if you was - I don't recommend
this for people but if you are a junior
developer and you get hired a company
and you continue coming to my website I
will say continue learning learn
everything that's there continue
continue with the subscription because
everything that you're gonna see at your
job you're gonna be getting here at the
website - plus more advanced things as
we continue to grow on the channel and
on the website right once I knock out
all the basic stuff then we start
getting to more to the mid-level things
right after we've done with the mid
level things we jump to the advanced
courses right because it's like we have
to build things in progress right so I
had to take my time to build all the
beginner courses and then from there
you're gonna get more advanced things
all right and this is great because it's
like once you finish the beginner
courses all the courses are on my
website our beginner levels right
basically you could get a job with that
right away right now if you want to get
to the mid-level let's say you already
got hired and there's a mistake that I
saw the other day from somebody who was
a member to the website right he was a
member to the website he got hired and
then he sent me emails Oh Joe I
appreciate everything I'm gonna cancel
or the the membership said cool
canceling
it's fine you you're a member until you
want to be a member right but one
mistake that he did was he got hired as
a junior front-end developer to help out
with HTML CSS hey hey a couple of HTML
CSS pages and then he realizes like oh
now they want me to do react
right so he stopped he stopped learning
and this is the mistake that I tell
people this is gonna happen to a lot of
you guys right you guys think like soon
as you come in you learn your stuff you
get your first job and you know I
learned guys your company is gonna
continue throwing things at you that
you've never seen before so he was there
he cancelled like two months ago I think
he like November around there and he was
like oh they want me to work on or react
and they want me to do this single page
happen it's like I've never done it and
this and that I'm nervous I wanted to
say to him like bro I don't know why you
emailing me like you get what I'm saying
like you said you basically say oh I got
my I got my my knowledge that I needed
from the website I'm gone we've never
seen him in a chat room we've never seen
him on on the message board so we never
seen him here on the live chat right I
wanted to tell like it deep down inside
of me the hood out of me I wanted to do
like bro you just basically soon as you
got your job you disappeared right why
are you hitting me up that's how I felt
inside right he disappeared but now that
he needs certain skills now he wants to
come back I was like ask me questions
about it like oh they want me to do this
for react and this and that can you help
me out and as I bro this is exactly what
I tell people this is exactly what I
tell people when you get a job it
doesn't mean your learning stops it
means that hey you got your job now you
could continue learning as you're
getting paid you get what I'm saying so
for me I was like man I don't know what
is going to send me up you cancel your
membership you and I don't mind if you
cancel your membership well stay in the
community because it's like if I don't
know you why are you asking me questions
why are you sending me emails you get
what I'm saying like like if you're not
a part of the community you disappear
soon as you got a job you disappeared
you never came back to say hi to nobody
you never came back to the live shows
you never came back to anything but now
because you need the advice and you need
to
extra help and you need like oh you know
you need to learn react and you're like
oh what should I use now you want me to
help you out and what did I do
I help them out because that's how I am
I can't I can't keep things in but I
help them out
so I told them I'm like yo listen just
take the react course my react router um
on this Craigslist come Crescent zap and
yo son you're watching this right now
don't get mad but that's how I felt at
it cuz I'm like yo people do this all
the time they get a job like right now
you can finish the HTML CSS course you
send the email of recruiters might get
you into a company and all they need was
just for you to edit some pages and some
emails you get hired if you decided to
say hey I'm just not gonna continue
learning and I'm I think I'm done like
that's on you you get what I'm saying
don't come to me later on like oh I
forgot oh wow
like I actually needed to learn react I
actually needed to learn PHP I actually
needed to learn this yes you dummy
like this is exactly what I've been
telling you for months
you gotta say like that's why I was like
you freakin do it like you're not part
of the community you know what say like
you know this people out here who will
send me emails and I don't even get to
answer the emails and they're part of
the community 24/7 day active so I was
like you left you disappear you got your
job now you're good and you think like
three four months later like I'm gonna
answer your you think even though I'm
gonna answer it nobody no matter what
but it's like grand audacity of people
like like yo this is like yo this boy
Joe felt that day future where yeah
cause it's like I'm trying to help
people out but it's like they don't help
themselves out you gotta say like you go
cash for the membership because do
whatever you want but stay part of the
community if you still want me to
continue guiding you and helping you out
this is like there's people here who
will deserve to get help down in and
deserve getting you know getting advice
this times that people flood my emails
or my email or inbox with a bunch of
emails and it's like I've never seen you
in the community I've never seen you
leave a comment I've never seen you you
know drop a message be on the live
videos you know it's like sometimes you
it's like come on don't try to game the
system and like you know I mean like I
just know I don't know I just felt some
type of way that day cuz I was like man
like I told you months ago you're gonna
need all of this stuff and it's like now
that you've realized you need it now
you're coming back like oh could you
help me I was like nah bro I told you
you need this you're not a master of
this thing just because you learn CSS
like there's so much other stuff that
you're gonna need for your job you get
what I'm saying so I was like yo this is
kind of ridiculous but that's how it is
man and that's an advice for all of you
guys guys continue learning great don't
stop just because you got a job doesn't
mean that's that's the end of it
you gotta continue learning I mean you
got to continue learning things you know
to me it really does burn my blood like
I'm like yo I can't stand when people be
like oh I haven't learned anything in
like a year like wait what like what are
you doing like you do you understand
that this industry if you don't continue
learning you're left behind and then you
look dumb in front of people like the
worst feeling that you could get is feel
dumb in front of people like I actually
like feeling dumb when I have a lot of
smart people around me but I don't like
looking ignorant right that's the worst
feeling ever
you don't want to be in a place where
somebody comes in it's like right now
one of those developers that they've
been stuck in Java world right they've
been like in the Java world or the
dotnet world for like 10 years straight
and they don't look at anything else
outside anyway I've been on that net
developer for 10 years and that's what I
do and that's what I need to do and then
when somebody comes in and is a bunch of
developers right oh yeah have you heard
that new react framework it's pretty
cool and then you start looking like you
want to become a super small super
little because you don't understand what
the hell are you talking about
right like that happens to people
so there's like you know for for people
that come in listen you can do whatever
you want but don't come to me
months later if you're still not part of
the community because this is not I just
don't like it when people I feel like
this is the thing to and this is how I
felt too with the whole thing with with
Matt and everybody else you know the
rogue squad like I I freaking show man
love to man I really respected that KLI
you know and I was like hurt because of
it because I was like yo I show love
towards kids and all this stuff man I
put time like I could be chillin I could
be outside
I could be freakin strip club right now
it could be freaking chilling with wifey
I could be with my boys playing
basketball I could go do whatever the
hell I want
but what do I do I come in it asks our
emails how people our and you know try
to guide them the right way and then
with the whole thing with him I was like
man this is dumb like I felt like once
he once he felt like he was comfortable
at a certain point like hey I know HTML
CSS in JavaScript I know no then I don't
know all this stuff is like no now I
know more than you and it's like bro no
you don't like you you still have a lot
more to learn you know I feel like
people feel like that after a while they
like okay I got what I needed and I
disappear and then they realize that
they didn't get everything that they
needed then they come back and they're
like oh Joe could you help me out with
this Oh joke are you could you give me
advice and distance like bro I haven't
seen you like four months you haven't
