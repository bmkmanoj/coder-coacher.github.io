I'm trying now to see if this thing
works we're trying to go live in this
new product that I found online which is
called restreamed that I owe and
technically what it does it basically it
makes my stream in all the different
places right so basically sends me to
twitch sends me to Facebook it sends me
to the whole shebang right everything
that I have so let's see if it actually
works okay I actually want to try this
out you know what I mean so yes sir
coding faces in here let's see how it is
man
all right so is it seems like it's
working I just check on twitch
I just checked so I guess we lit we lit
right now so we lit right now we we
basically every everywhere right now you
know supposedly I can actually stream to
30 different websites at the same time
so I'm gonna try that out I'm gonna sign
up to every single website out there
that you could actually stream live and
yeah we we going global kids you know
all over the world man so yeah man were
Dre so what's good how's your weekend
going guys which you guys is up to what
you guys is working on let me know do we
need a portfolio to apply software
engineer position instead of what
development position I will say yeah you
still need a portfolio or something
right a lot of times from what I hear
from different software engineers that I
know it's a little bit different for
them sometimes they they care more about
how you doing the interview so most
likely you will get more technical
questions and to see how comfortable you
are but for web development this is the
reason why I will still people I focus
on your portfolio because in web
development they really care about what
you have done you know they care more
about what you have done now if you
could actually ace the interview you
know I mean so that's why I say what the
runtime is way easier to get into now
also to if you wanted to get into like
game development or even whatever so far
in development right you wanna have a
couple of projects that you can actually
show for right so having a website that
you can show screenshots or videos of
your software that you've created trust
me is gonna help you right it's not
gonna hurt you it's actually gonna be
way better for you okay so let me see
what else any other questions man
let me know let me know man we live we
live photo all over the world we on
Twitch we on on YouTube will Facebook I
think we on I wish I know how to
livestream to Instagram so matter of
fact I could just do it with my phone I
could just say hey man we live right now
let's do it right now I need to get used
to like really like letting people know
in social media like yo I'm life I'm
doing this and that cuz I usually just
if I wake up in a good mood or I'm doing
something I'm like okay you know what
I'm gonna just go live right but I
should technically I'm trying to get to
a level that's more professional this
year you know having things in order
having things where I could tell people
like hey we gonna go live from this date
from this time so this time but the
problem is that I'm so spontaneous and
and I love the fact that I could just
pick up my phone or I could just pick up
my laptop and I can say hey I'm live the
whole world could see me right let's
hang out right I love that power I love
to be able to do that man but that's
like the only problem that I have where
I'm like man some people they they like
to have things or schedules right now
everybody cuz you know they get into
notifications because technically I know
if we will so let everybody know you
will see this livestream like at least
500 people right but it's like number
one they don't get those notifications
number two I don't let nobody know when
I'm going live I just go live so it's
like only like the true fans really get
to find out because they're constantly
either on YouTube or they constantly you
know seeing what I'm up to you know so I
really appreciate it so yeah man I've
got a go live I'm gonna put this right
here so let's put it right there there

that's wondering like Oh what is Joe

things that I'm doing this weekend right
I'm also answering emails whatever
emails you guys sent me today I checked
there's really no emails so I guess you
guys don't want to you know
and no answers this weekend
ya know so I'm just like you know I'm
here I'm telling I'm taking my day off
you know relaxing weeing hearing I'm
gonna start the Deaf kid chorus in the
dashboard course that's what's up man
have you performed badly at any
interviews yes plenty of times all the
time you know like this is the thing
number one I'm not like the perfect
interview like developer for interviews
I'll be honest that's why I focus so
much of my portfolio so much of my
projects and all that stuff because a
lot of times when I've been to like
let's say my very first interview was at
tumblr right when I went to tumblr
pretty much I bombed that because there
was like so many things I I didn't know
now that I didn't know but I just didn't
know the name you know cuz there's a lot
of time too that you might learn stuff
on your own and this is the thing that I
tell you guys too you might learn
something online by yourself and you
know how to do it right well somebody
might come in with a technical word for
it and you just like uh what what did
you call it but you know how to do it
but you just don't know that word I mean
for me it was it was so dumb I was like
my first you know first eight months of
whatever and I was like nervous I'm like
I'm a tumblr I'm at this and I'm like oh
man there's a big company freaking Yahoo
owns in this and I'm like oh man so I
was like nervous and then whatever one
of the questions the guy was talking to
me about JavaScript methods and I don't
know why I went blank and I was like I
was like I don't even know man like it
was my first into y'all just like blank
number one oh I didn't even like study
or anything I know a lot of people that
when they go to they like they get their
their mind or like going to interviews
what they do is they go over interview
questions that go over a whole bunch of
stuff me I never look at any questions
or look at anything I just show up I'll
be like okay cool this is what I
do this what I know this this is what
I've done in that's a I've never studied
anything because I feel like if I study
something then I'm I'm trying to you
know prepare myself to this interview
and it's like now I just want to be
there by myself and be myself cuz if now
I'm gonna be nervous oh god I gotta
remember this I gotta remember this
algorithm I gotta remember this other
thing is like not me you know some
people that works for them and for me it
just doesn't work I just you know but
yeah everybody has had bad interviews I
mean the past four years I haven't had a
like a bad interview I have bad
interviews where I'm like I definitely
do not want to work here
but I've never been like oh I messed up
because I don't go to companies that I
don't feel comfortable with you know
what I mean I don't know like I do a lot
of research before I even apply to a
company like I want to find out what
type of testings they do I want to find
out what's their stack I wanted to find
out basically everything about the
company so by the time I'm there I'm
basically interviewing two interviewer
you get what I'm saying like I'm not
going in there like randomly like oh
it's like oh man I'm showing up I'm I'm
nervous like now that's only the first
year after that you know how to play the
game you go in there comfortable if you
know the company you know what the stack
is you know everything that they're
gonna throw at you by the time you get
there you're like okay this is just a
regular conversation I mean the last bad
interview I had was a few months ago I
don't know if you guys remember somebody
has sent me emails like man actually one
of my friends is like listen man I know
you you just left your other company but
can you check out this other company
that's very close to you and they need
like a react developer and they'll pay
you whatever you want I'll say okay
whatever so it was close to my house and
I actually had Bing under on on the
building I don't know if you guys
remember when I did the JavaScript group
in Long Island they actually hosted the
the meetup right so I had already been
to that that building so
I go there and they were pretty cool
they the guys who were who interviewed
me through the phone was like he was
like super nice and wanted me to work
there so bad but then there was
something then we had another interview
which was him and two other guys one was
the CTO and one was the CEO so me and
the CTO were cool but then me and the
CEO he just number one there was things
that were off
number one he never looked at me in the
face right like he came in and he had
like this attitude like I can't deal
with people like that
now you gotta look at me in the eyes
like if you talk to me talk to me in the
eyes show me that that respect because a
lot of this CEOs this owners business
owners they think like I'm a millionaire
I'm you know I'm the business owner and
and this is my workers and I don't even
wanna look at nobody into I cuz it's
like I don't care they're just workers
like nah bro like you show me my respect
if now I'm gonna curse you out right but
I mean I didn't take it to that level
but I was just like whatever we did we
did the whole interview and the guy was
never he never looked at me in the eyes
and that was already a red flag for me
that's like you don't have respect for
me
right so why am i doing here and then he
was like going like looking at the paper
like the whole time he's like this
looking at my resume oh this is great
you seem like a great candidate but
never looking at me at all it's just
looking at the paper oh I see that you
do a little freelancing and I'm like
yeah once in a while I feel like doing
some freelancing for a friend or
something like that I'll do it but then
he said something's all his face turned
like his face literally turned into a
asshole like literally just what the
whole borrowing everything
well you know we usually like our
developers to just focus on our work
here because you know mine you're not
even looking at me in the eyes because
you know sometimes we just we want the
developers to go home and rest you know
get some rest and come back burn you on
Mondays and I'm like yeah but you know
developers go home and they do personal
projects and they do other stuff you
know I was like everybody does die yeah
but as part of the the culture of the
company to actually have you know
developers go home addressing we usually
don't like them to to work on anything
as I grown like seriously like the hood
out of me wanted to come out and just be
like ah you know I was like it's like
one of those episodes from like was this
guy's name Dave Chappelle when when
being real goes wrong when being too
real goes wrong like that was one of
those moments that it was about to get
real I was about I felt like I wanted to
slap the out of him because I was
like bro like everybody goes home if
you're a good developer goes home and
works on personal projects what I do
after 5:00 p.m.
mind your business dude so I told her
what I said you know in my white voice
you know you guys never hurt my white
voice this is what I called my white
voice I said sure listen I appreciate it
you know you guys are pretty great and
you know there was this guy I think his
name was David he's like David thank you
for the opportunity for letting me you
know coming in for the interview but
personally I don't think there you know
I would really be a good culture fit for
this company because I actually
appreciate what I do on my side and you
know it's like for me to not do what I
do on the side it's like me giving away
$100,000 to the air I mean if you guys
were to really pay me that much you know
if you say hey Joe we got two hundred
$250,000 for you then
I would definitely now quit everything I
just work specifically from here right
and that's when the CEO looked at me in
the eyes because in his head he thought
I was just some some little random
developer is like yes master master do
you want me to be in the house master do
you want me to go to the fields master
do you want me to be here for you master
you don't want me to touch the computer
when I get home master I won't touch a
computer master whenever you want master
cuz your paycheck
I live from that I pay my family from
that please master whatever you want
hire me bro I go in there like my dude I
make already the same money that you're
gonna pay me here this money is the
extra money for me whatever I do on the
side that's my real money whatever I do
at a company that's extra money you know
what I mean I'm not coming in there like
messed up you know I tell you guys all
the time this for main reason you never
want to be in a situation where you need
a company you're a developer you got a
skill you can make this thing make money
for you you know I was like I'm not
gonna be in the fields like please
master coded for youth from nine o'clock
so eight o'clock oh and don't another
thing that he said that was a complete
red flags I you know we usually have
developers come with come in on weekends
or Saturdays when when we have a
deadline bro I don't care if you have a
deadline through NASA I don't care if
you have a deadline through Google
listen I'm not coming in on a Saturday
you could keep that to yourself you get
what I'm saying like you're not paying
me enough for that you know so I was
just like I told I told her to I was
like yo white voice right you know me
you what's you in the job you switch up
you like this insert um you know I
really appreciated David that you you
know you wanted me to come in come in to
work but I really I don't think that
we're gonna be you know I'm the right
guy for this situation I don't think I'm
a culture fit for this company and so be
honest I think you know you guys could
probably find somebody else and like I
said you know I can't
lose out on over $100,000 that I make on
my own so you just say hey I'm just
gonna you know come in and sign a
contract cuz doesn't nothing they wanted
to sign a contract we use you like we
usually have spheal sign a contract bro
who's the developer who's the idiot that
goes into a company and signs a contract
that they can't work on anything besides
whatever they do at that company you
have to be a idiot
you know I was watching this um this
interview about Monique right this is a
controversy about Monique going to
Netflix and this and that right and I
thought it was stupid cuz I was like
she's an old Amy Schumer getting five
hundred dollars getting not like 13
million dollars and she's a legend and
she wanted to get 13 million dollars to
and I was like Monique nobody have heard
of you in a long time so it's like
nobody cares about their Ann is like you
want people to boycott Netflix and this
and that
so I watched that thing right but then
worked in that we didn't know and that
she explained in the interview was that
Netflix wanted her to basically do the
uh the live show for five hundred
thousand dollars and did not work not do
no movies not do any life comedy shows
not use the material or material
anywhere for the next two years
you got no sound like so she probably
makes like two three million dollars a
year and you want her to get powned
barrels for this contract for 500,000
like anybody will be mad so that's
exactly what they were trying to do to
me you know what I'm saying
they were trying to just say okay you're
making this much but here's this little
bit of money here's just $100,000
$120,000 maximum right but we want you
to be bound to our company as I bro keep
that I make that with my eyes closed on
my own right if I go to a company that's
extra money that I'm putting in this
only time that I go to a company is if
I'm I'm thirsty right if I'm being
thirsty I'm okay I'm making money out
here and I'm like oh but wouldn't it be
great if I could just make another
80,000 or another hundred thousand
be great right but it's not because I
need it it's more of like hey it's like
the icing on the cake is like you have a
cake here and somebody tells you hey man
for the same thing that you're gonna be
doing in your house we're gonna pay you
another hundred thousand dollars who
would I want to do that right but it's
not because I need it so it's like nah
man I ain't going to that job you get
what I'm saying you know what I say so
it's like this companies you gotta be
careful too man but yeah guys listen
