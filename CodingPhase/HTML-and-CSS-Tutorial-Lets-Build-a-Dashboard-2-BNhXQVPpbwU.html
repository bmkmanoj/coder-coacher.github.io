again coding phase calm your boys
backing out and did it again listen guys
this tutorial is brought to you by
coding phase calm
it's my website where I basically share
all my skills over the years of
experience of becoming a pretty
well-known developer out here you know I
do what I do and I do it good guys if
you haven't signed up to my website
check it out coding phase calm listen
the cheapest courses they are out there
I basically break down difficult
subjects into something like that you
could just eat in one little bite right
and you can understand it okay so come
over here let's start this up so what
we're gonna do now is basically we're
going to do the header this header
section alright we're gonna do this
pretty quick and let's do it now alright
so first thing we want to do is we want
to come here now we have the side well
side menu right that section we're going
to also come here and we're going to say
something like this we're going to say
header okay Hatter
so we're basically building the header
which is going to pop up right here
alright now the first thing that we want
to do is look at the image what we have
here we have a search icon we have four
10s s-type for search which is an input
field and then we have a couple of other
links here okay
so let's do that now okay we're gonna
say start it up so first of all we're
gonna say here I'm gonna make a div
and what we're going to do is we're
gonna play I'm just gonna write it down
for now you're gonna say icon I'm gonna
say input okay input type text then
what's the other thing we're gonna have
another section inside of it which is
div div all right so what we doing is
basically breaking this thing into two
pieces that piece there and this piece
here
all right now so we got a link href plus
add okay plus add we got the bell which
is gonna be icon bell and then inside of
the bell we're going to have another
thing call a span the span is going to
be that little circle that little number
that's in there so let's say 3/4 now you
got a link now which is gonna be an icon
and we have to spam let me just put it a
con because just for the hell of it
then we have another thing which is H
ref which is gonna be another link right
so this link is going to have is going
to have a circle so
div class user image okay
user image and right next to the user
image it's like I think is an arrow down
let me open this up yes arrow down okay
I don't know I think they used to call
it carrot a carrot down or something
like that
let me see arrow down let me just write
icon that's what we're gonna put just
the icon so let's close this anchor tag
so that's it that's the HTML for the
header pretty simple we have this here
which is an icon input field and then
here we have another section which is
just a link a little link for
notifications and a link for the users
profile okay now let's build that with
CSS well before that let's get the icons
first so we need the search box and the
bell so let's do come back here to font
awesome icons gonna say search copy this
here save okay now now that we just did
this here FA search let's do another one
which is going to be just care it down
or arrow or let me sit down this one
carrot
okay so put that here and the other icon
and now we are oh wait we missing the
belt almost forgot
okay Belle I don't remember is a filled
in or not look at the image it's not
filled in so we get this one okay take
this here paste it there okay so this
what we have so far this to HTML guys we
have a header and inside of the header
we have two sections we have one is
gonna be a search field another one
that's going to be a profile area or
user area so let's put the class right
now so we're gonna say oops class let's
say search alright class search and here
we're going to say this one we're going
to name it class user user field
I guess user on the school field so
alright user field put like that what a
dash is we're writing down all classes
like that
what if i underscore okay so let's see
what's in here let's save that on you're
probably asking why it's not showing
well it's probably over here hitting
below this so what we're going to do is
we're gonna come here to the main dot
CSS let's come down here and basically
say header let's work on the CSS guys
just the fun part we're gonna say Hatter
I'm gonna say
something like padding-left I'm gonna
say 200 was the whiff of this thing 280
pixels
okay cool
and why do we put 280 pixels because
this right here it's taking 280 pixels
of space all right
so because it's taking 280 pixels of
space we want to push this header which
is showing up here below it we want to
push it at 280 pixels right now first of
all we could do even a margin left which
is actually better for us so we put
margin left on the header so like that
now we can actually come here and
putting padding we can say padding let's
say 20 pixels and then let's see how
it's only pixels look okay oops so 20
pixels look like that now once we do
that let's see what else we want to do
to this we want to say something like
this we want to separate into two
sections
we got the class search and class user
field so let's create those two classes
I say search let me do this and we put
this search area or yeah that's for a
search area and this a user area in
search area makes more sense
okay search area and then we're gonna
say F a for the search area we're gonna
put a color of
gray dark okay now for the header we
want to make sure that the background is
white okay background ass white okay
now inside of the search area we want to
make this this field here we want to say
input and let's be specific just for the
hell of it even though we don't have to
because there's only one input field
there but input type text let's say
input type text and we're gonna say
background:transparent okay we're gonna
say border:none okay so now we don't
have no border and we're going to see
font size let's say - rim actually how
big is that it's a little bit baked I
don't know if we wanted that big
obviously how big how big do I think
that thing is let's see one room that's
a little bit too small so let's say 1.3
rims
yeah that's about right for now right
okay so that's fine we keep it like that
okay let's see
color let's say green neon and let's see
padding say 10 pixels also let's say
font weight let's put that 100 so it
could be a little skinny font alright
yeah that's fine for now
okay now let's leave this along and
let's start working on our user area and
we're gonna say display:inline-block
also - let's do that for for the search
area so we say display:inline-block now
okay let me see look at the HTML okay
let's make this padding a little bit
smaller than that let me see something
okay for now we're just gonna say user
area we're gonna float it to the right
make sure this this is going to be a
little bit tricky because every time
that we save the little pop-up is gonna
show up right there so okay let me see
if I could turn that off browser sync
no notification let me see if I could
turn that off without turn that thing
off so I say notify okay let's go into
here I see an hour gulp let me see I
think I can just come here and say like
that and put notify Falls save that now
let me see something
let's stop this here control see here
and put MPM run watch one more time okay
let's see if it worked yes it worked so
every time we we do a change it does
it's not gonna be seeing the
notification here because that's really
annoying okay cool now what we want to
do here is we want to say plus add we
have that we want to give ourselves some
padding for this area let me say padding
say 10 pixels this is just for now until
we figure out what's the sizes that we
want for this thing so okay
now it's out of this we're going to see
anchor links we're going to make them
display:block display:inline-block
display:inline block and we're going to
do a little something to this we're
gonna say margin right let's say 10
pixels are even padding right it's 1 2
pixels okay all right cool
now what we have here is we have a area
domain we have a area where we have the
ad so put this like that okay ad plus
let's do something like this I say
text-decoration:none so we could take
off that little underline all right now
for this we're going to say something
like this we're going to say say let's
put a clasp to the span you're gonna say
circle all right so we're gonna say
inside of this we're going to say circle
we're gonna make display:inline-block
now for the area where we have to bail
we're going to give this a class of
notification defecation so let's do like
this let's put an N and say notification
all right and put the circle inside of
it okay now we're gonna say notification
position:relative and the circle we're
gonna say background red we're gonna say
wave ten pixels height ten pixels
oh my god ten pixels let's make this a
little bit bigger so let's say 15 pixels
okay we're gonna say border radius so
you can see watch the magic happen right
here okay loops border radius we must
say 50% save that alright we're going to
say font size let's say 8 pixels and
we're gonna say font size 8 pixels what
else we want to do to this thing say
color white let's make this to 12 pixels
all right now
let's say text-align:center see now we
got the little number there kids
now the next thing that we want to do is
we want to position and we're gonna say
position absolute okay now we're gonna
say top 10 pixels when I frag let's do
30 pixels oops it's negative negative 10
pixels and we're going to say right 5
pixels okay let me see maybe left left 5
pixels now let's bring this down a
little bit say 5 pixels okay now can we
make this a little bit smaller how can
we make this little bit smaller say 10
pixels can't ever see it's that good
like this the ultimate schemes guys
let's make this a little bit smaller so
10 Sam soul over to small for my taste
there you go
now that my friends is good all right
now let's see something like this just
look at the image no let's move this a
little bit more so seven pixels to the
left that's fine that's good you don't
need nothing else after that a little
bit more down there you go
so you got the little three right there
kids and that's how you make things go
guys this how you make a little
notification it's not that hard man now
one thing that we're missing is the
circle for the user so user image we got
to create another class so inside of the
anchor line and anchor link we got a
user image area all right so what we're
gonna do is we're gonna say hey
fullscreen I hate writing this down so
what I do is I always copy you from this
word this website and I'm telling you
right now this website that's why it's
number one kiss thousands of developers
copy the same thing nobody likes to type
this so what people do is they just copy
and paste it all right
so it's not like we can't do it it's
just we don't want to you know what I
mean like I'm lazy kids all right so
let's say you eye faces
so you I face is calm let's take this
guy seems like a good candidate go back
let's take this image
okay let's paste it right here okay now
what we gonna say is we say wave let's
say wave 20 pixels height its YT pixels
okay cool now we're gonna say this play
inline-block let's say 30 pixels so we
can make it a little bit bigger
okay now that we have that we're gonna
say here something like border-radius
to make it a circle 50% okay now let's
see okay one thing that we want to do is
for all the anchor links I'm gonna say
vertical-align:top okay
see maybe I should make all of these a
little bit bigger obviously what's the
size of this 22 by 22 so let's say
that's like 20 pixels so when I say all
in notification let's say all the anchor
links let's say height of 20 pixels my
why is this image bigger it's 30 pixels
that's why so height 30 pixels let me
see a vertical line of course we can do
this wave flexbox there's somebody out
there say you can do this with flat but
the Flex boxes yeah but if you do a flex
boxes in reality in your beginner you're
not really learning anything guys like
there's so many good tricks with CSS
that in reality if you don't get to
learn it it's a shame you know that's
the truth guys okay so let me see we got
to make that icon bigger man that's the
problem that F a where's the F a user
okay circle notification font size let's
say 20 pixels
okay let me see now sometimes you got to
find a trick skit okay so let's see what
we got through to this I'm gonna say
notification padding padding top 10
pixels 5 pixels you see that's a little
bit better now for this top you know say
3 pixels here okay there you go
now we got those things aligned now
what's the next thing that we're gonna
do we're gonna do this ad plus so we're
gonna say something like this we're
gonna give this a class of class add
class of ad so you'll see and if it has
the class of add let's say the font size
it's when you pixels let me see how it
looks it's a little bit too big okay
font weight 300 now say 500 for now
bring this down so we're gonna give this
top let's see five pixels from now hey
just to see 10 pixels oops
padding padding top all right so we got
that now one last thing that we're
missing is this this f8 that we have
here so we want to bring that up okay
and guys yes I gotta tell you guys you
can do a lot of this stuff easier with
flex boxes yes but the point of this is
not to make it easier is to pretty much
get you super comfortable with CSS like
I'm super comfortable I can do this in
Flex boxes I can do this in anything but
I prefer to do it like this because it
just is a challenge you know I mean like
you're coming in here and doing things
the way that God meant it to be you know
like this is just like how can I say oh
use an image hello because we're missing
what's the name of this okay so let's
put in FP - carrot down if a carrot down
and then
we're going to see position:relative and
we're going to say top zero alright for
now
I'm gonna say negative ten pixels you're
going to say negative eight pixels all
right
negative eight pixels and we're gonna
give ourselves some space here so on
this we're gonna say margin-right five
pictures 10 pixels okay cool
now the colors of this things should be
let's see for the font for this thing
we're gonna say color grey dark or for
now he's just putting a regular number
and yeah there you go
now this we're going to say is 50% of
the screen so we're gonna come here
let's get this input Yesi on hover when
we hover above this we want the
background to be something like
three light okay now we want this to be
wave 50% okay
50% okay so 50% now the search area
you'll see with 50% of the screen okay
and we're going to put in a transition
to give it a little animation transition
of let's see it all so basically all of
it let's say 0.5 he's in and out okay
Ally let's put on this cuz problem is
when you put transparent that's not
really showing a cool animation for it
let me see
80% okay
there should be 100% okay that's a
little bit so much 80% is fine all right
cool now I forgot
so take the new boarder input oh I don't
know if it's active I forgot it's active
or forgot the name of it our focus is
not really active it's outlined data so
copy this because it's really really
annoying so let's put this here at the
bottom so text area focus outline remove
it
please all right so it looks like that
okay let me see also - Lucy C background
let's put in grey light let me see what
else
let me see gray light input active let
me see something
Oh hovers like that all right I think
that's fine for now
we got everything as far as like the
header like we good for now we can come
back and finish this and make it even
better but I think we forty minutes in
kids so so we good all right I'll see
you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
