joke make sure you subscribe okay let's
continue with this so right now only
half is this my first HTML page right so
we're gonna create a top menu right a
header so let's say this header and in
the header
you're gonna create something let's see
get inspired by somebody something
similar you know choosing a design a lot
of times it's better to have a design or
you know either designing yourself we'll
have somebody designing for you or just
sometimes just to be honest which is
just taking ideas from other people and
seeing seeing what they got you see like
I like this I liked how you know how
clean your lugs so let's say an example
we take this I'm gonna put this into the
projects and the projects we're gonna
create your folder call image IMG short
for image alright so now we have access
to that image whenever we want to see it
okay so we're gonna create something
like this right okay
so first we're gonna create the header
which is this which is a logo to the
left menu on the right and there from
there you have a large image and then
from there you keep you know boxes of
whatever projects you've created and
then at the bottom of the footer will
create something else right so alright
let's get back to this let's go your
header right
okay so we had let's say I D Globo
that's a little for that right just copy
this to just call this all right when I
pull this top now just not in here we're
gonna say and about that is come out
- what taste
and then I'll say trash talk so now
let's see what we got you got a logo we
got the links okay so now let's see what
else we have to do it I still eat the
stuff this is annoying me okay so now
you have that right now let's go ahead
let's guess something called a CSS reset
which is top of this whole cold
now let's create another folder call CSS
and in here we're gonna create a file
called very sexy a sex drive that gonna
reset that CSS and this pace or we got
from here copy and let's paste it here
what this is going to do it's going to
make the page you see how we got this
padding here in the spaces every browser
is totally different so what you want to
do is create a reset so with that reason
what it does it removes all the padding
and all the spaces that each browser has
so now you start from like a clean
canvas you know without no styles that
does you know the browser is already
giving you so this helps you out start
fresh
so let's go now let's go and actually
put this into the page so we go blank
H ref CSS / reset that CSS
surely doctors then CSS sometimes I
forget the staff is truffle annoying so
so we take this and say okay
so now we remove that that pattern that
the browser was already given okay so
what we did here we just added the CSS
just a reset right okay guys I'll see
you in a little bit make sure you
subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
