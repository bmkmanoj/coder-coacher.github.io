next is actually do a check we'll check
that if this did that got clicked
doesn't matter which one is this dish
that I clicked that has the class album
right
I have a class album if this does not
have the class selected we're going to
add it all right so now what we're going
to do is we're going to come here and go
do this I'm going to believe this I'm
going to say if this contains class list
right this that class list contains all
right contain selected and then we're
going to say not equal to true so
console.log don't have it save this and
then run okay so I'm going to check if
this whatever container we click on has
the class selected its supposed to say
don't have it so let's see what happens
sometimes this thing be acting up I
don't know why that I'm running multiple
times
okay so don't have it all right
so that's fine that's exactly what we
want it because as you can see this
doesn't have the class selected now
let's see if we added that we came here
and we say economy wasn't symmetric the
safe is running multiple times to make
sure all right
when we click there it doesn't do
anything but if we click here it says I
don't have it and that's because we
don't have to class select it on that
dish see because it has selected it
doesn't actually do anything okay so
what we're doing here say if this class
is contains select it and it's not equal
to true they run this else console.log
yes have it okay save this run this one
this okay now let's see what it says yes
I have it don't have it all right so
what we're going to do is we're going to
actually add the class select it to the
dish whenever we click it well first of
all let's remove it from everywhere else
okay save that let's go back to the j/s
okay so if this class contains unlikely
and it not equals to true then add the
class to it so one say this that class
list that I and let's see selected okay
you're gonna take this copy it we're
gonna put it down here
you know I believe this now I believe
that now what we're going to do here say
to remove so I hope you guys want to
stand what we're doing save this so what
this thing is is this dish doesn't
contain the class selected right if it
doesn't contain that then add the class
selected to that element now if it did
see true this was true that it does have
it it's going to go to the next one
which is remove to selected so let's see
what happens sorry madam safe this one
okay good there we click it it removes
it so because they don't have it added
it and because they have it removed so
when you click it alright alright cool
so we got that now another thing that we
want to do now is actually remember this
array that we have here we're going to
push that information to that we're
gonna say something like this we're
gonna say album select it will say that
push and then when I say album title
right so what we're doing is we're
actually adding the title to the album
select it but let's see what it says
let's run this I'll just select a and
let's put it to the console lock so save
this now let's run it okay when we come
here click there sorry
click that again it's fine save this run
run a couple of times I don't know why
this thing be acting up
all right so let's see why I was
selected is not actually going to just
constant long sorry you've got to put
this inside of here run this a couple of
times
all right well click here see comments
drop off I click it again college
dropout we click it again
college dropout so you got added two
times that's not what we really want see
it keeps adding it so what we want to do
is we want to remove the duplicates we
want to remove the duplicates from album
selected so we're going to do is I'm
going to say albums selected equals so
I'll gonna select it dot filter right
and then here we want to say function
I'm going to say item all right and then
here when I say return return and we'll
do something like this let us say item I
don't right I don't not equal to album
title all right so let's say I see if
that any one happens here of that save
this everyone run it one more time make
sure it goes through so console.log
college dropout click it again I removed
it right so removed it inmate I will
select it into empty MBA right so what
it did was just it took this one so that
was already there so since we remove
selected it also removed college dropout
from the array
all right so now we basically got what
we wanted now we don't have no
duplicates and it should just all be
original one so I say see the reason
come home we kind of drop our blueprint
alright and we come here over moves just
a college dropout
the reason come home me blueprint C so
let's go over this one more time and the
reason why I'm doing this is because a
lot of you guys need this you need to
know exactly what's going on every time
that we do in your video so remember we
did a while loop right so we looked over
every single element here alright and
then that's what we have two albums the
I and then the ultimate what we did was
we created a function this function that
we running right here is added to every
single element on the page every single
DIF that has the class album all right
and then from there we'll be there we
say hey if this this element has
selected great if we have selected I'm
going to run this if it doesn't have
selected is going to add selected to it
and then from there is going to push the
title to an array that we have out here
now from there we basically move on down
to this we're basically saying hey if it
does have selected remove selected from
it as you can see here remove selected
from it right and then the array up here
that still has the blueprint title right
we got a filter to it when I say I will
select it right there's the new value
for it so the new value for is going to
say I will select the top filter so
we're filtering through that array and
we basically say hey give me every item
that's on side
this array except album title so it goes
through every single item let's say we
want to have all of them right let's say
we have although the moment I click on
college dropout is gonna say ok give me
everything is that kind of strapped up
because this the one that we don't want
so when we do let it remove selected
from it and they also removed it from
the array all right so it's pretty
simple guys is I know raw JavaScript
another JavaScript me it could get a
little confusing for some people but
this is just basically just for you guys
to understand what's going on behind the
scenes and 99% of the time you're not
going to be doing this you're most
likely going to be using a framework
like jQuery or framework like and your
few react so you won't be having to do
all this work but this is good because
you could actually see what's behind the
scenes hey guys it's important jump back
at it again guys this is video letting
you saw is actually part of my course
future proof JavaScript listen guys
you're gonna learn JavaScript the right
way the money wait the easy way the way
that you're going to understand it I
know you tried to treehouse I know you
try you - yeah and I'm making it easy
for anybody who wants to get better with
JavaScript or people who are just
starting from scratch right so you have
to cause here man check it out you will
not only go from coding phase calm but
you will go directly from the link
that's on my description which will give
you a 50% off automatically for the
personal original price okay and if you
really really smart with it you would
actually do but all-access pass right
for $10 right that's what I would do it
for ten dollars get access to all the
courses you can't go wrong guys all
right so I'll see you guys around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
