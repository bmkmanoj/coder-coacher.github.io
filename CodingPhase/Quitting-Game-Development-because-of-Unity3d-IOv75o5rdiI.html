it again man coding face calm listen um
I just wanted to talk about this because
pretty much I've tried to get into game
development like three to four times I
think this is my fourth time that I'm
trying to get into this there's the
first time I buy a course from you to me
and I'm like man I'm gonna do it I don't
want to start making some games I'm
gonna get into this thing I'm gonna go
all out and once again I have to quit
life because I just realized I'm like
the reason why I'm always quitting on
this it's not because I can't do it it's
the fact that you know I have to not
only are basically cold but at the same
time also have to learn a new program if
you guys haven't never you know had the
chance to check out unity unity 3d right
the program itself is very complex it
has so many different windows so many
different things is like it's like I
don't know how to explain it's like
freaking Photoshop on steroids
right yeah man
and like for real I just I don't know
man like I love coding but I don't like
learning new programs it's like now I
gotta learn like all these
options there's so much into this
you know this game engine itself right
and I've been trying to find something
like you know I don't know just plain
JavaScript game engine something that's
good but there's not enough tutorials on
html5 games right there's not that many
good tutorials or anything that can help
me out you know because I really don't
want to be learning no game
engine like you know Unreal Engine or
the Unity game unity3d like it's
really annoying
no like I really just realized that I
just like coding man I don't like doing
all this extra you know I mean this
and I already know from before but to me
this is the best side of my game
development like it's like if you you
know real programming you just want to
call like you just want to create a
 game could I say right but you
don't want to go in there and have to
learn so much I'm a game engine
like that's that's the problem of
becoming a game developer which I don't
understand how people do it you know I
remember when I was like 14 I was going
to go to full sales on this college I
don't even know if it's on the chek
college but yeah full sales dot edu
right Full Sail University back then I
wanted to come here to actually learn
game develop it I wanted to learn game
development or I wanted to become a
audio engineer right but I never had the
opportunity to go it was just like too
expensive you know single parent like I
was like man who's gonna pay for this
 nobody is gonna pay for this
so I'm gonna be either in debt or
whatever right but a lot of of the
people that went to the school like they
work in the industry working ei they
work at was it ubisoft like all this big
companies right and I was like man I
gotta go to this thing but now that I'm
here I'm like looking at this thing now
I'm like man I'm kind of glad I didn't
because I just don't see myself doing
this like you know I mean there's
so many different parts of it right you
could be a game designer you could be
you know do game development which is
more the coding side you could do mobile
gaming but man I just don't know man it
kind of sucks man because I was really
excited I was like man I'm gonna become
a a game developer I'm trying to switch
up cuz
what development was cool but at the
same time I feel like I'm losing I'm
losing out on how to close like the
passion for it because I already learned
everything that isn't what to me of
course there's so much I gotta
learn but I've lost the passion to
continue doing what development because
I think I kind of burn myself out soon
the past four months where I do what
development I work I do web development
here and in you two are do tutorials um
I also learn new the web
development technologies and
frameworks and languages and it
acknowledges if it became too much right
like I want to do something else I want
to learn something outside a new sign
cool that has to do with programming so
I don't know if maybe I'm I switch to
software engineering or something else
you know because what development is
great but I've been doing this for so
long guys like I've been doing this for
a long time like even though I started
when I was like 14 messing around with a
little website thing I left it alone
came back when I was like 24 25 10 years
later like I've been doing this for what
like five is gonna be like five years
six years you know this year around
there so is like it's a long time and
then I've been doing this like
constantly like I haven't stopped I
probably got like already over 10,000
hours because I do this every
single day like at least five hours of
coding and now I'm like man I already
know how to do this like what's my
next challenge you know like what is it
that I'm gonna learn next like I want to
be able to learn something else because
I love the idea of keep on learning it
and learning new cool things and I'm
like man I wanna games development to
work I wanted to become a games
developer and create cool but
game engines suck because I all I like
to do is cold I don't like to do all
this extra I don't like doing this
 extra things that you got to
learn from like game game development
there I'm like man all I want to do is
code that's it right so for now I'm
gonna have to put this on whole game
development is going under the rug for a
little while and yeah it's just gonna be
what I call a dream you know I'm not
doing it you know I'm just not doing it
man because it's just not worth it for
me to try to learn unity or
Unreal Engine I just don't have the
passion to learn a program I have the
passion to learn programming I don't
have the passion to learn another
 program system right like it's
really annoying like you know I already
spent enough time learning Photoshop all
the Adobe Suites I already paid time to
 learn a sketch like I learned so
much then it's like man for me too
so I get into game development it's like
I'm starting from zero and the part that
I at least like is learning a new
software like a unity and game
engine or whatever right I hate that
 is too many windows for me
is this like it's too much so many
 options it's like they try to
put so much into this game engines that
it kind of it up because it is too
much it's overwhelming it's not like
cold code is like okay one plus one
equals two that's a but when you have to
deal with 30,000 windows then from there
in every window there's 30,000 options
and then this 30 doesn't select
on drop boxes and options there a whole
bunch of and you're like what the
 is all this you know it's like
this tutorial that I bought it's not
that bad but
at the same time is like 56 hours and
I'm like man when am I gonna have time
to learn unity right when am I gonna
have 56 hours to give right
I just don't know man so I'm putting
this in the backburner and under the rug
I'm punishing the garbage game like I
ain't doing this and I'm just gonna
accept it that I'm not gonna become a
king developer because I just don't like
the game engines at all and you know the
only way that I will do is if I find one
that's just straight-up JavaScript like
JavaScript and just coding I could do
everything one was cold and I don't have
to deal with a user interface
because that's the problem do you know
what this user interfaces and all this
 programs that they create it's
like it becomes so complicated
for no reason and yeah man so we
put in the under the rug okay guys
anyways man I just wanted to share this
