out and did it again guys we bringing it
back we're doing what we used to do back
in the days and I don't know if you guys
remember last year when I was working
full-time my previous company and when I
first started the channel right I used
to do this live shows
straight from like my house all the way
to my job right so be like a 15 minute
video or like a 10 minute video of me
talking about a topic and that's what we
doing that way right now
so pretty much the topic that I had this
this morning well that I have this
morning is you know the stupidest tech
company out there stupidest tech company
company in the world ok so who am I
talking about I'm talking about Yahoo
if you guys don't know for all of you
little kids who are new to the world of
tech and technology at some point yahoo
used to basically on the internet yahoo
was everywhere yahoo was at every
basketball game yeah who was at every
soccer game yahoo was being promoted
everywhere you know that will constantly
be commercials of like yahoo you know
i'm pretty sure you guys remember the
commercial of like yeah it was like that
it was some dumb commercial right so
they were pretty popular they were the
google of the time and pretty much they
dropped the ball plenty of times
okay so this will happen with yahoo so
and i believe in 1998 google try to sell
their company
well the creators of google try to sell
the company google so yeah
and yahoo say no we're not looking to
buy for 1 billion dollars hey and then
our thinking around 2000 2001 yahoo
turned around and said oh man this guy's
from google they're you know they're
eating up the market know what can we do
this we should try to buy them so ok
guys it's been a few years so here's
three billion dollars google said no and
give us five billion and we'll sell it
to you and yahoo like an idiot it was
like nah I don't think you guys are
worth that money
now mind you they could have all Google
right now the biggest problem with Yahoo
was that they did not understand that
the way to really become bigger it's not
to create your own products once you
reach a certain amount of level or
success as a tech company there's really
no need for you to be constantly
bringing up new things and creating new
things all you have to do is just
basically buy out other companies merge
with them right oh yeah you know swallow
them up no homo
so I love them up and just like you know
just that's it bring them in which is
what Google has done which is what
Amazon has done which is why Wells done
that almost everybody here everybody
that's out there you know soon as I see
like a brand new company like oh this
company got the best data scientists
what do they do they go and they buy
them up and basically the way Instagram
Instagram was its own company and they
say hey man Instagram is very successful
people started leaving from from
facebook to instagram so we need to buy
them up all right same thing with was
even Microsoft has brought out a lot of
companies Microsoft was one of the first
ones that started doing this right but
for whatever reason Yahoo
basically they were late to the game
I believe this lady's name she's kind of
hot too
the CEO the ex-ceo of Yahoo I didn't her
name is Marissa Meyers she was also a X
Google employee she's pretty bad
she she's back she definitely looks good
but yeah she's super smart and she came
into Yahoo and she tried to acquire a
lot of different companies but by the
time she came in it was too late you
know it's like they basically gave her
like a dying company and then another
mistake that Yahoo did was somewhere I
don't know somewhere between like 2009
2013 around there I can't remember the
exact day basically
if a rising wanted to body yeah for like
forty five billion dollars or something
like that and for whatever reason the I
was like no we we deserve more money
work yeah and this isn't that and
they're like bro your company is dying
your company is not going nowhere you
know I mean it was like now I think I
don't know if they sold it yet but I
that I said that I seen somebody was
trying to buy it for like three billion
dollars yeah so it's like you telling me
a company that was the number one search
engine in the world it had all the best
silences developers they dropped the
ball constantly like sometimes if you
have to the wrong people around you as
far as like management they could
literally bring down a company on their
own I mean if you don't have the right
people
controlling a company you know thinking
ahead doesn't matter if you have the
best developers sometimes this you know
this companies is gonna go down
is that great now what was the last time
you guys typed in Yahoo sometimes I'll
be downloading some stuff from like
download.com or cnn.com and I realize
I'll be pissed off when they put they
try to scheme it when they try to add in
the software they're like hey do you
want us to change your default search
engine to Yahoo like bro don't know
don't touch my my browser and they'll
try to add no no no freaking Yahoo to my
 man
that's like like somebody saying hey man
do you want us to give you a Motorola
phone when you know there's a freaking
iPhone and a galaxy phone out there and
somebody comes to you is like hey man
it's like we gotta give you a great plan
but here's a Motorola phone from 1998
that's today's topic man the dumbest
stupidest retard eNOS retarded it's a
word the worst company in tech history
yeah
because they dropped the ball so many
times that's not even funny guys like a
company cannot drop the ball that many
times man it's like you're gonna pay for
at the end it's the same thing with
American online man when you think about
it I'll give you this between both of
them I give it between American online
and Yahoo but definitely Yahoo takes the
number one spot but yeah man America
Online was also another one that just
dropped the ball man like so many times
when you think about it it's like how
much more of the market can you have
than America online right everybody here
who just from anywhere in the u.s. you
know damn well that America Online had a
freakin monopoly on the incident back in
the days you know you those little
companies here and they're like net zero
and you know you have always a horizon
dsl and you know a little cable here and
here and there but the majority of
people were introduced to the internet
because of America Online
you know and they were pretty smart the
way how they did it was they used to
promote in every magazine they used to
go in and give you the free city back in
the days when see these were expensive
they will come in and be like hey man
try American online here's a free city
it comes with like a couple of demo
games and it also has America a very
smart company man
but somehow they dropped the ball at the
end because what they needed to do was
pretty much like focus on on that man
and I even bought I don't know if I
remember well I think they bought HBO or
they had like part of Time Warner I
can't remember the exact thing the exact
details but America Online started going
into other different things like media
right and that's when they dropped the
ball
they definitely dropped the ball because
there's a hey man your bread and but
it's the Internet man like start making
deals with all of this major companies
like DSL you know horizon DSL Time
Warner Cable 'roger you know time bonus
Roadrunner optimum online like make
deals with them so you could still keep
the the name brand of American online
and just lease it to them just like hey
call your internet America online and
people would have signed up I mean
that's what a smart person would think
right because the brand itself is like
people trusted it plus the services that
it had were amazing so as you come in
and say you've got mail you know I mean
Laura like if you ever been to the
America Online chat rooms man that's
when it was poppin
you know if you ever been to one of
America online chat rooms back in the
days everybody could have got laid in
there that's how that's how bad it was
man like and as soon as you come in
everybody's trying everybody's trying to
smash
everybody's DTF man straight up like
everybody in there will be like yo ASL
ASL a so you know age sex location a
whole bunch of gay dudes don't you know
I remember being like 16 17 years old in
there no I was younger than I was
probably 12 13 years old and dudes is
trying to holler at you like wait hold
on man I'm here for the chicks how long
so yeah man but America Online was
poppin man I think that's like the first
introduction to the internet for
everybody but yeah man it was pretty
legit now let me see I had another
company that dropped the ball we got
Yahoo America Online
who else dropped the ball man there was
another company I can't really remember
it man but yeah so let me see what
everybody say in the chat room man we
got a couple of people who got luciene
we got Carter we got Kelvin Davis let me
see Robert Jones Kelvin Davis Joe Hoss
who else is in here
haha Robert Jones rubber Jones Joe has a
homicide
JC Rodri who else let me see where where
else man
ever said people saying bring back
Emerson
where do I'm saying you guys remember
was the the MSN Messenger that they used
to have oh yeah Microsoft definitely
dropped the ball on mobile devices right
like I remember there was like Windows
Phone but it was so ugly so bulky the
the software itself was like pretty
garbage and yeah man how about when I
don't know if you guys remember this
like Microsoft had a like a iPod
competitor I don't know if you guys
remember that like there was like some
some little device that was
like a square and it was like it was
like a fake iphone and they they thought
that that was gonna be able to compete
the zone whoa good memory can't the zone
man
like sometimes I'll be laughing man I'll
be like yo do this companies like you
know sometimes you think like all these
people got the smartest people in those
companies and it's like no they don't
they have smart people for specific
things right now you could be really
smart at let's say front-end development
right but you could be really dumb with
logic right with thinking with your head
with creating new ideas and you know
this goes back to what I was saying the
other day about you know like a lot of
developers are creating constantly in
JavaScript like new front-end things new
front-end libraries this isn't that to
me personally I find that to be like
kind of like I don't know deficiency of
them thank you because I feel like all
the time that you spent creating tools
you could actually spend it building an
amazing project building an amazing
startup building an amazing
you know service that will help
everybody out but you spend months and
months
recreating what's already there you get
what I'm saying is like it doesn't make
sense to me and going back to companies
like sometimes they have people that are
very smart but very dumb at the same
time you know a lot of these guys they
they smart when it comes to cold or they
smart when it comes to whatever they do
but in just common sense they're stupid
you know and that's what other things
where I'm like I'm glad that more quote
unquote regular people are coming into
the industry and that's my goal my goal
is for people to come in and look I mean
like oh man if this guy came in and he
got in the industry
I can definitely be in the industry
because you know even if people might
say oh I'm smarter than this guy I speak
better than this guy I do this and that
but there's certain things that I have
that a lot of people don't have in the
tech industry right in this real-life
experience I've been in very diverse
situations which a lot of developers in
and Silicon Valley don't have you know
it's like this it's like imagine this if
I'm a guy I went to my whole life to
private school and and then at the end I
got to MIT and everybody in mice my job
is from MIT everybody that's there their
lifestyle the way that they think the
way how they see the world it's it's
only through their eyes meaning like
they see things and they see
opportunities to things that make sense
to them right but when you get people
from like you know for all type of
lifestyles all type of you know
communities or all type of classes you
know all type of incomes it basically
gives you a more
worldwide view of things okay can
sometimes you create a product and to
you you like oh my god this is so
amazing this is great right but then you
realize that the general population is
like this
this thing is dumb you got are saying
same thing that's happening right now
with snapchat right
they created a couple of new features
they change things around you know all
the guys that are snapchat are pretty
smart but the problem with them is that
they don't understand how regular people
think you know they don't understand how
the general population people who are
not tech savvy people who are just
regular dues you know or girls you know
regular users right they don't want to
say how they think and then they miss
sound those opportunities and they
create features that don't matter
features that the general population is
going to look at him like oh this is
dumb like why is this in here you know
what I mean and that happens all the
time you know it's like that thing that
happened a few months ago where a
start-up decided to create you know 2 X
Google developers you know I hate when
people come in like it's like 2 X school
developers as if you know Google
developer makes you like a higher
standard like you're like a freaking
super smart like no you know you just
are able to do that know how to pass the
test you're gonna say so yeah so to
Google developers created this basically
a vending machine that's smart enough
that when you go in there you open it up
you put your hand in there
it's you know it basically records your
face it knows who you are
and then basically they charge you to
your account right so you don't have to
pay for it all you have to do is just go
in and pick it up and it's called bodega
right so they put it everywhere they try
to put it everywhere they launched it
and then they get a backlash they're
like wait why are 2x school developers
you know procreating this
this word of bodega right why are they
doing this and they're trying to create
something that it's gonna take jobs from
you know regular bodegas right so that's
how the general population took it but
why does that happen right why do they
get backlash it's because number one
they don't have you know
diversity they don't have you know I'm
about to say you know a word that you
know somebody might might might get
pissed off but you know you don't have
some real dudes around you you know I
wanna say I want to say the n-word but
I'm not gonna do it
but you don't have some real dudes
around you you got what I'm saying like
when you don't have some real dudes
around you you know and nobody you know
pulls your card and be like hey man this
sounds dumb man like people is not gonna
like this
you know what I mean so it's like you
know you go I said like when you don't
have real people around you you don't
have a diverse people in your company
then you have people that is just
thinking a certain way and that's not
how the general population works you
know one of the reasons why my channel I
feel is very successful and they're
still growing every single day is
growing like crazy now it's because it's
it just hits the core it hits the people
it's the the regular people does general
population the people that come in come
in and be like okay this guy's just like
me this guy is just a regular dude this
guy's just somebody that could relate to
you know but a lot of companies they
don't have that you know you can't you
can't have a company creating products
for the general population when most of
your employees that are creating the
product are coming from high coalesced
you know like sit you know like they
have like I seen this thing where there
was like a company where literally every
single person that was in there was like
Oh from Harvard this guy's this and that
this guy from MIT this guy's from
Stanford this guy's this and that and
there's nobody there's nobody in there
that's just some regular dude right and
I see a lot of problems in companies
like that because it's like you cannot
create a product for everybody when you
don't have everybody in your company you
don't have to input if everybody right
and as I sometimes what they do is they
try to go into different communities and
do little surveys and be like hey what
do you think about this product do you
do you think this product is a little
bit racist do you think this product is
a little bit edgy like and then they
they ask people that are not even part
of the community and a part of of the
area that they trying to serve and then
it's like oh when they release a
freaking product you know then they get
the backlash that oh we're sorry we
didn't know that people was gonna take
it like this it's because you don't have
real people around you you gonna say
like every company if I'm a developer
right and my job is to create products
for let's say the average American right
average American that earns from $10,000
to $45,000 that's the majority of the
people that is going to be using my
application I need to have people that
know what it is to live in that world
that know how it is to live I say you
know you know at the bottom of the
United States
you got one saying like you can't just
say hey man we are all you know we all
preppy kids that we all gone to just
number private schools and you know
my mom got a little a little summer
house and the Hamptons and you know it's
like you you can't create a product a
successful product for those people
because you don't know what are they
their problems you don't know what are
the things that they need you know so
that's why diversity is so important a
lot of these companies because it's like
creating products for for everybody but
then the people that work there are not
part of like the general population and
that's what there is great to have more
developers that are coming in from a way
of lives like you know I have like a lot
of people that love my channel right but
the guys are like super smart you know
guys that you you'll be like oh man this
guy's super bright super smart they'd be
like oh man I hate this channel uh you
know the great developers and I don't
mind them uh you know I don't knock them
for it you know if you're a great
develop you a great developer right but
what they don't understand about this
channel is that this channel is for the
people right this channel it's not about
hey who's the smartest was the most
technical in this channels for the
people you don't insane and a lot of
times they hate that they're like man
okay we can't have people coming in you
know trying to get jobs that you know
it's gonna earn and earn some money is
like why not you know what I'm saying or
they'll be like oh man this guy's they
don't have the passion for code is like
but how do you get the passion from code
isn't it by coding right you get to have
passion for coding when you start
building projects and building
applications and you learn into code
nobody wakes up nobody comes out of the
you know the couch nobody comes out of
the couch out their mom's couch and be
like that baby is gonna be a defender
part nobody comes out like that that
happens with time when you you know you
have a great science teacher you have a
great
have teacher you have a great computer
science teacher somewhere in junior high
school and then they introduce you
today's that I Oh do you want to go to
Kok it codes or code by kids wasn't even
accompany coding with kids right that's
like a a company that teaches little
kids how to code so there's a no coding
with kids right now they put that little
bug in them right to learn to code and
that's what I feel that's what I do here
I come in I put the little bug there's
people out there that are interested but
they be like oh I don't know if I could
do it I don't know if I should do it and
I come in and I put that little bug in
them and be like hey you know what you
should get into the industry because we
need more diversity we need more people
that are coming in from all way of life
you know what I mean because you could
be let's say I always bring this example
of the truck driver right you could be
the truck driver right but the skills
that you bring that a lot of this
developers that are in the industry
right now don't have they don't know the
struggle they don't know the roads they
don't know the routes they don't know a
lot of things that you know as a truck
driver right they don't know your
industry you might come in and create a
new way for truck drivers to make a more
efficient route right you might come in
and say hey there's a better way to so
basically charge charge clients or
charge companies when you're a truck
driver or you might come in and create a
better way for Google Maps to actually
display navigation because you're
actually in the road right nobody else
is gonna come in and create those things
because most of the developers they're
not in that world you know what I'm
saying it's the same thing as somebody
who who is uh you know let's say for for
example a dentist right you might be a
dentist but
when you learn how to code and you have
the skills to actually come in and
create new products and new services now
you're bringing in that knowledge that
you have from other industries and you
might be able to say okay as a dentist
it sucks that our software works like
this and it takes so long to charge to
the insurance company how about I create
my own way to charge the you know short
charge the insurance and this and that
right so when you come in from different
diverse backgrounds right it actually
helps to the industry more than it hurts
them you know a lot of developers that I
see ally there's people that are good
and there's people that be like all day
kumbaya with everybody oh yeah you've
got questions let me help you up
right but this also the group of people
who you know to play put a plain simple
right you know this is a group of people
you know the one style I always say are
the guys you know guys who are in high
school right you already know in high
school they're at in a corner cleaning
their you know the little freaking high
coolest Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons playing the
low yugi'll card playing the little
things like that so they create this
bubble around them where they think like
oh man you know before we used to get
make fun of before we was you know the
little smart kids doing not working and
this and that and then with time they
create this idea in their head that that
code and technology it's their world
right coding technology is for them
they're like oh this is supposed to be
our our thing you know what I mean it's
like this to school jocks it's the girls
that little daddies there's the you know
the kids who are into sports there's the
the kids who are into music there's the
kids who are into computers and this is
in somehow society later on there's
people join society after they go to
college and they do all this stuff right
and somehow they still bring that with
them right they still bring that with
them where they're like they feel like
this is just for them this is dears
there's like there grounds you got what
I'm saying like they feel like this is
their ground says like oh this is my
ground man
like we're doing you know we're the
nerdy guys we were supposed to be the
rock stars of this you know it was like
why are regular people trying to come
into this industry you know so it's like
they look down upon other people trying
to get into the industry because they
feel like oh that this is their world
like this is their their thing you know
I mean so it's kind of ridiculous you
know cuz even with time that passes by
it's like man like everybody should be
into this man I feel like this should be
taught with you know right after math
class you don't know say but yeah so
that's all I'm saying
yeah some people they hate that
I'm being honest and I see it all the
time you can see it on the comments man
whenever you find like a hating comment
and be like oh you don't know what
you're talking about you you this isn't
that a lot of those guys it's kind of
sad the idea that pisses them the most
is the fact that I come in here and be
like
you already know shield boy joke back at
it again and it's like I played with it
you know so like I played with it I
bring it into a entertaining world i
bringing into a world of like happiness
and just having fun with it right
some guys they're they're so uptight
with this thing man like they're like oh
man this is supposed to be y'all they're
supposed to be our world we're not
supposed to have this type of people in
here like this supposed to be for you
know for the Nerds this is this is our
safe ground
this is our safe place
and it's like now bro no cuz there's
people like me who is changing this
industry man because it does need to
change you know all of these companies
and going back to the main topic that I
was talking about you know all of these
companies the reason why they fail is
because they don't have that insider to
the streets they don't have that insider
to the general population they don't
have that insider of you know of people
that live in America right if people
come in and just talk about if people
come in and just talk about or like
let's say they create a product like I
said before for you know everybody in
America they're trying to create a
product for everybody in America that is
gonna solve the problem for everybody
right something simple like a social
media right if you are not from you know
if you don't have the inside you don't
have somebody that comes in and tells
you like hey man this was popular
outside right even in the music game you
know what they used to have to used to
have a in ours right they used to have
people that go out to the streets they
go out to the clubs they go out to
wherever the music the new music that's
popping to do researching and to be able
to to understand it and a lot of times
what they used to do is they hire people
from the streets to come in and give
them that that ear of like hey man this
is what's popular right now this is what
the kids like right but in the tech
industry they don't have that that's the
problem with it in the tech industry
that don't have that at all so there's
people creating products and there's
people creating things that have no idea
who are the users who other people are
going to be using their application they
try to do a and B test they try to do
little how you call this like closed
surveys closed testing which means it's
like okay we're going
pay ten people from Craigslist hey come
play come play with our game or come
test out our application and tell us
what you think and there's like ten
random people but that doesn't mean
that's the streets that's just some
random people that show up so get a
hundred dollars per day because you you
you you know you showing them their
their stupid on application you get over
saying but once there's more more people
from all ways of life I think the
industry is gonna be so much better
because there's gonna be more projects
and more products that are gonna be more
legit it's not gonna be stuff that you
know it's like right now it's like who
was it Bill Gates right they did a thing
on Ellen with Bill Gates right they
asked Bill Gates how much was like a
Dorito chips what something like that
Bill Gates hasn't been in in in a
supermarket in over 20 years because
Bill Gates cannot go anywhere right
so for Bill Gates to be able to create
anything for the general population
makes no sense because he hasn't been
out there he don't know what it is like
right so they asked how much is like a
derivative chips and the guys like oh
seven dollars that cost a dollar
that's how you know you know you're not
into it with with the people you get are
saying so saying how can you make a
successful product if you're not in tune
with the people you get what I'm saying
and even though Microsoft's their whole
business is not really they don't make
no money Microsoft makes no money with
with like watch people let's be honest
let's put this out there Microsoft does
not make money with people when you use
Windows 10 when you use or whatever
Windows 21 whatever they have now when
you use their services their upper
operating on operating system like they
make no money with you the money that
they make is all from enterprise
that's where they make their money you
know like general populations they make
no money with them right now if you
wanted to come in you know it's like the
same thing with like the Xbox you know
Xbox one
well the Xbox 360 was successful because
the person who was running it was a
regular do if it would have been just
another MIT if we can graduate or
another Stanford graduate whatever like
those people don't they don't know the
general population a lot of them don't
even know nothing like they they smart
in code they smart and in the books but
they're dumb in life you know so that's
the thing that's why companies like that
they fail because they just don't have
some real ninjas around them real ninjas
out here you fill in the blank bout to
go to the gym real quick I don't believe
you listen man I'm in here man how much
a boy $10 $10 a month man trying to keep
