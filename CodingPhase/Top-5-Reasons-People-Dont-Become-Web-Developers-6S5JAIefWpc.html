someone that you guys probably heard us
someone you guys probably not in coding
phase and concrete to go ahead and
introduce yourself you already knows
your boys okay I do this weekend coded
face.com okay YouTube / coding face your
voice out here we're here man I'm a web
developer man but I'm also just a
regular guy man like think of me at just
your friend your boy or you homie you
know I'm just a regular dude that's the
type of energies I like to bring I don't
want to come in and but oh my god it's
just uptight person who does cold man
I'm just like you guys you know what I
mean
yeah yeah you hear me yeah well I mean
welcome to my channel um I'm looking for
this I've been you've been trying to
plan a meet up for a while Emily oh yeah
man it's crazy well I mean I feel the
channel thing like I don't know if it
was like December or early January and I
was like hey I'm really like I was going
through a lot of stuff when I was a girl
this kid his channels like so positive
like it kind of keeps like you actually
made me continue making videos because
at one point I was like the only this
was happening to me I was like Natalie
we want to do this my mom and then I'm
like wait hold on he's doing it and he's
doing it you know in a proper way and
I'm like you know what I'm gonna just
push myself you know get this YouTube
channel pop in and you know here we are
ha ha ha yeah well me asking your videos
and I know especially if your new camera
I like the new constant should be driven
now get into it so today we're going to
be talking about it the wrong ideas
people have about learning code for
example like man I'm not smart enough
people
montrose oh man you know I don't live in
a good enough computer and so what we
want to talk about today for everyone
that does do this today and for the
future is what are the wrong these
people have into misconception the logic
we've heard
to prevent people to marry another
hearing predominance yeah well
definitely this is something that I went
through when I was first starting to you
know get my interesting in what
development and it was like oh my god
like I'm really bad at math so I was
like am I gonna be able to become a
developer because I'm like I'm not
really good with math like I'm you know
everybody would come into class and do
their you know the homework whatever in
the test and do good and I'm like oh man
I gotta find somebody to cheat off like
you know I was one of those guys so say
yeah yeah you know I would just like a
regular person I was like them and maybe
that's not for me just because of you
know like the programming side I will be
like oh my god I gotta be really good
with math I gotta be really good with
calculus and then when I realized right
now I haven't used math like I don't
know anyone like five seven years I
don't know you don't have to be Einstein
all you have to know it you know what's
one plus one equals two that's a if you
know the simple stuff you're good you do
these notes abstract subtraction though
in a little bit washing the memory you
can just make it through life with like
everything is a plus you know I agree I
think the minimum requirement is just
not to catch on money if you're able to
do that then you're good to go it's that
it's impossible for me to live and I
think many people think that when they
keep people like Mark Ferguson or even
Bill Gates skewer the developer in using
sharp I'm going to see even the people
the owners of SEOs of Twitter all the
people were very intelligent programmers
but that's why I started a company
because they're really good
because they kind of still that having
that skill to not many people have but
we're not trying to build the company
that's all we're trying to do is trying
to learn how to understand a language I
don't know yet and honestly for for me
at least when I'll insist you know no
one kid says it'll it was a hundred
times a year to learn new languages in
the working space and a lot of people
think they can do it but really what's
effort looking termination Eva just
studying an hour a day which is what I
do one a few hours
you'll be able understand in two months
at least HTML sister you know and now
some people though I've been receiving a
lot is not true now I'm sure you can you
sing a lot not sue :
yeah but a lot of people have been
asking me about you can a lot of you
wasn't asking me actually please put out
a video don't ask
hey I just got accepted to you know
college and should I good I call it and
she liked it
no take a bunch of them to go there
alright
my problem with boot camp is like I mean
it's not really a problem like you know
the boot campers themselves it's the
fact that they charge you so much money
for food people just a basic like people
yes have have this idea of hey imma go
into this boot camp I don't know
anything
imma book into this boot camp mo come
out of there as a developer that has you
know the senior level is like he's gonna
know everything you're going to be able
to get that ninety thousand dollar job
right away and like that's like your way
to basically go up to the top and it
doesn't work like idea it takes time
people think they have to learn
everything in workshops you don't need
to learn everything one on one shot like
meaning HTML CSS JavaScript PHP Ruby
Java or Python people think that they
just have to go in there dive deep and
just like I gotta learn em like that was
little mistakes food that I made in the
beginning because yeah I was just trying
to learn everything like okay at that
time there was a backboard
they was angular than was amber and
literally yeah I learned everything at
one time
but then I really know it no I didn't
know it all I did was just pretty much
with the basic just like a little
introduction so my whole first year was
pretty much of me just tasting a little
bit of every every single frame on frame
working language like I remember this
like I went to this company right and it
was like done I don't know you had a
complex ragga zine alright so I want to
accomplish magazine and I
for interview and it was for like
front-end developer and I was like man I
was already nervous because I'm like oh
man I don't know if I'm ready it's like
my first major companies that have
started working on a smaller business
but when you go to those large companies
that's different you know so as you come
and you see the big logo the tricky last
door like every case all nice and clean
and get oh yeah I don't know if I could
be know am I gonna get hired here you
know what I mean but yeah sorry ask you
a question what I hate do you know like
oh I forgot all of it Oh prototypical
inheritance of what the hell I don't
even know how to answer that I got like
no yes I know or what it is but I was
just like oh my god like how the hell am
I gonna answer this because all I know
was just like jQuery and you know a
little dollar sign and I'm like okay
maybe I could get by with this but then
I realize I'm like the reason why I
wasn't ready for that interview it
wasn't because I haven't been studying
it's just I just been focusing on
everything else instead of just focusing
on one thing that's a really good point
you said concrete and I'm glad I
actually asked that question because
that's a big misconception that a lot of
people have when someone code I remember
when I see you know all the youtubers
two kids like they don't even like the
table
and you get so overwhelmed by all the
language to teach me my people I'm not
sure this is Maria because it's actually
something that came out of my school
bond even know that existed
yeah pipe down there C sharp the C++ to
see everything right and so you kind of
think that you need to know everything I
want be able to get hired for the
Sacketts that's not sure they'll never
happened to me I said the HTML CSS
JavaScript was a penalizing to the base
building but I think that's for everyone
I mean then we can I thought I was a pro
when I wasn't a JavaScript I want to
treat to jQuery next about all my
JavaScript yeah you know and then I want
to shoot the peach feet and my sequel I
forgot all my daughter spin so actually
well my job with DES can give you right
now is the run javascript again all
because try to run everything one
picture died on the advantages that
people was coming Chris how did you get
a Java three months did you really get a
job a319 only tell them yeah and they
ask what did i do different than
everyone no I did nothing I just made a
website I applied I called them down
like a job two days later I came up to
the interview in the IBM spot
oh and no so yeah a lot of people think
you have to know everything to get hired
right away with you just have to go
straight the only way you'll know it's
good enough to get a job is if you apply
and you get rejected order to get hired
we don't get hired what do you need to
need to improve that's the only way you
want to know I think another my
subscription um is that use for me I I
tell them encoding what eleven months
ago ten months ago and so I'm 29 now
also 28 of my side let me cook
abscess still young all right we're okay
28 in Lending Cove and you think of
everyone
wait in my fuel they learn pronoun am I
not the best or should have learnt all
not teaching it is two weeks for me but
the fact of the matter is that's not
sure why because actually take part in
the hiring process not work I look for
people the join a company yeah I had the
junior developer interested in it um now
we just hired a couple months ago
pictures on 55 the results we hired are
55 year old back-end
program now it yet shoe he's very
skilled it's really good for 65 years
old you know so age really doesn't
matter how old you are where you learn
English you don't have to be 18 to be
hydrogen developer do something to be
hungry yet and kinda work harder than I
don't know those the people listen up
yeah well I definitely agree with that
like another thing who are you know this
for the females the girls who's out here
go cold energies yeah which is their you
know pretty great um like one of the
back-end developer for my company it's
actually a woman right and she's
monogramming since the eighties right so
she has like
long history shoes are like almost every
back in language that you could think of
she's done pearl she's done Java not a
ruby good unless it's like there's no
limit to this thing you know your skin
colors not really about your age not
really about where you come from it's
not really about your sex orientation
it's about hey can you do the job like
you know you have fun doing it people
think that just because you see the
numbers hang somebody solar cells making
$90,000 so-and-so is missing $120,000
the relative thing is that that's not
going to be you most of them it could be
you but the reality of things is you
have to work there you don't know that
person's history there's some people
that have been coding some 14 years old
13 years old and the part on the end of
high school they have the same level as
somebody who was you know 30 years old
in and Bank
you know saw here Chris so 30 years all
who's been you know program from here
you know it just takes time so when you
see somebody who's like really yellow oh
my god only 17 and he's already you know
signed up with facebooking Facebook
picked them up you don't know his story
you know he's in Detroit I love how long
you know yeah I really yeah pretty much
for first couple years sacrifice you
could be willing to eat garbage for the
first couple years build your skill even
if you become better than your and
senior developers and that should be
your goal yeah yeah I mean I totally
agree yes discussing the bottom up
that's what's happening right now I'm at
the bottom but you know I'm just left
I'm happy yeah stop you're already
heading to the top dummy ha ha ha I
haven't heard from you know from a lot
of people that you know that everything
is going so good like like you right now
man you've got a very good YouTube
channel you have you know
oh very good skills that are in web
development at the same time you know
not many people just say hey I got a job
at 3-1 like I wish I could've said that
like me it took me a whole year because
I am a head I'm like I wasn't ready for
you you're the type of person that's a
go-getter and then in your positive at
the same time as I hate when you say
like that you like you know what what do
I have to do somebody just go for it
you're gonna go to places where you you
want a mr. coffee you know let's be a we
don't know where you got you're gonna be
at realizing this cream Chris chart at
Google next year like yeah who need to
care about you more than anyone else
regarding creative insuring yourself
when you get that much here can you
realize why no one cares about I need to
be something now what will that do
that's gonna push you to what cardamon
why you kick at the end of the day your
life your silence you can care them it
up to me that's why I work so hard oh
well I want to work at our description
that's why I stay up till 1:00 a.m.
every day my still it's effective it's
to go to work and China hustles into
picture because I realized no one cares
it off you know and so what people need
to realize that you're everyone please
even listening right now lis to work
hard
yeah learning : be difficult at this
moment but when you should exceed it
when you make it to the end guess what
people still won't care that's why you
need to care more than I do now
you could get fit exploit and even at
that point nobody cared
nobody's like nobody was going to be
there and applaud you I'm gonna hey this
guy made it no it's like you're doing it
for yourself
and like one thing that I'm gonna tell
everybody is everybody that's here and

you guys are watching around the package
of listening the fact you watch this
whole thing shoulder yeah that's you're
really able isn't it
