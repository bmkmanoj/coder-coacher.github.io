man Conan face calm listen your boys
back and not and did it again alright
guys so today's question was from
somebody on online on Quora and they
asked you what is the most common laptop
used at Google offices and you know from
my experience when the last time that I
went to Google office over here in New
York City
it pretty much everybody that I've seen
had a MacBook Pro right literally every
single person I saw I never saw nobody
with a Windows computer and even like in
the offices I will see I max you know I
haven't worked at Google I've been
invited multiple times to Google offices
either for meetup or you know like a
casual invitation you know for you know
just a meeting with one of my friends
but this is also something that
everybody who is commenting on on here
too it's like yeah MacBook Pro 15 inch
right now like 13 inch 15 inch like
everybody uses MacBook Pros now once in
a while you're gonna see somebody with
Linda would think pad with Linux you
know you will see something like that
but by far it's gonna be Mac's man you
know it's like those are one of those
things where like people acts like oh
man you know what is it that actually
used to start learning how to code you
know it's like guys there's a reason why
the big dogs used you know max it's just
your life is easier you don't have to
worry about all the things that you have
to go through with Windows Windows you
have to come in and install Ubuntu bash
and do a whole bunch of stuff like no
doesn't even work perfectly you know how
many people are gift from emails and
sending me messages like yo Joe I having
some issues with my Windows computer
following on you know the just the you
know the the freaking starter kit like
the simplest thing in the world right
and they have issues because is Windows
it's just
it's pretty much a floor system like I'm
telling you guys I have I have a
brand-new Windows computer here like I
have a monster computer here that I
pretty much paid like two thousand
dollars catching dust I don't use it at
all
I put in Linux whenever I want to play
around with Linux I basically built a
computer for gaming I maxed it out I did
a whole bunch of stuff in the computer
is just you know the graphic card
doesn't run as good as it should be I
don't know man you know there's always a
different things hey you got to download
this driver hey you gotta install this
hey your control is not working because
is that this distance you know it's like
so many different things like yeah like
it's ridiculous trust me trust me guys
it's ridiculous all the things that I
have to go through in a Windows computer
just to get anything done but yeah man
there's a pretty cool question because
you know people always asking that like
man what should I start with what is it
that you know which one should I buy
guys if you have five hundred dollars in
your pocket and you're like oh man I
want to buy something right now wait a
little bit
buy yourself a used MacBook you know
2012 2013 2014 you could buy it for
seven hundred two hundred dollars more
just wait for it buy it on Craigslist
buy from somebody literally is gonna
make your life so much easier right and
on top of that like you're using what
the professionals are using people keep
talking about hey man there's more
Windows users guys it's a big difference
quality and quantity right it's like
everybody that uses Windows is because
windows are cheap you could go online
and buy yourself a Windows laptop for
$100 like you know why people be like oh
man
in my country everybody uses Windows in
my company everybody uses Windows yeah
because in your company they don't have
money to really invest into
infrastructure but hey guys we're gonna
give you guys the best tools around nah
they
don't you know it's like a lot of times
you just don't have those those
companies that could come in and take
care of you as a developer and that's
just how it is but doesn't mean that's
the best tool out there like trust me
guys like I used to be a windows head
back in the days my whole life was with
Windows you know my first computer was
like Windows 95 even before that we had
like a Windows NT that barely worked and
then we upgraded to Windows 95 then from
there Windows XP XP was the best to me
because everything worked perfectly for
it the moment they started doing Windows
7 was a Windows Vista Windows 7 Windows
8 Windows 10 now it's like Windows 8.1
like what like you know what I mean like
what are you talking about 8.1 that's a
brand-new version like Pro chest down
you know the reason people come up with
crazy stuff on Windows Man and I feel
bad man cuz I do respect Microsoft man I
respect the grind I respect what Bill
Gates built but I just don't understand
why why they don't like the software
itself is
tracky is sucks I've seen their new
computers with a guy like you know the
one that that flips over and you could
draw on it I think Mac should be jealous
of that right there's a lot of cool
things that they have in Windows but
like let's say the touchscreen or on a
laptop that's cool that's hot I wish of
my MacBook could do that right
I'll be honest I wish they could do that
but for some reason they're not focusing
money well I think like they should
definitely take that and start making
things more touchscreen but at the same
time you know Mac they try to make money
that I hey man if we make if we make our
laptops touchscreen that's it that's
pretty much killing off the iPad
automatically you already killed the
iPad the moment you make it touch screen
goodbye iPad all right so they trying to
stand it right or how people say they
try
perfect but I don't know but you know
what I mean like when it comes to this
windows versus Mac guys you're a
developer you want to get the best tools
you don't want to be hacking things and
you don't want to be dealing with drama
like there's something where let me see
where is it I'm not this is a good
comment somebody put here man let me see
where is he yeah look haven't seen any
Windows laptop I heard someone in my
team say they try using Windows but it
was a pain to configure with all the
internal security stuff yeah like this
company is trying to Wayne off Windows
like they don't for security reasons
period like you you definitely do not
want to be using a Windows computer like
it there's so much stuff man so many
things like you know we could go to the
deep end
you know max versus Windows whatever but
you know your answers there kids what do
people in Google use they use Mac
MacBook Pros that's it right and then
they use the Chromebooks coz Chromebooks
are free they give it to you for free
you literally you go in there first and
they be like hey they won here's a
Chromebook that's it it's like a $250
laptop for you to walk around it's cheap
right but the ones that they use for for
their work is max all right guys I'll
