face.com your boys back in I done did it
again alright so today's topic is gonna
be supply and demand okay just like any
other industry if the supply is there
all right well because the man is there
this is gonna be the supply right so the
reason why I bring this up is because
there was a good question from David
Michelle and I believe it's Waldo Mack
who basically was also commenting on it
on the Ruby on Rails videos are creating
and pretty much it was a good question
this is one of the best questions that
I've had this whole week is I hate Joe
you're talking about Ruby and Ruby on
Rails is it because you're creating a
course on it that you're now trying to
promote
hey guys go check out Ruby and to be
honest with you guys no you know I was
actually remember a while back I was
like man I don't know what should I do
if I should do a Python chorus or I
should do a Ruby on Rails right and then
I started doing my research I started
looking into things because if I do a
Python course it's gonna sound like
crazy right it's definitely gonna sell
and not only with just my audience here
but everybody else there's so many
college students that are looking for
Python courses and that's why you see a
lot of people coming in and you know
taking advantage of that because the
demand is there
people want Python courses but the
reality of it is like hey my specialty
is web development right so if I'm gonna
talk about something I'm gonna talk
about things that are beneficial for
people who want to become web developers
not so for engineers not all
applications developer nah you know iOS
and Android developers but web
developers so I started doing my
research for like the past month and a
half almost two months I've been looking
into it and yes I did say that Ruby on
Rails when I was looking for work
probably two years ago to three years
ago because I really bring in laravel
bubbled basically you know where
everything that I've been doing for the
past three years have been in Arabic I
was also looking at some point into Ruby
on Rails jobs and most of the jobs that
I was seeing a year and a half two years
ago was mostly for mid-level to senior
level developers right but after doing
the research over again this year now
for November from November to now and
looking online and talking to one of my
my recruiters people that I really trust
this kid he basically he went in showed
me his his screen and he was like listen
this is all the jobs down here over 70
70 jobs nationwide now you might think
like oh there's only some of the jobs no
when they have 70 jobs that means
everybody else in the industry has 50
100 different jobs everywhere all over
the country okay cuz his company is a
major company for you know all the
startups so when he tells me like yo
right now there's not enough Ruby or
roasted other person okay because you
gotta understand a lot of the senior
developer is the same thing that
happened with PHP it's now happening
with Ruby right and that's why I'm
talking about Ruby again cuz I'm gonna
get oh wait so you're telling me the
senior developers who guys will have
been working on Ruby for the past you
know 5 to 7 10 years almost people have
been working on Ruby on Rails since like
2009 you know what I mean like 2009 so
those guys are now leaving to other
languages like elixir and they working
on golang cuz it's like think about it
guys if you work for six six years let's
say six years in a company working on
Ruby on Rails at some point no matter
how much you you love it you
I get bored you gotta wanna you know
expand your horizons and trying to try
other things that's the nature of this
business you come in you do a technology
for three to five years sometimes if
you're lucky and you're one of those
that love the technology that much or
the language that much you stay there
for ten years but at some point you want
to try something new so all of these
senior developers are jumping ship and
they jumping into bigger things you know
golang they looking into the scholar
they looking into elixir you know it's
like you can't be mad at them they've
been doing this for a while right so
what does that mean for you guys you
guys are junior developers in a lot of
you guys you in reality you could
consider yourself mid-level because just
because you you haven't had a job but
you've been coding for the past two
three years but and you know all the
technologies all these frameworks you
know programming you know web
development like the back of your hand
you know a lot of you guys just having I
don't know why you guys just don't go
for interviews yeah could be getting
jobs oh yeah I'll be slacking right so
that's that's all on you guys if you
guys take the courage to go to the
interviews that's on you
but talking back to Ruby on Rails
Waldo Mackin and David Wasilla they had
a very good question is it Joe is it
because you're creating a course upon it
no I'm creating a course because of the
demand that's there for you guys you
guys back okay jobs all right if I
wanted to really think about the money
the one that I would have chose to
create a course about is really Python
because Python right now is hot like it
or not is hot for people even though
they're not gonna find jobs which is
kind of hilarious
like I'm talking to you guys just to be
honest to be real with you guys a lot of
the people studying Python they're not
gonna find jobs in Python right because
how competitive and how much you know
like you got people coming out of
four-year schools with computer science
degrees where they major
Python and then it's like people are
trying to learn this stuff online on
their own guys let's be honest you go to
a company and they say hey man we have
somebody who has never worked at a
company and their portfolio is okay and
then somebody who coming from a
four-year school or a university and has
a car computer science degree the
company is gonna sort of lean more for
them because they have to math behind
them it's not just a programming Python
when you you jump into Python it's not
just programming you got a have math in
it you gotta have calculus one calculus
two calculus 3 freakin linear equations
like there's so much stuff that people
look for for Python developers that is
not even funny you know that's what
people don't talk about you know what I
mean so for me in my audience my job is
to make sure that you guys are
self-taught developers get jobs and get
opportunities I'm not gonna talk to you
guys about things that you have that's
gonna be harder for you to actually get
into you know what I mean like that's
just how I do things right and I'm all
about jobs and I'm all about money
that's to be honest if there's no money
for me in there I'm not going to tell
you guys to go in there I'm gonna be
like yo there's no money in that
like you're not gonna be able to find a
job I want you guys to if you take a
course you build your portfolio in the
you know the tops three to four months
you know get at least you know entry job
at a company and then from there just
like everybody else you scale yourself
and you keep on going keep on learning
and building your portfolio and now you
have six months now you can go to a
bigger company that's what I want for
you guys if I was to think about the
money wise I will focus on nodejs
because to me I get better SEO with no
Jade with no js' and most of the people
that that come in and then I hate
they want to buy something is usually no
js' or Python alright but why would I
tell you about Ruby on Rails and tell
you hey guys you guys gotta jump on this
now because the jobs are there right
people are jumping ship from Ruby on
Rails because this other technologies
aren't cool you know what I mean like
when you're senior developer guys and
you get to a certain point in your
career you've been working in a company
you know five ten years you don't want
to keep doing the same thing at some
point you already mastered that you want
to try something new and that's what's
happening with Ruby on Rails I saw it
with PHP like four or five years ago you
know when I first started this I was
like man all I did was run it for a good
two years and a half all I did was front
end right and I did a couple of
WordPress themes and you know until I
learned the backend and when I was
learning a back-end everybody's like oh
you gotta do node you got to do this and
that and I'm like yo no way that I found
right there was barely any jobs at that
point but for some reason everywhere I
got way there was like a million jobs
for for PHP it was the best decision
that I did to learn it because not only
did they expand my career but I actually
became a back-end developer like once
you learn one back in language from
there you're good let's say you you
chilling when I work with Ruby on Rails
it was the best job that I had because
it was fun all right now you could have
fun with Ruby and it's a it's a fun
language and now there's the
opportunities for you to get jobs so
that's why I bring it up now people can
believe me or not now look it up do your
research in your area do the same thing
that I did I started checking throughout
every single website that has jobs I
looked everywhere for remote jobs and
one thing that I saw was like I always
been saying
look it up exactly by the titles those
don't put in like let's say don't put a
ruby and that's it because if you put
ruby remember you know the freaking
recruiters they put a ruby no Jay yes a
pilot Python Java they put like 30,000
different technologies on the same
listening but that's not really where
the job is that it's like hey if you
know any of these is like it's more than
welcome but it's not really what you're
gonna be doing at this job but if you
look right now Ruby Ruby on Rails and
you do make sure you search through the
filters and you put advanced and insert
some titles you're going to find that
it's a whole bunch of jobs that are new
it wasn't like this almost a year and a
half ago it wasn't like this at all
because like I told you people are
jumping you know people are jumping
ship and they jumping into other stuff
so what that does is it opens the door
for you guys who have no jobs and as I
hey man now I can come in and apply for
those jobs and take it because hey if
there's not enough people that want to
do Ruby on Rails which are mid levels
and senior levels what do you guys think
is gonna happen they're gonna have to
start looking into the junior developers
the guys who are barely getting their
their feet wet because they still need
people there you know our company might
have let's say an example a company
might be one senior developer right
before they used to be two three senior
developers that senior developer is up
to here with you know working and
backlog and you know a whole bunch of
bugs that he got a deal with he needs
the extra hand and that's when you come
in as a junior developer help out and at
the same time get to learn from that
senior developer this happens all the
time you know you got to understand
supplying the man is real it's just like
any other industry
right you gotta understand that that if
the supply of developers is not there
but the demand is high that means it's
more opportunities for you to get jobs
same happened with PHP man this our
languages are are high : psyche they
already been proven right it's the same
thing as Java Java has been around for
god knows how long
right and even when new versions of Java
come out or you know sub children's of
Java like Haskell and in Scala even when
those come out the job of jobs are still
there you like it or not they still
there they don't go away because the
companies is not gonna leave the
developers leave but the company stays
there you know what I mean so that's why
I've been talking about Ruby on Rails
the past few days and that's why I
switched up I was gonna do a Python
course because to me is more profitable
it's easier to to actually tell people I
hate I got a Python course a Python
course basically promotes itself
you put Python course on Google search
on your freaking Google search and
everything shows up right away right
it's easy to promote it because all you
have to do is just put Python on it
right now python is so hot and because
there's so many college students that's
learning Python there's so many people
that are just jumping onto Python but
what people don't understand is that
there's different levels of things like
me my focus is on web right Python for
web is not the is now where is that
there's no jobs for it there's a few
companies that are doing jangle but like
it's not where is that it's like I'm the
type of person that I want to be where
there's a lot of jobs so my competition
is not that that big so whenever I
decide to be like hey I want a job today
I could get a job whenever I want
but if you're over here trying to learn
technologies and languages that is very
competitive that's when you be like oh
man I've been six months without a job
I've seen people coming and like super
smart guys guys start smarter than me
I'm not the smartest guy in the world
let's be honest I'm now I'm just a
regular dude like that's not I don't try
to consider myself smart some people
might say yo you're smart all the things
that you know and other things that you
do you smart no I don't consider myself
smart because I'm just some regular do
that works hard that's what I do you
gotta say like I didn't go to MIT I
didn't go to you know none of these
fancy schools I didn't go to none of
that I just happen to work hard in
everything that I that I like I get
passionate you know I become passionate
about it and then I really go hard like
I love Ruby since the beginning of time
I love laravel since the beginning of
time I love frickin react since I first
saw it I was like man I used to do
angular so does I touch react I was like
you know my world changed I was like oh
my god what the hell have I been doing
before you know what I mean so but like
I said I'm the type of person man that
I'm all about doing my research on jobs
I don't care if the technology is cool I
don't care about if if it's the latest
thing those things do not impress me
because the way how web development
works is every framework does the same
thing that other frameworks do I've seen
guys come in with back Bourne backbone
applications that are better than people
that are doing it with react they all do
the same thing it's all about preference
right but one thing that you're gonna
know is you gotta find where the jobs is
that because you'll be in the smartest
person in the world you having to know
all the latest
and all the latest frameworks out there
mean nothing if you broke in your house
this look there's no not to people no
natural you know I've gone to meetups
I've gone to hackathons I've gone to you
know places where you meet like the
smartest people there alright super
smart they working under like the latest
trends you know our new framework come
out there doing it talk about oh this is
the new framework this is da da da and
then you find out as an egg what you
live you know it's like how's everything
in the housing life going oh you know I
live in the basement with my mom still
you know I'm still working you know I'm
just trying to learn and I'm working on
a side project so me that's a failure to
meet us failure that's failing in life
like I'm all about money I'm all about
being successful I'm all about being
able to feed my family being able to
take care of my life you know I don't
want to be one of these guys but I hey
man I spent you know I'm learning
freaking I don't know let's take an
example Python right now right I'm
learning Python in my house I'm going to
coke atom II I'm learning it there I'm
taking clever programmers freaking
course I'm doing this in and then not no
not today
I'm just using an example the people who
are are into Python right now okay I'm
taking this this night I'm taking my
jangle course I'm watching Chris Hawkes
jangle course online I'm learning a lot
right but the jobs is not there for you
Cooney a developer you don't have to
math behind you you don't have to degree
behind you so what does that matter what
why would you want to take of course it
or take anything that is just not gonna
put money in your pocket we're not
getting younger kids like let's be
honest I just turned 30 this
right we're not getting younger right
you know who's who can be doing that and
learning like all this cool technologies
and all this stuff just to learn it some
kegels 17 years old who has no
responsibility doesn't pay brain who's
still in his mom's house you know he got
a good you know let's say from 17 to 23
he got a good six years to you know mess
around and you know play around with
things and and try to become the
smartest kid in the world he has that
time people like me and you we don't
have that time
we got responsibilities we got kids we
got families
we got houses we got mortgages we got
things to pay you know what I mean like
I live in this real world you're gonna
what I'm saying like I don't live in
this fantasy world like you know there's
a lot of people that live in this
fantasy world I've seen somebody was
talking this about this in the podcast
where they were saying man you know not
everybody can go to a boot camp and just
stay for three months and it's like
hello like you just notice that like
people live in this fantasy world where
you know as I hate my mom left me you
know a little trust fund she left me a
hundred thousand dollars and my grandma
left me another fifty thousand dollars I
would live in that world I live in the
world where if I don't work if I don't
make money
I don't eat right now I'm in a Benz
right I'm about to get a new crib if I
don't work if I don't make money somehow
and generate this all of this falls
apart and I mean in some Section eight I
mean some freaking I'm in the hood
somewhere you know going to the corner
store to get a the freaking the fake
Coors Light beer like that's the world
that I live in you know what I mean like
I don't have no backup I don't have no
pillow
so a lot of you guys live in that world
so you live in the real world the world
of hey man if I don't buy my own food I
won't eat if I don't work hard
I won't eat if this thing that we are
doing right now learning to code in
three months if I didn't I didn't get to
get a job I don't get to eat in three
months there's a lot of people that live
in that world just like me you don't say
so when I come in and I'll tell you guys
about certain things it's because I do
my research I go in and you guys know me
you guys know I live in the real world I
don't live in this world of trust funds
I don't live in this world of the
hipsters of my hey man I'm moving to the
you know saying all these hipsters they
moved to the hood they lived their whole
life in in the suburbs and their parents
take care of them they go to this
amazing universities to go study
psychology go study sociology right and
then they move to the city paying twenty
four hundred dollars for a studio and
they can afford it because they live in
this la-la land of basically they've
been taking care of people like me and
you don't live in that world we live in
the real world of hey man we gotta make
you somehow hey man we gotta get a job
hey man we gotta pay for rent we gotta
pay for this net
you know what I mean so that's why I
tell you about Ruby on Rails because
right now this heart is hard for you
guys who are junior developers guys who
are self-taught I don't I could care
less you know somebody comes in and
tells me hey man
you know right now or you know other
college graduates are you know they're
getting jobs in Python like it's really
hot right now I could care less for that
because that's not my audience that's
not the people that I relate to those
people have nothing to do with me those
people don't even follow me you know
what I mean those people are not on this
channel there's very few people who come
in is like oh yeah I got a computer
science degree like a very very few
people less than one percent other
people that follow me are from that
crowd so I can't come in and give you
guys advice as if I'm giving advice for
that crowd because that's not gonna work
for you guys the majority of you guys I
have to take care of the majority of you
guys I have to give you guys real advice
real things you know like we don't live
in that world
like I don't know what you guys I don't
live in that world I live in the world
where you know I have to make sure that
whatever I study if I'm gonna come home
and not spend time with my son I have to
study something that's gonna make money
and give me money I don't live in a
fantasy world man you know so everything
that I do is surrounded around that
like from David Michelle that was a
great question because I want you guys
to understand that a lot of you guys
already understanding I live in a real
world I do not live in the world of hey
man let's study the cool things that's
out here just for us to learn now if you
guys want to do that go to fun fun
function go to the coding training go to
whatever whatever channels out there
right the guys that they make their
their channels about showing you the
cool things like hey let's connect some
a couple of WebSockets and you know
let's turn off a light without you know
a freaky game Arduino or some freaking
Raspberry Pi do you really think I have
time to be playing with a
Raspberry Pi right now like let's be
honest do you think somebody like me has
time to be playing with a Raspberry Pi I
don't live in that world I'm not in that
world to just spend you know spend time
on things that's not gonna pay you off I
just don't you know every single one of
you guys that know me already I know who
I am already my name is Joe Santos
Garcia I'm just like you guys I started
from the bottom and everything that I do
is to make sure that you guys learn
everything from me that I've learned
over the years of making mistakes and
over the years of of just wasting time
with things
I've wasted time before but I've been
doing this for too long now how do I
look like wasting three four hours of
your time here and be like hey guys
let's run nodejs on a Raspberry Pi you
tell me what better what's the benefit
in that it's not gonna put some money in
your pocket right now
you get what I'm saying I live in this
world with like man I gotta get a job I
gotta give people jobs I got to listen
that and that's where I live man I don't
have time to waste your time that's how
I look at it word I just I wanna help
you guys out man
I just feel bad sometimes like like the
other day when this kid Charles he asked
me about that course and the course the
first thing the guy goes I hate I don't
want you guys to you know waste your
time learning things that is not
beneficial to you like jQuery like PHP
and it's like wait what do you know what
the hell you're talking about like you
know how many companies out here are
using jQuery you know how many freaking
design shops are still using jQuery like
people are junior developers like this
people be acting like as if they're
making courses for people who are
mid-level to senior developers but for
me it's a waste of time to learn jQuery
I'm beyond that I already passed that
the companies that I work for they don't
even use jQuery anymore but that's
because I already passed that stage when
you're making courses your audience is
people who are coming out of other you
know other fields guys who were working
for kong addison guys who were bus
drivers guys who were you know at some
point that we're interesting in
technology but life hit them you know
and then they had to work at a fire
factory and they're like you know what
man I've seen this commercial on udemy
maybe I should take a course those are
the people that are taking the courses
main level to see me a level developers
is not taking no freaking courses on
udemy this is what people keep
forgetting like me myself I take you to
my courses for fun to review the
developers to review the instructors but
not because I need it because what I
have to do is look at the documentation
once you get to a certain point right
you only you learn stuff from the
documentation you know you don't even
learn that good when you look at videos
that's being honest you get to a certain
point when you're like hey man this guy
on this video he's taking 30 minutes to
explain something that could take me
five minutes when I look at it and the
documentation for that because I've
already achieved that level I already
been doing this for a while for somebody
who's a brand-new developer who was like
hey man I don't even know how to install
node I don't even know how to do this
what developer starter kit like I need a
video that's your audience when you make
video courses you know what I really
like even the guys who read books that's
not even the same audience the audience
that read books is not the same audience
that basically watches videos and that's
something that a lot of instructors
don't understand when people come in
here and they're watching your videos
even people from YouTube people from
YouTube is not the same audience that
somebody that's reading a book or
somebody that can go into a
documentation and learning themselves or
even even guys like you know like let's
say traversing media right traversing
media his channel is amazing I love it
because I go in there and when he
releases something like a crash course
it's great for me because he goes in
explains it quick and that's it and
that's all I needed and I already
learned whatever language or whatever
framework that I didn't even know
existed I just learned
that quake on that crash course well do
you think somebody who is a brand-new
developer who has no idea of what's
going on do you think they learn from
that you don't learn from the crash
course it doesn't work like that because
somebody needs the whole explanation of
this how you install this this is how
you do this and that and that's why for
the guys who like controversy media go
check out his courses on on udemy he
goes deep into it he has a great arm
I believe our angular course if you're
looking to learn angular go check out
his angular course he goes deep into it
why you think he's giving you all that
free content on YouTube is ready to be a
crash course
you know it's for you to understand
something quicker but all cool this how
it looks
I'm interest in it but definitely you
have to go in check out his course to
really understand they're really
learning you know what I mean
because when even this girl said it
what's her name
real tough candy she said it you know
when you watch what the guy's name Derek
bananas or bananas or whatever banana
band is something I forgot his name when
you watch us take his video those videos
are horrible those videos are horrible
for junior developers guys who are just
learning those videos are horrible
because what's happening there is you
just seen somebody go over a whole
programming language in one hour and you
didn't even get to pick up anything you
don't understand that when is it that
you got to use certain things why you
use it you need more explanation you
know what I mean but this all to say in
answer that question from David Purcell
and wild Omak
like I said guys everything that I do
I do it for a reason my decisions on
things is on jobs if tomorrow they was
to be like hey man every single job for
Ruby on Rails is filled I will tell you
I be like hey man you lost the boat man
you missed out that boat and that's just
how it is you know when I was doing like
Ruby on Rails a year and a half ago
around she was it from January from
January 2016 to I would say like July
2016 I was working at a company doing
Ruby on Rails at that point they wanted
to hire other developers and they wanted
to just get mid-level to see me level
developers because they just don't want
to they don't want to help people out
they don't wanna it's annoying
I'll be honest when you're a senior
developer and you got a hold somebody
hand and then be like oh how do I
connect the models to you know to the
database how do I do
how do I do this how do you do a
many-to-many relationships you want to
pull your hair you want to freakin pull
your hair you're like I got to do
and you asking me about beginners
right you don't want to do with your
knee developers but when you're the only
senior developer there and there's no
developers period there's no mid-level
there's no senior level developers you
have to take him you're like man I guess
we gotta have to hire some some junior
developers man and that's what's
happening right now a lot of companies
they just they have to hire you guys
because it's just there's not that many
people a lot of people are jumping ship
they jump into a lot of other cool
things like golang and you're liq sir
they jump into other you've been
doing it for five to ten years you don't
want to be doing Ruby on Rails for
another 15 years you know what I mean
like that's just how it is developers
jump companies man they jump from
companies to companies you know the
people that you hear oh yeah I was with
a company for 20 years those people are
the exception
those guys are weird because that means
you've been doing the same for 20
years the only way for you to start
doing different things is when you jump
to another company
so yeah man we ain't here man we just we
just having a conversation man don't
want you guys to think some people they
think when when I scream or when I get
excited I'm upset now this how I took
this one when I'm hyped when I might go
where we gotta out you gotta let the
people know what it is
that's what's going on but I love that
question
a lot of you guys are so used to the BS
of people the BS of people of my gaming
you know what
today we're we're releasing this new
course so now for the next month two
months we're gonna be talking about Ruby
on Rails because this is what we have to
promote guys you know don't give us I'm
not gonna curse because we got to get we
gotta get some views from this video so
I'm not gonna curse but you know I don't
give up fill in the blank you know I
don't give a damn about
like hey guys we got a promote this is
where the money's at you know where the
money's at PyCon right now
whoever's over here creating courses for
Python it's like a gold mine right now
I've seen guys what's this guy's name on
send text right send text I think does
his channel he's been making Python
courses item courses the are from I
don't know from probably like almost
like five seven years old and he's
making a killing reader on udemy or
YouTube because he has those Python
courses that are old he's like reselling
them they're making him money writer
like Python is hot
you got clever programming he making
money right now
you know I told Chris Hawkes the other
day I'm like bro you know Python kind
why aren't you making you know releasing
your courses on Python or you know
getting it out there this guy is making
money out here from Python that in
reality shouldn't even be making no
money out of it you know I mean but
that's just how it is
me I don't go for that I don't go for
the things I find that I give value when
people come in and you know how many
people send me emails and
and I just come in man I got a job I
listen to you he literally said this I
got a screenshot this and I'm gonna just
cover his face cuz I don't want to put
everybody's business out there but he
literally and literally said to me he's
like man this is crazy
I've been taking you know cold steel's
cause I've been taking a couple of
people's courses on udemy and after
doing three or four of your projects
that you had on your website I found a
job right away I put it on my portfolio
I basically I changed them around change
the themes change the colors made in my
own way which is what you guys should do
you should not be showing off like let's
say a project you did with the exact
same images the same freaking background
same colors asked whatever the
instructor shows you you're supposed to
change it around you're supposed to use
whatever you learn they're recreated
again but in another application so
that's what this kid did and he has a
job you know it's like it happens
constantly you know what I mean I don't
follow the trends I follow the trends of
where the jobs are at I don't want you
guys to come in you know like I've seen
people with with this like hey man it's
like man you know I got three 4Â° man
and then you ask some where you live at
and they like oh yeah nah
you know still can't are you doing on
section 8 it's like you know I wanted to
study anthropology in in a little bit of
sociology you know then then I said you
know let me just get a sociology master
it's like where's your brain this should
be like a there should be like I don't
know like a requirement through life
like you know right when you you just
come out to sperm like somebody needs to
be there where like uh you know like a
bouncer right before you get to the egg
this should be like a bouncer right
there
and just real I hate anybody we only let
him people that use their brains you can
only come out and you can only be born
unless you gotta be used your brain
right there's people running around
walking around like I don't know what do
they do it with their brain like they
don't use it it's like your brain is the
most beautiful amazing muscle that you
have in your body I don't even know is a
it's the brain up or organized a target
it's like a muscle I don't know
well it's like the most beautiful things
that you see is there for a reason it's
not just to so think about dumb ideas
it's about using it putting it to use
you know it's like come on man if you're
gonna study sign hole here I want people
to like you know if we was in a
classroom right now I would say guys who
here wants to spend eight hours in front
of a computer trying to learn stuff in
trying to learn languages just to say
hey guys I know this language I know
this language I know this language but
then at the end you have nothing to show
for you have no benefits you have no no
money to take vacation you have you're
walking around in a freaking 2001 Honda
like what was you doing you got what I'm
saying like that's how I look at things
and it's not that
hey material things is everything but at
the same time it's like you know like
have something for yourself you gotta
have something to show for working sucks
I'll be honest working it doesn't matter
could be the best job in the world is
worked you're working for somebody
you're working at a company you're
working for a client work is work nobody
wants to do work it doesn't matter what
you do nobody wants to be doing no work
for nobody
right so if you're gonna work for
somebody you gotta have something to
show for you want to come in you know
the worst thing that could happen to
somebody is going to work every single
day never missing a day of work go on a
sunny day go on a snowy day go on a
rainy day you still show up to work
right and then you realize that there's
people out there they have a better life
than you more money than you they drive
a better car than you but they don't
work as hard as you that sucks
you get what I'm saying so people have
to use their brains down days it's like
man you gotta go hard and you gotta go
hard and but you gotta go hard on the
right things
you can't just try to learn everything
out here you guys are junior developers
you can't just focus on things just
because you see on a blog just because
you see it oh it looks cool yeah it
looks cool I'll spend five ten minutes
on it I'll create my own application
cool that's it move on you learned it it
was great that same but you have to do
things that pay off things that's gonna
get you a job
trust me guys you don't want to be here
telling a story like ant-man it took me
two years to get a job as a developer
yeah dummy he was doing all all the
things that was not needed you spent two
years learning technologies that in your
neighborhood and your freakin 50-mile
radius there's no jobs for you dummy
like that's on you
you know what I mean that's like people
right now I'm going to study IT there's
no freaking challenge why would somebody
hire somebody as an IT worker when
there's all this old people right I went
to school my first degree was in a
freakin NIT it was programming his
systems one of the biggest mistakes of
my whole life I could have done computer
science if I wanted to but then I said
oh no IIT is close to computer science
I'm gonna be programming and it's like
now you're gonna be connecting Printers
kid that's one of my biggest regrets
right so I want to do IT a lot of people
do IT you know I was one of the guys
watching you know this guy what's his
name II like the computer guy back in
2011 I was one of those guys watching
that channel I was like oh man I T and
you know IP addresses and and connecting
printers and this and that this is gonna
give me money and then it's like then
you realize the Mo's you're gonna make
is like fifty sixty thousand dollars and
the people that make money are like the
managers and those guys never
retire the guys's I remember had a
manager who was like 78 years old as an
IT worker what the hell are you doing 78
years old
go retire so somebody could come
in and take that position and they could
grow in this field
this guy 78 years old still as a manager
that was like that's like a dead-end job
you're not going to win if you become an
IT worker you're not going to work
there's no jobs the Indians got it on
lock people working remotely working for
like $5 there's no jobs in that field
people get a freaking hike folders get
laid off left and right
you know you got to use your brain on
here man and that's all I'm saying
you know this whole video this whole
video is about basically explaining to
people like I live in a world where I
live a reality dies I will my world is
if I somehow mess this up
right if I somehow don't do the right
things all those things that I have
around me you know I don't even know
like this the regular there's the
regular for me you know I'll use this to
show off this is the regular for me like
this is not YouTube money this is not
courses money this is money that I get
from making websites right this is about
three thousand dollars in you Oh
hundreds nothing for hundreds blue
cheese the money wait the blue cheese
wait right and that's because everything
that I do I specifically focus around
money everything that I do is money
everything I do is jobs I don't study
things that's not gonna pay me I'm
there's no point of me coming in here
and becoming a freakin a pearl master
you know camel is no camel hostel master
like Dana giving you whop like that
they're not giving you money like that
like it's just not all of this right
here was from literally a WordPress
website like this is a WordPress website
I don't even know if I have to report
this $3,000 I don't even have to tell
nobody I made that 3,000 this was just
some Craig's this money this is what I
call cranks this much somebody needs a
website that I hey man can you build me
a wordpress site yeah I could build your
WordPress site
knock it out real quick
and since I already built a whole bunch
of WordPress sites I'm pretty much just
gonna copy and paste the same thing that
I did before putting an extra plugin and
for anything I'll call the plug-in
myself and that's it
while people are telling you don't study
PHP don't study WordPress don't do this
and then don't study jQuery don't go
into Ruby on Rails don't jump on
anything guys I live in a real world I
don't live in that world of let's do
things to be smart now you could be
smart and be broken out I'll be with
money out here you know what I mean like
that's how I look at it just saying
Joe slinging code right here now I'm
just saying man like you know especially
for people like straight up so be honest
with you guys especially for people who
are coming from other careers let's say
right now you work at a company and you
show that you you realize as $60,000 is
the most you gonna get let's say you was
a bus driver this is just an example cuz
I have people here who are from all type
of ranges and all type of different
careers and different type of jobs let's
say you spend seven years in a company
and you realize I'm a freaking bus
driver and the most I'm more people
making is $60,000 and for me to get to
$80,000 I'm gonna have to spend another
five years in here and you're like I
wanna switch careers to becoming a
developer Ruby on Rails to be honest
with you guys is the highest paying one
for web developers when it comes to like
junior developers like you start good
like a good 70 80 that's the starting
point
so that's up to you if you want to learn
it that's up to you if you want to go
for it you know I'm just here supplying
you guys with the reality of things
supplying you guys with things that I
see that worked I hate I hate I've hated
when I had to come in it and learn stuff
that maybe nobody I don't you know like
I'll be keep bringing this up like
beauty is like guys I went spent five
hours learning through this whole thing
created a couple applications until this
freaking day man I haven't made $1.00 of
UGS that was one of my biggest regrets
not even waste of time learning that
 like there's no money in it it
looks cool
those grateful personal freaking
projects but there's no money nobody's
hiring for a few J as developers
nobody's coming out to me and be like
hey we're looking for a few Jas
developer they just not so I wasted
father five hours of my time learning
that you get what I'm saying that's a
waste of time
nothing that was a waste of time for me
was learning codeigniter that was a
waste of time because the companies that
are hiring for CodeIgniter our company
is that I would never work there it's
like old people freaking guys wearing
suits guys that are like you know you
know how they wear the the button-down
shirts the polo shirts a whole bunch of
nerdy dudes with polo shirts and slacks
those are the type of companies that use
code igniters I don't want to be around
those people
that's not my crowd that's not the
people I want to be around it working on
the same type of e-commerce websites
from 1998 I'm not working there so
codeigniter was a waste of time that's
like dinette dinette I went to a couple
of interviews I started learning down
there now putting a lot of hours into it
and yes there's a lot of jobs but then
that's at the same time you gotta also
think it's not all about the money or
even about the jobs because if you're
not comfortable in certain type of
people I don't want to be around people
that do down there I'll be honest I just
I'm not comfortable
it's guys or squares guys who are like
talking about Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons guys
who are like not my type of crowd you
know you come in and you talk to them
about some music they're like Oh golly
like you know we're still listening to
you know freaking Metallica and whatever
is like bro this is not the type of
crowd I want to be around so learning
dotnet was not for me that was a waste
of time you know sometimes you gotta do
the research you know you got to do the
research of the way of life the way of
you know life and work situations you
know a lot of these companies - they
want you to work freaking high coders
like that you guys remember that last
interview I went to the last one I was
like yo I'm not going to no more
interviews if if I have to be dealing
with it they would things like this this
guy was like oh yeah it's like we see
that you you do a little tutoring and
some YouTube on the side you know we
usually like to have our employees
basically just focus on us do you think
you you are ready to do you know to
leave that behind and you know you do
that like a a hobby and I looked at the
- like what the hell are you talking
about like
once I clock out from here mind your
business you know I'm that type of
person like I clocked out mind your
business
don't worry about what I do if I wanted
to be if I wanted to become literally
like a dude that's just like freaking
Arno who has a crazy life who parties
all the time or whatever if I come in at
nine o'clock in the morning I'll leave
out of here six o'clock mind your
business that's not your business
whatever I do outside my job mind your
damn business but these people they want
to control your life tea you know so you
gotta find the right company to it's not
always just about the money because
somebody could come in and pay you a lot
of money and then literally want to
control your life like worried like I
just work here from 9:00 to 5:00 when I
clock out I don't know you if I see your
Christmas tree I'm crossing the other
way because I don't want to talk to you
I'm one of those dudes you know what I
mean and one of those people like I work
with you but it doesn't mean I'm your
friend
doesn't mean I want to talk to you
outside of work that's just who I am
you know I mean I got I can come in do
my job
but don't worry if I do you too don't
worry if I do my website or if I make
any sign income like this people didn't
even want me to to do like freelancing
like I've been freelancing my whole
career like who the hell is you to tell
me hey man we want you to focus you know
sometimes we we might want you to come
in on Saturdays soon as he said that I
said
man I don't think this is the place for
me I don't think I would be a culture
fit for this company it just doesn't
make sense for me
you think I'm gonna go to a company
that's gonna tell me we want you to come
in on a Saturday we want you to leave
your YouTube something that I built it
took me a whole year to build in and
build this relationship with you guys
it's like hey hey guys like you guys
should slap the out of me if you
see me one day come in here and be like
hey guys I'm sorry you know I'm gonna
have to you know not to YouTube no more
because my company told me I need to you
know stay off social media for a while
slap the outta me like are you
crazy
like straight up
sometimes you know this whole video is
about me talking about you know living
in the real world and I don't do things
because they're gonna be profitable
when I come in here and I'll tell you
guys about something
trust me is not profitable for me
profitable for me would be like hey Joe
Joe's making courses for five hundred
dollars and only ten people are gonna be
able to sign up work with those ten
people he just made five thousand
dollars
those are the ways that I could be
making things profitable when I tell you
about Ruby and rails it's not because of
my benefit I get nothing out of it my
benefits is when you guys get hired you
guys and go tell other people hey man I
went to this guy he threw this this
advise on me you helped me out get a job
you should check him out that's the only
benefit that I'm gonna get me coming in
and charging you guys arm and a leg for
course and then you tell the next person
man I went to this person they charge he
charged me an arm and a leg
it took me seven months to find a job
man I don't know if he's the right
person for you that's not what I need in
my life I need more people to come in
then you see how this channel has been
growing naturally I don't need to have a
bunch of subscribers to look like I'm a
big guy on YouTube I don't need a
hundred thousand subscribers to validate
the fact that I'm already making an
impact on YouTube
and everybody knows it every single
channel that's out there knows it guys
who are way bigger than me who who've
done it you know who's done it
organically they respect my ground they
know what I'm doing out here everything
I do is for a reason the people that
don't respect me are usually the people
who are paying for court for freaking
paying for for views because it'll be
nice I'll be honest what it would be
nice that you come here one day and you
look at the channel you were like damn
Joe got 250,000 subscribers oh my god
you know if 250,000 subscribers are
following him he must be the biggest
legit guy in the world
it looks nice right but it looks nice
for the people that don't know you know
what I mean like if I come in you know
when somebody comes into one of my
videos they like my video so no cool
this guy only has 12,000 subscribers oh
he's a cool guy this is cool I'll
subscribe to him right but if there's
somebody who's a junior like somebody
was interested in in web development and
they're like man this guy's talking
about a couple of things and he's given
advice that makes sense but he only got
12,000 subscribers but what would be the
difference if I had a hundred thousand
two hundred thousand subscribers those
people would believe it right away
they'll be like Meg he got two hundred
thousand subscribers he must be the real
deal and that's the illusion that a lot
of people are selling you out here a lot
of people go in and pay for the
subscribers you know it's easy to buy
you know fifty thousand subscribers from
India let's be honest is very cheap you
could buy those subscribers for like
three you know three four I believe it
is twenty seven cents or something like
that
last time I checked
on YouTube the YouTube promotions and
all of that stuff is that you could get
three for 30 cents alright you start
calculating if you go in you say hey I
spent four hundred four four hundred
five hundred dollars a month in six
months I could get a hundred and fifty
thousand subscribers but that's not
quality subscribers that's just me
promoting to India promoting to
Bangladesh promoting to Pakistan
promoting to the Philippines where the
promotion is very cheap and nothing that
those people are not quality subscribers
but it's like you're cheating the game
you're cheating the game of buying
subscribers to make yourself look like a
more legit youtuber more legit the song
developer because people come in and
they're looking for the right answer
they're looking for the right advice and
it just it looks nice when you come in
and you be like man is 250,000 people
following this person so there must be a
reason why they follow away for what
people don't know is like people are
buying those you know I was tempted at
some point around February I was tempted
I was like man I'm growing so slow only
have 2000 subscribers man I want to
reach out to everybody I want to be able
to when I drop a video my video says
five thousand ten thousand views in one
shop I want that I do want it I'll be
honest it would be nice to have five
thousand ten thousand people view you
every single time you drop a video but
what happens is your pain for those
subscribers you pay for those views and
then those people don't stick around you
know anything could come in and you know
it's very fickle people would be like oh
that's a this guy's you know it's like
the net neutrality thing I drop a video
on net neutrality on how I feel my body
like I'm not gonna cry for it
and a lot of people are upset but those
people are upset but they stay here they
stay subscribed now if I go and I'll pay
for subscribers those subscribers are
not loyal to me the subscribers I say
something that they don't like half of
my subscribers is gone because they
wasn't there from the beginning there
wasn't lawyer that wasn't there
organically you know what I mean
you gotta learn how to do this man you
never learn how to come in and just be
yourself you know everything that I do
here on this channel and I'm sorry this
is like what like a one-hour video I'll
Drive him home
you know dropped off wifey and I said
you know what let's talk about this
listen let's go over this and talk about
Ruby and rails and let's go over you
know living in the real world that
versus living in a world of you know
just fantasy you know so people started
like I always bring this up people
studying sociology psychology those
people live in a fantasy world
people that live in the real world they
can't afford to go to to school and go
study I'm gonna study Western
civilization - I'm gonna go study you
know I'm gonna go study freakin
sociology I'm gonna get my masters in
psychology the people are never in this
world that I live in the people that
need to get money to eat money to
survive they can't afford that you know
it's the same thing with people that go
to boot camps a lot of people that go to
the boot camps are people who think like
they gotta it's like a a get rich scheme
for them no yeah I'll just go to this
book heaven and get rich get $100,000 I
don't know what I want to do with my
life I have a trust fund but I don't
know what I should do I started studying
sociology now I wanna study to become
pelipper I'm gonna go to a bootcamp I
get to tell my parents and I get to tell
you know my my friends who are doing
something with their lives oh yeah I
went to a boot camp for three months I'm
studying to become a developer I'm doing
technology now a lot of these people
they don't live in the same world as me
or you like we got to pay I wish I
wish I had the opportunity to say hey
man I'm gonna disappear for three months
and go to a boot camp and all I'm gonna
do is code because I don't need to worry
about if the rent gets paid this month I
don't need to worry about how things are
going</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
