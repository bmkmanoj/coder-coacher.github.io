joke back at it again man coding
face.com
listen alright so your boy Joe was hurt
I'm on some Derrick Rose oh my leg
hurt like crazy I don't know how I got
hurt they took me off the game early
right now I'm subbed yeah destinies
today's show your boy is hurt I don't
know why man but you know especially
every time that I'm stressed
some always happens every single
time it's really annoying I don't know
why like when I'm stressed out like I
get like physical like like I see you
physically you know what I mean like
like my leg hurts like crazy
somehow I I stepped the wrong way my
foot got like this big right now they
got super fat last night so when I came
out of work I took off my sneakers and
my just look like this bro like
this bro wait just crazy
to all the stuff that we're doing at
work then I'm gonna see exactly what a
helmet you know like I seriously I wanna
I want to do YouTube full-time and I
want to be like you know I want to be
like this guy's eye traversing me the
Steven Grindr just create tutorials
create courses create like I'm this
close to like the same I don't want to
be dealing with it like companies and
 like that because I already did it
for so long already
you know it's like I wanna I'm getting
bored with it I'll be honest with you
guys I'm I'm really getting bored like I
want to challenge myself on and do
something else already it's like I love
coding I love web development but
there's a difference like working for
somebody else and another company is
like you don't you don't have control of
what happens in that company sometimes
people up sometimes people do the
wrong things or sometimes people just
throw at you as a developer and
they think like hey we have this idea
just get it done and it doesn't work
like that you know and sake and I
suppose like let's say like this we were
supposed to hand in a website that was
supposed to take a whole month you know
a whole month for another month it's
gonna take another whole month
right to finish but somehow people want
it done by Sunday because on Monday they
were not releasing and it's like it's
almost impossible so we're going to
release this website with a whole bunch
of problems a whole bunch of issues and
just because people you know they want
to push it live right away but what does
that do you know now we got to work
extra hours
now we're really like super tired and
then on top of that we know that when it
comes to Monday and we release the
website there's going to be a million
bugs and a million mistakes and people
call calling customer service oh this is
this isn't working for me oh oh I'm in
this page I can't see
my thing oh I'm trying to fill out this
form and it's not working so now when it
comes to next week it's going to be even
more stressful because now you got to
hurry up you got to hurry the up
and fix those those bugs because there's
a large website and it's the business
you know so for you guys I want to
become web developers you know there's
moments where you're going to be like
what the like there's a reason why
you get paid a lot of money it's not
because it is easy in yeah
coding out in the coding part is easy
the part that's not easy as dealing with
people people's expectations people who
think like you know people who have no
technical background will think like oh
yeah we could just make this happen and
it doesn't work like that or people who
just don't don't understand what's a
front-end and wasn't a back-end
developer or people who just don't
understand like in general what's the
process of building a website and not
only just a website a web application
because you can build the website
anybody could build a website you could
go to wix.com and build a website but to
build a web application it takes time
and it takes a lot of work and a lot of
man-hours and there's certain things
that no matter how much money you throw
at it or how many people you throw at it
you're not gonna solve it until there's
an X amount of hours put into it you
know what I mean like we could go in
there and say hey we're going to create
I don't know we got to create a
app that makes your phone fly alright
and you're going to throw 50 thousand
developers to work on that just on that
application alone but everybody knows
it's going to take more than that it's
not going to be just how many developers
are working on it but it's going to take
time to develop the technology
is going to take time to figure out how
the hardware is going to work it's going
to take time to do a whole bunch of
to plan things out to testing key wait
the out of the app like it takes a
long time so even if you throw money at
it
owners think like oh we are going to
throw money at you guys like here extra
money bonuses and all this extra
and it's like yeah but you can't
fast forward time you know what I mean
like no matter what so for me like the
reason why I'm feeling stressed out is
because it's like I haven't had a
 weekend to just relax
like I haven't had time to just
relax all this time and I've
been telling a lot of people around me
I'm like yo June the end of a
 maze gotta be beyond stressful I
need a weekend done either time
to just shut the up and relax go to
sleep stay you know stay sleeping late
like I need to get some rest
because I know this was going to
happen and like now I got a deal
with math at work and somehow make
all this happen
tired with a up leg then
do all this and somehow get it done
 pisses me the off but yeah
man this what developer lunch brings man
you know sometimes you gonna get good
topics sometimes you're gonna get me
just here talking to my peoples
sometimes you're just gonna be like you
know my diary you know I'm a
coming here and just spell it all out
well you know let it all out and just
like you know like this how it
is
I'm gonna speak a little Brazilian let
me see what do I know vs. Valeo valve
LOLOL Oh poop check check
touch it Chuck man I want some bunda
that's what I want nice mullet yeah man
yeah man that's the thing
yeah no I mean that's the goal that's
the goal to create some passive income
and I swear like at one point like I
told you guys at one point like I'm just
stacking up saving money at one point
I'm just gonna open up my own business
or you know that's why I want to finish
coding face.com just so that's like my
my golden ticket you know to start my
own company and either maybe even start
my own boot camp like but not charging
people ten twenty thousand dollars this
this girl home send me something from I
forgot her name she's always here love
Dominican girl I think she's the making
I'm sorry if I ever you're not she from
the Bronx she sent me a message about
this boot camp that's in the Bronx
that's free for students I'm gonna make
a video about it at one point I'm gonna
see if maybe I could go to that boot
camp not because I I need to go to a
boot camp but because I want to
interview the people there and I want to
share people's stories because I think
that's great you know you go to a boot
camp and basically we don't know if the
boot camp is good the boot camp is bad
but just the fact that people are are
giving our courses to people and
training them for free which I think
nothing that every boot camp should be
free because my problem with boot camps
is now that they're expanding their
 expensive or whatever I just
think like they charging way too much
money for just three months of training
this boot camp which is free it's like
they give courses every single day plus
stay there you know you can pass by go
swimming by talk to people talk to your
peers so I think that's super cool and
it's like it's like a good good place to
networking and get to know new new
people is how because it's also you know
they're focusing on bringing
more blacks and Latinos into the
industry and I think that's great man
like I really do I really think that's
amazing so I want to go to that boot
camp to pass by and get to interview a
couple of people maybe give a talk there
you know so yeah if I was to open up a
boot camp that's what I would do I wound
up a free boot camp a place where people
you know oh it would be enough profit
was a non profit not-for-profit
non-profit boot camp where I will help
people and like I will pay myself from
donations and all this stuff and pay
whoever other instructors are there for
donations but it wouldn't be a place
where I'll be like hey man we gotta get
that quota we got to make sure these
guys they graduate in three months so we
could get another you know three hundred
thousand dollars in the next course or
the next class or whatever how would
they make their money you know like I
wouldn't want to do it like that but
yeah so I'm definitely thinking about
opening up my own business you know I'm
laughing I was an after night work cuz
I'm telling my girlfriend she does like
DIYs and all of the stuff and like she's
really good you know I'm really proud of
her she she posted something up on Etsy
all right and somebody bought it for
like fifty something dollars and I'm our
ocean nice you know fifty dollars a
little fifty dollar sale that's not bad
you know that's like selling it you know
selling two dubs out here in the hood
you know what I mean
awesome good you know selling a
couple of dubs and then also she she got
her first sale but then she goes and the
girls Center um you know she's supposed
to receive it by tomorrow and then my
girlfriend's gonna send it today and I'm
like yo you're already up on
your business
y'all like if somebody buys it on Sunday
you're supposed to send it by Monday
you know processing the most is supposed
to take a day or two you're taking a
whole week to
just process it and send it you know so
I was like but it's cool I like that
she's doing her own thing cuz that would
be hot you know open it up I want
business and and maybe doing something
together like you know maybe I'll help
her out and create a website for her so
she don't have to sell it through Etsy
and she could just have her own dot-com
where she'll sell oh you know DIY things
that she wants to sell so yeah
but yeah man was good was good everybody
man word yeah back in the days when I
used to push that young pusher somebody
sent me a message like hey man
programmer by date drug dealer
by night oh my god I mean it's not true
well you started laughing when I go if I
can people are crazy
other than PHP laravel react are you
using anything else on your job yes
Perl which is like a super old
technology and that's why we created
this new website in laravel because we
walking away from Perl
yeah
yeah pearl sounds crazy
like who the hell uses Pearl in 2017
but the company that I work for has been
around for over 15 years so think about
it they start in 2001 you know so you
know what I mean so it takes time
sometimes when a company they're making
money and they're like oh yeah
we're making money but then they don't
update their their systems it's like you
know all those banks they haven't
updated the system since God knows when
you know like it just takes too much
time to just change platform
oh yeah man
 it's crazy I don't even know how I
got hurt man my leg hurts man
last night I couldn't even walk
back in here you already know
Mandela effects that I want to start
with C++ after listening to you John
yeah I mean you can mess around with C++
you know C++ or C sharp mess around with
it I would definitely if you want to
start with C you know if you really want
to do C you can mess around with C you
know but if you're looking for a job
right away
I think c-sharp will be the best place
for you like you go I'll also do game
development unity uses c-sharp
what else a whole bunch of software uses
c-sharp
so you know if it wasn't because of
Microsoft maybe I will mess around with
c-sharp but you know besides that and
then I don't wanna mess around with it
coding phase how you find your current
job was his direct application or
recruiter trying to figure out best way
to get a job I'm learning es6 and react
right now have laravel personal projects
basically from recruiters like i have it
really gone on my way to find a job in
like four years
like the past four years is it's like
even right now i get like a million
emails from recruiters that's why i know
that I'm good like I'm good because god
forbid like I was so you know
get fired from my job or god forbid I
 I lose my job or whatever it is
right like I could find a job literally
the next week because so many people
send me emails I came we want you and we
want you we want to reward you we want
you and then only that if I wanted to do
just um you know contract work like
remote or any stuff like that land I
don't know if you guys have heard of
creative circle look
get up you guys should definitely join
what they do is they basically find jobs
for developers artists graphic artists
what designers UI designers and
basically like let's say an example
that's how I work for a whole bunch of
companies like you know I did the Viacom
I'd a random house I did a whole bunch
of companies you could look it up in the
video I'm not gonna be over here talking
about it like I want to show off
whatever but um yeah through
create a circle date they found all
those jobs for me like I didn't have to
do anything like they put me they
connected me to a whole bunch of
companies and like most of the time
they'll tell you like hey it's a
contract for three months six months a
year two years and then sometimes if
they like you they'll keep you me
personally at that time when I was doing
creative circle a lot I didn't want to
stay in one company because I like the
idea of jumping around from company to
company and working on different
projects and then now as I got older
because of benefits and because of you
know whatever I guess I'm getting old I
decided to start working in companies
for longer time but for a long time I
was just working like you know three
months here 6 months here one month over
there two months over here like I was
doing that for a wife like two two years
I was doing that but it was cool I liked
it because I got to meet so many people
and it just it made me a better
developer because I wasn't just working
in one company like right now like let's
say an example like you guys could go
get high right now so junior developer
somewhere and if you stay there let's
say their stack is no js' right so for
the next five years all you do is no js'
you become really good I know GS but
then something happens in the company
they gotta let you go or you quit or you
don't like whatever somebody in then
you're like you I'm leaving now you
basically starting from scratch meaning
all you know is no GS and JavaScript
whatever but
I was jumping around like I know Ruby on
Rails I know JavaScript I know uh almost
every front-end well not every
single one but backbone angular or react
what else messed around with you like I
know view I could go in there and
somebody tells me hey we got this
project in view I could do it because I
already messed around with it so yeah
like Ruby on Rails Larry Bell on Java
what else I messed around with c-sharp
but it was mostly me as a front-end
developer connected to a c-sharp back on
back-end what else no Jay is like
there's so much that I learned over
the past five years because I was
jumping around so I know if I would have
stayed in one company then all I would
know is just like one or two
technologies that say and that happens
all the time to like you know all the
developers like you meet people who you
be like Oh have you heard of this new
front-end framework have you ever heard
of this this library data and they'll be
like nah because they bring in this
bubble of like working for this one
company and they never experienced
anything else so then you know those
people who you look online this is
hilarious
I've looked online and I've seen
comments where people be like oh I'm a
Java developer I'm a c-sharp developer
and I'm signing up to this boot camp for
nodejs and I'm like wait you're signing
up to be in a boot camp for nodejs
but you are ready a developer like what
part of the game is that like to me that
sounds like retarded you're already a
developer and you want to join a boot
camp because you want somebody to
validate you and give you a little stamp
in the back that says hey this person
took some training in nodejs
like bro look at a tutorial on
YouTube going udemy and you
learn no js' it's not that difficult
like you're already a developer
Oh No like that's one of the reasons - I
get madder at bootcamp - because there's
so many people in there in those boot
camps that they already have to grease
their already computer science major
they already developers they're like
there's people who are I Oh s developers
and I oh I want to be a back-end
developer so now I'm gonna go to a boot
camp any kinda up the statistics
of it because somebody has a brand new
developer they go into this boot camps
and they're like oh yeah I'm gonna learn
a lot in three months because 90% of
their other people or their you
know they graduate they get jobs and
when nobody tells you is like there's so
many people in those boot camps
who are just insecure and they just need
a little pat on their back so they
already developers they just need
somebody to tell them hey give them a
little pat on the back like hey buddy
you know nodejs now here's a
certificate you know what I mean like
this people like that you know that they
just need to be validated especially all
the developers who they come from the
windows background you know c-sharp and
all this other because they think
that you know like back in the days it's
like you go you go get your a plus
certification or you go get your Cisco
certification or you go get this other
 and as I bro you don't need a
 certification you don't need
somebody to come in and give you and
give you a little pat on the
back and tells you hey you took three
months now you're a developer I know Jay
has developer like come on
yeah you know what I mean so do you
think there will be a discrimination or
someone starts development career at 40
plus no I think you gotta have something
also coming in like you can't go into a
job interview and be like hey and you
look super old and you be like eh I'm a
junior developer I think if you're old
I'll be honest if you're older developer
somebody who's starting from scratch
don't go into a job interview saying hey
I'm a junior developer prepare yourself
because what you're doing is you're
basically putting yourself at the same
level as a little high school student a
little college student and you have more
to give than that you know what I mean
like you have 40 years of experience of
life experience let's say 20 years of
life experience that are 21 2000 18
year-old doesn't have so you have to
bring those things and be like here I'm
on you know I'm a comment like you know
when somebody's like 30-something
40-something they know what they got to
do at the job there's a certain
responsibility that they have they don't
 around they dare to get work done
you know so don't go to a job interview
something telling them like hey I want
to become up I'm here applying for a
junior developer and you're like fifty
something like no apply for jobs as a
developer when I hear I'm a developer
but I'm willing to take that junior
position because I want to work that's
it don't go in there with this little
face of being scared of like oh my god
I'm 40-something years old and I'm a
junior developer don't do it you gotta
give yourself value all those he is that
you've been working other industries and
all those years that you can work in
through life
they count for something they count for
experience they count for you being a a
a great employee
somebody that that's been around for a
long time and knows how important
deadlines are that knows how important
being in the business is you know it's
like that's what you got to go in there
with don't worry about your age
of course they definitely count you know
because it's like when you go in as a
developer you apply it somewhere your
plans are developer man don't put
yourself you know like a little high
school student loan you know college
freshman can go in but oh yeah I'm gonna
plan for a junior developer you're in
day you're going forty something years
old you're 40-something is all grown-ass
man and you gotta put yourself in the
same position as a 20 21 years
old like no you're somebody will
life experience with we have experience
and as an employee
give yourself value all you have to do
is what I tell everybody is you got to
prepare yourself you got to go in there
as if you've been working for years you
can't go in there thinking all nervous
like oh my god they're gonna ask me
questions about this this and this as I
know if you know how to build a web page
you're good there's gonna be more
complicated high coolest questions
depending on where you apply to but
that's fine if somebody comes in and a
brand new developer and you try to apply
a
shorting up this array you know
what I'll do it
straight up I'm not even learning since
you guys like I'll look at it I'll be
like you know what I don't need this

I'm not going to waste my time half an
hour half an hour an hour that's good
putting me finding out some
 riddle for you that's how I look
at it
ya know how I feel about sorting
trees and paradigm
The Situation's that are are very are
they're needed but if you're going to a
job for front-end developer what of you
need to be sorting out anything you're
not engineering I want it as anything
you going in
you know
the the
they use a
then it's not
I just got to my uh parking lot
is over
but every time I get here there's barely
any service you got anywhere because
this thing is already hot enough all
