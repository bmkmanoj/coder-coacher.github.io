again coding face.com
five tips to help you pricey project
your body on your mind tip number one
make sure you do the research on the
client meaning find out how much money
do they have and how do you find that
out let's say if a client comes to you
and they say hey we need a website for a
restaurant find out how big is the
restaurant find out how the layout of it
is right you can actually tell if they
have money or not if they don't have
money then you gotta lower the prices a
little bit you gotta work with them okay
number two make sure that you write down
all of the features that they want you
to build that's the first thing right
and then once you have that then you
finalize it right you say okay you want
me to have user authentication you wanna
have a forum you wanna have a section
for users to upload or a gallery you
want a section for users to be able to
follow other users that whole system you
have to build it but you need to put in
a piece of paper or in a PDF somewhere
where you're both signing and it says
hey this is what we came into agreement
this is what we actually want all right
and at the end that's the only way that
you're gonna save yourself the headaches
of having extra things coming up and
people changing their mind halfway
through the project there's like nah we
actually agree to this in the beginning
that's what I'm getting paid for number
three make sure you add into
consideration to the project assets
meaning we're talking about photos do
you need a photographer to come into the
business and take the photos for you do
you need to pay your service for
licensing different type of images right
because you can't get sued if you go out
and create a website for them and then
you just copy and paste a whole bunch of
images from the internet they love that
photographers love that because that's
how they make their money right so you
don't want to be a victim to that so you
have to put that on piece of paper and
hey man we're gonna need a couple of
images for this and on top
we might need a designer so now you have
to hire a designer okay if you are
coming in and you're doing the whole
project yourself
number four put down either on the
contract or a verbal agreement somewhere
where you say hey this is how many
revisions we can actually have for the
project a lot of times you will come in
and build the whole website and then now
people want to change everything around
it's like wait wait wait wait hold on we
didn't have that in the scope so why are
we changing this now when we're like a
week away okay so make sure you keep in
there
hey there's got to be two revisions
before the ending of the project number
five make sure that if somebody tells
you hey I need this in three months but
you know damn well this is supposed to
take five months you charge them very
well for that because that means you're
gonna be nights without no sleep
weekends without hanging out with your
family or your friends and you just
gotta be miserable
it happens you know what I mean you're
gonna be overworked so if you're gonna
work all those extra hours make sure you
get paid very well a lot of times we are
very nice and we say yeah okay well do
this no don't say cool I'll do this
you'll be like nah you know what this is
gonna take way longer and actually I'm
if I'm gonna have to do it by a set date
I need to get paid those extra hours so
now it's up to you to decide how you
gonna charge them all right guys make
sure you subscribe make sure you like

this list you let me know this video is
brought to you by coding phase comm all
of its members make sure you go visit a
