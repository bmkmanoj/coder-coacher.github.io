that's all you really need man
chit chit chit chit chit chit cheer let
me see let me see I want to check how do
we soldier going I'm anxious I wanna see
poor people voting for a man yo Joe what
do you think of using CSS framework for
freelance work yeah you could use it
listen guys you can use whatever makes
the job easier for you you know like
when you come to a client the client
don't care about if you use bootstrap or
you use CSS grid they don't care about
that what they care about is can you get
the job done as soon as possible and
does it work you get what I'm saying
that's it that's all they really care
about and most importantly does it work
on every browser that's on you that you
have to come in and do the research if
you're using a certain technology or a
new property from CSS if it's brand new
if it doesn't work on ie 11 or IE 9 and
they're like hey man we need to actually
take care of those browsers then that's
on you you have to figure out what's the
best way and what's the best tool for
for that job you got what I'm saying so
yeah we are in here kids
looks pretty good it looks pretty
actually pretty freakin good man link so
good list now guys I want you guys to
share this with other peoples man share
this link with other people if you
refresh the page you will see the new
link is there which should be how you
call this what should be a tiny link
which you could literally copy that and
show it to other peoples and be like hey

like her her channel let me see
listen man with all the kindness of my
heart we're gonna do this live we got an
email every single youtuber that I know

them and let's see which one which one
actually replies back whoever's who
replies back you got one saying like
most people they just won't do it
you know a lot of these guys that got
big egos they don't want to lose that
I'm gonna you know they don't want to
come in and and give like to other
channels but let's see if this year
they're they're actually in a Christmas
spirit and they want to help out other
channels and they want to actually find

this live we're gonna start live we're
gonna send out emails to every single
one of them and we're gonna do it live

it is out here man it's the YouTube
world but I'm doing this for you guys
man I'm doing this for you guys because
I actually want to give the power to the
people to choose the top channels so we
can make a legit top 20 top 35 top 50
YouTube channel so people could find you
know the the good channels the channels
that people care about you get what I'm
saying so let's see how that goes
let's see who actually responds back who
comes back and just says fu Joe I don't
want to talk to you who comes in and be
like hey man I'm not interested and it's
fine
alright you got a sense of me a song
text alright man so we did this for you
guys man hopefully we get as many votes
as we can in the next week on Friday I'm
gonna continue you know reminding you
guys to vote for this whole week you
know I'm gonna continue reminding you
guys to vote and I'm gonna send it out
to my personal emails right I have about
I think about 15,000 emails and I'm
gonna send it up you know now most
people would not do that for us for me
for any of the other other youtubers
here but me I actually do things like
that like like I'm not scared to share
like hey guys check out cool channels
like is actually why people come to me
because they want to know you know Joe
was the coolest framework what's the
best framework was the best YouTube
channel that I could go visit you know
who should I watch what blogs should I
check out like you know that's what my
channel is about my channel is about
sharing what's out there
and finding the best resources for you
guys so you know that's something that
most people will not do they will not
share that you know that 15,000 plus
audience they will not email every
single one of them with anybody else's
channels link or channels name but
that's the things that I do you know
what I'm saying so we can't put
everybody on the same on the same
spectrum
me like you know me you know what I mean
like I'm now in the same spectrum like
we now in the same charts you know we're
not in the same categories but that's
the type of person that I am I want to
give you guys this year a very accurate
list for 2018 I want to give you the
best list that I can give you from all
the youtubers that are actually
developers so let's see so let's see
who's online man who's in here called
Chris my Glock tell most appeal Tiffany
I don't know Stephanie coke Chris I know
let's see just saws quick mask no meat
just sauce quick maps what about the
four people that I mentioned people can
actually add you can go in when you vote
you get to add this there's a field day
that says other so you can actually add
in new people if it's they're not on the
list they could get at it
you know what I mean so
let's be honest you get some exposure -
yeah I get some exposure because I'm the
one building this thing like nobody else
is gonna do this I think you know what I
mean like I told a couple of people you
know pretty big channels I say man you
guys should do like a top 13 like people
don't have to add me you don't have to
add me to the list right cuz if you
don't like me that's cool but I had the
good people that are out here creating

want to vote for men if they were in the
ballot you could add them guys you could
add them and if they're not there
you could definitely add them it's right
there man
let me see where is it let's share the
screen before I leave
if you guys don't see the person that
you want you could come here and
literally be like a choose your
favorites okay
you can choose programming era grilled
self candy-coating trained and then you
could come down here but and other and
then put in Johnny Cash I don't know
like whoever is out there whoever you
guys think that should be on the list
you could add them to the list that's
why I made it like this so you guys can
actually vote for multiple people's like
the thing is not to have a number one
who's number one it's not about who's
number one it's just I want to share the
top people for everybody right I'm gonna
share every single person that's on the
list is gonna get shared but we're gonna
have a top order for whoever got the
most votes going down all right so then
from there that's just how it is you
know what I mean so I see vote it on the
photo let's see oh we got a bot word
but party if you can't read you can't be
a programmer yo I was thinking about
this somebody sent me like a message
like if you have uh I don't know an
impairment with your eyes
can you still become a programmer and I
was like thinking about that like man
can they be a real programmer because
it's hard but you have to be able to
read even if you have one of those
accessible freaking little machines that
read it for you
you know how knowing that that gotta be
even like like left-arrow
eight one right arrow title left arrow /
H 1 / like you can't write code like
that like you can't like that would be
so annoying you know what I mean so your
eyes are very important guys take care
of your eyes take care of your fingers
like everything else could be gone but
your eyes and your fingers like you
gotta take care of that
all right kids give myself a little like
cuz there's like 30 people in here

I'm saying like in their head in their
head for a lot of people they think like
man if I go in and I share this link
with my viewers they're gonna notice 30
other YouTube channels so they gotta not
come to my channel people are so
ignorant on this like in this whole
space of like web development and
programming like you deal with so many
snakes and so many people that small
minded that it's kind of sad you know
what I mean like the only person that
sent back a email was the real Casa
Darrow and Aaron invader who showed up
now mind you you gotta see tomorrow I'm
gonna do another video where I'm gonna
just share who actually sent the email

just how it is like this is not for me
this video that I'm gonna make this top
YouTube web developers I'm not going to
make it for me this is not for me this
is for you guys this is for the people
that come in here and they want to know
channels that they've never seen you
know it's like I'm not scared to share
my audience I'm not scared to be like
hey guys
this guy has a good channel this person
has a cool channel I'm not scared I'm
very comfortable in my own skin I'm very
comfortable with the swag with the sauce
you get what I'm saying
but these people they're not comfortable
and I feel bad but you know I gave up my
platform I shared them to 15,000 people

some subscribers hopefully they they get
some love and you know is this the
Christmas spirit man gotta for every
also share who blocked

you guys are cool man you guys are the
real deal man yep
Thank You Lucas Lucas says I love your
channel because I feel it demonstrates
something different to the stereotypes
of developers yeah man like you don't
have to be a square you know what I mean
like looking like a square doesn't mean
that you're smart doesn't mean that
you're the best developer it just mean
you're you're a square that's it but it
doesn't mean that you have to be like
that to be a good developer or whatever
like you could just come in here and
sauce it up you know and just cut me and
just hit him with the dab real quick a
lot of people don't like when we hit
them with the dad like that
you got our same but that's just how it
is man is try to find Chris on Twitter
man how far is the drive from Queens
where you at poof 45 minutes 40 minutes
40 minutes to 45 minutes depending with
this traffic on the Long Island
Expressway so let's see
go ahead and vote man this is not about
who is the number one this is about
sharing an accurate list
seems like a very very accurate list
currently
guys when you add other just add it one
of them don't add two or three people
I've seen people adding like commas to
it like you should just add a one no no
this
see let's see let's see and for the
people that are asking me why some
people are not on the list because the
list is about youtubers the list is not
about people who are I don't know how
you call this like marketing people who
are now becoming into the space of web
development this is not about marketing
you gonna say like these are people who
are youtubers quote-unquote youtubers
not people who are here trying to sell
something people who are youtubers right
like if your channels about selling then
you're not in this list
somebody might say hey Joe you sell your
courses yes I sell my courses but on
YouTube that's not my focus
I don't be here we're just here to sell
courses this is not what my channels not
