cutting phase your boys backing out
and did it again yes we got the people
back
you got the mentorship season - its back
we done did it again kids yo we got your
boy Aaron we got cam we got Sam we got
your boy Robinson
we got a squad man you know one more
person was supposed to be here you know
is that personal already got cut you
know what I mean so this is how we doing
it we switching it up this year right
this season right we coming in we gave
them everybody a project right we're
giving everybody a project a matter of
fact there's gonna be three projects
that they could choose from every single
week they choose one and say hey there's
the one that I can do right this one
that's gonna be easy this one that's
gonna be intermediate and this one
that's gonna be hard right people get to
choose which way they they won't attack
it's undone they don't have to finish
the whole project but they need to
finish at least a minimum of three of
the sections right everything doesn't
have to be perfect but what needs to be
there is just you know the heart come in
in the determination being able to show
up you know so that's pretty much it and
there was the little twist of this right
is every week somebody's getting cut
right so every single week somebody's
getting cut luckily for this guys
somebody already got cut so that means
they good you know what I mean they they
go for next week you know scar people my
name's Aaron I'm from Staten Island New
York
you know I've been program for a little
bit you know I'm doing a bachelor
program to be honest you know I know a
few things I know I'm learning web
development HTML CSS so the beginner
tsunami probably learning everyday so
you're trying trying to learn a lot
right now so that's about it
since when I wanted to get into web
development let's see I don't honestly a
video and I made a soup like simple to
learn and and I could see myself like
picking it up so I've always been into
computers and stuff like that ever since
high school you know video games and
then like the things you could do a
program and nowadays it's kind of it's
insane like you can make Ashley your
phone like honestly I just want to stop
work of elements gonna be the stepping
stone because who knows what else you
can learn out there you know what it
means people know about me I'm cam I'm
in the community
I'm from OKC home of the Thunder and I'm
ready to learn the stuff I even took out
took time away from work to be on this
so I'm serious about this yeah I've been
doing this I think since March you know
I've joined a community I saw your video
Joe and I really love everything you're
talking about then I really did this
mentorship that I feel like I need that
extra push to get to the next level so I
can get a job after this because I feel
like I got all the basic skills HTM HTML
CSS and JavaScript I just need it all
put it all together and be able to build
websites and stuff yeah I'm from
Illinois yeah I just I've been looking
at a programming you know I mean I'm
pretty familiar with PHP vanilla
JavaScript a little bit that's about the
only thing I have that I can get to an
employer is something that they just put
in like a couple hours here and there
probably for four hours a week or
something like that an hour a day four
days or something but uh sometimes I you
know I'm really I really you know if I
have a project or something I you know I
try to you know it's been a lot more
time on it just - yeah probably several
months five or six months probably got
the least experience of all these guys
English I've got an English history
degree but I'm not for me just decided
to change what I wanted to do I've just
been grinding ever since I've always
been
probably about six months so I'm just
you know I'm comfortable with CSS HTML
Javascript I know a bit of vanilla and
no joke with no jQuery so just learning
some just been doing it for under six
months I left University but when I was
in university those on introductory
course to like web's web developmental
and we had to build a tape website from
using old-school divs and tables and I
liked it and then what actually made it
even better was I had a part-time job
when I was at university and basically
pushing trollies at like some sickness
place with Sainsbury's and this guy who
looked you know he looked by his 20s
got in his Porsche and I asked him I I
went up to him about what do you do then
he was are I just make my own software
company and you know I've built a couple
of apps and then I was like no ways and
I think after that it's kind of when I
ever I never knew there's a lot of money
in there at the same time when I did my
introductory course you know it was only
three months but I liked it you know it
was cool I was excited I was building
buildings little websites to just give
tags and although were using Dreamweaver
and I know Dreamweaver you know big
cheap but fell into another oh yeah let
me let me get into this but I've been
suffering from learning reading learning
reading learning reading I'm not
building enough that's that's why I want
to do this yeah you know going back
again to the rules every week you will
receive a new project you don't have to
finish every single section of the
project but must do your best okay
must show interest in being here if
you're showing up and you you look like
you know you'll be here like watching TV
or you're talking to your mom or you're
you're like talking to your little son
somewhere and your son is like daddy
controller like you know what I mean
like this is not the place for you
because people want to be here this is
not you know I'm doing this out of my
own free will and you guys too is like
you know people actually send me over
you know over 27 emails and I chose you
guys right so
no let's let's not spend on the faces of
those people that couldn't be here you
know what I mean
so make sure you you want to really be
here and then last one is the audience
will vote for who to eliminate in if the
host feels the same as that person right
will now be part of the show the next
week right if we feel like you're just
not going hard like every week we gotta
eliminate somebody now does it mean that
you are a bad developer doesn't mean
that your you're not supposed to be here
no it doesn't mean that it just means
like hey we just have to choose a you
know top one top tool of like people who
we feel that just really want this bad
right and like I said somebody was
supposed to be here so pretty much they
they kicked themselves out you know I
mean so then they show up so what that
means is you guys get a free week
everybody gets a free week here so this
week you're good the next week you guys
are good the week after that we have to
go with the votes all right so well
we're going to do now is we're going to
start looking at the project all right
because there's three projects and you
guys get to choose which one you guys
want to do all right
and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna send
it to you guys after the show just so
you know so you guys can have the files
yourself and you could go over and then
you choose which one you wanna pick
all right so let me see let me open this
up so the theme of this is gonna be
ecommerce okay I don't know can you guys
see this you have to see this way it
acts it yeah all right all right cool so
pretty much there's the website that you
guys one of the website that you guys
can pick to choose to actually build I
mean all of this three websites are
built around
ecommerce for sneakers shoes it can be
anything that you want you guys could
decide hey I don't want to do it about
sneakers I want to do it about t-shirt
I want to do about clothes I thought you
know you could change it the images is
just images the design then that's
something different that's something
that you got to keep it the same right
now it's like we're looking at this
thing you can build all this stuff you
might think in your head oh man I don't
have the images I don't have the
background I don't know how to do this
thing here this triangle all of the
things that you're seeing can be done
through regular CSS right also like I
said you don't have to finish every
single section let's say I'm looking at
this section right here right and I say
hey you see this triangle I can't do the
triangle but I can do this part and I
can put an image here so yeah so finish
that right do it you don't have to go in
and create a background exactly how it
is all right all of this stuff is doable
right what other stuff you could
definitely do this stuff right here
might seem complicated but it's 100%
doable like this is pretty much just one
image in the background you put a
gradient on top of it that's it this is
just text this right here is just text
that you could put all of the stuff you
could do it with z-index okay it's
pretty simple this thing this whole
section is the same thing you can do
this whole thing with z-index
you don't have to do every single thing
like if you were to be like oh all I
have is this image here and four images
here you don't have to do the sneakers
on the background now if you really want
to go hard and show your hard work then
you will put that sneakers title on the
background alright see it's the same
thing like here all you have to do is
just build the sections here okay
don't you know don't drown in a in a cup
that's what I tell people at a time you
look at the design you break it down
section by section all right you got a
header up here alright after the header
you got this top top section here then
from there you have another section for
logos then you got another sections for
Jordans or
whatever the limited edition release of
whatever clothes are t-shirts whatever
you decide to choose right the images
like I said you can find images on
Google for all the items that you have
here like you can literally go find them
like it doesn't have to be this glasses
it doesn't have to be the sneakers
doesn't have to be none of this stuff
right just if their sneakers fine
sneakers that's it all right now we're
gonna look at the other one come here
that was one now I want you guys to
start deciding which one you guys think
you could change it later on but I want
the people to know the people the
viewers to know which one you guys are
leaning more towards is it the first one
the second one the third one now don't
tell me right now tell me at the end
after I show you all of them so there's
the second one is a pretty simple to me
is the simplest one like is very simple
you don't have a lot of complicated
things on it all right all of this stuff
like you see like this shadows this
background so you don't have to do that
at all you just have to do like pretty
much the things that make sense like
this image here and this image here the
title alright that's it that's what you
really have to do this one you can build
this with regular CSS background like I
say it's just a regular background with
a image gradient on top of it this was
the same thing tied on titled this is
three images a button that's it this is
a whole bunch of images like you know
Instagram styled here's I got a section
for emails and of course the footer
alright pretty simple to me this is the
simplest one
you guys can definitely choose that one
now let's see this other one I think
this one is another one that's this
one's intermediate because this one has
a lot of activity that's what I call
this has a lot of activity like this has
a lot of stuff to do like you got the
header you got bread crumbs then from
there you gotta you know you got a form
here where it's like you got the drop
down you have buttons here to buy to
sell you got shared as a portfolio
follow you got the image different here
you got product details
then this graph you do not have to add a
graph here now if you wanted to really
go hard this distinct called charts
GS you could literally do this on charts
- yes all right that's on you if you
really want to go the extra mile you
know you want to impress me you want to
impress the people you want to impress
yourself you know to really go hard
because sometimes you know 99% of the
times when you at work they're gonna
tell you hey do this graph so now you
have to do the research on where to find
a library for grabs and you know it's
all on you you don't have to do this but
this will look nice if you do it all
right now the next thing is just like I
recommend the section for for the people
related sneakers a footer and like a
copyright section alright now that's
about it kids so I want to know which
one are you guys actually leaning on so
like which one we would you like to do
what do you call my mother first let's
see I'm leaning towards the third one to
be honest I feel like I feel like I
could do that one okay
that's right like it's a comfortable I'm
still a beginner but I think I could
really make suck it up not as fun if you
guys wanted to go with the third one you
could do it definitely
which one will you go with Camp cam is
like okay know about this
okay I was gonna go with the third one
but since he went to the third one I'm
gonna go with the first one okay
yeah not as fun I think to be honest
with you guys the third one it has a lot
of activity when I mean activity has a
lot of little things like breadcrumbs
which there's really in reality the
small work on that one but it's easier
work than every other everything right
right because everything else is gonna
deal with a lot of positioning and a lot
of uh you know working with the
backgrounds and and just making
everything in the right places
right but the third one has a lot of
activity it might look easy while II
like a lot of you know it's like simple
but it's a lot of work trust me I've
done websites like that it's like
breaking down its layouts and HTML and
I'm doing the CSS there's gonna be a
little work all right now um Sam which
one you try to lean okay
which one is just the beginner or
whatever but just based on the look I
like the first one this is not a
competition what this is basically hold
you accountable to really go hard right
because right now you can do this on
your own you but I hey I'm gonna find a
design myself I just build them out on
my own time you know what I mean I guess
it's not really you know telling you oh
man I gotta do this
but what this does is holds you
accountable to really come in you know
go hard the things that you don't know
you know like you might be finding
yourself trying to position something
right in in one of the designs you're
like oh man internal position this is
exactly how the design is right but if
you didn't have that design from this
show here you probably wouldn't even try
to build that on your own you know what
I mean like this is going to help you
push forward man
so by Friday we need to you have your
project done and we have to do a meeting
one to one because the way I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna go in one two one
look at your project look at your code
with you see the things that you did if
your code is looking sloppy I'm gonna
tell you
looking sloppy if there's some things
that you could have fixed I'm gonna tell
you you couldn't fix this make the font
a little bit smaller here make it a
little bit bigger here the image should
be a little bit to the left whatever it
is right and then from there what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna take that we're
gonna record that whole meeting that
we're gonna have which most likely is
gonna be maximum 20 minutes right so
then from there I'm gonna copy it save
it you know cut it cut it up you know
and then from there put in the
highlights for the next show for next
week right now the show is not going to
be live like I said for everybody the
show is gonna be on coding phase comm
and it will be on YouTube I will release
it on YouTube in two weeks from now
right so if an episode came out today
here I'm releasing it two weeks from now
on YouTube all right and that's exactly
how we're going to do it it's like a
two-week delay and the reason why we're
doing this is because we want more
people to come into the website register
to the website because I'm putting in so
much content for you guys and there's
gonna be multiple shows that I'm
creating there's other things that I
want to do with everybody here I'm like
I said I'm planning on going to
different events and other stuff that's
gonna be exclusive content to coding
phase comm you know YouTube is just a
platform for you guys to find us but at
the same time we have our own platform
we're not dependent on YouTube or
whatever it is now the whole thing is
completely free people be freaking out
they'll be like oh my god I gotta go to
coding phase that kind of I gotta pay a
membership no about 50 to 60 percent of
everything on the website is free nice
all you have to do is register it's just
like the same thing as YouTube you
signup to YouTube that's it yep
hope you guys enjoy this show I'll see
you guys later stay up yeah I better
finish this project I don't want to come
back over here and be like boy I'll get
done sugar spice and everything right
it worked you know if you watch the show
you get to vote on who gets the state
who gets to leave all right so as you
can see here who you think will survive
to the end and here's the link man man
and like vote for who you think is going
to win
what do you think is going to survive to
the end
next time I'm calling face I'll be
honest with you guys I don't know who's
gonna make him it I really don't think
you guys are really working hard
somebody's getting cut</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
