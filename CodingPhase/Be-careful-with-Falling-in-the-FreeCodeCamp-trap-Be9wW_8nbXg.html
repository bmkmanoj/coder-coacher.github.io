coding face.com your boy is backing out
and did it again
guys um I just want to start this with a
very simple sentence be careful with
free code camp and falling into the free
code camp world and the reason why I say
this it's not because it's not a good
website and in some way it can help you
out but it's also a trap in the sense of
I see this all the time
there's a lot of people that keep coming
to this website it's like oh yeah man
you know I'm trying to learn how to code
and I follow free coke campaign you know
I'm just following alone you know the
the freaking track whatever right guys
be careful right because I keep hearing
from people that they can't find jobs I
look at their portfolios and they like
they have little things from free code
camp or you know that I oh they add the
little projects that free code camp has
on their portfolio and to be honest with
you guys this to me free code camp is a
place to go in practice that's a free
code camp is not going to teach you how
to find a job how to get a job out here
how to get real projects it's just not
going to teach you that it's not meant
to be that it's meant to be like hey
this is HTML hey there's a CSS hey this
is JavaScript
hey this is a for-loop hey this is this
does not whatever right but it doesn't
teach you how to put everything together
you I've seen it you know right now it's
gonna be a million people that's gonna
agree and a million people that's gonna
disagree you know some people is gonna
be here man it's like we have to be
thankful that it's free and and this and
dies like you know the community is is
behind it yes I do agree and it's
amazing that it's actually free and it
has a lot of little tests and little
things that you could play around with
but what I'm saying is a lot of people
are falling into this trap of like hey
they're gonna go through this whole
thing
finish every single thing in here you
know one by one by one by one and at the
end once they finish they get to the end
they're like okay cool I finished
everything but then when you tell them
hey okay could you build me a website
out of this design they struggling
they're like oh you know they put in 50
60 70 hours into a frico camp and then
now they're like oh wait I don't know
what I'm doing oh wait now I'm gonna go
to you to me eight oh wait now I'm going
to go to trim treehouse oh wait I'm now
going to go to you - guys listen
everything that's free in this world
there's a reason why it's free right and
I'm telling you right now for everybody
who's going to say Joe don't be you know
defecating on top of free coke amp is
free they have a great program and you
know it teaches you everything that you
need for web development yes and no
because a lot of people keep sending me
emails that they're following this tract
and then when they're done they don't
even know how to find a job how to get a
job they're not feeling comfortable with
I give them the design and they still
struggling I'm like in my head I'm like
you know if you go in and you spend
let's say let's say just up to here
right now even talking about the
intermediate front-end projects and all
that stuff right let's say you got one -
let's say five okay five five ten
thirteen sixty three seventy three and
then let's say 75 let's say and now
basically a lot of people keep falling
into this basic algorithms thing right
so 75 plus 50 now we're looking at 125
hours
now this 127 hours right so just up to
here you got - 127 hours of just
following a law and following along and
you still don't know how to build a
website that for me
is scary because to spend 75 hours let's
say people could come in right we got 75
hours divided by let's say the maximum
somebody who works who works full-time
they work from 9:00 to 5:00 and then the
most that they can do is let's say three
hours all right
that's 25 days all right now let's say
per week they can only do or let's say
divided by let's say three all right so
that's eight weeks that's two months
let's say two months you spend on freako
camp and at the end of the day you still
don't know how to build a website you
still don't have a decent portfolio you
still don't have stuff that you need to
start going to job interviews you still
don't feel comfortable or confident that
you can get the job I'll be honest with
you guys like me personally that's why I
prefer you to me you to me or you know
even my website if you guys decide to
use my website but just even find
somebody and you to me that's really
good somebody else Trustee follow along
cuz you're actually building real
websites and real projects I feel a
frico camp is like looking at the
documentation right like you're not
supposed to learn by looking at the
documentation of html5 you're not
supposed to learn by looking at the
documentation of JavaScript you're
supposed to learn by building projects
and learning how to think like a
programmer and how to use certain things
like let's say you don't need to know
everything in CSS before building a
website you just need to know the
concepts for example there's a little
round right here right there's a little
circle here you know okay how can I make
this circle are you going to say hey I'm
gonna remember every single thing in the
world or CSS no all right what you're
gonna do is say okay how can I figure
this out at the beginning Google's
always
going to be your friend so you always
going to say for example how to let's
say how to make round the corners
corners and HTML right you're gonna find
this here Google css3 borders rounded
corners alright and you're gonna see
border radius right so this little
things like that that I know somebody's
probably laughing like this is not how
you search for things guys this is how
you supposed to think you supposed to
say hey there's something that I want to
do how do I figure that out how do I
find the answers right now following the
documentation because I could go in -
you know Mozilla's documentation and
look at everything and do the little
examples that they have that doesn't
mean that's teaching me how to find the
answers to certain problems right and
there's just a simple example where I
could be like hey guys
this is how you will find the answer and
how you would think like a program and
how you would think like a developer of
like ok if I know what's the the thing
that I need to do well how do I find the
answer for it right a lot of people
don't know how to do that a lot of
people just follow along this whole
track and then they don't know how to
put it together like here you could go
and learn every single thing about it
but then at the end after you know 127
hours in do you know how to build this
website if I come in and I tell you hey
build this whole website exactly how
they have it here can you build it right
can you go to dribble comm alright and
search let's say for example let's take
this one let's say somebody gives you
this design can you build this in HTML
CSS and this is super simple I've seen
people that can't build this thing and
I'm like how you can't build this for
like let's say a landing page alright we
come to dribble search landing page
right
these are stuff that you're going to be
building as a developer somebody gives
you this design you're telling me you
don't know how to build something like
this
all right there's people that just don't
know how to do it they keep following
this free code camp and there's like
what I always tell you guys you're
following a way of teaching as if it was
looking at a documentation you don't
learn like that the way how you learn is
by building of real projects all right a
lot of people love free cocaine there's
been people who came in and have been
successful because they finished free
code camp but what people don't tell you
is the extra mile there's an extra mile
that you have to go people come in here
they do this this whole track right and
then they don't go the extra mile they
think okay once I finish everything a
frico camp I'm gonna know how to build
websites no no you're not you're gonna
learn how to build websites by building
them now by going through the track the
guys are successful today even though
they say hey I was successful and I got
a job because a frico camp guys it
wasn't freako camp that gave him the job
it was the fact that they came in here
and they built projects and side
projects besides this this isn't going
to help you this is going to help you
slide the documentation there's like
looking at the documentation with
examples that's it it's not teaching you
how to build websites how to put things
together how to look at a design and be
like okay this how it got to break down
my layout this how I want to use you
know I want to create a menu I'm gonna
use the knife and then I'm gonna put our
anchor tag inside of it or you know you
could say hey I want to use a UL and put
some allies and then some so anchor tags
inside like there's so many different
ways I you go you go what I was saying
like you gotta know man like this isn't
the answer guys there's a place to have
fun and come in and practice as you
become a developer but stop thinking
that this is actually the answer this is
not the place where you're going to
learn
how to do websites and and become a web
developer this is just a tool alright
it's like people go to was the other one
cold war was a cold war cold war's worse
I don't remember
cold war's yeah there's another one no
it's not this one this one is alright
there's another one of the words it I
think it's cold fights what is it man
what Co fight or something like that
yeah think it's this one
cold fights waste so much time on this
website and not keep seeing it and
that's the other people that just come
in here and just it reality just waste
time guys
I'm being honest like this is cool for
you know to practice stop thinking that
you're going to learn something out of
this like you're not like this is not
the place to learn
I just finished you know basically
telling somebody to come check out this
course cuz this they asked me like hey
what do you think about this course I
looked at it and I actually have it on
my other account that's my coding phase
at gmail.com account is not my my Joe
Santos Garcia account where I have
everything there but this will already
have it in my account like when I was
like learning nodejs
this was another one that I took that I
just like you know I just looked at it
and I was like okay this guy's pretty
good pretty cool examples but it's like
I always say to you guys like you don't
have to come here but I oh we gotta come
in and you know use Joe's course or or
this and that
guys there's a million guys on udemy
creating amazing courses and you know
stuff that you could learn you know what
I mean it's like right now man like god
I created this build a restaurant web
app like I'm giving you real examples
man I'm not trying to teach you in a way
of like hey there's how the
documentation is that doesn't work when
you're self-taught developer
your brain doesn't work like that
because you're coming from a regular
person's mind your mind is about you no
TV and music and hanging out with your
friends and your kids and your family
your mind doesn't work in this world of
like hey look at documentation and try
to learn this as you go every time you
go to the next step you forget the last
step that's not how people work
regular people work by saying hey this
is a website alright this is a header
right here this is how we build a header
right and whenever you use a header and
you want to give a space inside of it
you use a padding that's how you learn
by seeing real things not seeing like
little boxes like oh there's a box
here's a padding and then you forget
it's like oh I don't know where to use
padding or where to use margin like it
happens all the time guys
so all I'm saying is and before anybody
leaves some hate like Mancos you know
it's like freako camp is like the holy
grail for for people who who are trying
to learn how to code guys it's a great
place it got great promotion it's a
great place to to practice but all the
people that have become successful and
give credit to free code camp they
forget one thing they forget that they
build real projects they build a real
resume they built a history the build
projects that people could look at him
but I okay yeah I could hire you because
you have this project and then they give
the credit to free code camp will they
be like oh yeah cool
I learned HTML here but I didn't learn
how to build a website here this is not
the place where you learned it you know
what I mean so that's all I'm saying you
know I keep getting emails and the only
reason what I'm talking about this and
you guys know I'm to be honest with you
guys I'm the realest developer out here
I don't need to sugarcoat anything I
don't need to be best friends with
nobody I don't need to be acting like
you know I'm not getting sponsorships I
don't care about doing collaborate
for anybody I make my own money I work
independently
my thoughts are completely independent
from everybody else and that's what
makes my channel special I be honest
with you guys
I told you about both camps I'm telling
you now about free code camp I told you
guys a long time ago all you got to do
is build the project's build real
projects that people's gonna look at
stop wasting your time with algorithms a
lot of people keep on getting stuck on
algorithms it's like look at the you
know I love the guy that created free
cocaine because it's super cool I have
his on his newsletter you know he sends
the best newsletter out there like
literally the most information the best
articles he finds it and he gives it out
but to be honest with you guys 50 hours
of algorithm scripting listen I'm being
honest you don't need to be spending no
50 hours on this at all like that's just
the truth that's just you know it's good
to practice it out you know it's for
practice but to get a job you don't need
to you know take this as if God brought
this down from heaven and say hey guys
this is the track this is the the map
for you guys to become developers guys
this is just like a documentation you
know if you look at Mozilla's
documentation this is pretty much the
same thing all right the only difference
is that you're doing it yourself you're
going one step at a time building one
thing then building another thing you
know so that's all I'm saying
please don't hate the messenger I'm just
here to help people out I'm just here to
tell them the truth the things that
people don't tell them you know what I
mean like I could come here and then
tell you hey XYZ taught me how to do
this but then I don't talk about the
hours that I put in creating projects I
don't talk about the hours that I put in
going to meetups I don't talk about the
hours that I do on you know looking at
YouTube videos this was not the answer
this was part of my journey
that's how I tell people is like it's
part of your journey it's a good tool
but this is not the answer there's not
the thing that is gonna get you that job
it's just the same thing as a
documentation guys all right so don't
take this thing as if it was brought
down by God and he gave you this map all
right guys I love you guys I'll see you
guys later
listen check out my website coding
face.com
where I have a couple of courses that I
created I also have a couple of links on
my description where it's just links to
other people's udemy courses like people
that I took their courses and have
worked for me you know one of the things
that people keep asking me is like hey
what did you do to get to where you at
what did you do to learn what was it
that you was doing at that time back
into you know 2012-2013 what did you do
those are the courses that I've been
taking for a while you know it's like
you could go back into my videos you can
see my journey I've been doing this for
a while I've working with very
successful companies and when I tell you
stuff is like it's because it's an
advice it's like a real advice I don't
want to be fake I don't have to have you
know sponsors I don't need to have
nobody giving me promotion I don't need
nobody to come in and pay me for
anything I'd rather just be honest with
you and then you trust me all right
that's how I like to have this type of
relationship with my videos and my
subscribers is like hey you know you
subscribe to my channel because you know
I'm not coming here you know I'm not
gonna pay my no boot camp I'm not
getting paid by no other company I'm
very transparent okay I'll see you guys
later
