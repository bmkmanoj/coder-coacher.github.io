coding freeze calm your boys backing out
and did it again alright today I'm
answering some questions this is one
question that I got today on my email
it's like Joe I just have one question I
need to keep it a hundred
which means be honest for those people
that don't know the streets all right
okay keep it a hundred
I know coding is lifetime learning and I
don't need to know this is three six or
nine or even twelve months right so you
don't need to know this you know in this
amount of time he already knows it but
by the fourteenth month right I have to
put it in two hours I'm gonna dedicate
to this right
will I be able to find a decent paid gig
thanks plus let me add keep up the good
work this is going to pay yourself all
for you keep hustling all right so hey
man thanks for the kind words
right there's for everybody guys there's
a message to every single person out
there right for you to become a
successful developer successful program
or successful engineer there's a few
things that you need you need you know
dedication right dedication being able
to go out of your way because it's very
easy to say hey I'm a great developer at
home right but you're at home that's it
right the second thing that you need is
being able to go out of your way to get
that job a lot of people think that
that's gonna come to them just by being
in their house and being good
programmers no it doesn't work like that
there's a lot of guys who are really
good programmers who don't have a job
and there's people who are pretty bad
programmers who are working and making a
lot of money I mean why does that happen
a lot of times as people are insecure
and they think like oh man I'm not ready
this isn't that and then you know
companies need somebody to start working
as possible so then comes the you know
the shitty developer who doesn't care
who just be like hey you know what who
secured by themselves and says I'm gonna
go to the interview and then he gets
hired right so those are the things that
you need you know dedication being able
to go out of your way to learn this you
know doing this for the next I think to
be honest with you to get a starting
junior developer position you need three
months three to six months to get a
decent job right now one thing that you
have to understand you know some people
might be coming from other the other
fields like you know them let's say
somebody's coming in and they do an
example this is just an example let's
say construction right you earning
twenty thirty dollars an hour in
construction you're like man I want to
leave construction and I want to start
doing programming whatever right you you
bust your ass working in programming and
then when you first get your job you
realize your first job is only willing
to give you forty thousand all right and
you're like wait what I'm making way
more than this in my regular job why
would I switch to programming I thought
that were given out a hundred thousand
dollar jobs out here no you have to
start somewhere
companies are not gonna put money on you
right then I got gotta trust you and be
like hey we're gonna give this person a
whole bunch of money without no no
history no or no way of you proving
yourself so you need the projects right
of course you need the experience so as
soon as you get in it's easy to get a
html/css job you could literally search
that online there's a whole bunch of
different jobs that I need people that
know HTML and CSS right so what a month
or two you could get a job but you have
to understand that is not gonna be a
high paying job it's a way to start you
could be there for three months apply to
another place and double your salary
because now that company that's gonna
hire you for Double Diamond that
getting paid on your first job they
trust you because somebody else trusting
you right they're not gonna give you
that chance unless somebody trusts you
right unless somebody trusts you and say
hey man we trust this guy with our
website we're gonna let him work here
for a few months whatever if you didn't
have that then don't expect a large
payout right don't expect like oh we're
gonna get so much money for my first job
it doesn't work like that right that's
another thing another thing that I will
say to you guys is stay focused stay
focus on doing your projects if you're
on my website knock out all the projects
do the timeline right do the timeline
right let's say you got to learn all
this stuff people try to come in and
then I already know notice stuff right
then I already know HTML CSS a lot of
times you don't write you did a couple
of little websites here and there but
you don't know it so my advice to you is
come in do the atom text editor right do
the terminal for developers do learn
HTML CSS do everything in order you
don't have to do all the videos like you
could literally go in skip the things
that you already know if you already
know it just watch it for like a few
minutes skip the things that you already
know keep going to the next keep going
to the next until you catch up right so
then you could get the full effect of
the website
don't come any thinking like oh man I
sort of know CSS so maybe I could just
skip the HTML CSS cuz you know I'll
learn it on my way to you know getting
the you know future proof JavaScript I
learned after future proof JavaScript
don't skip the steps come in go step by
step by step by step and learn
everything right now that's one of the
things I want to tell you this you know
and you're gonna succeed build the
projects that we're building you know
put the stuff like once you get to the
coding nodejs like a pro master course
alright pretty much you're gonna come
here and you're gonna
to be able to build your portfolio use
this project to push you know push all
your portfolio all your projects that
you have into your portfolio
sorry tongue twister yeah so put all
your projects inside of your portfolio
so once you get to here like I said you
gotta do a whole bunch of of different
projects all throughout all of these
right all of these are real projects I
did not come in here but I okay guys
let's just do it to do app to do it to
do it you know let's do a little
algorithm to do it algorithm know every
single one of these is a project that
you can show and say hey I built this I
built that I built this I built that
right all of those things you should add
it to your no js' course right once we
finish the nodejs course add all your
projects inside of that from there we're
gonna also put it in on how to push it
to your life site rent your domain make
sure you buy a domain and you're gonna
be successful guys trust me like these
are other things that I did to be able
to be successful as a developer there's
other things that I did and till this
day is its come in handy you know what I
mean like all these things I'm doing it
for a reason but I want you guys to
understand you know it's like he was
saying here he's like y'all you know
just be honest with me
and 14-month you know it's when I have a
job there is no guarantee unless you
make it right when somebody comes and
tells you oh man this kids lucky he got
a job he does not know he made luck
happen for him you know you shouldn't
take 14 month I'll be honest it
shouldn't take you 14 months to get a
job as a developer it's between three to
six months one two three it's just you
going hard and learning everything that
you need right three to four and those
those are two to freaking months is
about building your projects and make
your portfolio looks nice making sure
you you have your LinkedIn set up let
make sure that um you know your resume
is done also the things that has
happening between 3:00 and 4:00 right
let's see by 5:00 or even before that
you already go into interviews but now
it's on you to start going to interviews
and that was on you to start pretty much
preparing yourself for the interviews in
going insecure one thing about me guys
like I tell you this and you guys can
see it guys I go into interviews secure
my first interview I was so insecure I
was like oh my I don't know if they're
gonna hire me I don't know if I know
this stuff now I go in there like if you
want me you want me if you don't want me
good this two thousand other companies
hiring I don't need to be here right
that's how you need to start thinking
when you go into a job interview don't
think like you need done they need you
because you're the talent
you know what I mean like that's just
how it is you know so you have to be
secure about yourself secure about your
skills and be able to create an
atmosphere for when you go into that
room for that interview you like create
the atmosphere be like you know be
secure smile you know talk to the person
talk about code they're gonna actually
what are the things are you into in in
programming be honest hey I'm following
this framework out I like this guy from
YouTube coding face I like I read blogs
I go on podcasts I I do this and that so
they know that you're in the community
right it's not just a guy who decided to
go to a BS boot camp or took a couple of
courses and it's like hey I just wanna
call it and make some money
no you have to be part of the community
people gonna they have to feel like
you're part of the community so that's
why I tell you guys also make sure you
you put ourself on github make sure you
you come here to coda face comm you hang
out your name shows up when people
Google a they Co this person
part of the community it's like you
building a brand you know what I mean
it's like one of many reasons to what I
did this why I started doing all this
stuff it's to build my brand you know
there's only so much that I could have
done as a regular developer right
there's levels to this thing there's
levels to the sense of hey you're just a
regular developer you Joe Schmo the IT
guy that's a right different day you
take it to the next level you create a
library that everybody uses now people
look at you different than oh cool this
guy he has 2,000 stars on github on one
of his projects those things look good
you have a blog people be like oh wow he
does tutorials online or you have a
youtube oh wow he does video so he
really must know his stuff like all
those things build your brand this is
not just a little thing with you better
hey I'm just gonna learn how to code and
that's a I'm just gonna show up somehow
I'm gonna get this job guys
one of the big things about this is this
little guy called luck
look why call is my bitch right because
I make luck work for me not the other
way around
I don't be in my house thinking oh man I
wish I was lucky I wish I could do this
and I wish I could get a job nah I
grabbed luck by the neck and just
smashed it out be like yo we out we
gotta take this right now you know what
I mean like we gotta be like yo we're
gonna do this no matter what we're gonna
get this job we're gonna go in a stir
interview we're gonna go to this meetup
we're gonna you know when people come in
they're like oh man I remember that guy
right so I make things happen you have
to make it happen - you can't think this
there's no project there's no website
there's no service out there that's
gonna give you that that drive you gotta
have a drive in you and say hey I want
to get a job I want this and then at the
same time like I said in the beginning
of the video you have to be
you know comfortable with the idea that
your first job is not gonna be great
if you can't get a job is because now
you're applying to the big jobs you're
not supposed to be going to those job
interviews and you know it this huh I'm
not saying for you buddy I just say it
sorry I something like I got mad but
it's true
there's people go into job interviews
that they not supposed to be going to
this place is where you you know damn
well you haven't put in to work and
you're going to jump interviews there
and you know you're not gonna get the
job
this place is that is guarantee you're
not gonna get the job all right because
you don't have the history you don't
have the resume you don't have the
degrees you don't have uh you know
nobody trusts to you this there's
nothing in your resume that that could
show those people be like why would why
would we choose you out of 2,000 people
who want to come to this company right
so what do you do you gotta build
yourself you have to go to the smaller
jobs but I hate somebody wants somebody
who does work present and just come in
and edit the HTML and CSS for them do it
it might pay you thirty five forty
thousand dollars a year do it do it for
three four months as you prepare
yourself for your next job right you can
come here and just learn this you know
from one two three maybe one to five
lesson you know HTML CSS are responsive
at SAS like applo like a pro like a pro
right you come in you could get a job
with those skills are you gonna get paid
top dollar
no but wow you got a job with the skills
while you at your job and you come home
you're learning the rest of the stuff so
you're preparing yourself for your next
job alright you could come in and get a
job right away with this but you you
have to come in and input in that time
you know somebody else sent me an e-mail
and told me like hey man you know our
hire in this company
to do html/css is like I forgot all of
the other things that I learned from
whatever now I'm like wait what like
what was he doing when you got home I
just you know I was tired we all tired
when you get home you continue coding
you get home you start practicing
JavaScript if you go to HTML CSS
practice JavaScript all day for two
hours every time you come home you come
e relax and nine o'clock you from 9 to
11 o'clock at night you do JavaScript
every single night even though you got a
job right once you got a job into your
next level you're a front-end developer
and you're doing or let's say JavaScript
and react right and your company now
you're getting sixty seventy thousand
eighty thousand a year now take your
time step it up and learn the backend
learn nodejs on our PHP whatever route
you decide to choose it's up to you but
don't just stay home be like oh I
already learned what I needed to learn
because if you want to keep growing you
have to keep learning this never gonna
stop this you're never gonna stop
learning you're always going to have
that drive in you and you need it to get
a job right so it's what I tell you guys
man it's not about how long it's gonna
take you you can do this and make it
happen in a month I'm being honest in
one month you could get a job related to
HTML CSS you could go in decom and find
jobs that all they care about is like
hey do you know HTML CSS can you you
know edit our products or can you edit
our paragraphs that's all you have to do
you go in there you get that job as you
build your resume and you build your
your skill set you go and apply to the
next job that's how it is guys if you're
looking for hey man I'm gonna come in
I'm gonna spend five dollars and then
with five dollars I spent on Joe I buy
two three courses from you to me that's
ten dollars each
I spent 35 dollars you know people come
in here a lot of times they send me
emails not saying about this guy because
he's
/ cool but these people that send me
emails and they'd be like hey man you
know I got this course I got this course
got this course this course you know
it's like they spent $55 right in total
and they think we're fifty five dollars
they're like oh they got a skill in
they're gonna you know make it in the
world as a hey man I invested all the
money that I needed to invest no you
have to put invest time which time is

gonna be the manager guys hire me it
doesn't work like that you have to come
in put in the work and go up the steps
