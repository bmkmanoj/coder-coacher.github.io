a boy joke back at it again another
stream and somehow we got we got enough
energy for doing this last video before
I go to sleep Wow
I'm disappointed like like a really
really big like this like the biggest
disappointment I've had like in a long
time you know what I mean like I've
shown love unconditional love out here
to a lot of people in this channel
people that have been here since the
beginning and people who I thought know
me like know who I was who I am
I shared so much I shared my family I I
give time that I shouldn't give time
like this puts a lot of stuff into
perspective you know what I mean like I
even quit my job to do this thing
full-time because of the support of a
lot of people and you know the love that
I got from a lot of people but then
realizing now how fake a lot of people
are and how just how people are in
general I mean people like that no
matter what is a human nature type of
thing right everybody you know when
you're the how you call is like the
underdog you're like everybody's
favorite right once you start getting a
little bit bigger people start hitting
on you like you know it's like you
haven't changed but people around you
change so whatever
so today randomly I'm like man I want to
you know go to my my own chat room you
know the chat room that supposedly is -
supposed to be part of the the channel
right so I'll go to the discord and but
um yeah so I was supposed to be
well this supposed to be part of the
channel that's what I've been promoting
it all year long giving you know sharing
the links putting it on my video
you know letting people know about it
you know
and for some reason around I don't know
like December something I had like a gut
feeling I was like like maybe I should
start you know putting everything on my
own website and and just completely have
everything on my site right because I
had like a gut feeling I don't know what
it was you know when you get that
feeling like there's something if he
about it and pretty much what used to be
my chat room which was created by Matt
Barbara and a couple of people also part
of it you know whole bunch of people I
don't know you know whatever I don't
know who exactly set it up I don't know
if it was my or Barbara one of the two
right so now I'm going to this chat room
I'm like wait for some reason I can't
see nobody online I can't see somehow
I'm blocked off my own my own freaking
channel you know my own channel on
discord right coding fees I don't know
whose name coding face out here whoa who
we joined this chatroom if it wasn't
named coding fees but somehow I show
love to this kid Matt this whole year
round you know I've been calling him
look the golden child the kid that I
know he's gonna make it the kid that
he's I know he's gonna be good you know
now he he's getting his jobs and
everything getting good opportunities
and it's great you know more power to
him but you know at the same time I had
like a little a little feeling which was
weird I was like wait you know after I
dropped the video of you guys remember
on network net neutrality right he was a
little bit iffy for some reason like as
if I haven't said stuff that don't go
with what he wants you know what I mean
like which is fine like we're supposed
to or not be saying the same things like
hey whatever it doesn't matter to me
because I'm gonna fight through it no
matter what I'm still gonna be good if
tomorrow internet was to be
five hundred dollars so right there let
me share the screen so it all started I
guess from here every single you know
video I drop he always show love as soon
as I dropped that video he's like oh
like something he's like man somebody
put in thanks Joe is nice to hear nice
to hear some clear thinking on this
topic and it's like it's like oh I don't
think talking out your ass is clear
thinking to be honest
I'm like wait why like damn Matt talking
on my ass like really like I've been
showing you love this whole time and
there's how you you come out of your
mouth
like seriously like this is crazy so um
whatever is like from that day on he's
been pissed I don't know why I haven't
done anything to this kid for no reason
I've literally just come in and
supported whatever he wanted to do are
created the discord channel which to me
is kind of ridiculous that created this
channel to pretty much now the whole
channel that's in there it's like it's
like a hate coating face channel
everybody you know that's why it's like
today's like one of the biggest
disappointment you got Casey in there
talking shit about me you got of course
Filipe he's been talking shit for months
this isn't something new this is the
problem that I have with him like this
to have been talking shit for months and
I've been just letting him go I just
like whatever I don't want to talk to
this do it I pretty much ignore him
never block them I've never liked to
blocked anybody until you get me to that
point where it's like bro I cannot have
you on this channel no more because
you're not productive if you're not
coming in and doing anything good for me
or for the channel or talking about any
good topics or doing anything you just
pretty much coming in here talking about
stuff that's completely irrelevant okay
then you got you know you got even
people you know like fin talking shit
about me
even camp I was like man like them even
cam like you get what I'm saying like
even cam like yo I was like I don't know
man I'm shocked I'm shocked like there's
a lot of people in here like that I'm
just shocked I'm like I'm really really
really disappointed you know what I mean
like like it's really like disappointing
the whole situation cuz I just feel bad
I'm like you know what I mean like those
are people that have been here since the
beginning and I've shown nothing but
love people email me I answer them back
I helped them out with whatever they
needed any questions they had anything
that they they want pretty much show
them love right so the whole thing is
like they've been having like the sub
section there's like a sub section
within the sub sections of coding
face.com
people that just pretty much it's like
they just hate for no damn reason and
it's like I don't wanna say if you don't
like the channel cool move on well how
are you in my channel and then you
create my own my freakin coding phase a
chatroom to basically talk shit about me
on my own channel like you know my own
discord channel you know just name it
I hate coding face that's what you
should name it you know what I mean like
it's kind of ridiculous you know and
it's very disappointing because it's
like you know I want to stand from
Philippe Philippe it's been talking shit
for months like this isn't something new
like him that's why I was like the whole
video and you know it's like even at
that like you go to Matt's channel it's
like he's like recording the the part
when I get so mad at this guy Philippe
and this fucking idiot is so stupid that
in his head he's thinking that I'm
matter Philippe because he's basically
going against or whatever I say is not
that the problem is that this guy is
literally not bringing nothing to the
table but arguments
right nothing to the table never a
positive comment nothing good and it's
like just because that's your friend and
you guys hang out all the time on a
chatroom and I actually do shit that I
have shit to do that I don't be on the
fucking chat room that doesn't mean that
it's like hey man this is my best buddy
I got a two sides you don't have to
choose no sides bro like there's some
internation like Filipe is like
30-something years old like 38 years old
almost 40 years old it's a grown-ass man
still trying to hang out with the junior
developers like that's embarrassing you
get what I'm saying like that's not the
place where he should he should be at
like if he he feels like he knows more
than me knows more than everybody else
and he's like the best developer in the
world as they broke like come on like
you know what I mean like there's a
channel for junior developers you know
what I mean like that's how it is you
know but you know it was like man I
don't get these people don't have
anything better to do exactly you know
and some people might say Joe why are
you even giving this thing time or
answering is because it is hurtful it
I'll be honest it is hurtful to see from
Philippe I already know this guy's a
snake this guy's been talking shit every
fucking time he comes to the the chat
room I like I can't stand it right so I
just whatever I try to ignore whatever I
tried not to even answer his questions
or his dumb comment or whatever he wants
to talk about I just ignore him but it
is hurtful when you see people that
you've done nothing but show love go
look at all the videos that I did on the
first um the first video for the show I
forgot the name of it yeah the show that
I did with all five contestant
contestants I came in I was like
literally like lifting up this kid man
like man the golden child you guys
definitely got to be like him you know
take it on you know take advantage you
know look look at him as a you know
example like I've never
anything bad about this case done
everything right literally you know to
help this kid out and just show love
like you don't you know what I mean like
to create a channel right I had my own
or getter account where I have my own
coding face freakin chat room whatever I
say you know what freakin Mac you
already created this court you know what
I'm gonna send everybody to this court
right and for him to go in there with
everybody that's in there and be like
hey man we just gotta be talking shit
about Joe and block him from the Hangout
and like literally like you get what I'm
saying like it's like they have a
subsection with it the subsection of
coding phase I hang out that's where
they call go in there and talk shit like
it's crazy to me though because then
they people come in or you know liking
my instagrams or hitting me up on
Instagram like hey Joe I did this hey
Joe thank you for I got a job Hey Joe I
went for an interview today and then
they talking shit behind my back like
unlike a subsection of a subsection and
you know technically I shouldn't even
give a fuck about this but it's the fact
that I asked you guys go watch all my
videos I came in here talking as if I'm
talking with my friends hanging out with
my friends but after today after today
like that's over with I'm here to do my
videos and that saying this personal
thing that I have with with people like
you know I'm here to drop my knowledge I
come coming here to share things but the
way how people are to have like a
personal chat and be like hey talk shit
about me in there on my own freakin
channel that I promote it for you and
basically is like hey there's like a
freakin a subsection that you know that
it's like part of coding phase because
people go in there you know what I mean
so it's like this what people gotta go
in there there's like a guy in there
talking about code and it's like
trying to get some help and instead of
getting help people is just like the
people that are here just talking shit
like that's kind of crazy
to me I'm just like damn man it's just a
big letdown man is a it's a real big
letdown from this kid Mac man like you
know and front cam you know like Casey
is like okay whatever man Casey messes
around a lot you know what I mean
so it's like you don't even know what
he's playing around or where he's
serious but you know from Matt cam it is
a letdown man I'll be honest it is a big
letdown because I show love to all these
people if these people would have been
like yo man I want to come through to
your house I've littered I would
literally be like hey man when you lay
here in New York when you in Connecticut
you could come stay in my house you
could come chill like that's the type of
relationship that I thought I had and
type of you know people the type of
person that I am you know what I mean
but to being here and like literally
just like talking crap about me like
that's not even cool man like if you
wanna talk shit like talk shit in front
of my face you know what I mean like
that's one thing that pisses me the most
about it you know it's like the
subsections of subsections you know what
I mean
like all these people talking talking
shit it's like you know it's like math
it's like Oh Joe probably gonna have a
seizure like like I'm gonna have a
seizure and then this guy is like oh man
that where is it
I can't find it like Casey is like you
know Joe is a dumbass oh man like you
know what and I even deleted the name
from this guy Philippe but you know what
we bringing it back let's bring back his
whole name you know and we just gonna
leave it there you know what I mean like
when they find you google his name his
name is gonna show up the first thing
that's gonna show up is my video like
y'all just do it is a snake
whoever searches his name hallelujah you
know what I mean so that's just how it's
gonna be and I don't care no more you
know and it's not even like um like
upset because of Philippe Philippe has
been like a freaking pain in the ass
it's like a a freaking thorn that you
had on your foot for months and I've
been trying to just let this guy slide
and just like ignore him
but to know that the people that you
basically show love all the time and for
a whole year you know what I mean like
this isn't like hey guys like I left a
comment for one guy no this is people
that I've been showing love for a whole
year and you know of course I'm not
gonna be discouraged to helping people
out you know like I'm still gonna be
helping people out like no matter what
because that's what I'm here for
but wow what a letdown you know what I
mean like that's a letdown you know like
the days that I frickin don't hang out
with my family don't do a whole bunch of
stuff to make sure I do all my videos
you have counted for for you to have
counted from our website answer emails
answer phone calls I answer text
messages people send me text messages
directly to my phone people that help
out a lot of times and it's not just one
or two people it's about like 10 12
people that have my direct number that
when they they need my help I help them
out you get what I'm saying like that's
crazy like is great man this is great
because it actually it helps me out to
like detach you know what I mean like
detach from me that was like something
that traversing media was telling me on
one of his comments he's like yo man
don't even pay no mind to it's like
these people are 1% of 99% you know what
I mean it's like this another 99% of
people who are showing you love and you
don't need to even worry about those
people but this time that right there
seeing all those
images there now I'm not gonna ban them
i'ma leave them there
I'm not banning no but nobody the only
way that I'm banning people is when they
disrupt what we're talking about
have you met people in person that you
helped yeah a lot of people from New
York City people who are in New York
then will tell you hey I've met up with
them you know what I mean like like
that's the problem that's where it's
like I actually went out of my way to do
a whole bunch of stuff now it's not
innocent joking man it's not innocent
joking it's a lot of like just hate for
no reason you know what I mean and it's
like even just came at like litter is
like Oh having been so cutting face for
for over a month yeah because I did the
net neutrality video and you like after
that you hate me like for a fucking net
neutrality video like you get what I'm
saying like I've helped you out this
whole fucking year I'm freaking showing
you love this whole year
every time that we talk about anybody
that people like let's say when people
ask me like hey man you should try to be
like this person I always bring up man
I'm like you're mad really bust his ass
you could see on his github he's really
working he's really building
applications like seriously like bring
this kid up all the time you get what
I'm saying so and even cam man like cam
like so see that I'm like y'all you know
what I mean and I haven't even seen
everything I'm pretty sure that is even
worse in there you know in the chatroom
all of you guys that probably have
access which is kind of ridiculous like
coding phase don't have access to his
own coding phase channel on discord
alright so I promoted this channel for a
whole year and on top of that they
pretty much block me off my own app
basically because if it's coding phase
how the hell
Cody faces can't go on his own preheat
his own chat room when I had my own chat
room before and I basically stopped to
get a stop promoting get her to promote
this discord because Matt and Barbra was
showing love and I said you know what
this our loyal subscribers people who
are I trust and I'm gonna promote this
link this link basically became like a
hub for people to just talk shit about
me for no reason there's no reason at
all like that's it I just feel bad man
like it's crazy
and then people recording people
recording like Matt Matt record him on
the live stream when I'm like really
upset cuz I really did get upset at this
do Filipe I really did get upset because
the problem with it is not that he goes
against whatever I say the problem is
that he loves to disrupt if I'm talking
about something he's just like you know
what let's just disrupt this he wasn't
on the freakin live chat for the whole
hour he comes in for one second in the
one second he comes in didn't listen to
the whole conversation we was talking
about just because he heard weirdo
companies in his head he's thinking I'm
calling somebody in the chat room
weirdo company or we're don't like
nobody's calling I've never disrespected
anybody here on this chat room in my
fucking life you get what I'm saying I
got I show nothing but love so his head
comes in like a freakin a white night
you know sjw like a PC the PC master
comes in it's like you're talking about
this this and that I'm like prove this
is the problem it's like you've you you
don't listen to what I'm talking about
you don't know what the hell I'm talking
about and you come in here disrupting
whatever we're talking about
you get what I'm saying like like that's
the problem you know what I mean
now I'm not gonna report none of this
stuff man
it's just I'm just gonna take off all
the links from my my website and from
the channel like I don't want people
going into this channel and be like hey
I'm gonna join a coding phase community
and then the community is about this the
rogue the rogue squad of people you get
what I'm saying like some people that I
do I have no idea why they are hating or
they just talking shit like that's kind
of crazy you know what I mean like don't
you have something else to do man you
know and that's why like like I said man
this do Phillipe was a piece of shit
since the beginning and he's still going
to be a a piece of shit till now but
what's crazy to me is seeing KC in there
seeing Matt India Singh fan in there who
else cam you know thank God I haven't
seen Barbara talk shit I mean I don't
know hopefully not man cuz they're not
I'll be like damn that's fucked up like
I've talked nothing but good things
about Barbara so it's like that'll be
crazy you get what I'm saying you got
run wrong web decay like there's so many
people here like it's just like a
subsection of coda face that just pretty
much is like hey man you know yeah no
I'm definitely now I'm gonna create
another chat room now I'm not giving you
no that's the same thing why even give
them attention why draw them you know
why even talk about these people you
know why do I even give it give it time
because to be honest this does bother me
this does bother me that I it's like you
spent you spend a whole year
showing love to somebody and then at the
end of the day it's like they showing
their true faces for no reason like I
haven't it's not like I I came in here
and said some braces hey I I freaking I
slapped somebody up like you know I
haven't done anything literally the only
thing that I've done here it's pretty
much show love and just do what I have
to do over here on this channel that's
it and it's just it does bother me to
see those people there you know it would
have been anybody else up and I okay
cool like doesn't matter but this is
people that I will say like like really
like the people who who I've shown the
most love to over here you know what I
mean
cam to see cam in there you know that's
I'll be I'll be honest that's hurtful
man to see cam in there talking shit
about your boy like cam like I've done
nothing but show love your way and it's
like even at that if somebody you know
it's like somebody comes to me and talk
shit about camp and you're probably
thinking in your head like oh man Joe
like this the Internet man people do
this all the time and the people Nam and
this channel was not supposed to be like
that this channel was not supposed to be
a a fucking channel about being fake it
wasn't supposed to be a channel about
people hating on each other it wasn't
supposed to be a channel about none of
those things you get what I'm saying
like I I could have frickin done a
channel like four years ago and I didn't
want to do it it took me a long time
because I was like man I don't even know
if I want to do it for those specific
reasons I have other channels where
basically were they were about music and
stuff like that and I sold those
channels right I saw those channels once
they got to a certain level I got rid of
them right because I know how it was
it's like a certain point you get so
much hate and so much like crazy
comments and and dumb stuff
but for some reason somehow this whole
year we we kept this this channel pretty
good like that was very few like
headaches there were very few haters
there was very few or like crazy
situations like this like this is new
you know what I mean
but I just feel bad I do feel bad man
like I feel bad I'm like y'all never
again like this you know the idea of me
coming in and and like showing love to
people online and like you know I'll try
to answer questions to people that's it
but that personal stuff that you know I
try to have and with all these people
and show love constantly like that's not
gonna happen no more man I'm detaching
off this thing you know straight up I'm
detaching off this whole this whole
YouTube thing like and to be honest with
you I don't even know if I want to be
doing it because it's just like it's a
waste it's a waste I feel like it's a
waste like you come in here you show
love to people like I don't make no
money from YouTube at all
I make no money from YouTube I put in
the most hours into YouTube and YouTube
doesn't even do anything for me I'm not
gonna leave I'm not gonna leave but it
does makes me feel like all right I
don't even want to be doing it how I've
been doing it you know I've been like
going so hard I don't even want to do it
like that no more because it's just like
you helping people out and then at the
end of the day how you how you gonna
come here I'll show you love for a whole
fucking year and you don't have
consideration of that and then you take
my own chat room which is my chat room
you started it but it's my chat room
because I'm the one that's promoting it
I'm promoting it to people to go in
there how dare you go in there and start
talking shit about me like it's like I'm
sending my audience to a place where
it's like full of hate
for me and I didn't even know because I
don't have time to go inside the chat
room like that's crazy
you know what I mean that's crazy I
don't and it's just like you know I was
like
coming here like this is crazy this is
crazy man like how you hate this much
this is what this was what Matt saying
on the chat like yo Joe I am usually
what is it from this from from the
December he's like because he's mad
because I just don't care about net
neutrality should I really should I
really care about net neutrality like
that's like when Trump came in should I
care should I stop my life and be like
oh my god Donald Trump is gonna be
President now I have my life gonna
change you know what I'm saying like you
don't put you don't let those things
stop you you get what I'm saying
so because of that he goes like oh also
I'm glad at the number of dislikes Joe's
getting like he's happy I'm getting any
dislikes like that's crazy it's just
crazy to me
somebody that I show love to it's like
that hateful and like literally I I sent
my audience to you and you're over there
just like spilling hate about me just
like for no reason
never again I'm sorry guys
never again will ya
you see the only person that was
defending me in there was Barbara
so you see that I appreciate that
Barbara you know that's crazy
ya know it's pretty crazy dealing it's
pretty crazy how the hashtag is hang out
or something like that um but it's kind
of crazy like how how you you come in
it's like you come in dress as a sheep
but then you really a wolf underneath
you know what I mean like that's how I
look at it I'm like yo I show number
love to this cat man and for Matt to be
talking shit about me to take my
basically hijack my audience to talk
shit about me in there like that's not
right but that's just how it is that's a
new lesson learned never trust nobody I
mean I never trust nobody at all but you
know I trusted him because it's like
like what the hell does you know there's
a little Justin Bieber kids going to do
like you know it's like he seems like a
good kid he does his work he really
wants to learn it's like those are the
things that I have um you know the
thoughts I have for him he's like oh he
he looks like a good kid
you know but to literally be like hey
man I'm just gonna hijack your channel
and just like cool I'm going to
basically convert everybody who's on
your channel to try to hate on you on
your own chat like that's crazy now I'm
not trying to let I'm not playing I hate
like you know this mess up the channel
itself
I just wanna guys you gotta understand
this thing this channel is a personal
thing this is not I'm not a company you
get what I'm saying like I'm not a
company I'm not you know it's like when
you go and people go and leave comments
to the team tree house you think they
care you leave or hating coming on scene
tree house the CEO is like this cash

comment on clever programming you think
he cares he's cashing in it he making
money out of this you you think you go
and leave a hating coming to John
psalmist you think he gives a fuck about

you got what I'm saying like he goes in
he's cashing in he's making money I
never looked at this channel like that
everything and everybody here was like
family and everybody that that that left
a comment everybody left a comment or
reached out to me was a person behind
this the behind the screen same way how
I'm expecting that you guys is gonna
treat me like hey is a person behind the
screen this is not a company this is not
the CEO of coding phase calm now this is
Joe Joe Santos Garcia you know what I'm
saying like that's the problem I came in
here humble I came in here showing love
and then as the channels growing people
started start the blood start boiling
like this guys is doing good this
channel is doing good it's like they
expect me to be at the same level as I
was before it's like I haven't changed
you guys are changing it was like that
that Jay Z interview where he's like hey
man people think because you're getting
money and money changed you it's not
that you're changing it's the people
around you that's changing because you
have money now and it's the same thing
as this channel because this channel is
growing this channel has a good
acceptance and people love the channel
now those people are completely just
like just they just hate the channel for
some reason and that's the power
that's the same thing people say stuff
behind a screen they would never say in
your face you know what I mean like you
know and that's the truth now is the
same thing as that that do freakin
Phillipe if it was up to me and all the
shit that he's been talking to me for
six months straight bro I would have
slapped the shit out of him by now like
but he would never do that in real life
that's the truth this dude was like
30-something years old thirty eight
years old some shit like that about to
be 40 years old still over here trolling
on the internet like bro how do I look
like trolling at 38 years old you know
that's just how it is you don't go to
jail for slapping somebody if you're a
real person
you're a real dude and you do some
disrespectful shit when you get slapped
you can't call the cops on that you just
gotta shoot the fear you just gotta
fight it out that's if he knows he do
some disrespectful stuff then that's how
it is man yeah it's crazy you start
making that blue cheese and do start
hating they start changing like yo like
you know what I mean like I quit my job
full-time to do this thing and now I'm
really like analyzing it like you know
maybe I shouldn't have done that because
I know this thing was gonna be like this
you know what I mean I got I had this
thing like a family you know everybody
that came in here I came in like you
know like frickin just treat them good
same way how I want to get treated but
it's like this tool just snakes like
literally snakes like that's crazy you
know what I mean
like I'm camera me if you want man you
could hit me up man you know but I am
disappointed bro I'll be honest I'm
disappointed because out of all people
ok I can understand a match being acting
funny for a while the whole month is
since the net neutrality video which is
kind of ridiculous like bro you were
twenty something years old 22 years old
21 years old like why are you worried
about this like you have other stuff to
worry about like a net neutrality video
it makes you hate somebody on the
internet like that's crazy
like I don't care about about net
neutrality that thing did not stop me
then the trailer could disappear
tomorrow I'm still gonna make money in
this world the Donald Trump could be
president for the next 50 years I'm not
gonna cry for it you get what I'm saying
like that was the whole video and dudes
took it like as if I was talking
blasphemy or something it's like bro who
cares it's like net neutrality is gone
are you gonna cry for it no I'm not
gonna cry for it you know but yeah man
Ramsay Jordan came in a little bit late
nothing man is just like the chatroom a
pretty much Matt's
chatroom Matt's hate coating face
Channel the one that I've been promoting
all year long is pretty much it's like a
rat-infested discord channel where
everybody they're just talk shit about
me and it it's hurtful because it's from
people that I respected and show love
here you know what I mean like I show
nothing but love to these people like
that that's this that's this respectful
man that's like if you to me I consider
everybody friends and that's something
that you should never do like I'm the
type of person that consider everybody
they're friends now I'm not gonna ban
nobody
I'm not banning nobody you know like
we're not banning anybody
if people are disruptive you know what I
mean if you disruptive thing you have to
get banned because you know that's how
it is
like it's crazy now let them have the
channel we're gonna create a new chat
which is the main reason why I started
doing it I started doing it on on my own
website because I had like a gut feeling
like I wrong
october/november I say there's something
like off about the channel and then now
because there's people who have love for
your boy they come in and like yo man
why are your peoples the people that you
show love all the time on the channel
when you help out all the time and and
just always elevating them and always
pay attention to whatever they say why
are they talking shit about you on your
own freakin chat room that's crazy but
that's how it is is the Internet man I
learned my lesson don't trust nobody
it's just crazy to me man
pretty damn crazy but here man we got
good stuff coming up man I mean what
what do you guys want to talk about me
the chat is there like the messages is
there you know what I mean cam like
that's the thing I don't even know how
to add the role I don't mess with this
court I don't that's the main reason why
I left it to Matt to basically run it so
it's just like it's disappointing man
because it's like you know what it is is
like people I feel like people think
that I'm like a character you know what
I mean it's like you know it's like you
go to I don't know a TV show and you're
like oh man this this freaking guy sucks
so this guy is he's talking shit this
guy is it doesn't know anything this
that but what you don't understand is
that's a person that's why I don't do
social media that's what I do Twitter
I don't do none of those stuff I don't
go in there and be like even when I
don't like artists music I don't go in
at them and be like send a message oh my
god your song is horrible like that's a
person like you you're not gonna say
that to a regular person that's walking
down the street you can never like Jesus
Christ your t-shirt is horrible with
Jesus Christ your you're a freaking your
sneakers is is the worst sneakers I've
seen in this world like you don't do
that you know you get what I'm saying
like I don't do that because I know
everybody out there is just some regular
person you know what I mean but yeah I
guess it's easier to think like oh man
it's just like some character you know
I'm some character on the internet you
know that I come in and give trust to
people and show love to people and then
people talk shit about me on my own
platform that I promote it to help them
out why should you know why is this
important to me and why I'm not even
talking about you
because if this is like this is the last
straw
to be honest is the last straw you know
there's the last row where I've been
like super committed to this channel and
I'm just not gonna be like crazy
committed to it like that like I'm gonna
do my my stuff I'm up to my videos I
might give you guys the knowledge I'm
gonna give you everything but that thing
of me answering texts at 3 o'clock in
the morning or sending out you know
helping people out with freaking their
homework freaking like you you guys
don't know the behind-the-scenes of
stuff you know what I mean like you
don't know the behind-the-scenes of
stuff that I do for a lot of people I
come in spend you know even when I was
doing the the the freakin show that I
did where this came Matt was on like
throughout the whole time I was going
through math stuff and I was still
making it to like every every other day
that they needed me to be there to
answer the emails or whatever like I
didn't have to do none of that stuff and
I was going I was going through like
real stuff going on in my life like my
sister had just passed away my mom was
like going through my issues like real
situations and I made it for it and even
now the last show that I did I didn't
get to finish the last episode with cam
and this other kid I believe in them it
was Tom because there was the situations
that I had in my life that I couldn't
make it to those I couldn't get to
finish the the last episode but it was
because of situations that really
happened in my life you know what I mean
so this whole idea that I've been like
going so hard it's like I I need to go
hard and make my money unfortunately and
just do what I gotta do take care of my
family take care of the things that I
have to do because people are ungrateful
people are snakes people are just pieces
of shit in this world you know what I
mean and we got to start looking at
people for what they are man
say you know so it's like it's crazy but
that's the thing cam you see you like ya
ya know I love you Joe though even
friends have disagreements of fight but
that's the thing what have I done to
have any type of disagreement of you
guys like ban Philippe Philippe was a
freaking snake since the beginning for
months I never wanted that to I kept him
around because of Matt and Barbara
that's in that's the only reason this do
has not been bent
I never been nobody there's only been
three people bent from the whole channel
Sam because he wasted people's time 27
people applied to become part of the
internship show right they wanted to be
part of the mentorship show sorry 27
people wanted to be part of the
mentorship show and this guy signed up
for it and didn't even show up I chose
to him and he didn't show up or send an
email or nothing so you know what I mean
so it's like it's crazy like it's crazy
you know what I mean and then freakin
man uploading videos like like really
like so you guys can have a laugh like I
really did not want to curse I was
having such a good show before Philippe
show up and that's why my face is like
kill I'm so pissed off that this two
showed up on a really good show
you got what I'm saying like we was
having a really good show for an almost
an hour and 15 minutes and the dude
shows up to literally to argue about
bullshit
that's why I don't like the freakin guy
that's a there's nothing that he brings
into the table he doesn't give any
advice he doesn't do anything for nobody
but come in here and literally disrupt
that's it
exactly Tyler like that's what I'm
saying that's why Sam got banned because
it's like bro like you don't do that
people come in here and they really
wanted to be part of it and we didn't
choose them because we gave him the
spotlight you know what I mean so it's
crazy but what I remain you know it's
like as far as everybody else man that's
that's just a lesson for you guys a lot
of you guys is gonna jump into doing
doing you know web development and a
YouTube channel and stuff like that
this is the stuff that you're gonna have
to deal with you know if you're in like
I feel like I'm not built for this
because for the simple fact that I'm too
invested into it if I was to look at
this like a money thing and but hey I
could make money off youtube which I
don't make no frickin money this shit
doesn't make no fucking money I put in
so much fucking time that could be doing
other stuff like I could literally be
setting up right now our office to
create you know what designs or what
development for companies around here
but I'm focused on creating videos on
YouTube you get what I'm saying like
this is the crazy there's the crazy part
about it but whatever man I learned my
lesson never again trust nobody even if
they look like a little kid man you know
it's like I'm really pissed off with
this kid man show him love for a whole
year and then he pretty much hijacked
the check basically my chat when I had
my own chat and now I come in I start
giving him to the people to having a
chat and he basically he basically is
like hey man we just gotta talk shit
behind Joe's back in his own chatter I'm
like who does that
and now you guys know listen man
tomorrow we got a couple of portfolio's
that we're reviewing so yeah man that's
what we're doing we doing a couple of
folios I was gonna release them today
but then I decided to release the bit
the video about table Plus because a lot
of people should know about that you
know so yeah now we getting this
negativity out of here man this thing
has been like a cold man like yeah man
yeah portfolios reviews is is coming
tomorrow I already have a scheduled for
2:00 p.m. Eastern Time and damn yeah man
your boys getting sick but yeah so it's
crazy just I'm just thinking about I'm
like young I'm disappointing like OD
disappointed like I will understand like
Casey I understand cause Casey is like
you don't know when cases joking around
or it wings being serious cam I'm
disappointed on freaking Matt I'm super
disappointed like super disappointed
like really really disappointed like
really really
od disappointed yeah that's about it you
know what I mean and yeah just you know
thanks to
from what I heard Barbara you the only
person in there that pretty much is like
y'all like defending me which I
appreciate it you know but there's
people there sneaks man like like that's
crazy but they could be here I'm not
banning anybody I'm just not gonna talk
to them I'm not talking to nobody
anymore like no no those people that in
its in that group I'm not talking to
them I don't you know god bless them you
know have fun do what you got to do you
know hope you you got what you needed
you you got to learn as much as you
could
I hope do as much as I could and but
it's crazy it's to me just mind-boggling
like how you do that how I come in I
have my own chat room you come in and
you tell me hey we have a chat room
that's probably better and then I say
okay cool so I'm gonna promote that chat
room and then now that chat room is like
a hate hub for my youtube channel it's
like literally I'm sending people who
are new subscribers people who are
seeing my my my videos to go to your
chat room where you just talk shit about
me and you do nothing else but that you
know god bless you guys man and so
Philippe man bro you a snake man I told
you from the beginning he was a snake
that's why don't fuck with you you bring
a snake bro like in real life outside of
the shit I would have slapped the SH out
of you because you've been disrespecting
me for a while and this is not like some
joking around shit I would have to shout
at you right now
like a real-life dislike some little
kiss stuff like like who wants to have
some dude talking shit to them 24/7 for
six months six months is a long time I
do like I would have slapped a shadow
you right now trust me and even at that
video I'm not catching the CG I'm just
like bro I don't know if he was in front
of me I would have knocked you out bro
like that's the truth the only reason
I'm like that cuz I'm really fighting
I'm fighting with myself I'm like Joe
don't even ignore this to ignore this do
it ignore this dude don't listen to this
dude because that's all he does all he
does is show up to come in and argue
with you and come in constantly to
basically disrupt if you're talking
about topic he wants to be out here
throwing bullshit jokes that don't make
no sense and he just wants to disrupt
the whole video that's why I was upset
that's why I was like man I couldn't
even hold it back I'm like fighting to
not curse because when I curse on a
video I'm making no money so if I was
gonna make freakin three dollars from
that video that day which it adds up to
like $20 $30 in a day right from YouTube
to pay the freaking taxes that's why I
used a freaking YouTube money for um I
didn't want I didn't want to ruin that
video that was a good video we dropped a
lot of gem so we talked about a lot of
good topics we had a lot of different
you know different things that we were
talking about like but for you to come
in at the enemy's like just ruin it just
because like you've been doing that for
six months bro like have some respect
you don't do that outside
your mom didn't teach you how to do shit
like that when you're in a classroom you
raise your hand and you talk right when
you were in a meeting at a job you come
in and you let the person talk and then
you come in and you talk and you give
you your your point of view but what you
do is you come in I could be talking
about something and you talk about
something completely different than what
the fucking topic is and you do that
shit all the fucking time that's why I
couldn't fucking stand you if it wasn't
because a man or Barbara you would have
been fucking gone a long fucking time
ago and in real life I would have just
left to shout at you because you're
disrespectful if you try to talk over me
I slap the shit out of you
right cuz you gotta give me my respect
to talk let me talk and then you talk
not you talk over me because then down
you disrespect them
man and that's how I take it if you feel
like oh man that's not that's not
corporate that's not PC this isn't a
corporate channel you get what I'm
saying like this isn't a corporate
channel go do that shit on somewhere
else bro and that's it anyways I'm out
of here
love you guys everybody who goes in here
man
and yeah we definitely we're not talking
about this dudes anymore
straight-up this just gone because it's
just funny to me how you show love to
people and this is how they are right
okay
Matt see you let see you around kid you
know fucking snake</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
