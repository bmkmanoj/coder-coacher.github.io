man heart
I just want Super Saiyan op up right now
for no reason alright guys you know me
I'm crazy like that alright
but anyways man I'm gonna teach you guys
when to use margin and when to use
padding this is super simple somebody
left me a comment which was actually a
message saying hey man when the hell do
I use padding or when the hell do I use
margin alright so look very simple we
have three boxes here right we have one
which is the parrot which has a red
background right and inside of it we
have two boxes box 1 and box tool right
now let's imagine this we want a padding
we want space inside of the the red one
which is the parent so what we're going
to do is we're gonna use padding right
so we're gonna say padding let's say 20
pixels now that gives us the space up
inside of the you know the box right
which is the parent right now right now
we have the other two boxes but we don't
even know that there's actually two
boxes because they're both next to each
other right now it's on
display:inline-block right so we
actually want it to have a space both of
them have to stay the same the same
space and Saturday but we just want
space outside and just been okay okay
buddy give me some damn space right so
on box one we're going to do margin
right 20 pixels you see so now what that
day was just basically pushed it to the
side and said okay give me my dance
space alright what's that hard no right
now sum it up once again saying it again
you got me repeating myself you know I
don't like to repeat myself but I'm
do it for you all right remember padding
you use padding when you want to give
space inside of a box inside of a div
inside of a header inside of a paragraph
inside of whatever you want any tag
right whenever you want to use any tag
as long as is either block or inline
block you could give it a space inside
of it right so let's say right right now
we say okay we want the right one to
have a space inside of it now when you
want to say hey I want space outside of
the box then you use a module and that's
what we do here we basically say okay
there's one box we want to give a space
between this box and this box so we say
hey give me 20 pixels to the right so we
just basically pushed it 20 pixels to
the right it's that simple guys I know
some somebody might come here but this
isn't the most technical way to teach it
listen this is why my channel is my
fucking channel man that's what I'm here
for
I'm not here to basically say the big
words up in this bitch
I'm here to just pretty much just have
fun and teach you guys in a way where
he's like you're talking to your buddies
like you're not gonna talk to your buddy
in a super technical way when he was a
technical shit that's why the courses
are right there on the description I
give you guys basically the sum up you
know the little summary in my own way
but at the same time if you're smart you
actually catch that I'm dropping a lot
of gems

to sleep man tomorrow I got work but I
wanna give you a little video and just
