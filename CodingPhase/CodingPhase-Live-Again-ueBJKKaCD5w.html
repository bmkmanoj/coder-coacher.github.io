Honda Civic
it wasn't really my car was my mom's car
first car I was driving but now it's
kind of sexy right there that little red
Honda Civic like that oh that's not bad
it's actually not bad at all
the paint looked kind of cheap though
that's the only thing well you can't you
can't hate this it's a Honda Civic
they're reliable okay Kyle Jones says
can you talk about if I should go to
college for computer science or
something else if you want to be a
developer it depends what you want to do
if like let's say you're 16 17 years old
I will say go to college if you're a
grown-ass woman or a grown-ass man let's
say 28 29 years old and you're like oh
I'm gonna go to college I'll be like nah
don't even waste your time exactly how
old and your financial situation this is
like if you're a grown-ass woman it's
hard for you to just be like hey I'm
gonna take four years out of my life and
not earn any money and just go to school
full time you know what I mean like it's
hard
now if you go to part-time then it's
gonna take you like six years to
graduate and I just don't think it's
worth it especially because you could
get the job without a degree so why
would you you know what would you go to
college for it big hits
it's one o'clock
animals are basketballs
so let me see
yeah you send me your resume right now
I'll check it out once I get home I
should be home like I follow clock
Sani sorry
yeah man I think everybody does that
everybody in the beginning does that
where they use other people's plugins or
they JavaScript for other people but
once it'll you know once you get
comfortable you start making your own so
I don't worry about it it's okay if you
use other people's JavaScript
chillin in a big body banks let's get
the mozzie give anybody another year
give me city another you know the end of
the year and let's see what we do out

like milk so that your loss knowledge
will sound like you found the bad stuff
for savage myself yeah
it was out here is sadly switching up
for that bread
choo-choo-choo
what delight developer the full-time
developer super senior super senior
skills both struck their online
instructor you to work the whole nine
that's it that's it let them boil that's
fine it's good like that a little bit
it's good like that
try it out that's Turkey right Turkey
good yeah I'm saying that's turkey right
yeah I rolled it off okay right
Oh
Oh
any question guys
somebody sent me a message saying how do
you basically motivate yourself to do
coding every single day when I'm like
man it's fun I have fun I have fun
coding I don't have fun when I'm having
to fix a bug or something like that but
when it comes to like coding I have fun
I love that I love being able to solve
problems I love the way I feel after I
solve a problem I'm addicted to it I'm
addicted to to coding I realized that
I'm addicted to coding I love coding
it's fun I love learning
so that's our motivate myself
yeah
she said hey all my friends are dick
push me to the edge any question guys yo
I wonder who here has been on my website
checked out the courses I'm wondering I
know Jerry he's checked it out I know
Kim has checked it out who else in here
in here
Barbara's supposed to check it out I
don't know she's doing her work I'm
going through I'll be checking people's
stats man I'll check your stats I find
out if you're actually doing the work on
that so that's why I basically open up
this website so I can keep track of
everybody to see who's doing work who's
not doing work who comes in for five
minutes who leaves for five minutes who
comes in and pump fakes watches the
videos but watches them fast forward
like I keep track of all of that of
course I'm not going to share that
knowledge that information to work for
anybody but it's for me to know who's
Siri is I like to know how people are
working are they having a hard time on a
video though they replay it multiple
times
yeah it's good info
let me see I'm trying to read everybody
everybody's messages man so today I'm
trying out this new salad let's see how
that goes
if it don't work for me then I'm going
back to the turkey sandwiches
hmm those include eh my friends a bitch
it's flash still relevant no it's not
flash is dead but for the people that
learn flash is still useful because they
can still use those things to create
animations to create phone applications
so dude because you learn flash let's
say five years ago or even ten years ago
don't mean that now it's irrelevant
because you can still use those skills
to do other things
okay David Young said hey Joe since
changing the price to Oh access to your
to your courses has there been any
changes to the number of registered
users yes we got so many people that
registered write a lot and I mean a lot
even that day that day that I released
the video about the five projects I
think about 300 people signed up that
day everybody I fought others but it was
great
it's great to have more people and
what's cool about is that at any given
time I'm trying to merge a couple of
things to the website like also adding
comments so you guys can leave a comment
on the video and yeah I could have
conversation we love each other so like
I said an example you're doing I don't
know for each loop and you're like you
can't understand it you leave a comment
I will answer your question or if
another user sees it he can answer your
question because at any given time
there's about 20 people on the site
because now we we definitely grew a lot
so that's definitely a lot of people on
the website now it's not Stack Overflow
where there could be 300 400 people but
we're getting there
you know what I mean like we're getting
there you know we're definitely gonna
have a huge community right now we got a
thousand something people on the website
which is great that signed up the goal
is 10,000 when I reach 10,000 users
active users not just oh yeah signed up
a thousand people and then you know the
next month everybody cancelled nah I'm
talking about having 10,000 active users
people are gonna be there and be active
pretty much like you know I'm I'm gonna
do this full-time you know 100% at a
time I want to go all over the country
go to different boot camps go to
different meetups go to different
high schools and you know make this into
like a career not just me teaching but
also finding out people's backgrounds
like you know I mean what didn't you
guys like to know like get to talk to
like let's say one of the the head had
all developers on my facebook great and
just pick their brain so I was thinking
about doing that I'm like I have a
couple of connections on Facebook gonna
have a couple of connections at
Microsoft so it would be cool to go like
all over the country and interview
different developers from different
companies you know I got some people
that hit me up from coca-cola which i
think is is located in Atlanta who are
developers who like my show and I'm like
man wouldn't you be cool if I could just
go all over the country interview
developers you know do like a a story
like a good ten minute video or like
their journey of becoming developers you
know what I mean like yeah so oh no I'm
thinking and a half a lot ideas man it's
just I don't have the time because I
work for time man if I could do eight
hours of youtubing in coding coding
phase then things will be great but it's
not like that you know what I mean
yeah yeah a lot of people been telling
me um you know they subscribed and then
they unsubscribed and now they
subscribed back again and that's great
man as long as you come back you know
it's fine sometimes there might be a
month that you're like okay this month
there's no no courses diamond
interesting
I mean it's five dollars ah to be honest
with you guys listen I'm paying for so
many people and patreon you know I'm
paying you know for for people's
channels as if it was a bill right but I
could do that right I know a lot of
people that I command that I in their
head like oh man I don't know if I want
to pay $5 so I want to support some
other food but $5 a month
listen I don't know what to tell you man
five hours is like literally like you
throw that money away
trust me you go to McDonald's they give
you change throughout the whole month
every time that you buy something to
give you change what do you do with that
change you know what I mean
put that money in in a little corner I'm
gonna okay this the fine artists for
coding phase calm you know if you
support the challenge support what I'm
doing here and at the same time it's
like all the courses that I'm putting up
you're gonna find them in other places
at twenty twenty-five dollars if you're
smart for five dollars you pretty much
could basically game the system and just
like take all the courses as you can on
dime month and you know for five dollars
like it sounds like super gaming the
system
so yeah guys you know what I mean like
plus you gotta think about it like this
man when you guys pay five dollars I
want you guys to really know this like
when you pay five dollars I get three
dollars it's like a dollar sixty-five
cents goes into the fees for a credit
card so I'm only making $3 guys it's not
like you know so some guys send me a
message like oh man they're like oh now
I gotta subscribe to Joe like this this
is Netflix I'm like bro it's to you
throw in $3 at me
like if you was like a whole bunch of
money you know how many times I think
it's gonna slack you okay I think he had
a G wants to see
 to check check check check chair
and we'll see can I set this up right
that it's now died great
no God word now everybody's gonna kill
me because I got soda this ain't this
some y'all listen I got
Charlotte I'm halfway there
listen I'm getting there give me a
little time give your boy a little time
you know what I mean
we can't do this in one day man let me
get there slowly but surely you know
you're gonna start seeing me with more
water and you know girls crazy
[Laughter]
I know the thought is the worst thing it
has to be I saw somebody cook a soda and
when they cooked it just became sugar
and it was like all these man
that's so nasty but man it feels good
though
feels good to the heart know what I mean
so I'm gonna try to quit for sure just
give me some time man
give me some time I'm starting to
workout in there you know I'm trying to
get back on my back rush so
do you know I mean but all right guys
I'm gonna see you guys Lina I might eat
this
BS salad that I got and I'm a jump on
that aqua man all right I'll see you
guys later
Wow make sure you go to coding phase
comm guys check it out
listen what you're getting right now is
a major deal fatherless guys go to
coding phase comm check out the es6
course 84 music I know you you're
already almost advanced in JavaScript
jump on that es6 course trust me there's
a lot of stuff I know a lot of people
already took the es6 course from steven
Grider but you know that the way that I
do it is totally different and it's
easier to understand so check it out I
just break it down real dummy proof keep
it pretty simple and leave comments on
it whatever you guys don't understand
let me know so like that I could help
you out and it's quick guys it's pretty
