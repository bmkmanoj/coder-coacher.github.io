at it again man listen five resources
that every junior developer should know
and should be visiting right now live
all right guys so we're gonna start like
this HTML reference that I oh all right
you guys probably like what the hell
that I oh what the hell is this right
well it's like a dot-com but technically
it means input/output a lot of cool
websites they instead of using calm
because everybody already got the
dot-coms they're using the I oh all
right but yeah so HTML reference the IO
is like legit basically you could have
all the tags here right so let's say an
example you look into to know all the
properties that you could put into into
tables right right I just jumped out of
nowhere but yeah so pretty much you
could get to the tables and let's say
you wanted to create a table you're like
okay how do you create a table you come
here
click tables then show up here on the
page and basically the guy he left you
an example he's telling you okay you
could actually put in inside of the
table you can put in a caption which is
this one you can have the table which is
this now from there you got the tea body
which is this then from that you got the
TDs which is basically the the columns
right then you got the tea foot which is
like the footer tables footer we got the
th which is the table header so on and
so on
and it gives you the properties at the
same time properties that could go into
those song those tags right that's one
thing that is amazing about HTML
reference right and at the same time it
tells you semantic you know stuff that
you might use like article all of this
stuff is like html5 that a lot of people
don't know about because a lot of
tutorials don't really go into deep into
basically what you actually need to be
html5 compliance well here you actually
got examples and it's telling you what
each tag is actually useful
all right CSS reference that IO coming
from the same guy man this guy's legit
man if you guys look him up man
the creator of this two pages he's also
the creator of palma de io which is a
framework which is pretty much ten times
better than bootstrap if you don't know
about that go check that out anyway so
CSS reference man like let's say an
example for you guys that don't
understand the you know CSS position and
it's pretty simple he basically breaks
it down and say okay you know you got
bottom you can put the bottom property
and say okay 20 pixels so what it does
it basically puts 20 pixels from the
bottom now they say bottom zero will go
all the way to this to the bottom
basically or like let's say laughs Auto
it's not gonna do anything left arm left
80
you got 80 pixels from you know from the
left side left on negative 20 negative
you know 20 pixels to the to the left
basically that's about it right and like
you have transitions for guys that I
want to work with css3 animations you
got animations and you got typography
you got backgrounds all the ways that
you question to use the background you
see if you use fixed it's pretty cool so
pretty much is like isn't a JIT man like
you can't go wrong whenever you need
something about CSS I know people check
out w3 school always w3c school or you
could check out the Mozilla well now
there's something meanwhile here which
is CSS reference which is I think to me
it's thirty thousand times better than
that all right all right so then the
next thing is code pen right
everybody knows Co pen if you don't know
about Col pen I don't know where the
hell you've been man because Co pen is
legit alright so let's say you're a user
right let's say you're a developer you
sign up for copan and you want to share
you know a cool little project that you
created right like people come here
and they create a whole bunch of cool
stuff just with CSS CSS and JavaScript
like this is pretty cool like all the
stuffs probably done through SVG's yep
I know SVG's and it shows you how to do
the animation like it's pretty legit or
like let's say an example you guys are
building a let's say slide show right
you need a slider for for your website
right and you're like you don't know how
to build it but you're still needed you
may still need to build it pretty much
you can come here and look at what
somebody else built take their code and
pretty much you could just put in your
page at the same time you quire the
customizer you could change it you could
come here and like let's say change
whatever you want out of it or you could
for okay you could save it there's a lot
of stuff that you could do you know with
people's examples and this is cool
because you can create your new like
let's say you wanted to create a new pen
and you wanted to share it with somebody
and say hey I want to share you
I don't know something like this and be
like hey no value got hey buddy now you
could go and save this that's it it's
saved all right and then from there you
can actually share it and basically take
this URL and save it and give it to
somebody share and just copy and paste
and that's it all right so we're going
back to the next one which is Scotch
that uh-oh
yep Scotch that I own right yeah I come
here all the time man this is like a
blog what they have here is like all the
latest things that's going on in the
industry like let's say whenever new on
programming language comes out or a new
framework comes out you want to actually
be on top of the game and pretty much
know what's in the industry so I will
say go to Scottsdale and pretty much
look at and look around man say take
your time you know
check out what they got getting to the
getting started with JavaScript buildin
no website get started with angular like
there's so many cool things that they
have and all of the stuff is like blogs
so pretty much in there it shows you
examples so like let's say let's go with
this I'm bill
unknown website alright look this one's
got videos alright this is for free and
this guy's is giving out stuff you know
for free which you guys should
definitely take advantage of course it's
not like you know it's not super quality
compared to something that you pay for
but man is free you can't complain you
know you got resources you got tour
wheels let's say an example JavaScript
tutorial you know you guys that love UJS
there you go you want to learn some of
you go ahead man check it out you know
it tells you the prerequisites all the
things that you're going to need how to
build a gives you examples start out you
get every demand alright so another
website that I think everybody should
know about is texture dial right seems
like everybody's using that I Oh what
the hell alright anyways but yes so
thing or was a texture that IO is legit
because they also are like you know just
like Scott style we're pretty much they
have examples like let's say you want to
build something of Rails you know it has
its like a blog but at the same time it
has checklist so it shows your can stole
nodejs and stole rails and stow sequel
light so it starts you know showing you
all the things that you need and then
once you build it it goes okay finish
just take me to the next chapter and
then from there it shows you okay this
once you got a build that are just like
a regular tutorial but the only
difference is that this isn't you know
basically build with text all right is
it's not that difficult
you know people used to do this all the
time back in the days people used to
actually read they didn't watch videos
some people I see you learn better when
they read something and then actually
just watching somebody creating
you know so it's all up to you however
you you learn but yeah it's actually
free and they have like a paid version
where you could download the files it's
up to you what you guys want to do but I
think just take it for what it is is
free and yeah man also you know you know
the other ones coke added me what's the
other one a free coke and this and that
yes those are great and the reason why
they want to put them here on my list
because everybody talks about that you
know everybody talks about those two
and yes they great they are amazing I
wanted to give you guys something that
maybe you guys haven't heard of or
having really used alright anyways man
make sure you subscribe make sure you
like this video man it's a boy chill
back at it again
of course guys like I was telling you
you get what you pay for all the stuff
and all these resources are free now if
you want to take it to the next level
and you want to come in here pretty much
