your back at it again man listening we
gotta talk about Christmas right the big
c you know the little cousin that nobody
won't talk about you know craigslist
right all right so you can find a job on
craigslist and then what I'm going to
job it might be good it might be bad
like that's just being honest with you
the worst companies are going to post on
craigslist I remember a couple of
companies that I have lied to and I
found on craigslist because in the
beginning you so excited that equal
actually works for somebody oh yeah I'm
going to be doing code i'm going to be
doing this discussing this when you're
super excited but the reality of things
insulin-like some companies you have a
fire like the shittiest companies there
period and when I mean shitty a really
shitty like people that are gonna be
like oh like they might wanna pay you
like some some amount of money
we're like okay you have a certain
skills and you know your skills or worse
let's say sweaty twenty four dollars an
hour but because you're a new developer
somebody might be like hey we're gonna
try to get twelve dollars an hour you
know sometimes you have to take it
because you might need to experience
like you can be constantly saying oh no
to every single job if you don't have no
experience right sometimes we just got
to take one that's bad just for a few
months and then move on to the next this
company is out there man that they just
treat people like slaves I'm just being
honest like they just don't care about
you and they don't care about you know
anything about your personal lives like
you might be sick and oh hey there go
straight days here buddy you might just
come in late and it's like they don't
care to just go okay we don't care what
happens to you we don't care if they
told you cause they don't care if you
you know for whatever reason somebody
left their the keys and then you
come back and open the door for them
whatever it is whatever personal
situation on coming they just don't care
those are the type of coming means that
you that fine right now of course
there's going to be gigs sometimes
you're going to find gigs start pretty
cool like a lot of times when I find
like good freelance jobs world on
craigslist like I would have like a
director who just created a short film
in the summer and then I'll go meet with
him you know like a starbucks and killed
some hey that's what the movie is about
and then I go where create them to
website forum or like artists might want
to come and say hey we got a rock band
and you want to create a page for our
band and be able to put always tour
dates and stuff like that that's great
those are the fun ones but you know
you've got to go with it and take
advantage of football correctness and
just do your thing man like just
sometimes you supply she was out there
you know it's not an emergency just
apply to you know a bunch of
jobs on craigslist because you have no
experience I feel brand new developers
with junior developer if you have no
experience like you could be the most
type of person experiences was that will
make you worse something and I will say
hey to your TG to you already knows your
boy Joe back at it again man listen make
sure you subscribe and make sure you
like this video man by the way if you
want to know exactly what courses I took
to become a web developer they right
there in the description it's no secret
it's nothing crazy as no secret gift
that I had it just pretty much i put the
courses they're pretty cheap that I
Christian dollars beats on specials and
just this immense change your life
change your lifestyle do something fun
and something cool that you could call a
career Wow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
