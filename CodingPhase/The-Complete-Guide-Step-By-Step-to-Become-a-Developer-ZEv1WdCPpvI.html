again coding phase comm your boys back
and out and did it again alright guys
listen I just created this timeline for
you guys because I keep getting this
question Joe where do I start
what do I do what is it that I need to
learn to become a developer alright now
I made this page on my website so you
guys could definitely check it out go to
coding face.com and you click right here
where it says timeline click on that
timeline and right here you pretty much
is going to have a list of courses or
just topics in general it doesn't mean
that you know they have to be courses
just topically in generals that you need
to know before you get to get hired as a
web developer or sometimes you might
even have just five or six of these
things and you get hired right but if
you really want to take it to that next
level and you really want to be one of
the best of the developers out here and
just get paid really well you will
follow along and finish the rest of them
all right now of course these are all
examples to my courses and at the same
time you don't have to do my courses you
pretty much can use this as a timeline
for yourself me like okay cool I like
Joe I don't like his courses I'll do
whatever I find my own course online I
find my own way I have my own book I'll
find my own you know my own YouTube
channel or find another website we'll go
to team treehouse I could go to you to
me I could go to a plural site I could
go to Cole caddy me I could go to Co
school comm wherever you go right it
doesn't matter this is a timeline for
you to be able to become a developer
there's a timeline for you to take
advantage cuz I took my time to write
this down for you guys and pretty much
is there man go to coding phase calm and
just pretty much go to the menu here
click on timeline get started alright
now going into my courses explaining it
pretty much I would definitely say first
of all you gotta start with Adam
because you need a text editor you need
somewhere to write your code and all the
things that Adam has it just makes your
life so much easier so many packages
it's just an amazing editor right very
simple there from day you have the
terminal for developers I used to think
that it was more important to learn HTML
CSS than the terminal but the more I
work with new developers I realized that
man the terminal should be before they
even start coding anything people should
know how to work with the terminal
period like we're in 2017
everything is done to the terminal
there's no longer people using FTP so I
mean sometimes they use FTP but almost
everything is done through the terminal
to launch your website is through the
terminal you you upload something to get
you do it through your terminal like
everything is through the terminal guys
so before you do anything learn how to
use the terminal the command line
alright it's very simple guys it's like
five six commands and then from there
you're good you're golden now from there
you need to have a HTML and CSS that's
for sure that's like the basics that's
like that's like English alright you
know you live in America you got a no
minimum English right
that's it to be successful right there
from there you have build a responsive
app then from there you have sass like a
pro the reason why I say sass is very
important because CSS if you also go and
write down CSS just plain CSS it takes
forever to do every single style that
you want alright but with sass it just
makes your life easier you know you
don't want to be spending the ten
minutes fifteen minutes writing CSS when
you could do it in three minutes
right pretty much just to keep it simple
then from there of course
future proof JavaScript you need to know
JavaScript meaning all the basics
programming languages they all have the
same things so as I Cuse JavaScript
as introduction to programming right so
you gotta know if statements and loops
functions variables different data types
all right so make sure you take that
all right then from there I will say
jQuery alright as you can see there's a
little red status I'll tell you guys at
the end after this so you guys can have
a you know clear vision of what's going
on here
so pretty much then from there you have
yes next so you have to learn es6 yes
seven yes eight yes nine whatever es
comes up that's why I just put es next
whatever is there like you know ah that
whole course by itself what I'm doing is
every time a new version of JavaScript
is coming out I'm just gonna add it to
that I'm not a you know separating oh
this es6
now there's another course for es 7
there is another course for esa no
everything's gonna be there so it's
called es next that's it
all right there for me I will say your
Freight or your first framework try out
hyper FJs try it out it's very simple
very easy to get started it's like
literally one function you have
everything one function with one object
and you that's it that's your framework
you know you know and a high level to
explain it all right the easiest way I
can explain it there from there you need
to know react of course
react is gonna guarantee you to get a
job out there all right but like I said
react it's a little bit difficult to
start with so that's why you should
start with hyper fgs so your brain could
start working with JavaScript frameworks
and you're like okay this how you do
things and you're also working with JSX
so because you're working with JSX when
you jump to react it's gonna be a very
easy transition it's not gonna be like
oh my god it's a whole new world right
it's completely easy then from there of
course jobs on JavaScript framework
angular for angular is like still a
diamond
in our framework out there there's gonna
be a whole bunch of companies that they
gotta be looking for that like I don't
know where you live I know where I live
I live in New York in New York reactors
dominating right you could go to
Milwaukee or you could go to Cincinnati
angular might be running over there
right so it all depends where you live
it right it all depends where you live
and was dominating that area all right
so boy if you know at least one of the
two you're good no matter what no matter
where you live at you still good all
right
then from there you have laravel like a
pro now from here all we're talking
about the back end guys the back end for
sure
all right we're talking about the back
end remember that we're not talking
about the far away that what you see on
the page we're talking about behind the
scenes you know stuff like migration
stuff like database stuff like learning
how to you know work with template
engines like those things are very
important when you want to become a
quote unquote web developer because if
your front-end guy pretty much you go
from one to six that's it you could get
hired all right then the more years and
if they say hey we want a mid-level
different you know from six to to eleven
that's your mid-level developer right
now if you're just gonna be a web
developer meaning that you could do
everything
what developer a full stack is pretty
much the same thing pretty much you need
to know the backend so for you to get
those jobs I will say hey start with
laravel it's a great framework is made
with PHP which means it's pretty easy to
set up you don't have to go and do a
whole bunch of crazy stuff you can put
it out on online create a quick web
application put on Heroku now you're
good now you're golden you can show that
off to an employer and but I hate I've
worked with frameworks name in the
backend I know how to work with PHP I
know how to work with databases your you
know you gotta get higher right
is that simple there from day you have
no js' you know people will be like oh
maybe learn nodejs before because you
already know JavaScript but the for me
like I always say the problem was no js'
is just not everyone is using it and
like the companies are using it they
really want somebody that know their
expertise meaning this whole guideline
here at this whole time line in reality
is for the people like you and me who
came from nothing who are starting from
zero who are learning online so if you
go to an OGS interview they're gonna ask
you a lot of complicated stuff that
basically you're not gonna know
everything so you might not get the job
but if somebody has a couple of years of
experience you know then you get the job
right so personally I would say start
with something where where the you know
the starting level is very low where you
could just go in and get higher
something like PHP Narborough you could
get higher with PHP anywhere you
literally all you know how to do is a
variable and people get hired trust me I
know
they're from there for you guys that
really want to take it to the next level
like if you know all of the stuff or
you're comfortable you don't have to be
an expert at nothing nothing that's here
you don't have to be an expert but just
comfortable if you are comfortable
you're good but if you really want to
take it up to the next level and make
sure you set yourself up for success and
a lot of money in your pocket you
definitely gotta learn a go all right
now I really I don't know I haven't
really been out there meaning I haven't
really like paid that much attention to
the backend world and looking at the
numbers of like company switching to
like go lately but I just had a friend
of mine who went in for interview and
was telling me in the New York Times
they just switched their whole back-end
from Java to go in his
Arden salary is a hundred and eighty
four thousand dollars I don't know if
you guys understand that I don't know if
you guys understand like what I'm saying
Reena a hundred and eighty four thousand
dollars you know me I'm a calculator man
I'm a calculator man and I like bringing
out the calculator sometimes man cuz
sometimes people don't understand it you
know what I mean they don't understand
when you say a big number like that they
don't understand for you know how that
would change your life right so let's
say your hundred eighty-four thousand
divided by 52 because that's how HR does
it so you're looking at thirty five
hundred dollars a week right thirty five
hundred dollars a week guys that's
enough for you to be like hey I'm
chillin you know what I mean like your
wife don't gotta work you could just do
everything you got send your kids to
private school like you good if you're
smart you won't spend that much money
for a few you know two three years
stack up all your money you could even
open up your own business with that type
of money all right
if you smartly write so $184,000 guys
come on like you you can't go wrong
trust me man after taxes you probably
getting twenty eight hundred dollars a
week that's a lot of money man
that's a lot of money man I don't know
about you guys clean after taxes twenty
eight hundred
I don't know it makes sense and that's
what I'm going to you know like I've
been focusing a lot on gold crystal and
like I'm I'm going to the next level
myself meaning like my my careers is
going fast like it's going up super fast
so it's like man I know the next company
that I'm gonna be working with most
likely I'm gonna be doing go so like
like I said you guys gotta learn go so
that's like to the next level that's for
you guys that it's like you know what
man I really want that money R and I
really want this money I really wanna
take it to the next level
you gotta learn
all right now of course I'm gonna have
another section which is career which is
pretty much a course I called it I know
how to code
now what meaning hey I just learned all
this stuff how can I get a job how can I
start working that's why I created that
course pretty much talk about where to
find a job online how to build your
resume how to find the right recruiters
not talking about recruiters that is
gonna you know give you a shitty company
something about the good recruiters so
recruiters that showed you up to like
big companies that get you in there
because like I said a lot of times it's
not your talent it's more about who you
know and how to get in the right crowd
and how to maneuver yourself in this
industry alright so I'll go over all of
that guys now explaining the colors just
for the people that are taking all the
courses on my website pretty much red
means on-hold means I'm building it I
just don't know when it could be a week
from now it could be two weeks from now
now probably when you watch this video
you could be watching this video I don't
know two weeks from now three weeks from
now a year from now and probably all of
this course is there they're probably
gonna be completed right but this very
this video is important for the people
that is gonna come here cuz I'm still
gonna keep adding courses this is not
something that I'm gonna stop I'm gonna
continue adding courses and adding more
videos to my website constantly but I'm
always gonna follow this legit red it
means on hold like I'm doing it but give
me some time it should be there soon
purple means coming in the next few days
and I update this thing every single day
so it's like once I complete something
that's it I change it right orange means
is a long course is a very long course
meaning it could be 30 40 hours all
right so that means it's gonna take
was completed so that's why it's got the
orange right stuff like laravel like a
pro I already finished the whole section
I already finished showing you guys how
to build the app you know a quick app or
quick to do to do this a task manager
right we already finished that the next
the next one is gonna be an ecommerce
one that one's gonna take at least 15
hours to build all right so it's gonna
take some time and then from there I
want to do another project and then from
there we want to deploy it so this
course alone you're looking at you know
30 40 hours it's gonna it's gonna take a
long time to finish it
meaning it could be a month or two
before it's complete but it doesn't mean
that you can't follow along right now so
if you see something that's orange it
means you could come in start taking it
right and then from there once you see
the video there's no more videos come
back give it two days give it a day come
back to it you will see more videos
being added all right so that's what
orange means Green is just complete
that's it downloads complete is done
it's finito ZnO more videos added to it
it's just a complete course so the
completed ones like I said currently is
terminal
status terminal HTML CSS build a
responsive app of sass like a pearl
future-proof JavaScript those are the
ones that say that same it's done you
know yeah like the next couple of days
like today I'm finishing up this one es6
es7 right I'm finishing that one up then
from there I'm starting tomorrow react
Jes
I'm gonna finish a couple of more videos
that I want to do like simple examples
for for you guys to build with hyper app
laravel like a pro next week
I should be adding another section like
I said ecommerce if you guys remember
the baked store that we did here on
YouTube we're basically building the
back-end for it
so we're doing that here and then you
have you know stuff like angular for
nodejs
advanced back and with go jQuery like
I'm gonna do those just give me some
time because I want to make sure I knock
out this one's out first you know I
definitely want to finish hyper app yes
I want to finish react I want to finish
atom the the course then most likely
after this I want to finish though I
know how to code now what they're from
there I want to start doing the the
jQuery which is gotta be pretty quick
jQuery so easy guys
that in reality I don't even know if
people even need a course for it like
it's that simple it's like you go to the
documentation and you understand what
you gotta do it's that simple but I'm
gonna create a course for the hell of it
just because people like to see how I do
things and people like to see the
shortcuts right you don't want to go
into a documentation spend more time
looking through stuff than what you need
all right so yeah this is the complete
guide you know I want you guys to take
advantage come to my website coding
phase calm look at this here you don't
have to take my courses I are repeating
how with some people you don't have to
take more courses if you want to support
the kit if you want to support me then
you take my courses cuz trust me I'm
giving you the shortcuts a lot of
people's gonna give you the long way to
do things
no I'm I don't want nobody to waste
their time I'm coming in I want you to
hit the ground running so that's why my
courses are alright but of course if you
