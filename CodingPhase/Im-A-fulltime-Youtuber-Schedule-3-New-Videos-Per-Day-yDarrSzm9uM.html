shutting it down it's like you know
coming in like Hokage like breaking a
shirt you know throwing tables around

the turnbuckle guys listen your boys
backing out and did it again but this
sound would've vengeance we killing the
game listen we basically we start in the
schedule today man in an hour from now
the first video is gonna drop this to
new and improve coding phase calm do it
full-time on YouTube doing it full-time
on coding phase calm the website
releasing courses on udemy releasing
courses on Pluralsight releasing courses
on my own website guys we are about to
kill the game now the whole idea of this
is to basically give you guys the best
content that I can give you haven't
wanted to do this this has been my dream
to do this in a long time you know it's
like it's like I unplugged from the
matrix kids like your boy is free it's
officially I'm free
alright so now I'ma put for my part I
hope you guys get to support me and
understand what I'm trying to do here
for you guys and and what I want to do
for you guys I want you guys to you know
help me out help me out help you guys
out right
basically all I ask is just pretty much
watch me on YouTube that's the only
thing that I ask for you guys just watch
me and you to subscribe to me like my
video share it with a friend even if
it's something dumb that you like man
Josette's and dumb thing is like share
it with your friends it's fine if it's
something positive share with your
friends negative sharing with your
friend
whatever it is guys I'm doing this like
I said full-time now this is
my livelihood pretty much it's like you
know if I don't eat from this I don't
eat you know what I mean I'm I'm
starving right now kids no joking but um
there's a plan man I have a plan from
you know where I could go in super hard
for the next year and let's see how does
your ghost right we just went through
nine months of my first year as a
youtuber but now as somebody who's doing
this independently and started his own
company I'm gonna basically open up my
own office I'm gonna have a spot for you
guys other people that are here in close
to New York you guys are more than
welcome to come by my spot it's gonna be
pretty cool kind of try to do meetups
tear listen I'm going all out I'm going
all out I'm basically investing
everything into this because I know what
I can do I know what I can do for you
guys I know what I give back to the
people and I know you guys is gonna
support me man
so I definitely appreciate it of course
you know I still got clients
I still got people that the I tutor on
the side am i making or everything from
youtube you know probably not but the
the fact that I now have the freedom to
still come here and give you guys
constant every single day you know I
mean I got I look at traversing media
and that motivates me like I'm trying to
get to that point where I'm like okay I
cookery week you know create a really
good content for you guys every single
day but in my own way you know how I do
I come in I hit you with the sauce I
break down things in simple terms so you
can understand it I'm not here trying to
look like hey I'm the smartest guy in
the world no no no I'm here to give you
guys the best content and keep you guys
here and get you entertaining at the
same time motivate you guys to basically
learn web development right what
development programming we bout to do
some gaming tutorials there's so much
stuff that's coming there's so much
stuff that
coming and I just want to give you guys
everything right now what are we doing
right what is it that we're doing
we got the coding free schedule right
this this is the schedule that we bought
to keep and basically it's like this
every day at 10 o'clock in the morning
here in the US in the UK is at 3 in
India at 7 p.m. and Manila is 10 p.m.
I'm answering questions every single
morning there's gonna be one question
per video and I'm releasing that video
every day at 10 o'clock in the morning
then at 3 p.m. I have tutorials
alright at 3 p.m. I'm gonna release
another video which is gonna be a
tutorial today is a continuation to the
HTML CSS tutorial that I'm doing which
is about a dashboard alright once we
finish with that then we're gonna jump
on other other tutorials might be
angular for might be you know API is my
v user authentication there's so many
things that we can go in so right now of
course there is a big difference between
the courses that I have for my website
coding phase comp on coding phase comp I
have videos explaining what's going on
and what's happening the videos that I'm
doing here on YouTube are more of a you
watch me how I do this and then you at
the same time you build it yourself
right but I'm not going into every
single detail of what's happening it's
like right now if I go in and like let's
say I'm doing the HTML CSS I have a sass
course right if you don't know sass I
can't teach sass on that code on this
video because there's already a course
for it you know what I mean so pretty
much what I'm doing is is how cool is
like it's like let's play videos you
know where somebody comes there and
plays a game and you just follow along
is the same thing same idea that I'm
using for my tutorials it's like I'm
building something and you
follow along right those of you that
want to get more into whatever it is
that I'm teaching I'm having it on my
website : face comm which was a really
good question somebody asked me Joe
what's the difference between what's
happening on YouTube from your videos
and the difference between on your
website where we sign up so your
subscription listen when you sign up for
the description you get a whole bunch of
videos and in just me explaining things
and breaking things down right now when
it comes to here on YouTube you're
following along but in reality you need
to have some type of knowledge right if
you've never done HTML I will say hey go
take the HTML and CSS course so you can
learn what's happening and then come
back here and use this as an extra
project for you to practice right and
like I said guys there's no way that
there's any course out there that's
gonna teach you everything which is
another comment somebody left me hey I
took this course I took the the cold
steel course and I still can't can't do
everything by myself
and like you're not supposed to be able
to learn everything by yourself just
from watching a course you're gonna
learn by building projects and that's
what you have here on YouTube and on my
website it's like you have constant
projects that you keep on building one
of the biggest problem that people have
is that they don't know what to build
right so that's why you have my channel
you have my website to basically guide
you in this you know three to four or
five six months that you're you're
becoming a developer you have something
to do every single day right now it's up
to you if you want to learn you know
it's a big difference from people that
want to go hard like I look at 84 music
the dude does music he works he also
comes home and does all my tutorials and
all my courses he's grinding and I'm
seeing the projects that he's building
yo from where he was to where he is now
he's definitely improved so much in the
past few months that's a person that I
could say hey he went in and this is
really what he wants to do right so it's
up to you I can never do more than you
know hold
your hand but it's like if you don't
want to cross the street you don't cross
the street you know what I mean
it's like I could hold your hand to help
you cross the street but if you don't
want to I can't force you
alright now that's on 3 p.m. right we
have tutorials then our 8:00 p.m. at
night is just a random video it can be a
random topic
everything is always gonna be related to
the web everything's gonna be related to
programming but this is what's gonna
happen every single day and that's the
goal right there might be days where I
might just drop one video or two videos
right but that's gonna be on a rare
occasion like let's say if I gave you
videos from Monday to to Friday right
three videos every single day all right
I gave you three videos every single day
on Saturday you gotta also expect that I
might have to chill my family I might
have to go out I might have to go to a
meet-up cuz there's other things that's
gonna happen not only am i coming in
here recording videos for you guys I'm
trying to go to different boot camps I'm
trying to go to different meetups I'm
trying to go to the media meetup I'm
trying to go to the Ruby on Rails meetup
show you guys the community not only
just me coming here being in front of
this this laptop this computer screen I
want you guys to see the community I
wanna interview other developers guys
who have been in the industry for you
know 5 10 years now working for PayPal
not working for coca-cola I got friends
that work you know MTV still I have
friends that that working you know a
random house like there's so many people
that I know so I want to put those
people in front of you right and help
you guys out and at the same time just
keep you guys motivated all right that's
the whole goal of this and all I could
say to you guys this support me man
support this dream that I have support
this this idea that I've been having for
the past 5 years when I first started in
this thing
I was like man and I was on on those
team treehouse
forums because that's why I like Singh
tree house for the community I love
helping people out some of the people
for questions I'll go in there and help
them out I never like stack overflow can
stack overflow it's more like hey your
question your answer is good but I have
a better one so a bowl up brought me up
to get some points I got never like that
it is just it's not a great community
but the teen tree house community even
though I didn't like the website and the
things that they were teaching me the
people who were there were people who
wanted to learn and I love that and I
say you know what I wanna at one point I
want to start teaching all the things
that I already know and share my
experience with others and be able to
help people out cuz that's the whole
goal guys I'm just here to help you guys
out and you know when you come to my
website coding phase comment and you
come here and you support me like you do
this you know like basically you helping
me out when you you are helping me out
you you are supporting me supporting my
my my deals and things that I basically
I believe in you know and just try to
help you guys out man you come here you
click on the description my description
has a couple of links like you know my
udemy courses udemy courses that taught
me stuff I also have on my website you
could get the all access pass on the
description below you could get it for
$5 is literally 20 bucks there's a lot
of people that come here from Google
people that find me from the Woodworks
and they have no issue paying to $20
because they're getting a lot of content
guys they're getting a lot of content
for 20 bucks so pretty much you could

that's it you can keep moving now if you
want to support your boy and you know
what I'm doing and what I'm doing for
you guys then you just keep it for a
month or two you know it's up to you
whatever you want to do but at the same
time guys listen this is what I'm doing
full-time giving yourself you guys like
everything like I'm giving you
everything like that I got
and I'm just going hard being because
this this is a dream that I've been
having to do and I say you say I say you
know what man
Joe you just gotta go all out you know
you if you're not happy doing something
out there like you know I wasn't happy
working with another company I'm like
man this is not what I what drives me
you know what I mean like I love to code
right I love to code but at the same
time there's a something more beautiful
to me that is teaching others knowing
that other people is like me passing
down what I learned all the years that
took me to learn all the stuff passing
it down to other people and they
continue with you know continuing with
that knowledge and pass it down to other
peoples and then they just be like oh
where you learned that oh I learned it
from this Geico coding face okay Joe aka
Joe Santos Garcia you know what I mean
so yeah man it's like I said I'm here
for you guys man and yeah that's the
schedule man you know we have what is it
10 a.m. 3 p.m. 8 p.m. Eastern time 3
videos per day man we're going really
hard right now we're gonna come out with
some really crazy content I want to give
you guys everything that I have create
the best content that I can give you
guys and we're gonna take this channel
to a hundred thousand plus two hundred
thousand plus we're gonna take it up
there we're definitely gonna take it up
there in the next six months you're
gonna see how this whole thing is gonna
change like people know me how I am you
guys know me man you guys know when I
assess something in my head and I'm like
yeah I'm gonna do this it's because I'm
gonna do this man like and you're gonna
see all you guys that are here and
you're here for a reason you're here to
learn you're here to elevate your mind
and also put money in your pocket like
no matter what like no matter how much
you know how much you study out here the
end goal is for you to be able to be
financially free meaning I hate you have
money in your pocket you create stuff
you go sell your own products create a
software as
you could come in and and create your
own business out of this like there's so
much possibilities you create an
application that just viral and the next
thing you know is now you're making a
million two million dollars per year or
more sky's the limit
the idea is that this is where you start
now this is not where you your story
ends I wanna know what's gonna happen to
you guys in the next five years from now
you know I mean I'm gonna know where you
guys get to go right cuz when I started
this thing I started by myself man I
started teaching myself I went to every
single website out there I was like man
this sucks this you know those days that
I was like I wanted to quit I don't want
to do it I just want to play ps4 hang
out I would hang out with my friends go
listen to some music but then I'm like
man I gotta do this I gotta do something
for myself you know what I mean so I
know you guys are in the same situation
and I'm just here to help you guys out
man and like I said help me help you
guys out man like I'm going so super
hard right now you don't even know like
I woke up super early today created man
videos for you guys I got a whole bunch
of courses coming out for my website so
it's like you literally getting like the
best deal out there and I'm not here to
become a millionaire like I said from
the beginning I'm not here to become a
million I'm here to basically just be a
regular comfortable help people I'll be
able to give our stuff for free be able
to say hey man I have this kid from
India who emails me and tells me he's
like yo man I have to go to a you know I
have to go into a computer is a computer
cafe pay you know like five dollars for
a day or something like two dollars for
the day for me to be able to use the
computer and basically learn all this
stuff and he's like telling me he's like
yo I just I just basically had to go
sell something to to get the money to
sign up for your courses I said bro
don't even do that that's not gonna even
do that and there's the same thing if if
you're coming from a third world country
guys listen
I'm here to teach right
if you can't pay for it you can pay for
it guys you know $5.00 is like literally
it's like McDonald's money less than
McDonald's right now but if you live in
a third world country you live in
Nigeria you live in you know El Salvador
you live in one of these countries where
pretty much you know damn well is gonna
cost you a lot of money to get five
dollars or it's gonna take you a la me
an email just send me an email cunning
face at gmail.com I got you man I know
nobody here is gonna get mad if I give
out some free memberships to people that
really really really need it like guys
like the whole idea of this I look at it
in a way where it's like you know we all
helping each other out right we all want
to be developers right if I work right
now and I don't know I'm a designer
right I work in a company I'm basically
paying for the $5 right I'm not gonna be
mad that Joe Golson helps out some kid
in Nigeria and gives him a free
membership that he can't pay and I'm not
gonna be mad and be like oh man I paid
$5.00 why he can't pay for guys it's
fine
you know what I mean like we're all
helping each other out it's like the way
how I look at this is like when somebody
comes in and pays for the subscription
it also gives the opportunity for two
three other people who are not able to
pay at all to be able to get the
opportunity there's people who are
coming from countries where you know
what sometimes they're not gonna be able
to go to college sometimes they're not
gonna be able to get those opportunities
you know and web development is their
way to get out is their way to get get
known in in this world and become
something of themselves you know what I
mean so it's like if we are a little bit
more fortunate than others when we give
in to this we help out those people too
so that's the whole idea that's what
I've been doing it when I when I first
started this go look at my first videos
one of the first things I said I want to
start helping out people that just can't
get that help you know what I mean like
I just want to help them out like
there's a kid that who's 14 years always
like I don't even have a credit card Joe
um I want to do this nobody believes in
me
