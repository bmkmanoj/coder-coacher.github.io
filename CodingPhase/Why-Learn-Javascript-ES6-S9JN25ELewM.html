again man coding fees.com your boy is
backing out and did it again guys
listen today we're gonna talk about why
you should learn es6 in all the future
versions of javascript very simple we
got started up with this it's the latest
version of javascript one thing that you
guys got to know the creator of
javascript created it in a week pretty
much look it up he created it in a week
so basically when he created it he
didn't think that it was gonna be a
language that was gonna be used for the
next 20 30 40 50 years right he never
thought that it was gonna be this this
big right so when he built the did he
build it with a lot of flaws and certain
things that he wasn't accounting for you
know as far as the future rate how
things will work so thank God that you
know the people from ACMA they got
together you know now technically they
trying to do it every year where they
come in and create not a exactly new
version even though everybody says hey
it's a new version of JavaScript is it
more about adding extra features to
javascript because javascript is still
javascript while all they're doing is
just adding a couple of extra features
to it especially you're using compilers
and transpilers like be with GS and you
know using webpack and you know the
whole the whole nine gulp you could use
any of those right to help you write the
new JavaScript but the best part about
it is like I said it's delay and the
latest version of it it's like it has
the new features so you always come in
in whatever was from last year they fix
it and they add little things to make
your life easier as a developer right
now like I just said it saves you time
there's so many things that you look
back well you know those days of jQuery
where you know you you wanted to come
cat like let's say your string right you
had to go away and like I say hey my
name is the variable and then you fill
in the what
the variable you will say like Oh my
name is Joe but you're putting a
variable whatever the user is so you
will have to do is string my name is
space and then close the string then put
a plus and then put in the variable to
concatenate the whole string but what
happens if you had something like a a
full a full paragraph and you have
certain six sections that you need to
come in and and do this right and put in
different variables so you will have to
go in open up the string right close it
up put a plus put in the variable open
up the string again basically is so
repetitive and so much work that in
reality just is really not worth it
right and that's like the whole way of
coding now thanks to es6 you just come
in and template strings guys makes your
life easier let's say you want to filter
something from the list in array right
now you have to filter method let's say
you wanted to say show me every every
user that is older than 21 now you have
to every method right now you could say
hey show me some you know some of the
user
the half dollar over 21 it shows you
like there's so many different different
methods man and so many cool stuff you
know the arrabal function which helps
you out to keep this that this keyword
inside of it like there's so many things
guys like it just saves you time and
like as a developer you need to learn
es6 it's a must especially now is like
come on guys it's like it's 2017 we go
into 2018 if you don't know es6 man that
should be like you know it's like you
learn how to how to write right think
about it like this you learn how to
write your ABCs well when you start
writing down sentences somebody got to
teach you how to put commas how to put
parentheses how to put or you know
semicolons how to put a dot at the end
how to know format a function or not
function a sentence format a paragraph
ese like that's to how es6 is it's like
you learn the basics of JavaScript but
now it's time to take it to the next
level right you have to learn es6 you
can't walk away from me you know
a lot of people I see that all the time
like peoples like I'll leave it for
later it's like I'm gonna continue
practicing more JavaScript ways like
guys what if you learn JavaScript right
and then but if I tell you hey man
you've been spending a lot of time on on
vanilla JavaScript right but at the same
time you could have done all the things
that you was doing there that took you
hours to do now you can just doing you
know in 20 minutes with es6 you know
what I mean it saves you time when you
work with employers what they really
care about can you do something as quick
as possible alright so it does save you
a lot of time guys all right the next
thing is all the new frameworks are
using it every single framework out
there at some point you know you're
gonna see examples are in es6 es6
classes and people be like man but i
don't know how to work with this I don't
understand this it's like if you would
have taken the time to learn es6 you
will understand why people are using the
new for basically all the new frameworks
are using es6 right you know a lot of
people is like they talk about view that
I offer view you could do it with just
vanilla JavaScript yeah but if you want
to work on complicated and complex web
apps at some point even view X you have
to jump into es6 just to really create
something amazing right so react
definitely uses es6 angular uses
typescript which pretty much if you know
es6 you pretty much know typescript the
only difference is just typescript has
like types you know all right now
definitely will give you an edge when
looking for a new job guys
it will definitely give you an edge
think about it like this this feels very
competitive right so you and another
developer go to the same job into right
you both
HTML you both know CSS you both know
sass you both know JavaScript but now he
knows es6 and you don't write in the
company that is bout to hire you right
they basically they use es6 for react or
let's say they use es6 for any other
framework let's say amber or whatever
they use right now because you don't
know that that person is gonna get hired
all right now you gotta say how long
does it take you to learn your six I'm
being honest the most is gonna take is
like an hour all right so it's just kind
of it's gonna you know in our two hours
probably you know three hours at most
of like practicing and you're gonna
basically you know hit the ground
running and automatically you're gonna
be able to get those positions cuz you
gotta think about it like this man a
company looks at him like man so many
people are applying to these jobs we
don't know which one's the best right we
don't know which one is that we're gonna
hire which was gonna come in and be able
to hit the ground running so the way how
they compare things is like okay can he
do this yes can he do this
no all the right so let's just give it
to him even though you might have more
experience than the other person would
have better projects in the other person
at the same time as like they like
thinking in the head man we don't wanna
train this guy have this guy here for
you know three four hours on the job
trying to learn es6 they want somebody
that's gonna hit the ground running you
know what I mean so that's what I'm
saying guys the reason you guys it's not
gonna hurt you to learn es6 it's not
gonna hurt you it's gonna do nothing but
good things for you it's gonna help you
get that job is going to also you know
just give you that little edge you know
a lot of people think about it like this
same way how you might be fighting and
you're like oh man I don't want to
spring another two three hours learning
something else you know how many
thousands of developers are like that so
there's so many people are lazy they
just
learn new technologies right they want
to stay with the old things right so
when you have more Skills than those
people automatically you get those jobs
guys so I would really tell you guys man
just go hard man take your time learn
es6
it's a must now in 2017 2018 like it's
definitely a must if you're gonna be
doing web development those are the
things and that you need to be learning
like it or not all right I'll see you
guys later make sure you subscribe make
sure you like this video love you guys
stay up you guys may no man listen I
quit my job because of you guys I want
to give you guys all my time oh all my
attention to you guys here and YouTube
help people out get jobs help people you
know get their money together get the
skills up that they need just to get
that job and once you hit that job
