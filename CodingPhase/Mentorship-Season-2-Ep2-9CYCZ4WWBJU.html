episode 2 of the mentorship program okay
guys we have your boy here first one to
get cut you know what I mean I'm sorry
Sam
I wish you the best I hope that you was
okay this week I don't know what
happened to you
but you know that's why I tell people
man a lot of people's gonna come in so
I'm gonna make it something I'm not
gonna make it so I'm gonna get cut by
the peoples it's up to you guys to
decide who's gonna stay who's not in the
state you know what I mean but yeah man
sometimes it's out of my hands I can
help out as much as I can try to bring
as many people into this but you know
stuff happens in their lives and you
know and that's how it is man either
something happened to one more pretty
much you know the passion was in there
you know it could be either one I don't
know I just given you guys to the
details and then you guys know exactly
who got cut this week all right
so you know once again your boys backing
out and did it again so let's get
started oh shit boy job back at it again
man cutting face calm your boys backing
out and did it again yes we got the
people back
we got the mentorship season 2 is back
we done did it again kids yo we got your
boy Aaron we got cam we got Sam we got
your boy Robinson we got a squad man you
know one more person was supposed to be
here you know is that person who already
got cut you know what I mean so this is
how we doing it we switching it up this
year and this season right we come
we gave everybody a project right we're
giving everybody a project a matter of
fact there's gonna be three projects
that they could choose from every single
week they choose one and say hey there's
the one that I can do right this one
that's gonna be easy
this one that's gonna be intermediate
and this one that's gonna be hard right
people get to choose which one they want
to tackle it's undone they don't have to
finish the whole project but they need
to finish at least a minimum of three of
the sections three of them right
everything doesn't have to be perfect
but what needs to be there is just you
know the heart come in in the
determination being able to show up you
know so that's pretty much it and there
was the little twist of this right is
every week somebody's getting cut all
right
so every single week somebody's getting
cut luckily for this guys somebody
already got cut so that means they good
you know what I mean they they good for
next week you know all right guys so now
we got your boy Aaron how you stay out
of the island you know
shouting man Stan Island you did waiting
here kid what up son so you know week
one for the messenger program it was
pretty cool I mom I learned a lot by by
putting all the skills that I learned
from tutorials and my courses online and
I I put it into practice like you know
making making the page from scratching
and you know it was it was a it was a
learning process so it was cool I just
started the project I started doing the
header and
the two headers and then I started to
build everything together I put the
content section info section you know
then it was like a kind of like a
recommended c-section and everything
started to you know to piece together
and all the problems I had them were
like positioning elements then and you
know the different divs inside of divs
because I've never really done anything
like that but anytime I I got a problem
I had like I ran into a problem I would
google it which you know Google was a
great source and and then I was able to
you know to to come up with this so it
was cool I'm glad that you know you got
through it you wasn't actually the first
one to actually hit me up oh you know
man
I'm ready let's just go for it you know
what I mean so I definitely appreciate
that and it just showed me that you
really went in and started working right
soon as I've had the chance it wasn't
like you left it for last minute which I
really appreciate it I hope everybody
that is healthy takes that into account
it was like I said we all basically got
our vote all at the end of the date he
was gonna come in well you know who's
getting cut for the week it's not like
who's the loser who's the winner it's
more of a thing to really get people
excited to work hard so I definitely
would tell everybody go keep that in
mind
draw arrows basically the first one to
hit me up I kill I'm Brady I got it done
so he definitely got some clothes for
that there's how the project okay okay
cool
taking on a second look I haven't seen
this since last week so I don't even
know how it looks so let me see okay all
right
so this is a project that Aaron built
it's pretty cool man looks pretty
similar to to what we have here we're
gonna start with the header okay looking
at the head of this header is actually a
full screen it has a container right so
it does have that container which you
put into but the only thing that that's
different is see the shadows could have
been a little bit more crispier on your
design so this it's pretty much is more
about actually like lowering down the
opacity on the shadows as far as like
the text here
this text is definitely this is
definitely too big you gotta make it
smaller see how we have this way small
is like you're looking at 10 pixels of
fonts all right this is probably like 16
all right and you might think oh it's
just text but all those little things is
what makes the design look nice and
crispy so the law are like minor details
that you know if you were in in a real
job environment like what they would do
is if they would have somebody over qe
go over the whole project that you have
and then you know come back to you with
details like oh make this smaller make
this the right color rate test you know
whatever the details that you missed
they will come back and tell you to fix
those so it's not a big deal like that's
what happens every single day at a job
especially as a developer now let's see
here okay I will say the buttons of e on
the top there the the border on it it's
supposed to be like one pixel you have
some pixels which makes it a little bit
too big like I said here the colors
definitely missing the colors or the
text just I think you have everything
all you're really missing is it's more
of like the execution right the
execution of things because I feel like
you have the idea you know what to do
now is it's about going in there and
making it crispy right you know you
wanna have it perfect as much perfect as
you can and pretty much clean up clean
up the details of it right you know
clean up the details on it like I'm
looking at the page like it's very
similar to the image very similar to the
page but I can tell which one's the
image in which one is the design which
was the website right so you want it to
be that somebody will look at this and
be like wait which one is the image in
which mr. the design or the website that
he built that's what you want people to
say you know only thing like joe said
was that that you know a little
attention to detail which is the kind of
important you know that's the sizing
like the font size the you know padding
and the margin for the headers and you
know really just tweaking that would've
made my project you know
stand out more so I'm the next project
I'm gonna probably just well not
probably I'm gonna actually tweak that
and you know try to pay the attention to
the attention to detail and make it make
it look really good make it look really
presentable I added the charts I guess
so you know I kind of understand it but
um I'm gonna I'm gonna you know get a
hold on my JavaScript and you know you
know the project was I think it was
successful because I was able to put
something together and make it look
relatively similar to the actual like
the PSD for the image and yes I'm gonna
poop on this and I feel good about my
project and that's about it okay like I
said listen like this whole thing it's
pretty much about grinding it just going
hard eating this project we just call it
all the way to a drink
you know this things that I see and you
like that I see the hunger you like all
I wanna do this like I could tell like
you still on on a beginner stage of HTML
CSS but all of those things are coming
into more projects that you've built you
know there might be people who we don't
know you're actually the first person to
come in and show you projects we
actually don't know what anybody else
got right like pretty much people might
just come in with two sections right you
might be the only one they just finished
the whole project you know some people
might come in and it you have some
things where their positions are all
some people are you know they're their
fonts are different things they're not
the same fonts that they were supposed
to use little things like that is going
to happen right but what's important is
the fact is that your
projects and building projects when
you're going away from the fact like how
we look something behind the scenes
where basically you've been following
different beauty courses and creating
projects but the ones that the person is
teaching now it's where you come in you
start putting everything together you
know okay let me start building this out
of okay now I definitely got to give you
a lot of props because there's something
that people mostly don't do like people
come in and and don't use CSS by
something use something like SAS or they
do some framework I wonder how many
people will use a framework out of
everybody that's in this the season two
because you actually went in everything
that we're looking at at the page going
back to to the page itself everything
that you do here that's all CSS you got
like 95% of everything done exactly how
it looks and everything is layer that's
the right places and all of this is not
a framework what do this is hang me you
went in there so it means that you've
really comfortable where CSS and music
you already know your HTML as far as
HTML you already know that your CSS
you're comfortable now about learning a
couple of extra CSS tricks
that's it yeah we ain't here with your
boy cam cam what up and I must not much
it's ready for this session where the
man you boys back in heat and did it
again yeah yo care was the housing week
man oh it was tough it was tough
I've had a long work week you know like
like you were talking about I had to do
some extra hours I actually just got off
work today because one of our cashiers
quit so god bless her yeah I mean
dropping like flies people go in as I
yell one week no notice is like you know
I'm here for one week I ain't giving no
notice ain't showing up you know forget
that check yeah
people crazy but yeah man so we're gonna
start it off by actually going into the
project itself so I'm gonna share my
screen okay
so this is the original project right so
this how things supposed to look here's
the header here is the top section which
is like a slider alright here we have
the logos here is a section for the air
jordans
okay then we have two images here in
there from there we have two other
sections
okay so a lot of sections actually yeah
it's a lot of damn sections you know but
this is super dope right like camp day
all of the stuff straight HTML CSS like
there's no images in here like all this
stuff is all HTML CSS you can actually
select it like that's how you supposed
to do things the header looks nice and
clean let me see oh we got the sir just
got the bag at the apparel everything is
good everything is definitely good um
definitely I could see you try to put in
the bag in the number you know you could
just literally just made a circle there
and it would have been fine you get what
I'm saying it's alright that's fine
you can fix that in no time I like the
the slider section here this is pretty
legit like let me see you actually did
this thing my you know I was like
thinking in my head like most people
they're not gonna be able to do this
thing right camera and all out like you
really to be honest with you I feel like
for everything that you have here like
you just won this like you did a lot of
difficult part you know you got a lot of
stuff done okay you know definitely one
thing I will say is trying to Center
this alright you can put in another div
around these and then have that div to
be centered of
whatever this area is here for for our
element so like that you could actually
control it and give it that paddock of
like that all right you know so you
could just knock that out then we got
here
limited release air Jordan you know so
this is looking good I will say maybe
what's actually looking we do here maybe
just make it a little bit smaller and
put in like a container mm-hmm like a
low I will add it for a so you you don't
have a section here maybe you did it
like what 50 percent yeah 50 percent I
think yeah so this is actually smaller
than 50 percent so maybe put this at 40
and then the other one at 50 so this I
don't know why it moved up but if you
say with a 60% it should be fine and it
actually looks a little bit better and
even inside of this like let's say yeah
at 60 40 60 it will be fine right so it
definitely looks good let me see the
button the button the font on it should
be a little bit bigger
let me see ya think it looks good
definitely looks good so that looks good
for sure then you got this other section
here oh yeah this took some time too
yeah I can imagine maybe you let me see
unser are fine a little lying height all
right the line height gotta be bigger on
the fonts you see how that space between
them right that's the line height so if
you go in there and really point five
right now more closer to that so the
line height is what was missing for me I
think this is fine you know what I will
say is just the padding there's
definitely a bigger pattern here so yeah
I feel like you you spend more time to
perfecting every section more than
everybody else like I feel like
everybody was trying to rush to get
order the whole piece done and it's like
you gotta finish the section that you're
working on to be able to move on to the
next one
like even on this one right like this is
exactly what I said on office today on
this to you or I said it to somebody
else
whereas I hey if I'm on the header if
the header is 90% done that's okay I'll
come back to it later all right and you
can move on to the next one right but if
the header was done 40 percent in and
you're like okay it's 40 percent in I'm
gonna jump to the next thing he's like
no it's like finish this then jump to
this and then jump to this and then jump
to this until you're done with the last
section or to have you at least in a
percent away it doesn't have to be
perfect but somewhere like presentable
unless you have it to that level you
can't jump to the next next line okay so
yeah going back to you cam I think so
far from this week you know you you have
definitely surprised me a good job kid
I'm proud of you yeah I was I was
worried because I was like I've spent so
much time doing all these little things
and I'm like man someone's gonna
for a bloom in the water because I'm
spending a lot of time on I'm still yeah
yeah no but that's the idea of it like
you know a website like this you know
people think like it's gonna get done in
one two days like it doesn't work like
that
in real life what happens is you're
gonna go in there they're gonna give you
a design in there from day you're gonna
have you know three days to go in and
put in the prototype what you have so
far is what you would do three days and
three four days in of the prototype
right then from there somebody will come
in QA and bid okay
you gotta fix this you gotta fix that
then from there you go and fix it right
then from there that's not even done
because then now you gotta do the
sliders now you gotta go in there and
make the JavaScript for the freaking
slider and you want it to slide exactly
how you want it all right so you know
what I mean like it's gonna take your
time you know so don't worry about it
you actually did out of everybody that
I've seen so far you actually did the
best work because every section was
presentable it's like you went in there
and said okay I'm not gonna jump to the
next part until at least this section is
presentable I can show it to somebody
what looks 90% close to what the design
is you know I mean so I'm very surprised
cam you know I'm happy for you I feel
like I I've seen you fool
you know flourished on the channel you
know next thing we know cam is working
at XYZ company and now now he bougie you
know what I mean now you know it's like
no more old Casey he's at Austin know
he's like San Francisco somewhere now
you start seeing care with a suit on and
you know it's like oh gee cam is gone
you know what I mean so yeah I better
enjoy your boy cam for it for now
because you know how people be once they
get big they they gone you don't see him
no more so right now we get cam more the
time people be like man we see camera
time the chatroom he's good he's family
I lost camp guess that little pocket
change is like a I'll still be there
I'll still be there to be honest with
you
really think that you're doing one of
the best works out here can tell who's
that
who's here suitcase make a coffee
Achille Justin Bieber - yo so Casey what
up man what brings you to these parts of
the woods man I don't know I'm just
trying to you know I think it's cool to
feel to having a mentor like you see
have 5 years experience I don't have
anyone around me that into web
development so nice nice nice
so will you film Casey Klickitat
Washington really really small towns
like 500 people in it
I'm originally from Montana I'm like
we're all the Higgs lebesgue okay so
there's the project there's the original
project that we have here okay so we got
a header you got a top slider we got a
couple of levels here we got you know
this Jordan here we got this couple of
hats a couple of sneakers and but in
this is a little bit more complicated
because there's more you know working
with positioning definitely you have
here like a gallery section another I
guess gallery section and I want to have
multiples gallery section right yeah so
pretty much this how the project looks
now let's come back to this this is
Casey's project Casey do you have a
responsive all right I see you started
on this from which it was telling me you
actually build this with react so yeah I
was trying cuz I'm trying to you know
I'm good with jQuery JavaScript but I
want to challenge myself you know
anything like what's the point of doing
jQuery if I already know it you seen up
saying hey so I got a challenge myself
nice nice nice yeah might not this is
looking good you know I see you know you
got the slider there's pretty legit
she's ever just a complete circle but ya
know that's fine I mean I just didn't
finish it that's alright yeah no that's
definitely fine man
you know Oh only thing that I'm gonna
say off the bat I wish you would have
just you
try to finish one session you know one
something at a time yeah well I was
gonna this like the bread and butter so
I wanted to finish it like basic it only
had this two sections at the bottom but
yeah the border at the bottom this looks
fine
you could definitely let me see maybe
the the font try to play around with the
font see I like the fact that that you
did the the number here came out fine
came out good I will say try to find the
colors for each font right like as you
can see here this search is a little bit
great and the idea behind it is that
once you hover on top of it then it
becomes the same color as everything
else here so or probably they have like
a thing that is like a button you click
on that and then the search input field
shows up after okay alright so that's
probably the idea that the designer has
behind it yeah now as far as this here I
don't know if it was a because what do
you do this on on a 13-inch computer or
you have a computer like I'll be like
I'll be doing stuff on this on this
computer and I show someone else and
it's like super tiny compared to
everybody else yeah so what I will do is
change this and putting edited right so
you could say hey I want to put in a
custom you see you got our laps
h/h I dpi I don't know what the hell is
that
well what and then I just keep a regular
thing you come here and say hey big
monitor right so you could get an idea
even on your computer which is small you
could come here and say hey 1920 by 1080
might think 80 right and then you add
that and then now you come here and you
say okay big monitor show me a big
monitor so now you have an idea how it
looks on a big monarch
yeah that doesn't look that great yes so
I mean he even had that you know there's
other ways that you could come here and
I play around with it and just like you
know so you could actually you see like
like this is more of a realistic look of
how your page looks on a 1080p monitor
all right like that's exactly how it
looks on my laptop so kind of draws your
eye on instead I get actual product like
said up here looking up at the band you
want the person to look at the Jordans
not exactly exactly so it's like you
look at these logos you just make them
you know if you would have went in there
and made each one to be like much
smaller than what it what it is
currently right now yeah I see what you
did so I'm not the smartest sir
I mean what you should have done maybe
put in like at 10% and then add you know
another 10 different no different logos
you see so it actually looks better like
that it's just missing logos like if you
added more locals then it would continue
you know background redeye look why you
got an orange background all right yeah
copy and paste job for the project
yeah so let me see take all the stuff
box shadow time constraint unit thing
but that's how the robot this Indian so
this section right here what I would do
I mean you didn't have to go in and put
in the lines the separate separators but
what I would have done is instead of
using a certain width like how you think
I think you put in by let me see you use
allies okay you ELLs an advisory and
then what's the wave of this 212 so it's
supposed to be perfect squares so if you
want a perfect squares you will do hi
212
right and there yeah it could be perfect
squares how the image is and then inside
of it you will say on the images
themselves you come in and we say with
let's say 65% right and then what you
would do is you will go in there and use
like flex boxes to center it inside of
that box I was it was like two pictures
like one index was on top of the other
Indian any composition and then they can
move like this as it gets smaller like
overlap each other I mean I could have
done that but I just kind of want to
challenge myself a little more I thought
doing that carousel would be a little
bit more challenge to me
so that's why I skipped it but I
probably it probably make more sense to
do it harder yeah yeah no I mean I
definitely understand what she was
trying to do you basically you're like
okay I saw more I got already HTML CSS
down so I want to really focus on the
JavaScript so I want to challenge myself
and do something that's gonna challenge
myself um
so I definitely understand that what I
would say is you just gotta you know
finish work one section at a time right
even if you would've came in and said
okay I'm not gonna do anything below
like let's say the first three sections
alright
mmm I told everybody does the same thing
that so everybody just focus on the
first three sections right if you zoom
in and you say okay I got this header
perfect okay that's the easiest part of
the whole website alright then from
there this is the hardest part okay so
then okay there's the hardest part so
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna finish
this then I'm gonna finish this area
which is the logos and then after
finishing the logos I'm gonna come back
here and all my my time that I'm gonna
come in is I'm gonna spend it on this
cuz I know this is gonna take me a long
time right okay
you want to do the thing start easy to
get it done as soon as possible because
even if a client comes to you right and
the client tells you hey
man you know it's like there's two weeks
for you to finish this project right but
then you say okay this is gonna be super
hard hey it's gonna be super hard for me
to finish it so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna spend all my time on this so let's
say two weeks go by and then you still
haven't finished the website and you
come back to the client and you should
apply every website is bad and then this
area is not some complete still pad you
know what I mean it's not it wasn't
complete then what happens is the person
is gonna be like yo what the hell like
this has been doing for two weeks some
day and they gonna be pissed off but if
you're smart you doing a smart way
you're gonna finish the easier parts to
get that part done right you gotta
finish the header finish the the logo
right finishes as you can that is gonna
be easy and then come back to the parts
are gonna be hard
so like that when the client comes in
you be like hey I got the whole website
I need more time like as you can see I
finished everything for you but this
part takes more time so I need more time
so now the client or even your boss is
gonna be okay he's right this thing can
be done in two weeks this thing's gonna
be done in three minutes
go back week or whatever see exactly all
right guys you already know simple job
back at it again today we got Robinson
out here man so pretty boys Robinson how
was the weak man how was it um I wasn't
holiday but try to put in the shift do
as much as I could try as hard as I can
seems like said I'm still gaining that
experience to learning how to do it and
to learn how to think so yeah it was
cool it was fun it's funny
nice nice nice so we're gonna look at
the the project okay so this was the
project day he was supposed to build
we're gonna just go over it a little bit
for the people that haven't seen this
this project this is how the image that
I gave them looks
let's see I see okay I haven't looked at
this since last week to be honest with
you
so that's fine okay
all right and came through with and
basically like I said you could go in
there and change the images change it
around you know make it a little bit
different doesn't have to be exactly how
it was so this is the project that he
came back with you know it's pretty cool
it's definitely cool
he had like an Xbox team so that's hot
now you know we're gonna start from the
top right we're gonna start from the
header so you know each a section okay
so come back oh let's see header on that
header and this a secrecy on this header
right like this section here the the
fonts are are always smaller and then
you have the icons on top
alright you have the logo here let's see
what you got you got something here is
similar I mean the logo doesn't matter
because it's really for Xbox so it makes
sense this menu here you definitely need
it to make it smaller you know as you
can see this is actually a background
that's white and this background is gray
this one is I got 41 pixels and it's
super thin this one is taking this I got
72 pixels see when I try to copy you
know the men's and when you use because
actually I'm Mac you can just kind of
when you looking at photos you can hover
over and look at the pictures exactly
when I copy those pixels was complete
here yeah because the problem you know
you can't say like let's say for example
I could come here and say hey this is
this is 34 pixels for example right
right but that's for this font right
it's 34 pixels of this
if you're using a different type of font
it's not gonna be 34 pixels but it might
be actually smaller so you're gonna have
to make the font a little bit bigger
maybe 48 pixels or you know the opposite
way where you could say hey this frantic
actually runs bigger so you have to make
it smaller
instead of 34 pixels you've gotta have
to make it twenty six pixels right it
all depends on the font right but what
you're seeing here even though the the
pixel here tells it it's 34 pixels the
the final result on your page needs to
be similar to that you know what I mean
like I could come here and look at this
and be like okay what's the font size
you see this font size is 100 pixels so
let's say 34 pixels is like that that's
actually smaller so like I said this
this font itself runs small so you will
say 48 pixels come back to this now
that's more similar to it that's a more
higher thing you want to make this stuff
with real like you know HTML CSS because
this image is probably huge you get what
I'm saying like you want to have on a
website that's gonna allow super quick
it's super easy like right now we're
we're using this on local environment
where it's automatic soon as you click
to load the page the page is there cuz
all the files are there but on the
Internet is different if somebody's on
3G or 4G like this page might take
forever to load all right so let's see
for this part right here what I will say
is as you can see this is kind of like
the background images were hard at front
associated my own thing so it's harder
to find background images that flow with
the content and make it look a lot more
natural if that makes sense well I mean
that's one thing to maybe something that
you could look into
is the fact that you know just because
just because you have content about
Microsoft right or like Xbox right
it doesn't mean every image on it had to
be about the game itself right they
could have been just filler images like
images like this like this website is
about sneakers there's really nothing
about sneakers about it it's just more
like you got jeans and you know it's
like a certain feel to it right you
could come in and put any type of image
there it didn't have to be exactly oh
let me put in a whole bunch of games in
here I gotta work on that
on this what I would say is you know
these are perfect squares and what you
have here are like rectangles so what I
will do is I will say make them into
squares and then you know just make them
into square and just make everything
like this you didn't even have to do
like this design that had like that all
you need to do is just make sure that it
was a perfect square I think it's good I
think you the problem is like when you
have too much time you literally have
too much time you don't put as much
effort in but then when you have a
deadline you you're less reluctant it
just I'll just go like record it now
then you you want to learn more and you
want to love the things that you need to
learn to do certain parts of you know
the section of the pages so you like I
need to go back and work on my CSS but
then I know our next time our CSS CSS
CSS CSS which is what I learned from
this basically there is no rush for you
to jump to JavaScript until you feel
comfortable when you can create the
exact design that's there in a webpage
because before you could even build
anything or create any web apps or
anything you have to build a page
if the page doesn't look up to par then
you can't move on to the next step
alright yeah don't try to skip steps
just stay there trust me you be like
okay it might take you a little long but
once you get that done it's like once
you learn how to ride a bike that's it
you know what I mean now you could go
skateboard now you could go rollerblade
do whatever you want to do but you gotta
first learn that bike you know what I
mean so yeah man so I hope you really
