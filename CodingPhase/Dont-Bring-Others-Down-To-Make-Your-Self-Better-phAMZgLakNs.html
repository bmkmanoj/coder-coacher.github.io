man coding face stop come alright guys I
just wanted to give a little quick
advice to everybody here every developer
here that watches me you know doesn't
matter if it's a viewer doesn't matter
if it's a youtuber doesn't matter if
it's anything you know anybody that gets
to watch this video quick advice you
know don't don't try to bring other
people around you down to make yourself
a better person or make you seem like
hey I'm the better developer because
this person is or this person is
not good in this and this person is not
good at that don't do that because then
you fall into this this trap where now
to make a point or two basically to
prove to somebody that you're actually
good now you need somebody else to be
bad you know so that's like one advice
that I want to give to you guys and also
like make sure you you never stop
learning now make sure that you never
stop you know stop what you're doing
always continue doing what you're doing
but never stop learning you know humble
yourself keep yourself humble make sure
that you know where you came from
understand where are you going but
always keep yourself humble you know
yes you can learn a lot and you know a
few years you could become a really good
developer but that doesn't mean that's
going to make you a better person you
can become a really good developer
somebody's going to get paid a lot but
it doesn't mean that people are going to
like people are going to actually want
to work with you or be around you you
got to keep yourself very humble and
understand that to become a successful
developer is not just about how good you
becoming code but also how good you work
in a team how good you work with others
right now so bring it bring it down to
life for you guys
hold on give me a second like you know
I'm always out here driving you know I'm
always on the go got wifey out here came
out of Michael's her store is buzzing
right now getting a whole bunch of
clients a whole bunch of customers so
she got to get more more items more
items to sell so she's doing her thing
soon you're gonna see her she's coming
out with a new channel a new website and
it's gonna be legit you know that's
that's my biggest investment right there
but going back to what I was saying to
you guys man stay humble push yourself
but never to prove a point try to bring
the other person down because you don't
need it because then now every time that
you want to prove a point
you're going to always have to need that
second person or that third person were
you going to own I'm better than this
person I'm good because I'm better than
this person or I'm good because I've
actually my coat is cleaner than this
other person or whatever XYZ reason that
you come up with right so don't make
don't make your code they'll make your
life in your career about what the other
person is doing do what you do show your
skills
show that you're nice I just came from
buying some some free getting that baby
fat you did but yeah
show that you know show your skills man
but you don't have to bring nobody down
you know to prove a point I noticed that
for a lot of people that they're like oh
I'm good because this other person is
bad or I'm gonna give this person my
coat and they're not as good as me you
don't need to actually do that at all
oh yeah I got the back but yeah man so
that's like my quick advice for you guys
man is I'm noticing that a lot I'm going
to github and checking people's comments
on other people's codes or checking
people's comments on YouTube or checking
other youtubers for videos on rare
occasions where I do watch anybody stuff
and I noticed that I noticed that people
do that people be like oh I'm actually a
better developer because that I is like
you know I'm actually better than other
peoples and this this and this it's like
you don't need to do that because you're
basically putting yourself in a trap
where now every time that you want to
explain something
you can explain it you're the only
reason for you to say hey I'm a good
developer is because I'm better than
this other person well and at the end of
the day there's somebody who's better
than you and it's always going to be
like that you know it's always going to
be somebody that's better than me better
than you better than anybody out there
no matter what you just have to accept
it but you can't fall into that trap of
saying hey I'm actually a good developer
because I'm better than this other
people all right now like I say so bring
it back to life you know it's like move
um
I'm happy where I'm at I'm happy more
like you know being liked or a good
developer being the person that I am and
you know the skills that I have I'm
comfortable but you will see me saying
hey I'm better than this person I'm
better than that person because I don't
lead it my actions speak for me my
resume speaks for me mine my skills what
I do speaks for me you know what I'm
saying so it's like if somebody tries to
tell me something like oh I'm better
than you my only answer is what have you
done where have you worked at how much
money you got in your bank account um
what are your accomplishments you know
those are my response to two people that
that throw throw shade at me or say any
dumb things or you know whenever I want
to say I'm I'm a good developer I just
be like hey this is what I do you know
what I'm saying so for you guys so you
you guys could actually be somebody that
you're respected by your peers and the
people that work with you never do that
never be in a job never be at a
hackathon that would be anywhere that
you go don't be like oh I'm better than
this guy you know or like to try to
prove a point like let's say oh no
what's a good situation the situation if
you're actually working on a project
right and then you say hey I'm actually
better than this other developer and the
reason is because this person sucks on
this but I'm good on that so I'm better
I'm better than humans like no it's not
about that it's about you do your job
keep your mouth shut
work with others what he don't know
teach it to him
don't don't blow his spot saying like
all better than this person no just
teach it to him that's how she is gonna
be better when is the person who like
coming through
pretty soon I don't know I want to
finish this big store tutorial you know
right now today I finished the basically
it's like an introduction to react of
what we're going to do with react
because there for me I have to add react
router then after that we got to do all
the pages and then from there we're
going to start a car right after I start
the car I'm going to do I'm going to do
how you call this lerigot so we're going
to start laravel and after we do narrow
then from there we're going to continue
what's good what's good to me challenge
any DMSO
know what I'm saying
so once I finish that therefore they
we're going to be good
yeah probably connected to stripe you
know something simple
yes sir just to keep it simple may be
connected to PayPal I don't know yet you
know once we get there we'll decide
we'll figure it out together you know
but for now I'm just going to keep it
simple so yeah man let me see goes in
here real quick got your boy bit cold
without what our bit coat I was seen you
in a while bro
khadeem Gustavo Matt FinTech BAE who
else the waffle master Elon Musk is in
here alright who else Addison I like
that name Addison let me see what else
yeah man just stay humble guys never
like I said guys so people would like to
work with you guys don't don't ever have
to put yourself in a situation where you
got to say hey my code is better because
this other person's code is worse
no it's like me is like I live in an
area where basically I'm the poorest out
here you know what I mean and I left
comfortable but why do I live in an area
where I'm the poorest why because that's
my motivation you know what I mean is
like so what the other day you know I
got we've got a little something you
know that got myself a little a little
 bangs you know that ain't
nothing on on this neighborhood
nothing you know what I mean like
that's like a poor man's vehicle people
out here walking around freaking
mercedes-benz Lamborghinis and and
Bentley's in this neighborhood so for me
that just motivates me to just keep
pushing forward and getting myself
better and getting myself to the next
level you know a lot of people they'd
rather be like they'll move to an area
where they'll be like the big boy like
you know what I mean like they'll be
like they'll feel like oh yeah I got the
the freshest clothes I got this and that
I want to be you know they wanna it's
like how can I say it it's like you you
remember like one on girls who are very
pretty right but then all her friends
are like ugly not even to call anybody
everybody they just not up to par all
right so this one pretty girl who just
hangs out with a whole bunch of ugly
girls and then why does she does that
it's because she also feel better about
herself she wants to be the one that
everybody when she's walking around on a
group she's the number one and everybody
looks at her
what I mean so that's basically it -
like for me I'm the opposite I rather be
like you know I rather be just the guy
that's just like the poorest one out the
crew so that motivates me I hate it
when I used to hang out with certain
friends where I would feel like man I'm
the only one that's doing something for
my life everybody else's into a shake so
it's like I always be the one that will
have money on me or I would be the only
one that will talk about all I want to
go one day buy a house I want to go
someday you know go to another country
and you know go for vacation this and
that those are the friends they wasn't
talking about that they were just living
moment-to-moment they just thinking
about hey all I want to do is just you
know light up the cigarette or light of
this blood or whatever they want to do
drink a beer whatever it is that's what
they thinking about you know so me I
associate with people that are way
beyond me like the developer friends
that I have I'm actually the worst
developer compared to them you know so
that motivates me to get even better
you know like when I started with this
thing is like I don't put myself in
situations where I'm the number one I
always put myself in situations where
I'm the last one so I could step up my
level and once I pass everybody from
that cruel that in a circle then I move
on because then now I'm not getting any
motivation from those people and that's
how I am you know so
and why do I bring that up I say because
like I say there's people who who love
to be able to say oh yeah I'm the best
because all of this other people are on
their code is bad or whatever it is that
I oh I'm better than them so I guess I'm
good and it's like nobody you're just
surrounding yourself of people that
don't have that much knowledge so what
you should do is you teach them and then
after that after you teach them and
they're on your level
you leave that and not in a circle and
you move onto another in a circle where
you're actually the worse one so you
could actually level up to the next
level you know
so that's what I'm saying is that the
same thing for me like I said from the
beginning I try to surround myself with
it with people that have more than me
people who are you know have their own
businesses people who are actually doing
 you know I can't surround myself
with people that are not better than
like I like the idea there's people
that's out there that are better than me
so I could level up
you know but yeah exactly some people
like being the big fish in a small part
because they are insecure exactly
yeah so that's all with yourself you you
can't be out here thinking like oh I'm
 I'm the best because everybody
else is not it's not that good so I must
be the best it's like no brother you're
not the best you just happen to be in
the little pond you know what I mean and
you like to feel like you're the big
fish I'm the total opposite you know but
yeah man that was a quick video guys
listen if you guys haven't checked out
the tutorials that I dropped today I
don't know if anybody has watched them
yet yo go check them out in a little
while after I eat I relax and chill I'm
gonna do I'm gonna do you know my AMAs
that I do every Sunday you know where I
come in do a little topic then you guys
ask me questions
you know then which is not my mother say
which people's and take my
format man I didn't that's why I wanted
reasons why don't even want to do
no more like I want to go to vend me
like straight up I want to go to bring
me just because I don't even wanna
nobody is channel no more because it's
like I'm literally seeing oh my my
in other people's channels that
pisses me off
even though they my friends or whoever
it is it's like you're taking my
format oh like
we're doing the same type of videos
we're targeting the same audience and
then when I do something people start
doing it like that pisses me off
you guys don't know how that like I
sit down I think about things that I
should come up with I should come up
with certain ideas certain tutorials
certain and then I come in and
start seeing it in other
people's channels man that's it pisses
me the off
