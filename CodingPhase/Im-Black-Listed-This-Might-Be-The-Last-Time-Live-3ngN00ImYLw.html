man coding face.com
your boy is back in I didn't did it
again alright guys it's just how the
title says man I'm blacklisted this
might be the last time live that's the
truth kids you know I don't do clickbait
you know I'm just I'm too real with it I
can't stand the click bathing you know
what I mean like I hate that because
when you go to a video and you're like
oh man this president oh I'm about to
quit you too or I'm about to do this and
then you see them the next day and
you're like hmm
like we don't believe you you
we need more people's all right that's
how I feel about a lot of people right
but I just want to get all of you guys
here let me turn on the lights for you
guys hopefully we get a nice little
crowd in here and get a lot of you guys
to get to see you boy you know pretty
much what I'm doing is I'm taking this
to the next level and I always say there
I'm always taking things to the next
level but I wanna you know I want to
talk to you guys about a lot of
different topics in this live video and
we're gonna start it up with I'm
blacklisted all right so we we like to
give you guys proof right so pretty much
right here I'm working on my website but
yeah so let's go to videos you just
wanted to show you guys this so this is
the little Golden Nugget the little
Golden Nugget that everybody is getting
right now on YouTube and I hate having
to do this video because there's like a
lot of you guys don't care about this
all you care about is getting
you're not really here about hearing
nobody sad stories and this and that
like and I'm just like you guys I seen
this from like my favorite youtubers and
and seeing them come up like oh man the
ad apocalypse and this isn't that right
well the ad epochal isn't and like the
censorship dump came down on your boy
right so what does that mean that means
that pretty much nothing that I put up I
get paid for it I mean in reality I
don't really make anything out of
YouTube to be saying like oh god there
goes my living like you know like I'm
gonna have to put my wife in the street
and my son is gonna have to take a job
because YouTube don't let me down it's
not that serious man the most that your
boy was getting from YouTube for the
past what seven eight Marv's seven nine
months are unless like 300 bucks 300
bucks of buying sneakers you know what I
mean like I ain't worried about it but
the end goal like I said from the
beginning was to do this full-time and
be here on YouTube with from what I'm
seeing it it's not gonna happen
it's not gonna happen not because I
can't make it happen - what was the the
standards from before but now since
everything has just gone downhill you
know I mean like even if you go and you
make a hundred thousand subscribers like
you're not making nothing right not
enough to feed a family not enough to
pay you know $800 on a car per month is
not enough to pay $300 in insurance it's
not enough to pay $2,000 of a house it
is not enough to pay whatever all my
bills are all my right it's not enough
right so what does that mean
right we pretty much gonna use YouTube
as a funnel for my
meaning like I'm gonna release videos
and I'm gonna drop keep dropping good
quality videos here I'm not quitting
YouTube right because YouTube is good
for search results right oops
Oh YouTube is good for people finding
you and this is something which I've
been telling people for a long time like
this is what you're supposed to be using
YouTube for you basically you build an
audience people like if they like you
they like you if they don't they just
don't right so what you supposed to do
is funnel those people to your own
platform where you could say hey guys
visit me here you're gonna get the real
content you're gonna get the real things
and that's what's gonna happen right now
so I had coding phase comm directly just
for the courses but now because of
everything that's happening I have to
remodel my my business plan and
basically coding phase comm is gonna be
just my hub for everything I'm uploading
all my videos there I'm uploading all my
raw videos my rants my you know all the
good stuff that you guys love I'm
putting it there right the things that
are going to be here and YouTube is
gonna be like tutorials you know top 10
programming languages or freaking react
vs. view or angular vs. view like we are
forced to doing that you know what I
mean now of course it's you're going to
change nah not really you know what I
mean like you gotta see your boy at
coding phase com doing what I do coming
in here have hit on with that you know
what I mean like I'm still gonna be me
the sauce is gonna be there right it's
just here on YouTube we have to do it in
a smart way now now we got to do this in
a smart way we gotta use this as if it
was Google you know I mean it is part of
Google but as if it was just Google it's
not know more about community it's not
about you know from the things that I
learned over this this past eight nine
months
of doing this is other youtubers are
a-holes people come here and steal your
ideas three youtuber doesn't care about
the content creators and for because of
one bad apple everybody pays so that's
what I learned over you know the poem
the past nine months so now I'm just
like you know what I'm very smart that
you know luckily I started doing this
and from the beginning all of my videos
have been saying Conan face.com since
the beginning of time I bought that
domain even way before this I was gonna
do it like a blog website and like
luckily I've been doing it
smart like I already had that vision of
my own website that's what I really want
to have people coming to and so far like
we get a lot of people you know it's not
thousands and thousands of people per
day but it's hundreds like you know a
good 700 800 people they come to the
site you know any given town there's
probably a good 10 to 15 people at any
given time which is fine to me because
it means that's the core audience that's
the people that's there right now what
does this mean for the people that
signed up for the courses all my courses
are still there all of my questions I'm
still gonna continue creating courses
because that's what I'm here for
that's what I like to do that's really
my passion creating courses and creating
tutorials and teaching you guys stuff
you know making sure that you guys get a
good job you know and get that money is
if it's not about the money I don't know
what people are talking about you know
what I mean so that's what I want I want
for you guys so the only difference is I
might change the design on the site and
change the menus around so you know if
somebody comes in is like I'm not a
member like let's say an example right
now I'm Michael from Bangladesh right I
have a lot of people from all over the
world who follow my channel and they
love my channel listen I'm freaking
Michael from Bangladesh and Mohammed
from Morocco right and then I'm also a
Sergei from Russia right I don't have
money to pay for a subscription for the
courses but I still enjoy the content of
coding fees I want to see that right the
content is gonna be there for you guys
for free all you have to do is just
register pretty much but what this does
is also you know blocks out from us
having you know external forces trying
to control our content or tell us hey
this I used to be doing this
you can't curse here you can't do this
and that no it's like we're inside our
own don't like this is the coding phase
done we don't care yeah do what you
wanna do over there
but the group is here we're doing us
right we got good content we're creating
cool stuff so that's what we're doing
right just keeping things professional
and you know I do apologize for the
people who are like fans from the
beginning like ya been here since the
beginning you know yeah my see me you
know say coding phase comm more than
usual it's just gonna happen you might
see that I don't know somewhere at the
bottom of the videos you might see it I
don't know like I might get like you
know the coding face hat and just be
right there right in front of people's
faces I hate coding phase calm you know
I never really wanted to do that I like
saying corny phrase that conscious
that's my name that's it coding face
calling face you know what I mean I like
sitting color faces it's a cool thing
but I didn't want to put it like right
in front of people's faces 24/7 like hey
guys coding face calm I didn't want to
do that right but we are forced to do it
you know I do apologize you know my
website is not gonna have no advertising
have nothing it's just pretty much all
my courses the people who have to
premium the subscription five dollars a
month ten dollars a month whatever you
pay right everybody pays differently you
know whatever you paid
that's your subscription the people that
are coming in for free they're getting
just the content the same thing that I'm
doing here on my videos you get that
Plus free tutorials you know the people
that pay for the subscription they get
way more stuff right and you know that's
just how things are you know it's like
if you are a fan somebody who support
your boy then at some point you know it
could be a year from now two years from
now you know I helped you out through
this whole journey of getting there
getting to that job getting making sure
that you you got all the right things
that you need it I don't want it right
now if you can't can afford $5 right now
don't fire ten dollars right now don't
even sound out I'm not telling you hey
you know go ahead you're not gonna eat
today because you you try to you know
help barcoding face calm no you do this
a year two years from now when you come
back and you're like you know what this
keep motivating me this kid helped me
out let's sign up for the subscription
in AFER's for a month for two months and
then you cancel it that all helps out
you know what I mean so yeah that's what
we got now you know we got we're
creating this new section called coding
phase draw so that's where that's where
we basically put in everything like you
know whenever I want to do a rant
whenever I want to create a content that
it just can't be on on YouTube I'm
putting it there you know now we just
gotta take you to more professional
because YouTube is it's forcing us you
know what I mean unfortunately but now
let's talk about you know I told you
guys I'm gonna have a couple of
different topics and at the same time
anybody that wants to join this live
feed right now
your email right now coding face at
gmail.com send me a email right now I'm
gonna send you the link tool basically
join this conversation and yeah
so hold on right now I'm going to a
comment cuz I want to answer a comment
you know so let's see where is it
okay how long let this thing load this
is crazy to you to be kind slowly
alright so let me share this to the
screen so you guys can see that the
comment so you got your boy David
Connelly who I mess with I definitely
mess with he says I hate to lay this
well tell you what was the video about
the video was about my thoughts on
Eliezer computer guy quitting YouTube
right all right let's bring it down so
he said I hate to lay it on you dude but
this video is bad vibes what happened to
Eli's much bigger than anything to do
with what development eli has clearly
been whacked by you to progressive new
social justice warriors toward police
these people are punishing anyone who
who says anything at all that goes
against their CNN endorsed bull and
there's a time for you to us to stand
together against a man there's not a
time for kicking somebody when he's down
rejoice DC has spoken
you know they're kind of these hilarious
yeah okay let's bring it up am i kicking
you like the computer guy down oh when
he's down sorry oh no he liked the
computer guy pretty much Katie he made a
lot of money
and he knows it he made a lot of money
pretty much putting out
subpar videos that and reality were just
like how you call this
how will you call this you will call
this SEO tip SEO tactics right videos
that have nothing to do with whatever
the videos about he might talk about it
one time in the whole video and then the
whole video because about something
completely different and at the same
time just didn't you didn't even get no
information out of him
alright the first videos that I think
that his first year were videos that he
had recorded before or whatever like
videos that where he was teaching stuff
right but then it's like this interview
where he he he basically talked to I
think simple programmer where he
basically explained it like yeah at some
point I realized that you know you got
Udacity got you to meet you that a whole
bunch of people who are way better than
me at this topics and there's really no
need for me
right so that was true there was really
no need for Eli the computer guy what he
needed to do was pretty much reinvent
himself he had an audience this month
unless to me it blows my mind I have
eight thousand subscribers out of those
eight thousand subscribers one eighth of
them almost a thousand have subscribed
to my website I have eight thousand
subscribers that shows you that whatever
II like they with a million or eight
hundred thousand or whatever you have
1.5 million whatever he hasn't told a
subscribers whatever he did over this
last eight nine years he did it wrong he
didn't know what he was doing he came in
this you know thinking okay I'm just
gonna create videos after the videos
that he was coming up with wasn't useful
for anybody he started going on this
other ranks right
in what you guys can know this for me is
I'm just a cool dude
da da da da
so as you can see I'm just a cool dude
I'm now like I'm not a ho I'm not
somebody who as I'm sure if I'm not
somebody who you know it's racist and
I'm not somebody who brings people down
I'm not
none of this stuff right I'm nothing I'm
like none of this crazy stuff that is
really bad in the world right but the
more and more that the personality of
Eli the computer guy came out the more
that people was like I don't mess with
this guy and everybody step back
it's like okay I got my information I
use your channel as a Wikipedia I come
in use the information and never come
back to it that's what happened to his
channel nobody was messing with him and
even now it's even worse because let's
put it out there
he's pretty right-wing like the it's not
about left versus right is now about all
this crazy stuff with everything that's
happening in the world the best thing to
be is just neutral just be like getting
let's see
but his opinions are he's pretty much to
the other side and that other side
wouldn't want to see somebody like me
out here the other side wouldn't want
somebody with a different color out here
the other side in their head is anybody
that basically has taken or you know
it's a poor or borderline poor or
anybody below that they're not really
good they're not supposed to be out here
right they're not worth anything right
different color different ethnicities
they're not supposed to be here right
those type of people they live in this
bubble that they still think is 1942
where you know it's like people be like
hey boy
go drink on that water fountain nah man
those days are over
so the more he talks right the less
people that want to be around him or
associated with him right so that's what
happened David Connolly right
unfortunately - you - right now they
don't even care like probably I got I
got flagged just because I said right
wing's automatically so unfortunately I
got flagged already right just because I
said those words they gonna fix that and
they're gonna fix that but what they're
not gonna fix for him is the fact that
people just don't mess with him he
doesn't have anything to offer to people
I'm gonna give you another comment that
was really good
David Connelly - this which was from
real tough candy my first reaction to
that video was that it was four years
overdue this guy has nothing but a
cynical unhelpful childish prick so his
subscribers for the past few years
without the help of the algorithm yes
exactly
of your viewer once asked what he or she
could do to improve their privacy online
and eli laughed it off the question the
question and basically called the person
idiot that was the tone his channel has
taken since he stopped doing himself for
whiteboard videos yes agree 100% this is
from your boy traversing media and I
appreciated that he comes through he
checks out the channel which he doesn't
I gotta bring it back now bring it back
to your boy you know I gotta bring it
back to you boy traversing media has no
reason to be here he has no reason to be
here because he
is update he's dropping quality content
you know some people try to look down on
my channel but hey his channel is so so
dope and like he's just a real person
like he understands where I come from
when I come in on this channel right he
understands it right some other people's
they don't understand it
but because he's a real person a regular
human being he understands it alright so
I just wanted to put it out there he
don't have to even comment on this
because he just don't you don't even
have to be here you know I really like
but he's just a real dude and I'm gonna
say something after I read this comic so
he basically said Eli seem to go a
little nuts I like his stuff but he got
too much into non-tech he made a couple
of videos about Trump which just saying
that word I just got flagged that turned
me off so some right-wing party policy
political crap that I'm not into with
that said he's incredible incredibly
intelligent election person I just think
he lost his touch and maybe a bit of his
mind now what can I say about that I
agree 100%
I agree 100% which reversing media when
II like the computer guy was on here in
2008 2009 I think 2009 2010 I run there
when I have first found his channel it
was a dope channel at that time I was
still going to college you know to
become an IT worker getting my
associates to become an IT alright so I
will go in there and and check out
window stuff and you know how to work
with Linux and this and that
it was pretty useful right but just like
Tracy say he just fell off and it's that
simple the algorithm wasn't doing this
to him he was doing this to himself
now if right now if traversing media
says man all my channel all my blogs and
all my my videos have been blacklisted
on YouTube and I'm leaving or YouTube
because of days I'll be I'll be upset
I'll be like damn man people are gonna
lose out on this people are gonna be
like man this sucks and you know what a
lot of people might follow because the
duel has been dropping very good content
for free
just for the hell of it is like here
guys it's like here take a little nugget
everything all right dropping gems for
free right so people are going to be
like oh my god you see the internet oh
my god traversing media is leaving yo -
he like the computer guys leaving is
like three four guys who was like he's
like oh man this sucks
cool let's move on to Linus cool let's
move on to Chris Hawkes that's it like
nobody is going to cry for this guy like
he did it to himself
and that's about it that's what I have
to say you know what I mean like you
understand what I'm saying David
Connelly and I brought you in hey I
brought you into this so Jim because is
it good it's a good thing because I know
how how people are will what take this
will be like Oh Joe talked about you
know the computer guy his channel
suffering the same things similar to you
like the computer guy but the only
difference is my channel is good and
people loving right his channel is like
a it's like how can I put it it's like
SEO machine right there's no soul to it
it's just like a dead zombie walking
around and it's like it's like walking
around I was like oh my god
containers laid eggs Arduino whatever
you caught us
you know what that means like a zombie
walking around like you're dead already
and you're just walking around because
of the subscriber count right if it
wasn't because of that his channel would
have been completely done a long time
ago he's not dropping anything good for
anybody all right now we're gonna leave
that at that
and let's move on to it man let me check
my email to see if anybody wants to jump
into them
you
ya hear me now you try to shut your boy
down now we're blaming everything on
YouTube we're gonna be like you to try
to shut me down yes oh yeah man so like
I said man you know I just wanted to
answer some some of the comments you
know and just be like hey man I'm just
trying to I'm trying to do me out here
I'm trying to drive good car and content
for you guys good quality content but at
the same time man I don't want to lose
the sauce man you know what I mean like
I don't want to be coming here in here
and be like hey guys welcome to coding
face.com
welcome here's the function guys here's
three ways to do a function I don't want
to be that guy right so so bring it and
break it down for you guys is everything
is just coding phase com coding phase
com if you are a subscriber a youtuber
somebody who's watching me right now
live over the Internet the best thing
that you can do right now is go to my
website just register coding freeze com
register this is where all my content is
going to be and of course if you want to
subscribe to the ghetto access pass if
you are on a journey to learn to become
a web developer if you're earning to
become a better developer then you I
would say hey join the subscription if
not if you're just there for the content
register just for the content all right
but definitely register no matter what
so yeah man so let me check what I was
saying let me check my email
I want to check my email so we can see
what other topics we got for today
because to be honest this might be the
last live video and on my shed
tear or two right am i crying this this
last feed I might you know because I'm
putting a lot of a lot of work to this
channel and I really enjoyed it
I really enjoyed hanging out with you
guys I really have fun
and I feel like this might be the last
video where we could really sauce it up
you know what I mean all the other
videos we're gonna have to do a more
professional you know no cursing no you
know coming with a fitty like hey guys
cohdon freeze calm you know yeah because
we forced right but at the same time man
I want this to be a memorable moment
like you know like the last time the
sauce was real there's like one of those
moments where people be like man you
remember when the sauce was around man
that was the good old days man it was
this guy called coating face he just saw
stood up man
he had the sauce on the under YouTube
man you know what I mean like it's gonna
be one of those moments right now so
right now let me see let me see let me
see why let me see the the comments
online right now hold on let me see the
screen okay I think there's actually
going to be good because it's going to
get a lot of people offer you two
concentrators will make more money and
better content more people are going to
need web develop some a landing patience
nice window I'm just reading through
this so I could catch up so give me one
minute so I could catch up what
everybody's talking about wondering why
do you choose to do tutorials so hard
for app instead of react well that's the
thing
everybody has a tutorial react and yes I
can definitely break it down
pretty easy when it comes to react in an
easy way but I feel like for first
front-end framework reactors it's kind
of scary for people because there's a
lot of stuff that you got to do to get
up and running so I just want to give
you guys you know something easy to ease
you in and ease you into JSX remember a
lot of people's don't want to join or
let you know they don't want to hop on
react because they're scared about
writing JavaScript writing HTML in their
javascript so basically I give you
highbrow which is faster than anything
out there and pretty easy
so yeah chi-chi said you're moving
moving over to your personal site yes
matter of fact give me a second let me
see what we got here let me see what
else so you got ha Barbara Barbara Oh
what up let me see love your content
along with other guys Chris Shawn the
real Cassidy oh man you guys got me
hooked on coding uh yes
cyber sound whoa we got cyber sounding
here bro this is one of my original
subscribers guys
everybody say cyber sound on the chat
for this guy he's been here since I
don't know probably like 10 people were
around so he's been around since the
beginning beginning guys so I want
everybody to just just to pay our
respect to one of the og we're gonna say
Cyrus sound a og I want you guys
everybody to type that for him cyber
sound hey oh gee
alright you know cuz he's been here
since the beginning man they were
Connolly
it's like Oh give me a break snapping
down the race car you got to be kidding
David Connolly come on bro
like listen I like you David Connolly
let's leave it at then let's leave it at
I like you it let's just leave it like
that man and it's not the race card man
cuz that's the problem the problem is
like it's like this it's like if you
come in and be like man I want
everything for you know
let's say an example I want everything
going for the white people then the race
car gotta get pulled out that's when the
car gets pulled out like hey hold on
here's my race card
we don't want everything good for the
white people we want everything good for
everybody
all right when you are a member of
whatever
any-any party that's with Trump right
now that is your car that is your car
where you're like hey we're all about
just white people that's that's their
card and Eli the computer guy is a
member of that group all right very
clear right so it's not about like Oh
guys hey guys I'm pulling out my card
this is my race card I'm doubling down
on my race card no man I don't care
you know like I'm half black half white
so it's like I'm not worried about race
like till I came to this country race to
me didn't exist it's only in this
country that you have certain things
that you could see like you know like
you go through this area where you know
it's oh oh white neighborhood and
everything is you know crystal clean the
streets are super clean the high school
is all all good you go a little bit
south you go to the black and Hispanic
neighborhood and then you're like all
way nobody has cut the grass in two
years away
basketball courts are a rusty Oh way the
you know the dropout rate out here is
like at 50% alway we get the leftover
shitty teachers oh wait you see what I
mean
it's not a race car man trust me like
nobody's doing this because it was like
oh you know you know it's not like
people want to be out here saying like
oh we got to pull out the race car no II
like the computer guy is pretty freaking
right-wing he or his a lot of his videos
not saying all his videos but a lot of
his videos saying you could tell his
views David Connelly let me know if you
want to jump on this coding phase at
gmail.com
semia send me a message you know what I
mean
send me a email Kony phase I gmail.com
I'll bring you into the the whole the
whole chat right now live right
so let me see who else is in here MERS
is like no he's still ranting as usual
this is the thing man this is why this
is a special video you know this is a
special video because this literally
might be the last time you might see a
rant or the last time you might see
anything controversial or me saying
anything about anybody here or YouTube
just because I'm bringing all of that to
my website I'm not gonna be putting it
out here on YouTube and you know I was
like I gotta get censored and all this
crazy stuff you know so you know what I
mean so let me see
put Connolly into the stream
Connolly you're like over here basically
let me see where is it we're either
going to talk to Skype or else I'm going
to do our reaction see that right there
that's when you just you just cut
yourself out man I like you a lot man

you know what I mean what anyways man
this chick
let me check who else send me something
let me see that's it man that's that's
my last topic of of what I'm gonna say
about Eli the computer guy that's it's
that simple man this idea that people
just don't like you know people can say
whatever they want but at the same time
man it just has to be like genuine and
just like just don't be a you know
asshole I don't even want to say ass
because that's definitely gonna get me
freakin blacklist and even more than
what I am right now so yeah it's just
just be a regular human being I don't
care what color I don't care what you do
just be a regular human being like
that's what you have to do you know
people just need to be nice he was a

can you get mine oh yeah here you okay
all right okay hold on give give David
yang a chance to speak all right okay
all right dude go ahead all right I just
joined up on subscribing everything on
your personal web
sian I mean the content was like one of
the earlier about probably earlier this
week talking about the whole supporting
you and Channel and see something like
that from I know you said you don't want
to bring it up but you don't see that
from like Eli or uh you don't really see
something like that from John saunas
John summers I mean you monetize that
 I mean excuse me I know it's all
out but I mean this is gotta be really
yeah a platform they're like give that
audience and then you kind of have
something to I just come in for more
like you have a service that's out and
available for people and people you know
come and watch the channel for just find
out what's going on or catch up with you
and just keep supporting yeah I don't
really see that from you know I was
calmly with God we won't talk about
right now
and too much should that I mean there's
a lot of the stuff that they have to say
it's good to keep in that's like
noncoding relating stop seek cut and
don't give me this you know yeah really
matter if I want that I find one that
flows all that I laughter dude just go
to the news and then yeah exactly
they went 30 minutes turn off the TV
exactly yeah no I definitely agree with
you 100%
that's why I'll try to keep my
challenges straight cold you know like
code and sometimes I come in here just
swag it out do a little dance and with
it you know what it's just for fun
you know what I mean like I try to make
this channel for everybody every type of
audience and just people to just come in
and just feel good cause it's like I
know how it feels to learn how to code
on your own and sometimes like you start
losing interest like the whole idea of
the channel
for somebody who wants to learn how to
code and at the same time it's like you
know what I'm kind of losing interest a
little bit let me find something what
this guy's talking about then I get a
motivated and then they write back on
you know their chorus like that's why
most people be sending me emails like if
I was to show my emails from everybody
here people be like oh man thank you so
much I was like I was about to quit I
was like in the second chapter of the
web developer boot camp I just hear from
you order the possibilities and other
you know motivation that you give us it
just kept on helping me to continue and
now I finished it and now I got a job
you know what I mean like that's the end
goal like the end goal is not to have
people be like oh let's keep buying
collar courses like if I show you guys
my udemy account my udemy account I'm
like a course hoarder like I keep buying
courses even whenever I don't even need
to I'm like okay I'm gonna buy this
course I'll watch a later even though
sometimes I know I'm not gonna be able
to watch it because I don't have time
but I still keep buying courses now I
don't want nobody here to be doing that
that's what I specifically told people
like oh check out this courses on my
descriptions - once I work for me you
know just because I want people to just
hit the ground running don't waste no
time don't do what I did which was my
first year was mostly wasting time
looking into different uh different
places like I want to team tree house
and people could look it up you could
find meat in tree house I want to go
caddy me I want to freako camp I went to
learn koat.com
coach cool calm I went to a whole bunch
of websites and a whole bunch of
different places and just everybody kept
giving me a little bit of something and
like I had to still go somewhere else to
find the rest of the answer so nobody
was like really teaching me like a full
website like the whole process from
building something from getting a design
to building it in HTML and CSS to
messing around with the JavaScript to
put a name out on a server to deploying
it to a live sir
like there was no place like that you
know what I mean like even now all this
places don't even have that so for me
that's why I make the shadow box just
like motivating man and just like who
else could tell you how to do it there's
somebody who's self-taught you know what
I mean like if you if you somebody who
is like you know that's to say to
anybody out there but if you like a a
developer who has a computer science
degree and and you want the traditional
route how can you give a an opinion or
tell somebody how to learn on their own
you can't because you didn't do it on
your own you know what I mean like so
it's like for people that find my
channel that's what I give to them as I
came in I'm just here to help you out
and basically give you the shortcuts
that I didn't have right that's pretty
much it but I definitely agree what you
said David is like you know a lot of
channels is adding too much stuff that
don't need to be in the channel like
yeah if you have other other type of
views add it to other channels it's like
right now I love you music like I don't
know a few people know it like I love
music but you're not gonna see me it's
like coding phase comm making beats on
fruity loops you know like you're not
gonna see that here you know it's like
the whole topic of this channel is
coding or getting a job you know or a
more motivating to continue learning you
know well yeah man so that's it's a
thing it's also like a problem that a
lot of the youtubers kinda like I love I
used to love playing video games but
like I see like a lot of those YouTube
game reviewers they like run out of
content their schedule kind of runs on
when those games get released yeah got
that just like that whitespace they got
to fill it in with this reviews of like
films and all that like the best example
would be like Angry Joe yeah used to
watch some his stuff and / then like all
the reviews started dropping but if you
look at it
the statistics and he's putting out the
videos sometimes a little bit more than
just like last year but he's got all
that stuff about like you know movie
review or some mother or like board game
reviewing like you know it's like what
the heck is this yeah I came here for
the angry reviews for those video games
this yeah they're like stick to the
channel is all about is about yeah I
agree with you 100%
but yeah so um let's see so we'll go
with you Diane how's everything going
here's I can hear you everything is
going I'm like one of your new YouTube
you know you're new people and I'm the
square one
yeah no I hope you don't stop and slow
down with the youtubes either because I
just I joined coding phase because I'm
in a boot camp yeah and basically I have
to go to your channel and I do traverse'
t media to kind of fill in the gaps yeah
so no that's good that's one of the best
ways to do it because it's like I tell
people is like man it's just like school
man like when I went where I was going
to school right I was studying
communication design for the bachelors
right when I was in the class everybody
that was in the class they knew they
didn't have no projects besides the
things that the teacher gave up so
everybody would be like okay I just have
my drawings here I just have my little
design or Photoshop but those sort of
like projects that they get the teacher
would camera and I'm like man what the
hell do you guys do when you go home
like oh nothing I just hang out and I'm
like you really messing up because
school is not supposed to basically
teach you everything in school supposed
to give you a certain guide but the same
time you have to go out of your way to
become you know excellent student and
like for you in a book at if you were to
just go and go to the book and be like
oh the bootcamp is supposed to teach me
everything you're gonna you know you're
not gonna come up as prepared as you
should be because you're not going
every way to create your own projects
trying to learn more advanced stuff like
you know the the book ever supposed to
help you out to get your in shape as a
developer but they can't do everything
for you they can't motivate you to start
doing that so it's really good that you
you take it on your own to basically
find motivation and also find other
tutorials like traversing media
traversing media is dropping like he's
dropping gems every day like you know
what I mean like I definitely agree with
you but as far as the YouTube man I'm
not I'm not quitting YouTube it's just
I'm not doing more professionally which
to me kind of sucks because it means I'm
going to edit the videos more I'm going
to have everything for some people that
might be like oh this this might be
better quality but at the same time it's
not as good as as a it would be if it's
just how you call it like organic you
know what I mean like when I come in
here it's like I just came from coming
from Queens just came down here to Long
Island I was like man I have this idea
in my head I want to create these videos
so I just come in and record them with
you know no planning just freestyle
that's what makes my channel special but
then now that I'm gonna have to come in
and be like okay guys I can't curse I
can't do this I got a you know just keep
it to one topic then I feel the magic
it's not gonna be there as good as it
was so that's why of course I'm not
gonna change who the hell I am I'm just
gonna say hey man I got my platform
where you're gonna see the roar you know
what I mean like raw uncut you know
coating face without having to have
people censor me or well tell me why I
can't say why I can't cannot say my
videos so yeah so I'm not gonna stop
YouTube it's just whenever I'm under I'm
gonna stop the live videos because I
feel like when I'm I'm on the live
videos it's like I just come in and I
say whatever I have in my head but then
at the same time then that's why I'm
getting flagged constantly from YouTube
because in my live videos I curse I
basically come in throw a whole bunch of
different topics so it
I just come in and do one type of video
on one topic I could pretty much control
it and say okay I'm not gonna curse on
this I'm gonna do a tutorial about this
so it's more professionally done for
YouTube but I'm not quitting YouTube
it's like you know what I mean but hope
that people don't don't be like oh man
Joe don't went commercial cuz it's not
about that is just like I'm forced to
now do it like more you know
professionally dinah stuff but yeah man
so how's uh how's the bootcamp going for
you it's going okay you don't want me to
say see second where does this see I'm
not in Arizona no but I'm I'm actually
doing it online I guess which it's
harder but oh you're doing it online
yeah cuz I couldn't get down to Arizona
okay okay
yeah no I think that's difficult I think
doing it online is it must be difficult
I mean what you're learning right now
what type of technology is they teaching
you um while I'm doing the full-stack
JavaScript so right now I'm doing the
mean so they're teaching angular and I'm
gonna do I'm doing the react on my own
because they just introduced the react
okay
you see that's what I'm talking about
you got to go out your wait you gotta do
this that's good man
you know it's always good look angular
or react either one you're gonna be good
you're gonna be able to find a job no
matter what hey can I ask a quick
question
yeah go I am what what's the status of
angular GS these days because I was of
the understanding that they chucked it
and they were gonna switch to this
totally different angular thing but then
it looks like they're continuing with
angular GS at least they've added a few
new bits and pieces
do you know what the story is as
angularjs a continuing or as it just
some kind of legacy thing that are
hanging on to well I will say angular 1
angular 1 people still use it like major
companies still use it because if you
have a complete website in angular 1
like I think you to me just recently
changed to react but for like the past
four years that we're using angular 1 so
there's a lot of companies like that
like let's say an example I got hired in
2013 2013 angular was the best framework
so I got hired by Walmart right so I
created a whole back-end a you know
whole back-end dashboard that's all
angular basically now that company since
they already paid me let's say it took
me two years they paid me it took them
three hundred thousand dollars to get
that whole dashboard done now they're
like you know what we can't just go in
and pay that money again what we're
going to do is we're gonna for hire
somebody who just comes in and just take
care of that legacy code so there's
people who who are pretty much still
making a lot of money of angular one
like it was it totally totally I mean
that's the story of frameworks pretty
much right and but I suppose Warren is
like are they still actively developing
I've done a couple of Google searches
and whatnot and I can't find a clear
answer to that you know yeah I don't
know I don't know if this still is
they're still developing angular one
they might be doing a couple of changes
here and there or like updates like just
little patches but I'm pretty sure like
all they're they're real development is
going to angular 4 which used to be
angular 2 yeah yeah oh well I am and um
that's good day you know you you going
out you're where you learn and react you
definitely need to learn react when you
got a chance check out the hyper app
it's pretty dope because there's one
thing I tell people when you launch
something like reacting angular once you
understand what a front-end framework is
you can use that same skills that you
got from those frameworks and use it on
every other framework out there because
every framework out there does the same
thing don't let nobody tell you like oh
it's totally different it's pretty much
the same thing they all doing the same
thing so it's like what like at one
point you're gonna have your own your
own clients your own you know you're
gonna work either freelance or you're
gonna work in your own company and
you're gonna decide to be like okay this
project is good for angular this project
is good for react but this project is
really small so all I need is something
light so that's when something like
hyper outcome comes up in is it's useful
all right so definitely check it out
so yeah ah David so was good David very
kind of well it's good to finally get a
chance to say hello
yeah I don't know what to call you Joe
coding face ship you could just be like
yo it's your boy Joe G yeah it's been a
long time coming been trying to get you
in here man yeah yeah I am I don't
really know what to say I was kind of
wanting to chat a wee bit about the UI
thing but I've been ordered not to go
Poletti : that we got censored well look
I never I never watched many of the guys
channels to be straight right I don't
know much about him he does have an
incredible voice I'll say that yeah I
wish I had a voice like that you know um
but I I don't know I I don't know um ha
ha look I say what you want to say just
we just now gonna make it like the whole
thing about it right ok well here's the
vibe right I don't know what the dude
said I've no doubt it was something that
was dodgy by your estimation and I'm not
gonna mess I'm done with Paul
but I would ask this question and how
can any human being or okay oh yeah
okay I'll stick with that how can any
human being raised perfectly legitimate
concerns are both things like
immigration and terrorism Islam without
being labeled a racist how can they do
that yeah that's I mean I understand
that and I agree with you to a certain
extent oh how can you do it what's the
mechanism I'd like to know know in
YouTube you can't just by you throwing
those keywords we got flagged
I'm surprised we still live always just
really does it do that yeah really yeah
so every time cracks your voice because
everything that we say right now gets
transcribed right into little words and
then basically what they do is every
time that a video buster gets uploaded
compressed whatever they do definitely
they look through the transcribed text
and basically every keyword that they
like oh this or no no there's no no
that's it automatically the video gets
flagged
right no yeah really yeah that's the new
world only send you that ten dollars for
the new world
no anyway listen I'm not an any Seder
anything I don't yeah you know like
bless everybody
kumbaya and all I'm all I'm saying is
that you know if somebody wants to raise
concerns about something that's
questionable I think it would be
counterproductive if we all just want
rehearsed you know and that's all I'm
saying
she does it they're old friends no yeah
bad night I know I think like great now
is like so everybody's just like so edgy
it's like the whole news and
everything's going on yeah the whole
world it kind of sucks you know you
can't no you can't have an opinion on
anything the only I know only thing
there for me I don't know where you live
that right now are they with you I'm in
Glasgow it's like IT capital of
Strathclyde yeah yeah so you know over
there my I don't know if it's the same
thing as here because I haven't been
over there but here pretty much it's
like it's not about a black-white thing
or black or you know any race it's more
of like almost you could say almost
everybody who is part or like goes with
Trump they believe in something they
believe you're something that is like
hey is you know it's like the white side
and race okay okay well I don't know
generalizations are dangerous I don't
want to go anywhere
well I'm not qualified I can tell you
that and there are no black people in
the street none none in fact if I was to
tell you the last time I was in the room
with a black person and I don't even
like the what I mean I'm not being play
clicker egg but it's just an uncool was
right but it would be five years or
something that's just no black people
here none you know at all
totally weird you know so yeah it's just
the way it's like so please I was born
anyway that's the way it is that's the
way is but I am it's crazy I deleted
every single tweet I've ever posted last
night that's how crazy as I got followed
by a bunch of Nazis seriously you can't
say nothing until crazy did I just get
right again now a flag to get $10 my
cello you'll get it right I'll get it
I'll do it in this super chart so
there's an event
I think I could fly I really did get
followed by Nazis I kid you not remember
all the charlottesville thing Yeah right
well it was apparently there was all
these Nazi characters and feelings were
high in a thought oh I'll check on that
an anti-nazi song on the Twitter feed
yay because I wasn't injured I've been
labeled some kind of our eighth wing
nutter as well you know and I thought
well that would tell people oh well
fortunately they get picked up by Nazis
in they just saw a guy we are song it
was a song by Roger teal or the drummer
from Queen and it has a song called
Nazis and the words over are any actor
but the short of it as people phone this
thing and they assumed that I was some
kind of a Nazi because the opening lyric
is they're saying no that it didn't
happen over and over again and yeah but
I know you know that's just how it is
that's why I was like now you just gotta
be careful I mean even myself I've said
things where I'm like man I just gotta
be careful what I say you know what I
mean because now everybody's watch it
you know what I mean like sometimes you
might not be this person and then you
know even like I've heard people say
jokes about like you know crazy jokes
that people would be like oh my god
this person's racist but it's to me it's
funny I laugh do you know what I mean
but but nowadays you can't say nothing
so you speak for yourself you know
that's how it is no that's how it is
that's how the world is right now right
okay
you came and say nothing anymore so but
the problem is with the whole thing with
the whole elight thing is he was he's
pretty much if you look at all his
videos he's not even nice to the
subscribers not even like not even like
a little bit nice to like oh I love my
subscribers thank you it's more like ha
ha ha I'm this guy who's been here for
eight nine years and like no matter what
you're still gonna see me on your search
results because the water Buddha
who cares you know no no it's not about
me you acting like I care about this
person I'm just bringing it up you the
one that that basically commented edges
explain to you why
basically the whole situation why I made
the video that's a okay I'm gonna be
straight with you though right does two
parts to this conversation right as the
whole a and maybe this fee as I was
saying in the comment before I think
this is a heavy time for YouTube and um
don't you think youtubers should maybe
stand together it tames like this
instead of sticking up for the man and
saying yeah the guy was a shyster anyway
you know well the thing is that I don't
know cuz if it's like no if you try
traversing media was to be like oh man
I'm getting out of here nah bro nah brah
I'll be like yeah I'll be like I'll be
worried about it but like man this is
messed up YouTube is messed up but it
feels like some some a-hole who just
it's just like who's not nice to nobody
who's been riding around this this horse
of like his high horse of like hey I was
the first one on YouTube and it's like
no bro who cares if he was the first one
you still gotta be nice to other people
you still gotta collaborate with other
people you straight okay fair enough
fair enough I get it I get I could dig
it but let me give you one piece of very
constructive criticism and I hope you
can feel my energy it's an energy of
peace love and happiness do you feel my
energy hey listen man you are a guy who
goes to all ends of the spectrum right
like do you remember that video you done
well you had the you were talking about
the job and of Union what no I think it
was Verizon and everything right that
was fantastic
I was listening to that in a car park
with my mom the two of us not heads off
that that was classic coding fees right
that was stuff that we love it's awesome
right but see when you go off and talk
about subscribers all the time -
now you don't like can you handle it
That's not me that is the beginning
middle and end of my criticisms right I
just think that forget about the
subscribers and just focus on being good
that's what everybody's into you know
that's a hundred percent true that's
100% true you're completely right in
there that's why I'm basically made this
video and it's called my last live video
because my last live video is when I go
to crazy I'll go into different topics
and a whole bunch of stuff I'm not doing
that anymore so what we're doing is
we're gonna keep it one topic one video
like let's say if I'm talking about
react I'm gonna talk about react if I'm
talking about a job interview I'm gonna
talk about a job into you and that's it
you know so that's why yeah because
that's just how things are but at the
same time there's people who love this
rant there's people that love me coming
here coming live and and just like talk
to them so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna keep that to myself into my core
audience not for everybody because not
everybody enjoys it it's like you you
might not enjoy those rants you know or
when I go into different topics so it's
like my youtube channel is gonna be a
certain way but if you love the raw
uncut coding phase yes
create a topic yeah and that's it you
know so anyways David by the way have
you seen Chris Parrillo channel I
haven't seen no no he's the guy you go
to if you want to buy a laptop or
whatever and he has this real dilemma
because he's take the views are
brilliant but then you'll see something
like hey I got married and we had a new
kid look here folks here's little Johnny
and he gets about two views and then
when I talk Apple my he's got a
bazillion views and it's like we need a
new frizzen a dictionary called per
ellos dilemma you know because the dude
wants to talk about other stuff and
nobody cares that he has a bit like
well that's how it is that's how these
on channels you know a lot of people is
what I said before
some people come in to different
channels and they come in just for a
certain information a certain how can I
say a certain topic right and they take
it and then they leave they don't care
about you they don't care about your
what happens to you they don't care
about your life and that's it they don't
care about you as a person to have them
interested in it right
they just therefore the one thing it's
like there was a another guy who was
making he was like cutting items with a
hot knife and pretty much he tried to
show his face and people was like just
gave it down votes everybody gave it
down votes because they don't care about
how the guy is look all they care was
about him cutting a knife using a knife
to cut everything every type of fruit
every type of whatever cell phone that's
all they care about you know what I mean
for me I feel I'm in an opposite thing
sometimes I feel like people care so
much about my ranks and my personality
and my things that I have to say that
even when I create tutorials like I used
to be making a lot of good tutorials
here on youtube or on YouTube and nobody
watch them right but those tutorials
take me forever to make so that's why I
created my own website says you know
what let will create a website for the
people that are really going to take
those tutorials seriously cause it's
like if I'm I spent three hours or on a
video let me give it to the people that
care about you know what I mean so I'm
in like the opposite that I'm I'm like
I'm creating something that's really
good but people will they really care
about more it's Mike my opinions on
seeing me here live or you know what I
mean so it's just really it's just how
you do good
are you gonna do that on their YouTube
they're not is it just gonna be on your
own website all it's been talking about
the wrong thing the raw is gonna be your
my website that's what I mean okay yeah
it makes more sense because the thing is
that I want to use YouTube
a funnel two foot to drive people to my
website meaning because at the end of
the day we don't know where this YouTube
is gonna be you know five five years
from now this thing might just be
completely commercialized meaning like
hey if you're not part of this brand or
you're not signed up with a network or
whatever you're you're not going to to
get any views or anything and you're
just gonna get put in the back burner
right so I'm just you know that's why
I'm creating my own website and just let
us go in there it's like a it's just an
idea that I have cuz I'm like you know
what even with the whole Eli thing I'm
like wait
Eli was popular for eight nine
years right and you telling me in all
those meetings he could not create a
website with to say hey guys come to my
site it was like to me that sounds crazy
you know what I mean like that's like if
you're 90 person and you don't have a
website you don't have something out
there where people could go and
subscribe or or sign up or just register
just so you could have to emailing later
on you can say hey guys check out my
email check out my videos or something
cuz you can't leave it up to YouTube to
show your videos you have to get that
audience to say okay this 8000 if all
8,000 people that are on my subscribers
right if they all signed up to my
website then I have control to give them
those videos that I want to give them
and I don't have to wait until YouTube
decides to put me in front of krishana
put me in front of Chris Hogg so put me
in front of traversÃ©e media I don't
need that you know what I mean I don't
need I don't need to create SEO titles
or create certain type of videos to
please
YouTube's algorithm so that's why I
created my own website right that's good
well good luck I don't want to hold your
baby anymore yeah yeah it's been nice
okay take it easy
you know David so anyways give somebody
a little background on you cuz you got a
channel but even myself I don't know
that much
you late you work as an IT do you are
you a developer what do you do over here
in Glasgow I was a Glasgow or glass blow
yeah that's right yeah whatever I can be
a classical am I'm a pizza delivery guy
you know Anna brother done a course on
computing in 1996 and I don't know much
about computers and I remember he was
building a thing called a website and I
was like wow all very shoulder and I
said I think I bet you people would pay
for those and he said no way and I said
yeah and I headed out and and the kids
within a I mean it sounds kind of cool
but it shows you more about the time
than me but on within 24 hours I'd taken
four and a half grand you know this was
what it was late in the midnight is it
was really really awesome so I did that
for a while and ended calm Baba went
which was gonna horrible and I was out
of it came by 2004 and it's been very
miserable ever since you know basically
Wow
yeah I'm I'm not um I'm not really much
of a technical genius to be straight but
I've I've probably built more sites than
most people you know and but nothing
worth bragging about
yes all right so what you doing now I
mean you want to tell the people yeah
you wanted to tell the people about your
channel a little bit no no I don't I
don't
I actually don't respect the viewers at
all actually
that's right I don't respect any of them
I think the web development genre needs
a cane of a Stone Cold Steve Austin guy
that's the vibe I'm going for and yeah
man so it's all cool to worry about it
David Connolly people's there you go
right okay no I it so cool like I say
it's cool and God bless you all
Thanks thanks for everything okay
Barbara Barbara I don't where's your
neck right maybe it's not Barbara anyway
doesn't matter I won't finish the
sentence I was about to start insulting
your people but a bit or not right
corner please
stay cool man right don't worry about
the subscribers you'll be the best
youtuber ever just don't worry about
them
don't even mention them right all right
deal
Thanks bye all right yo David Connolly
people for sure yo you guys are still
here David and Diane yeah we're still
hell I have nothing to contribute some
type of information Lee like how about
you do what you up to right now you're
studying the way I'm studying I've been
studying
uh well I started off from pre-code camp
mm-hmm I got hooked onto uh cold steel's
the web developer Burt boot camp but I
just keep happening and it's been like
hindering the progress but about maybe
done with the course I've already start
applying to some places but I'm like
real hands-on with IT stuff computers
and all that when I was in the Army I
did a little bit of Intel work so a lot
of the stuff that didn't really
translate over into you know like a
normal civilian lifestyle yeah school
didn't really work out too well to
couldn't just you know like when I went
to school I was like 27 years old
there's only like three years ago and
whole this stuff happened and I mean
they were like kind of going out after
like some of the military vets and I
mean I was one too I try not to like
make it you know obvious that I'm one
but I mean the haircut gives it away the
that one lone asian guy that's off by
himself not with other asian people
there's something different about that
guy dude like it's just like zeroed in
on me especially when I want it to like
a like a at the at Ohio State they have
like a veteran's lounge and then start
walking in right yeah I'm like you know
the hell you're doing in here there's
like the veterans lounge and the guys
like oh I thought this is you know like
guys please study like nah bro you know
you got to be a vet to be in here but no
just anyways long story short I just
been doing like learning at a code since
like February and okay no I think you've
got down the penis vanilla Jas it down
pretty well on HTML and CSS but just I
feel like I'm ready but it's just a
matter of companies willing to take the
chance
yeah I mean whether you live right now
currently I live in Westfield Indiana
this is north about 20 about 20 minutes
30 minutes away from Indianapolis but I
mean it's just like suburbia up in here
I don't like Indianapolis at some point
I was thinking about moving over there
I hear there's a lot of companies there
like you know there is it shouldn't be
trust me like you should start applying
from now man like start applying as soon
as you can't because this the thing this
is how it works there's a lot of jobs
like you will find on indeed.com that
people put up a listing right but
they're like they're those type of
companies that they don't care if they
have to wait six months for the right
candidate right so you might come in and
email at the right moment and now you're
ahead of like 300 people right the
person comes in looks at your resume
sieze law you know so Army veteran
automatically whenever you go and you
ask somebody like you know they make you
say that all the time like in the job
application so you are a veteran ik and
there's a reason for it
because they know you're gonna be
somebody who's gonna be able to apply
themselves to the job right and it's
gonna be responsible so far not a
company they see it as a good sign
nearby okay this person is gonna be able
to come in do the work handily and you
know now break on the on the under the
pressure you know what it means so I
will say start applying from now even if
you're still learning apply from now
start applying it just send it out go
through interviews if they call you go
to the interviews it doesn't matter if
they don't give you the job the idea is
for you to be able to be comfortable so
the the time that they call you up
you're like okay I know all the answers
I have my projects I got the education
line I know how to build whatever
project they sent to me and then from
there you're gonna be good you know what
I mean and then you know if you have the
right project you might be ahead of a
lot of people you know I tell this to
everybody here you gotta build a real
estate you gotta build a restaurant you
gotta build a digital agency you have to
build a portfolio for yourself and you
got a build a I forgot the the fifth one
but pretty much just real business Oh
ecommerce so you gotta build real
businesses through basically through the
website sorry and then from there you
you're gonna get hired because most
people show up from college with just
like they'd agree they're like oh yeah
I just graduated automatically they get
shelf they get put under under the
resume said okay shelves because they
don't have no experience but if you come
in and you be like okay I freaking got
all these projects and I got all these
clients
automatically you are ahead of everybody
else because there's so many people that
want to become developers but they
either don't have the projects or they
give up too easily you know you guys
shut down the first time the second time
you going to an interview people give up
you can look it up here on YouTube and
this is good for you to hear - Diane
because there's a lot of people here on
YouTube that graduated from boot camps
and in their head they do like they were
gonna get a job that same moment they
came out and it's like no bro you still
gotta have your projects and just
because they shut you down from one job
doesn't mean the next one is not gonna
give it to you you know what I mean like
you can't give up you just got to keep
going to the interviews and then if it's
like you know I got hired on the third
freaking job you know I went one to one
job I got it on I went to tumblr I
got it on and then the third one
was a bad job but it was a job you know
what I mean like I got hired and then
from there every other job that I got
was good he's got to put in that work
you know what I mean
see ya man let me see let me see missing
hey man let me see who's in here on on
the chat you guys have any any questions
anything you guys want to talk about and
you have both man quiet come on guys
come on David come on Diane all right I
got one now that I got down like vanilla
Jas getting into like the whole jQuery
portion of the web developer boot camp
because there's no you know it's coding
there's no I guess you well there's no
linear structure like you don't you know
I got to do eight so forth it's kind of
like you kind of pick and choose you
know your battles or the stuff you want
to build but like after learning vanilla
Jas you know what to build okay I'm lost
because it was cutting up
you that if Rose if roses
Johnny yeah go ahead tell me again you
were saying that you finished with Jeff
another JavaScript and then now you
doing the jQuery
right but after getting down with jQuery
mmm aside from I think it was the like
the three or four projects to build what
what do you do after that
okay after jQuery what should you do
after that that's the question um I will
say I will say like this you gotta think
about it like this
javascript is to basically be able to
have control for web page through
programming and be able to either create
actions you know clickable actions hover
actions whatever it is right changing
classes removing classes whatever it is
that you you want to do to a page you do
a JavaScript jQuery what it does is
makes your life easier because if you
try to do all the things through vanilla
JavaScript if you look at the lines that
you have to write is a lot of code
alright compared to something like in
jQuery where you could do something with
one line with vanilla JavaScript it's
like a whole bunch of stuff that you got
to do and it's also - not as easy to
remember like you know you gotta
remember an event listener and a whole
bunch of other stuff there's some work
so much to JavaScript that to try
to remember everything it's like it's
kind of ridiculous so the best thing to
do is to have a framework right so you
have jQuery for whatever small little
doubt Dom manipulation then once you're
ready then once you're ready you
basically you you jump to a framework
something like angular or react or any
framework that you would like write
whatever you're comfortable with because
that's another two
yes sometimes the angular react of
better to to learn because there's so
many jobs for it in such a high demand
but also if you're comfortable with it
doesn't matter the Teletubby framework
and it's you're just comfortable with it
an employer is not gonna tell you like
oh don't use the Teletubby framework
because what they care about is king can
you build something as soon as possible
and you know if you're comfortable with
the Teletubby framework then a lot of
times the employer is gonna let you just
use it right all they care about is just
to build projects as soon as possible so
for you after jquery
what I will say is try to build a single
page app try to build a realistic so try
to build a real estate app look at
Zillow calm and try to recreate that in
your own way you know something that you
could search you could do a search
result like you create a fake dummy data
right of like let's say ten apartments
in each apartment you have the
information of the images you have the
information of the the title of a that
the street that's located the full
address what state is locating at
whatever right you have all the
information for ten different apartments
there from there after you do that you
gotta create something like a filter
some way to filter that those apartments
with the data so like let's say you say
I want to see apartments that are from
$500 to $1500 the page should rerender
and align itself to show you only those
apartments depending on that result so
if you create like a Zillow you're gonna
be able to be a master of any framework
out there because creating a real estate
single page app will test you with every
type of skill that you might have in
JavaScript so that would be the next
thing that we'll say for you to build
you look at Zillow comm just play around
with it sign up register look at it add
you know Adam different apartments - -
like your your saved list play around
with it because everything that's on
that website is everything that you're
gonna need forever in JavaScript so if
you can build those things then you
could get higher anywhere it's like this
like the web that's the beauty of the
web new libraries come out but once you
know one library that means you know
every of the library because almost all
of them are based on something else that
came before it
only differences they improve it a
little bit or they make the code a
little bit shorter or they make it a
little bit easier for the person to code
or they make the code easier and faster
whatever it is but once you learn one
you know all of them like once I learned
how to build things with jQuery I know
how to use everything else out there
that's it's just pretty much about like
the syntax it's like how you learn how a
new programming language by
understanding the same text but you
already know how to do a for loop you
already know how to do a a switch
statement you know how to do an if
statement every language out there has
that so you already know those concepts
you know what I mean like for people
that don't know programming that's when
JavaScript and things like that are hard
because they don't understand that
concept of if something is true then
show them something you know what I mean
if something is true show them a else
show them B people don't understand
those concepts if you understand those
concepts you're already ahead of
everybody else
well this thing here man
let me see got Casey got Barbara got
Marissa got Luis salsa David Connolly
tip the the tag the chat with $10 thank
you Joe yeah go ahead
what's the discord channel the discord
channel is a channel for developers for
all of us
so basically chat you know how when I do
a live video I know what it is yeah but
it's just what's the name of channel
just oconee face yeah Barbara you put up
the link for the discord real quick so I
could see it I had it on my description
I gotta add it to all my my videos I
know should be here somewhere I got in
my phone okay you should be able to
search coding face and then it should
come up like you downloading the app on
your phone and then you should have it
there it's pretty much just like the
chat room right now the live videos like
we just all in they just go chat you
know there's different areas yes let me
seem kind of add it to the description
right now so yeah Diane so what do you
used to do before
before joining okay
oh gosh this is gonna get real boring I
used to work for a health insurance
company my background is accounting and
finance okay good
a lot of people are basically coming
from the same world either some way of
financing and they joining you know what
does that mean world
so that's cool man
I mean where you from I mean you here in
the East Coast or now I'm originally
from New Jersey but I live in North
Carolina okay
have you found our house the tech scene
in North Carolina well I guess I I'm in
near Charlotte so I guess it's okay I
think if I were in Raleigh or somewhere
it might be a little better but UNC they
actually just started a program for boot
camp they started our coding boot camp
it's just so it's just getting that
popular so so I'm sure it's gonna be
yeah we're getting a lot of um people
from other countries here because of
that so so I mean right now are you
working full-time or you're doing the
full time I'm doing the full time online
course but I'm doing my own thing I
actually um left my job so I can do this
actually because I want to start my own
business I don't want to work for
anybody anymore
yeah yeah I mean if you already have
your your contacts I mean do you have
clients from or like they have a large
network and yeah not for the cut not for
the coating but you know of course with
the accounting stuff so what I'm going
to try to do is kind of parlay that into
that knowledge into the coding to start
out and get those people you gotta have
a plan for this you can't just show up
okay cool I know how to code and that's
saying like are you expecting to work
for a company sometimes you you don't
have to take that route sometimes if you
come in with a certain knowledge or
certain connections from another
industry like I know somebody who he
actually used to be in sales like
selling high coolest thing I don't know
if you ever been to like a conference
and
have like all these banners there's loan
banners like talking about you know
showing like different companies and
stuff like that he used to sell them and
he got into web development and
basically what he did was he left that
industry but he still had connections
with a whole bunch of different small
businesses so what he did was like hey
man I just opened up this new company um
if you guys needed websites if you need
you know to have a presence online for
social media this and that and the guy
has his own business now you know I mean
like he works for himself he got there
like three to four people working under
him and got his own office you know what
I mean like that's the dream right there
that's like you know if you smart and
you know what what the hell are you
doing you come in and you know it's a
skill that you could definitely useful
whatever you want you know it all
depends on the person so it's really
good that you have a plan already and
it's like you know but have you thought
of like after you finish the bootcamp
work cuz I don't you don't want to work
for nobody but would you like to work
with like let's say a company out there
let's say coca-cola well you know this
has no position open would you work over
there someone developer I I don't know I
mean I really don't want to uh you know
cuz I've worked for many you know so
many years and you just get burned out
so what I was thinking is you know start
with if I work at all for a company it
was definitely be like an independent
thing I'm not going to you know I don't
want to go into that whole corporate
having to get dressed up again and all
such foolishness yeah yeah I'm trying to
disconnect I'm trying to disconnect from
this world of like you know corporate
companies like the company I'm working
for right now is I think to me is gonna
be my last company that work for myself
working for any
because it's just like after a while you
get tired you're like you got a deal
with the office politics you know the
kissing and people just don't pay well
and like even I get paid well but I
still feel like I could I should be
getting paid way more for all the things
that I have to deal with in like at work
I feel like I shouldn't even be dealing
with all that stress you know but that's
how that's not like if it wasn't if it
wasn't because I have a kid now I would
definitely reign now I would just like
leave to like Thailand or something and
like or like I don't know somewhere in
Asia and just like work remotely and
like not care about nothing you know
because working 9:00 to 5:00 is not easy
is something that drains you you end up
all tired like even though you're in
front of a computer there's so much
stress and different things that I tell
people I don't know like I feel like I'm
not built for it I'm not built for being
in front of a computer and dealing with
stress 24/7 so that's why I was like
curious to see what what's your thought
on I'm working for a company especially
your goal is to become a I don't think I
mean there's a lot out there because
I've been doing a lot of research so I
think I can pretty much get away with
freelancing the only thing you know of
course you have to worry about the other
overhead and stuff but you know I think
I'll do well as a freelancer because I
do have a little bit more fronting and
this is like years ago I went to art
Institute and I took their web web
interactive media so all that front-end
stuff so you know I can do that too I
mean I can theoretically be doing that
right now
while I'm doing this boot camp but I
wanted to kind of immerse myself so I
can get the bad
again stuff that I don't know sound
exactly all right for fear of boring
you're right your people are live shut
up I mean this what this channels here
for man and we we here to basically a
lot of people get a lot from other
viewers like you know you're a viewer
when you sharing your experience like a
lot of people they feel the same way and
they they like that you know they like
to hear what another person is doing how
how is it going for them you know
learning cuz sometimes you bump into a
war and you like oh man I don't know how
to do this loop or whatever it is and
then you're like oh man I gotta be dumb
because I can't get it but then you
don't realize that other people are
going through the same thing so it's
like right now you're going through a
boot camp and learning the backend you
know some people somebody here in the
the chat room could be thinking in their
head or like oh you know this I
feel dumb because I gotta keep
looking online through different
resources and this and that and then
like they might hear your story and they
might relate to him but I oh cool
somebody's out there doing the same
thing as me somebody still has the same
planner like me to create my own
business or do my own freelance work you
know so it's good it's good to show you
everybody story in every background
definitely good but yeah man I think I'm
gonna start heading out guys we've been
here for a while this was a pretty cool
cool video we got a couple of people in
here we got basically this like the last
video guys man there's the last real
sauce alright I want you guys to go to
coding phase comm register the reason
why I want you guys to register you
don't have to sign up for the premium
courses you sign up for the premium
courses if you want to learn if you just
want to get the content just register
so I could be able to send you guys
directly email to basically say hey guys
I released a new video I'm not gonna be
a spamming you guys we're a bunch of
stuff cuz I hate that I hate getting
those emails like oh god this guy's
freaking I subscribed to this guy and
now he freakin sending me a bunch of
videos no I'm only gonna drop like you
know specific videos that I know you
guys are gonna enjoy so yeah man you
already know it's your boy job back at
it again coding phase comm thank you to
David yang thank you to David Connolly
thank you to Diane we love you guys
thanks for coming through so yeah guys
I'm out of here
you already know simple job back at it
