today we're gonna try to be
professionals right so we gotta ask you
know some real questions right so how
long you guys been doing this so
everybody take a turn and start with
Chris and they go from Greg okay all
right so um so I taught myself to code
it took about II about a year and then
now I've been working in the field for a
little over a year
nice so you got like two years under the
belt yeah I like on the resume that's
what I'll definitely put there you know
ya know definitely how about you Greg
I've been programming since about 2011
okay you got like seven eight years
under the belt saying pretty much you
have been you know you'll work assisting
and switching jobs and learning nice
gonna journey how is the over there in
Detroit
how's the like web development how is it
out there the communities is there a
community out there Lea community
especially the past couple years twist
around the automotive industry it's a
lot of automotive tech jobs automotive
api's out there and out smart cars a
connected vehicles and and if there's a
actually like a hub here in downtown
Detroit right now so okay nice you know
that's what I like to hear man cuz it's
like right now I think everybody that
watches my my show here knows I'm like
I'm trying to find the exit plan to get
out of New York it's like I'm I'm stuck
here and I'm trying to find the next
place you know I have my eyes sets on
you know I got that is Austin Phoenix -
my warm you know yeah because it's like
you know I was actually looking into was
it Indianapolis and it's not that bad I
was like there's a lot of companies
there and I mean but it seems like it's
in the middle no way that's like you
know well I don't know you guys so the
so we live with another family and
they're from Indianapolis okay and so
we've been there a couple times and it's
it's actually pretty nice it's just a
really really really small city
so I'm come from Chicago so it's really
tiny if you're coming from New York yeah
it's it's gonna feel really small yeah I
mean I don't you try to go with myself
yeah or the California area's been
Midwest all my life so I definitely an
opportunity to see some palm trees or
something so you see the see somebody
hit me up the other day I'm like I've
never seen the sea I'm like damn sign
you need to get out you know it's like
you never seen like the Atlantic Ocean
the Pacific Ocean it's like we need to
get you outside like you know what I
mean
we ain't made so how about you know like
for you guys like when you guys started
this man what was like the hardest thing
that you know what was like the thing
that at first seemed so difficult for
you guys for like just like learning
yeah ah dude okay so starting off like
when I decided like to commit like
alright you know like this is this is
Rob this direction I gotta go this is
where I have to go now
the hardest part was literally knowing
where to start because it's like okay
cool what do I want to do oh there's a
different programming language for each
thing you want to do and then it's just
like alright cool well all right I've
got the language oh no no but there's
these things called frameworks there's
these things called libraries there's
these things called whatever API you
name it and then I'm like oh god like I
just like where do we even start
that's probably like the biggest thing
is where do I begin and yeah so for me
personally though like I was like I just
gotta learn something I'll watch my
mouth because I know you haven't
blacklisted before yeah
but yes I'm at the library and I just
got a JavaScript book that was just big
and fat like this looks educational I
just started reading it nice yeah no
that's how it is how about you Greg yeah
I definitely agree on and know where to
start it is a issue for most developers
but so much information internet but
yeah that in and just you know find the
time to program all the time it takes so
much of your time so you have to find
some time from somewhere yeah now I
think even for myself I think one of the
hardest things is explaining to somebody
like you know like people think you know
like my mom's and like other people like
I will tell you my friends I'm like oh
man I just gotta I gotta go and sign up
I'm gonna see you guys later and like
you're given two pounds I'm out some
piece and they're like wait where are
you going it's like okay I have to
co-sign I have to go in and learn some
things that I'm doing and people look at
you like you're bro like you gotta be in
front of a computer you could be chillin
right now but you're gonna be in front
of a computer for met hours and even you
know especially if you're in a
relationship
like how do you explain that to your
significant other like yo I have to be
gone for three to four hours and like
sometimes they think like oh yeah you
just you've been there for 3-4 hours
doing work is like nah ma I just started
I was doing research now I tell my wife
that all the time I was like alright
cool well you know I got up early I got
all this stuff started cool like you've
been working for a couple hours no no
like I'm ready to start like I just had
to get to the same spot I left that Tim
everywhere I picked up and get all the
things working okay now I'm ready to
begin
yeah once they see like like the
progress you making in the benefits that
it brings and they can understand okay
you need to be up till 5:00 6:00 in the
morning and watching this tutorial
reading this blog debugging something
yeah no I definitely agree with with
that I think you know like in the
beginning even for you know my wife to
really understanding even like right now
right now is really we're going through
a stage where it's like you know we're
basically understanding each other
because we didn't live together you know
before we had a king everything like we
didn't live together so in reality is
like we just started to like you know
live together understand the things that
we like the things that we don't like
and then at the same time it's like hey
man I gotta take some hours off even
though I'm home I'm really not home
because I'm not spending the time with
you you know what I mean so it's like
sometimes that dynamic is weird because
it's like you know the only time that
they do understand it is once they they
see the good things that come from me
you know what I mean like she's been
with me since the beginning since I was
like that broke like you know those when
I met her I was good but I quit I quit
my job I was an IT worker and I quit my
job and then I became a bum for like a
few months and there's like you know is
like it was the whole process of like
okay I was good then became a bomb then
I started doing a little bit better and
then freaking I left some other job then
became a bum again as I and when I say a
bum is just like for like a good two we
of like not working it's like okay Maya
you gotta hold me down whatever you know
and then from there like now I've been
just good this whole time like you know
I'm being making money for a couple of
years but she's seen the process of like
okay this ups and downs ups and downs
and just knowing all the things that I'm
doing it you know it's like who wants to
be in front of a computer for man-hours
in reality when there's so many things
that's out there to do but it's like a
sacrifice that you know is gonna pay off
at the end you know what I mean
so definitely whenever in a relationship
or two there's any relationship with
weight development also so exactly yeah
word now I mean let me see anybody in
the chat room anybody got any questions
for us let us know this are definitely
so pretty cool developers in here you
know whatever you guys is going through
ask us and you know if we can't answer
it we're gonna answer it
you know so we hear man if you can open
up another window and go leave a comment
to the real cast there and be like y'all
bro you're supposed to be here you know
I sent them a message I was like I'm
super last minute I never tell nobody
like hey guys a week from now it's like
yo sign I'm going live like in 30
seconds what up you know what I mean
like that's how I do it I'm super
spontaneous like all my friends is
really pissed off at me all the time
because I stay I'm like the type of
person I'd rather stay home but then
that moment when I get that urge like yo
I'm going out we going clubbing it'll be
like a random once day or something like
that and they were like yo son I can't
just be leaving everything behind so I
definitely understand the castle era
real casa Derrick doesn't show up he is
fine I understand it but leave him a
message like yo son college boy so what
you guys are up to now like I mean like
you Chris you've been here for two years
and Greg's been here for like seven
eight years like what exactly is it that
you
know you guys are working on now like as
far as like learning or jobs or you know
etc you filling the blanks yeah for sure
so so for me so once I got my job I had
to learn PHP because basically like like
oh this guy can learn okay yeah he's
he's good enough you know and so like
that's how I got my foot the door and
I'm like I'll get cool well I I don't
want to screw this up so I better learn
some some PHP and whatnot right so so
that's why I had to learn but I'm like
okay good now I know this and it's off
my chest
um you know but I definitely JavaScript
a lot more and then I like learn and
then I like today between like react and
angular and after like there's a much
debate I'm like all right I want to go
down this react route and so for me
right now that's kind of my thing is
basically I'm like getting to the nuts
and bolts of like under the hood like
actually dude you you and real tough
candy both recommended the weird parts
of JavaScript or Jessica through your
parts and I was like alright let's to do
put those to two people that I trust
their their opinion I'll give it a shot
oh my god it's like the best it is
absolutely the best yeah it's pretty
much it's like I haven't I'll be honest
I haven't been able to watch everything
on it because the soul-deep interested
well I mean as much as you can binge a
unit yeah cause it's like it's pretty
much it's like an encyclopedia of like
everything inside of JavaScript here's
every single little thing of JavaScript
and explaining it and like I'll be
honest sometimes you don't need to know
all of those things but you need to have
at least knowledge that is there you
know what I mean knowledge I'm like okay
this how objects works this house
closures work this how even how when he
created a fake jQuery you know it's like
it's like this how libraries use you
know everything and how they put things
together he's like now and your head Oh
library you know what I mean and it gets
your brain working but it's definitely
one of those classes down I'll be like
you know I was like I haven't watched
every
I use it as a as a references of like if
I want to know more about objects I'd go
in there and just refresh my memory and
then just the whole object section I'll
watch it for like that week you know
what I mean but all the other things
that I already knew I didn't watch it
you know but I it's like all of the
videos that I watched I was like yawn
this is super crazy like this guy I've
never seen a course like that that they
break down every single thing about
JavaScript and that's why that guy he I
think he's like in the top ten of like
best sellers of beauty me okay what
happened to that guy cuz I was like oh
yeah like I gotta find the student Mike
went to his Twitter whatever and I'm
like 2015 or whatever I just disappeared
like I can't find him anywhere
ya know he said peace I'm making money
pretty much income I'm out I'll see you
guys later
you know I was like because it's like
you could fall into this there's a crazy
world of hey I gotta create a course for
every single thing under the Sun but
sometimes if you create the fundamentals
that people are gonna use forever like
you're good you just that's like a
classic album that's like a the Jay Z's
blueprint he dropped Jay Z's blueprint
he's like I guys I'm good I'm out of
here I made all the money that I needed
and I said you have this amazing course
here for you guys but I wish he he will
create like other even other languages
like it will be so dope you know oh yeah
so um so what's going to Greg what you
working on
sometime you know I like to follow
everything JavaScript so like a lot of
different api's for buying a sit on a
lie ecommerce Shopify has like a nice
API all of you have to experiment with
that the buy button there is a really
nice clean API to do e-commerce with
JavaScript and fill it with things
looking on the IOT world raspberry pies
and arguing olives
okay okay I'll try to get into the
hardware world I was gonna learn a
little bit like electronics and signal
and stuff like that so
not necessary everywhere Jase goes not
outside that's hot
I definitely up in Charlie get like a
raspberry Peter I was a raspberry pie
and just like put like some emulators in
it I've been wanted to just do it just
like a personal project like you know
it's not like one of those things that
I'm gonna go super hard at bomb like
magnified if I put in a Super Nintendo
game in this little thing this little
chip I'm gonna feel like I got a chip on
my shoulder like yo son your boy if you
look around like and like in the media
from like what they say about it like
everything's gonna be you know smart so
it'd be no my controllers and everything
so so deadly and javascript was supposed
to be a lead nap with the you know
wouldn't live node and you know event or
oriented the other it matches the
paradigm on the like natural devices now
that's cool this like so much potential
to JavaScript I think like once they in
reality like these things I like about
JavaScript and these things that I hate
about JavaScript like you know this
runtime errors and you know in like the
fact that you could put in the number
three and the string of three and it's
the same thing it's like it's super
annoying like that should never happen
because or like I don't know if you guys
have ever done this I go but let's say
you dinner with my sequel like this
happens a lot and laravel right you you
posting a data and then you're supposed
to get a data back but the data doesn't
come back as a number the data comes
back as a strength dream so then you
have to transfer you got a Parsi to a
number because if in your application
you're expecting a number that string is
breaking so that's one of the many
reasons why a lot of people trying to
jump into type script or flow and and
all the other new technologies are
coming up me personally I haven't really
mess too much with typescript and stuff
like that because it seems like is so
much work to do just just to get types
you know what I mean like I'm just
waiting for the upgrade you know once
they'd be like hey guys es nine got
typed and I'm a jump on it you know
now I'm not such an typescript yeah but
I've been running away from times for a
minute now but I understand that it's
important to have everything strongly
typed and what they call a real
programming languages yeah eventually
I'm gonna have it up on a bag wagon yeah
yeah I know me too I mean at some point
I'm gonna have to jump on it it's just
like one of those things like you know
as a people sounded like somebody sent
me a message and like Joe why do you use
gulp why do you use you know webpack why
do you use this thing or like somebody
saying like oh why do you use nodejs to
do things in the front end it's like
there's just so many tools that save you
time you know what I mean and like when
I build the was it the web developer
started kick
20:18 for people the reason why I
created that is because it's such a
headache
to go in there but I okay guys built a
goal builder web pack connect everything
together find out which ones are the
ones that you gotta install like as a
developer if you was to be doing that
every single time so anybody who's doing
this out there
you're an idiot like you're not supposed
to you're supposed to do this one time
copy and paste that code you never
supposed to be constantly doing this you
know setting up a web pack every single
project you're about to do like you're
wasting your time because it could take
you like hours one time I had to set up
like you're my my last job when I first
came in they had nothing set up pretty
much I built everything from scratch
right so since I build everything from
scratch I had to build the web pack I
had to build the task for gulp and I
built everything from scratch where I
couldn't even copy a lot of the things
that I did on my own or what developers
started Kay so I had to build all that
stuff all that stuff took 12 hours to do
like no lights to connect everything you
have everything exactly how we wanted it
how we wanted all the JavaScript to
minify and the whole shebang I was like
man like where is doing this every day
it's like you know sometimes I be like
man you
guys don't know like people care about
speed you know what I mean like there's
certain things that is very important
and that's like one of the barriers of
typescript typescript you gotta go in
there on the stand side skirt then from
there you gotta understand how to set up
the TS config then you gotta put it with
whatever you use if it's gold if it's
web packaged with whatever it is you
gotta set it up it's like a whole
process and you're like man when am I
gonna get to code you know what I mean
like that's one of the reasons I've been
shying away from here the angular 2 you
know it it have forcing you force in a
typescript and it goes out like
something yes big speeches but you know
it's it's a lot of setup you have to
have that you know well you don't have
to put the CLI tools you use not just a
bootstrap everything and take ten
minutes to set up
ya know I mean I was gonna do a video
but I'm probably gonna do it tomorrow
that's gonna come out somewhere next
week which I'm gonna hike on it's like
retract what I said about view Jas in
the sense of like I said if you know
angular and you know react
you shouldn't learn view now I'm
retracting angular out of that that
equation if you know react there's no
need for you but if you know angular the
obvious option to move on next to it is
view Jas because I just went through the
whole process of like setting everything
up for angular four and I'm like why is
this so difficult why do you have to put
so many you know s I can't say the S
word what you gotta put so much so much
things into this freaking framework
decorators are freaking now you gotta
worry Nelly about the interface of
typescript we gotta worry about a whole
bunch of things I'm like man keep this
thing simple like nobody wants to come
along about like the purpose of you know
going to angular 2 in a before whatever
was a
developers was complaining how difficult
angular was but I like I learned a
mastered angular 1 and I like I still
using other one
I love it yeah yeah yeah yeah go ahead
sorry so a Gregory since you were on
angular 1 and and I don't I don't know
it so you can correct me if I'm wrong
but my understanding is when they
changed it to it was so different that
like you couldn't like use any of the
code from one there wasn't like a path
to to getting things up it is that right
or I mean from go ahead oh it seems some
some talks where they took some code and
angular to code and tried to make a list
similar as possible say yeah you don't
have to sound like a big chunk at this
but you know in my opinion it is a lot
of new syntax is different in your book
everything is moving to of components
now so and you get rid of I like scope
but yeah I don't like the decorators and
it just looks like me feel still I feel
fun hey you look well your boy just got
in here first thing you did put on the
shades got on your Bush cat's a bear oh
yeah boy you came in here like yo hold
on Superman is in here boom the shades
real quick hasedera without without wood
up let me see let me see it sound the
train on the train I recognize that from
my commutes man that's definitely the
metro yeah I leave open New York well I
think he's from was a Seattle yeah I
think that's where like Microsoft is
that see yeah Microsoft and Amazon is
out there yeah yeah this definitely
right there we go yo yo yo you are you
let me see where you a son then I'm
gonna I'm on the train
live from the Train
undergo you did hold on he said nine
what time is oh it is like a sick
Society you know it's like it's like
yeah like six thirty minutes so you just
came out of work
oh yeah man oh yeah those are definitely
the most definitely I only get home in
like 7:30 I was like dude I'm gonna get
on a nightmare cuz I'm yeah man you have
to at least at least uh you know
whatever service you know as long as you
don't have a rising you're good so yeah
cuz there we basically we talking right
now you know I actually the two guys we
got here we got Chris we got Gregory
pretty much what well I wanted to know
is like for you what was the hardest
thing when you started getting into code
I couldn't I couldn't wrap my head
around for loops I think it's the way my
brain works man even now I still have
issues with like I mean like I would be
in class and I would just be bro man I
felt so stupid like this I was working
on this coke problem yesterday to to a
nested for loop man bro it took me it
took me four days to figure this thing
out and I've been I've been writing for
loops like the last ten years man and
then I got slowed down but nested
for-loops was recursion it took me a
long time to wrap my head around
recursion man I think it's just the way
my brain works though man I think a lot
of people are like that though yeah I
mean I was the same way when trying to
learn what I was trying to learn Lou
I couldn't get it I couldn't get the I
equals zero semicolon eyes less than
whatever number semicolon and I plus
plus
I was like wait what now yo y'all need
to break this down English you know
that's why I like the wire loop till
this day the wire is a that's like
that's like my come up you know where I
go to like interviews maybe like hey man
you want to do this in you know choose
your it's like you know it's like a
freaking it's like a Marvel vs. Capcom
choose your character who do you want
the for loop the wire loop and if you
want to be adventurous as a caveman i'ma
throw in the for each loop just to wash
my hands but that's like the safest
thing is okay for each grabs a concept
about closures that was a bit of me I
don't know probably like a year two
years I'll be out like this certain
things that cuz I hit the ground running
I was like the type of person that I was
like I just want to create something you
know I still believe in that even like
when I do my tutorials I don't go in and
give you the hard things first I give
you the things that's gonna make you
build something as soon as possible and
then come back and oh by the way there's
this hard-ass topic where it's gonna
take you a long time to understand it
you know but closures is definitely was
one another
another thing or even hoisting
understanding hoisting and you're like
wait what if I'm writing it like this
why is this working like this like a
weird part
[Laughter]
so can sit there what you working on now
that you know I was the next question
that I ask you guys is like what exactly
you working on now that you know things
that you you're working currently so I
got up so what I'm doing is I'm really
doing I'm redoing the website the real
Casa Darrow and the site like the first
iteration that I'll
I did it in Jekyll it's still injected
and so right now I'm really going back
through and I'm learning all that ed
stuff
but what's so cool about it is that
there's a lot of stuff going on there
that I didn't I didn't recognize what
was going on like that includes mix-ins
sass pre-processing CSS preprocessor
like there's all these different
technologies that are involved in that
so yeah that's that's my main thing is
rebuilding that site adding more content
to it I got an update operation softie
I'm gonna change the name to after that
I'm gonna roll into those other into the
other talking about on the channel like
I started a command line app that like
is basically it's just a build script
that I'm gonna put on NPM so you can do
it you could do it in p.m. install and
when you're ready to start a new project
you'll be like Cody Cody Cody phase 2.0
right quick it did it'll ask you a bunch
of questions and you fill them out and
then it'll do all the initial code for
you and it just scaffolding man I mean
it's tough the guys are doing it like
the alamin and stuff like that but it
was just a nice little command line
something you know pretend like I'm
really doing some big you know math
sounds good man it definitely sounds
good
I've been actually started creating like
a young man for Hyper app and then I'm
like wait why am i using yo man cuz then
it's like now I'm gonna have to tell
somebody else to download yo man so you
know to use my my scaffolding generator
I'm like man I need to write this by
myself you know so I've been to that the
wave I was a shell Jes or something like
that
I've been trying to get into that tool
myself so that's definitely a cool
project but currently right now man I
just I've been working on I don't know
how you guys heard of pug
we'll have a herd of pug you mentioned
it I like one of your good money yes
language is like a language is a
template engine right okay all right yes
so I know you you guys if you guys
messed with nodejs right you guys have
used the da ER B was it that er B or
your jugs yeah so yeah so pretty much
it's like that the only difference is
that is it's similar to Python it's all
about indentation so like you could nest
things inside of it so I'm gonna say you
wanted to put a div with a paragraph
inside of it you will say div and then
you will press ENTER and press tab to
basically nest it inside of that div and
say P and then a space and whatever
paragraph it is that you want to put in
so what's cool about it is that it keeps
oak oh yeah it keeps your coach super
clean and like it forces everybody to
write clean code and at the same time
what it does is you use go to compile
that into regular HTML and what's cool
too is like you could use our layouts
and you could extend things so you like
let's say an example you have our menu
right back in the days people when you
used to build a page you will say okay
this is my index page this is my about
paste is my contact page right you will
go in there and if you wanted to change
the menu you won't have to go into every
single file or change the menu okay I
want to get another item to the menu
another item another item now we've
basically with bug you do it one time on
your on your includes and you're good
and then you compile it and it compiles
your HTML all the files for you and you
don't have to do anything you know I
mean it's like it's super easy you could
use for loops you could create makes
things you could create there's so many
cool things on it man like I heard about
this zone yeah but ya know it sound it
sounds a lot like Jekyll like just well
yeah I mean it's different but the free
dough sheeter I don't know
Jekyll is written with Ruby and what you
do is it's a um
the same everything that you just said
you just write you write all of your
content and markdown and then you do all
of your styling and like all these
separate files will have like your
footer your body your header and then
you then you can have different styles
for different pages and you can apply
the styles based on the way you write
the markdown file so you can have so you
can make styles for everything and then
you blood okay I want to make a page I'm
gonna like say for instance you got like
all your JavaScript blog posts the
backgrounds are gonna be yellow and all
of your PowerShell blog posts they'll be
blue so when you you go you write it you
write your blog post and markdown and
then you will put you will put whatever
inside of your your header you would say
this is JavaScript and then when the
when you run Jekyll it compiles
everything into the files and it applies
all the styles and then you just upload
the files to a website in the the reason
why I got in a Jekyll is because you can
host sites on github so you you you run
Jekyll you can pile all your files in D
you do a git commit or a get when you
get you get you push up to get it then
it updates the website and then that's
what got me into the command line thing
so I build this command line tool they
generates these sites I can't build them
out and then whenever whenever I want to
do something I just type it and markdown
on a computer if they run a command and
it all compiles and then pushes to get
and then the website it's updated but
it's someone to plug website now man I'm
gonna I'm on the other Capone looks like
like how like be run locally yeah you
run pug locally or on your computer and
it's basically like gulp it's like a
gulp task and basically tell the gulp
task okay like how I have a setup is
first to the CSS world the sass then
from there after the sass do
doulas ass to the webpack and after
webpack then to the HTML so then from
there it basically it goes through the
the Pug files and whatever you name it
and whatever folders you name them
basically it creates a for you so
whenever you like you gotta build
something for a client or like even
you're building something in whatever
language like you could actually use Pug
with PHP you could use it with no GS you
could use it with Ruby on Rails you
could use it with literally every single
language out there because the reality
is just it's like if they created this
library that pretty much any language
could just hook into it and use it as a
template so it's wrong
yeah it's pretty legit it used to be
called Jade and now is called pug I was
gonna ask you a mission about Jade but
uh innovate they changed name because I
used to use a J like way no no first
came out and it was like you seem like
the be part of a company language yeah
know it for a long time but the thing is
that a lot of people you know when
somebody comes in with a new idea
sometimes not everybody want to pick it
up on it they're like oh man I want to
stick with my HTML so you want to stick
with your HTML then you have nunchucks
and you have the ER be one but those
languages there's like so old it and
like then nobody updates them you know
what I mean like nobody goes in and
creates new new features for it hug they
constantly creating new things for it
and like now I'm like I'm bout to just
like make everything that I make from
now on it's gonna be in Parkers I'm not
touching HTML no more I wash my hands
off HTML because a skin is good is good
but it's boring you know what I mean
like that's like the most boring part of
your whole project HTML CSS right now
this is boring but now because there's
four loops there's functions there's
makes things there's so many cool things
that now HTML can be fun again no it
makes it hey
for a while to SAS came out and didn't
you know it definitely does make CSS
fluent
oh yeah you couldn't you would actually
think about the layout like nesting does
that feature alone makes it you know one
person better then of course on the
Connexions and all the tools and toys
you can use yeah now I mean look I had
to do four when I was doing this this
course on the HTML CSS and reality I
didn't want to do it but there's so many
people that that is on my website that
are pretty much complete beginners like
they don't know how to do anything cuz
they just starting they see me and
they're like oh I'm height Joe's doing
it I'm about to jump on this right so
people jump on it and then I'm like they
asking me about HTML I'm like oh man I'm
gonna have to make a HTML CSS course and
like that's like the most boring part
because it's so easy to me my head is
like so easy I'm like I don't want to do
this so when I did it I had to go in
there and explain everything about CSS
especially like especially a specificity
where it's hard for me I can't say that
word man oh yeah City I just gotta say
City man you know me but yeah so
freaking telling people to say hey if
you wanna target element that's inside
of another element like let's say you
have a div and then you have another div
that is a menu and doing another div
that's the listing
whatever right you will have to go in
there and say div that menu in that
space well they've space that menu space
that listing to basically target that
specifically that you're gonna be like
okay I want this to go red right but
with nesting all you have to do is but
okay this is inside of this and this is
inside of that and that's it you know I
mean just it makes sense well we're
doing it with regular CSS it's like man
you're like going back into like the
Dark Ages you know it's like people
walking around with but first came out
it was
you ya know I look I remember websites
even before my deals
cutting out cutting up service Verizon
you can blame it over Verizon now you
probably you probably in the mountain
some way in Seattle right now you know
guys are talking about nesting it inside
of each other well so so my work we
don't you sass we use less which is
basically sass but not as nice
so anyways so we use less but my like my
peers they're not a big fan of nesting
because of like editing like only like
need to go back and like make edits to
like the CSS or the lesson I'll but I'm
like but that's I mean yes we can
reference things like you know we can
reference like colors and give the
planes and glass stuff but it's like
unless things really visually making
things easier and a hell of a lot faster
so like you know without giving ya like
we just have more code than probably
necessary because of certain practices
like what what what changes that what
changed the game for me man is because I
didn't I didn't want to use I didn't
want to use like all those all the extra
tech like says B it was if you knew what
the project it was easy to read cuz she
knew where me but if you just like going
to look at it like a hundred different
files you're like whoa what the hell is
all it is right but then I discovered
the f12 button on the browser man a lot
of people like when they first see all
this stuff they're like oh nah man I
can't I can't mess with all that is
there what you meet me
I don't you me for HTML files in this
one oh you got a broken down yeah no oh
man so so for me it was it was the
developer tools they changed me cut it
out cut it out castle Darrow it's cut it
out you got Verizon right now horizons
trying to get you yep
so right now i just i muted the cast
there because service horizons trying to
get them LTG just for a little while cuz
I know his servers gonna come back up
you know we won't give them a little
second until it loads up well yeah so
let's continue with this um yes so it's
like we got SAS you got a whole bunch of
different different things that is out
there and like people don't want to do
it you know I'm I'm guilty myself a lot
of times when people come in and come up
with something like new and they'd be
like oh man there's the latest and
greatest and I'm like wait this does the
same thing that this other thing does
I'm always hesitant to go in deep you
know the thing is like you know when
people say this is any other place and
great is the way you want to look at it
the project is though what do I want to
use to accomplish this individual task
this unique tasks and a half because
they all do the same thing but
frameworks but they have no different
philosophies on how to approach a
problem so whatever your project is
whatever you're trying to do that will
dictate the direction with the framework
that you use so yeah a lot of conveners
getting happy to sing something new and
shiny and because who's gonna do what a
work for my so I'm not oh yeah no I
definitely I
it is 11 you just you're not a framework
Sawyer that's just yeah overkill right
now for the frontier community yo Joe
your mics muted Joe music himself yo
times is hard times is hard man you know
cuz I was trying to video Casa Darwin
but I got you I figured I had a big
myself man yeah so now it's just crazy
like I don't mind learning something new
it just has to be something that I'm
getting something back out of it not to
say like oh I'm learning I'm on the
latest thing it's like nah if it's not
if it's not making my life easier I
don't need it you know what I mean like
if I don't see a good progress or
something that's better than what I'm
using
I'm just not gonna use it I'm just I'm
gonna look at it I learned everything
out there if people think like I don't
learn certain things I'm like bro I
already go through it I go through the
tutorials I buy every course almost
every course that's on you to me like
when somebody comes in and drop
something I'll be like okay let me look
into it
and you know it's only ten dollars to me
is like it's not that much you know what
I mean so it's like I just spent ten
dollars go through it if I like the
course I liked if I didn't I didn't like
it there's certain courses where I was
just like about to you know I don't know
jump over a building where I'm like man
this course is horrible but besides that
it's you know a lot of times I look into
it and then if I like it I like oh yeah
man let me sing it if the people was
good with the peoples in the chat room
see if they got any questions who's
online we got a couple of new people who
got worlds we got Cody Lucas
am cold who else is in here
we got nymph let me see got digital jazz
oh your boy digital jazz is back let me
see who else is in here
Casey of course passing casing around
like a piece of cup um they need to see
you got Phillipe you got AIDS art a we
got your boy Matt you know any question
guys let us know we got Casa Darrell we
got Chris we got Gregory
we got the squad right now I miss it I
missing okay so somebody asks basically
Gregory what are your plans who are your
future plans in Michigan Detroit yeah
right yeah yeah I've been working your
prolixity doesn't 11 I've done some
great things I've worked on some big
projects and small projects and projects
that's in the hands of millions of
people and users I really want to bitch
Rob like I said we're doing the West and
I've got some offers from you know
Google and uh yeah thanks boo we'll do
some some emails yeah so I'm thinking
about going west
that's one of my goals you know to be
around just the way everybody is just an
expert and I can stuff up so much just
acknowledging and just the cultures nice
yeah man you say you you're a Michigan
right now in Detroit yeah I mean it's
ready to eat
yeah that's what he found me yeah
there's that be a tech hub here it is
but not yet cuz cuz a lot of people
don't think of it earlier a lot of it
like a automotive industry is is you
know moving on a lot towards of the tech
field of like I used to work for a
company called copy where and General
Motors were like a client of their so I
was working on a project for tuner
motors like building like the JavaScript
API for the actual automobile so like uh
yeah just you know playing JavaScript be
good in you know controller card base
Wow
I wrote down Windows he could get down
and I was take information like am ethic
caught this and give me the speed so I
could turn off our radio and stuff like
that that's done and you know automotive
ministry and tech is definitely move on
or now that's definitely hot man because
that's like something where I'll be like
you know why aren't they like you know
taking advantage you know what I mean
like they could be like especially now
like you could connect your your car so
everything like I was thinking in my
head I'm like y'all I've seen this on
CNN right where somebody had a glass and
the glass had like images inside of it
it had like arrows and things like that
like I was thinking in my head I'm like
ill even my car my car has a whole bunch
of freakin sensors around it whenever
anybody's around it starts beeping so I
was doing the whole shebang right so I'm
thinking in my head I'm like yeah why
don't they just link up with other tech
companies and they put it like on the
car like arrows like okay I'm going left
or like you know like be careful with
that person down the block or you know
what I mean like there's so much
potential there with cars it is actually
you know was happening now and the
directions going I gave a partner Padova
Bosch and Panasonic
you know - Britney although
we're modules sending signals no that's
hot man you know we learn something
every day the most useful channeling on
the world kids this is coding phrase
calm you dig we in here we live we got
the people's you know you don't want to
say you don't want to stay down there
with it with the cart with them with the
cars well the thing is it's cool but
I've been here all my life and I just
I'm too pitcher i well you know will we
do I really want to be with ultimate
goal is to be remote and go everywhere I
got my laptop yeah yeah no definitely I
agree with you with that I mean right
now I think I think I'm living that
dream right now kids I'm somewhere this
ain't this ain't Long Island no more
kids you know I was setting I was
telling like yo which is funny you know
with the whole thing okay this whole
week has been kind of crazy cuz you know
whatever I just really busted my ass to
finish this website for this people and
they do every day like an ovation know
whatever and you have seen how when I
was like flipping now and like stressed
out so they come to me and that I go we
we seen your videos man you looks like
you you look like you don't happy here
and I'm like yeah you think and there's
like my other partner left you know he
left and he's working in arm I don't
know if you guys heard of loci the
freaking bracelets water blaze bracelets
or something like that
making like about 20 a year right and
I'm like wait why am I here man like you
know what I mean like before I took to
this company I literally was about to go
to title which when you put it down on
paper it looks good it's like something
that you could be proud of you but like
hey man I work at title you know what I
mean now when I come in I'll tell
somebody I don't even I don't even tell
you guys where I was working at because
it's not something that I could be proud
of
small business I came in saved pretty
much the companies we changed everything
around created super cool now and I was
like man when you say hey I work for
Google I work for Facebook I work for
whatever company's not the same thing as
saying hey I work for 39 dollar glasses
comm you know what I mean like it sounds
corny you know what I mean so that's a
that's a good that's a good thing that I
bring up like cuz I was wondering about
that because like I talked about a
little bit but I know you do too so I
was curious like you know you talked a
lot about like well back when you were
working for a company you talked about
your experience with the company and
stuff and I was wondering my head I'm
like you know people at my company they
don't they don't watch me but I'm like
people at Joe's company watch him do
they do that do they know like do they
know like hey by the way here's a
YouTube channel if they just but I'm
like I'm like I'm sure maybe he like
casually has to mention it at some point
like by the way I got a YouTube channel
yeah no I tried I try not to I think you
know at one point and slipped out which
I didn't even know like one of the
people who subscribed to me so this
which is hilarious one of the people
subscribed to me and I think it's the
same dude that I just you know he's a
good guy but just kind of stand him I
was just like this dude is like
literally and the whole time I'm like
pretty much saying a whole bunch of
things that he does wrong on his channel
and I'm like I didn't even know that he
subscribed to it so whatever I guess one
day he put it both together and it's
like yo man somebody gotta watch this
kids Channel
so they're a Monday the owner is like yo
Joe's like I just watch all your
channels somebody he's like somebody
from the company sent me or a list of
order the videos that you talked about
the company and I'm like bro like I just
actually like two years ago I need a
vacation time I need to get the hell out
of here because the other kid that used
to work with me he quit like it was so
stressful that he's like yo why am i
coming here not getting paid as much as
I would in the city work for a company
that could be proud of and their
everybody they got their their
together well we was working at it was
like it's a small business it was a
small business and then now they they
growing and then because they're growing
they still don't understand how business
works you know what I mean like when you
go to a company like let's say Google
everything is already set up for you you
don't go in there like nobody has a plan
nobody understand was the business like
that's what happens in small businesses
when you're working one of those big
companies all you have to worry about is
coding you don't have to worry about oh
my god is the company gonna be here
tomorrow so we got to finish everything
as soon as possible because the company
might just drop like you know how much
stress that is you know what I mean it's
like wait it was crazy
when I was because I have moved to Long
Island and I was like man I'm just gonna
chill I'm not gonna work for like six
months I got money in the bank I'm good
I'm not gonna work so the next thing I
know somebody a recruiter call me up I
don't even know how she got my number
she called me up he's like oh they want
you a title da da da so I was like okay
cool go to the interview they tell me in
the interview hey you're gonna be
working on a brand new music player for
the company and I'm like for how long
she's like we don't know until the
project is done I said okay peace I
don't want to be on this project because
that means you're gonna be working on
one single thing for who knows how long
you're gonna be working on that right in
like sometimes later those projects
might take a year two years to perfect
like people go in and see Spotify and
thinking like oh Spotify created this
amazing player that plays on every
single system out there and you think
like oh yeah they did that last week now
that nothing took like two three years
to build you know what I mean
sounds like so why take that opportunity
over there or not so I say I'm not gonna
go I ended up going to this other
company because it was ten minutes ten
minutes away from my house
and I was like oh I'm sweet I'm selling
it's away from my house when I get there
mind you the recruiter tells me this all
you're gonna be doing
it's html/css it's gonna be an easy job
everything's gonna be sweet everything's
already set up for you I get there the
whole thing is a mess the whole
structure of the company is like a mess
and I'm like holy shoot
what the hell did I get myself into but
I like the other do that I used to work
with it's like this very is very hard
when you find like co-workers you really
like to work with so I pretty much
stayed there because of him and then one
day he just comes back from vacations
like yo I'm out I already got an offer
hey you deal with this you know what I
mean so this whole month I was like yo
I'm just gonna try to knock out as much
as I can at the end of September i'ma
come in and giving my two weeks and I'm
out of here
you know I've been saying it on my
channel for a minute I'm like yo I'm
about to go full-time hey guys watch out
for me you know what I mean because all
of this stuff was gonna happen I was
like you know I just don't want to be
there no work you know so it was like a
crazy situation man but I definitely one
thing that I would say is oh my if I
ever work for another company I'm not
gonna put in none of like however I feel
about the company I'm not gonna put it
up online I learned that from from this
one just because you don't know who like
one thing about it when I built this
this channel I thought nobody knows me
nobody's gonna you know nobody's gonna
know who the hell I am nobody cares
about me it's like I'm some kid from New
York
I've never to sound like a you know and
I showing off my freakin popular here
people hear me are from different places
I'm getting invitations to Microsoft
people still throwing a lot of things to
me and I'm like man I'm over here I'm
keeping that hood man I got the shitty
this shitty freakin little car and I'm
over here in my workout room this room
is a mess got the baby things around
here and it's like I'm thinking in my
head like nobody cares about this is you
- you know what I mean but if I will
work for anybody or work on any company
I'm not gonna show how I feel in it
because because it's like that's it I
got not to say like I'm famous or
anything but I'm already like a person
of interest where it could come up like
if I'll be like oh man I freakin hate
this company I hate Google you know what
I mean like now people come up and be
like hey man you remembering 2017 when
you say you hate Google I'm sorry Joe
you know I was like you can't say that
here it's like we're part of Google Joe
you know what I mean so it's like I'm
not gonna do that for sure that's what
didn't I tell people everything same
thing happened to like oh what's this
kid Chris Sean Chris Sean was like doing
videos in this job like you know without
people doubt I'm here in the office
dudes were like yo they put them to the
side and I say hey son you can't be
doing that out here don't show the
offices don't do this and that because
they don't want you to really you know
expose anything of the company you know
you know what I mean like luckily for me
it's like they come in tonight oh man
what can we what can we do to make
things better
I'm like nothing man I'm who's gonna
leave two weeks from now I mean it's
like so if you want to go we're gonna
have to let you go like yeah that's
great you know literally I felt like a
weight off my shoulder like whoops I'm
not responsible for this

was like just a few years ago I couldn't
even get home I'm on the train
tell them people that yo can you swipe
me in like looking like a bum like you
know what I mean so that's what it's
like it's like I know how it feels
especially when you want to get out of
the mold of like working whatever BS job
is like if I can help you out I'll help
you out
you know what I mean so that's what we
got right now kids so so like when did
you win the juice because you like me
man like you started learning cold like
way back like way back when it didn't
like you you took a break like when did
you like get back into it like I was
under the impression that you like you
had just like like got a job as a
developer like I thought it was like two
years ago did you I mean listen to us
that's the Sham that's what I call it
the Sham
you know what I mean like I hit him with
this I like people to think that you
know but I've been doing this for a
while man I started in you know 2000
2001 I think before what was it like the
World Trade Center yeah before that
right before that I started that was in
eighth grade I was like yo I'm gonna
make my own Dragon Ball Z website and
then I basically built it in no line I
had like half a million people are on my
website and then it was getting crazy
back then
they would charge you for the bandwidth
one day my mother comes in and she's
like yo the credit card went up to $150
and I'm like yo I don't know ma I'm just
here trying to put my lipstick Oh like
4000 no it was just like you know I just
created this thing and I never made like
my own HTML like my own website what I
used to do was copy what other people
had and I copied their code and be like
okay I like this menu I copy
I like this like this I don't know
there's many of this video player I just
copy it back then there used to be this
thing called real player I don't know if
you guys remember that oh yeah yeah so I
created this thing this website and
whatever it got really crazy at the end
and pretty much I got a letter from like
the FBI like oh you're you're basically
contraband ding you know cartoons
whatever movies so I had to shut down
the whole website and then after that I
was like oh man i'ma leave this alone
and then I started getting into art
going to art then I got into music their
music for a while from there I came back
I came back from tour and then I was
like man um it's like imagine this
you're like 17 years old from 17 to like
20 21 I was like on tour like going all
over the US producing beats for a whole
bunch of different artists going to
Puerto Rico creating reggaeton beats and
then somebody sign me out when I was
young I was like 17 somebody signed me
and basically they took all my
publishing so everything that I made the
person was under his name so even now I
don't know if you guys ever played this
game called NBA ballers
I created like all the songs in there
and this dude had it under his
publishing and I'm like yeah one day I'm
playing I'm playing NBA ballers on my
only yo what am I being on your rights
oh you know whatever like like
three four years ago this and that I was
like yo so then that shut me down and I
was like man I don't want to do music
ever again in my life so I left it alone
I came back home and I was like yo I'm
gonna get back into school and then I
was gonna become a teacher so then I'm
in school I'm like soon as they have me
writing essays I'm like eh I'm about to
quit so soon as I've got to quit
somebody told me yo you like computers
right just do computer science so then I
did one year computer science did that
and then as soon as I did that they were
like yo you're not gonna be able to
program until three years from now
because all of this is all theory next
to three years I was like okay cool
piece and I quit that and then I just
jumped into communication design which
is like designing right so in reality I
didn't get to do coding again until 24
years old ten years after I first
started so it's just crazy you know like
the whole story the whole process of me
getting incidents it's like everyday
I'll be myself over the head cuz I'm
like man if I were to just did this at
14 from 14 to now I would have been like
yo no lie I could have been on some
Zuckerberg thing like no like I'm not
even lying to you guys like I was like
really doing it big like I was getting
half a million people cuz I know how to
promote things I know how to make things
good I know how to people like me I
don't know what it is what I do but
people like me so it's like whatever I
do it becomes good so if I were to
continue at 14 who knows what I would
have freaking Manman but you know that's
how life is I always uh think about that
like you know like where could I be if I
started second like you know it's
I rate or something like that yeah yeah
yeah I couldn't imagine it just crazy to
think about what you could accomplish
with just the knowledge that you have
compounded by those many years exactly
that's the thing cuz there's like even
now right now we continue to learn like
I've been doing this since 2012 and
every day I continue to learn and
there's things that I learned now even
in JavaScript that I'm like yo I did not
know this two years ago and I did not
understand where and I don't understand
it so imagine all of the stuff that we
understanding now you could understand
it
creaking at 14 15 years old because this
thing is not science this thing is about
doing it and then you understand it as
you build it so you could a little kid
who's 14 comes in and learns this stuff
from 14 to 16 by 17 he's like a monster
already you know what I mean
and I saw you getting apart like a bird
exactly by 21 he's like building a
freaking flappy bird you know what I
mean like coming in creating some crazy
app making like a million dollars a
month you know so it's like that's just
how it is that's what my son I already
got him to kick I already ordered it I
actually ordered it today you know this
I have disarmed this toys that you could
basically is like little robots where
the little kids can program it so soon
as the baby's like 2 years old I'm gonna
get him on that like y'all bro calculus
son you 2 years old you gotta man up how
can you turn them early I gotta turn on
the AC man I'm dying Reina yeah - well
yeah 3 yeah start start a topic man
start it up you dick interesting topic
I don't know about you guys but like so
like getting into this it was very
intimidating I was under the impression
like oh I'm not really smart so I don't
think I can do code because I was under
the impression like to be like this you
know like this egghead guy who like just
you know talking about advanced calculus
and all that stuff and and then and then
like I started like learning like likes
true it's people like you know they
learn on their own back in like the 80s
and I was like oh you need to be smart
and know that meteor was lucky when I
first started uh yeah I didn't never
touched a co before but you know just
starting off you learned your first
hello world code or you be at your hello
world and then you realize I was able to
do that so then you do it again and then
you can suck the more advanced more
advanced and then you know other fears
go away just there's a train yeah what's
big honey-do for me is like is it
because I mean I filled it dude man I
was horrible in high school
it's it took me forever to figure out
cascading stylesheets bro I mean like I
should you not it was like it was like
two years I couldn't wrap my head around
the concept it being one day I don't
know why it just clicked it was like
dream like all the styles go here the
HTML it's like such a simple thing right
great
it's like and you're learning this stuff
the progression is so slow right yeah
it's like it's like growing up like and
you're a kid you see adults you like
y'all want to be an adult I want to be
an adult but you never really think
about because you think about becoming
an adult but it's gonna happen
automatically you don't have to do
anything right I mean you're gonna
become an adult like you might be a
I guess it's like that with anything
like like learning the code or something
like
it's crazy Cousins is this brand new
thing like before before the 80s like
it's like up until 19 there were people
who didn't know what a computer was in
1995 they're like huh you can get that
what's that what's the internet right
everything about like the Internet in
middle school like I did not understand
what a somehow a search engine worked
still like so I was like oh I like video
games right so I type in video games
calm right I don't know like I was like
doing a report on like Marines Marines
calm like that I would just doing right
now didn't exist when we were born not
and now you don't know how much you know
like I'll be like I'll be I'll be
listened to and I'll be like bro right I
don't know nothing compared to this
 right here bro but then
I'll talk to somebody else you don't
know how much you don't want to until
you get to talking about it and
especially when you get around other
people who are excited about it and then
it's just like like well that's the
that's been like mind-blowing for me
with there's some eggheads out there bro
I mean there's people who like they lock
themselves in the office with their
cheese sandwich and I think that we just
do math all day bro it's crazy you see
the neckbeard now but that's true I mean
you know what's crazy like you know
somebody sent me a message talking about
boot camps and I'm I don't know if the
video released yet or or if it did not
release I know I recall a recorded it in
our schedule day I don't know if it's
coming out next week but talking about
that of the fact of you know this guy
just hit me up and he's like yo man I'm
like
I've been I've been coding in my house
I've been doing this I know all this
stuff and I know what you said on about
boot camps but I still want to pay for
it I'm gonna go to a boot camp for the
simple fact that I get to be around
other developers and other people who
are excited to learn this stuff you know
it's like those are one of the pluses
that that boot camps have is the fact
that a lot of times there's people who
and not everywhere because you got to
think about it like this when you go to
one of those boot camps there's gonna be
five people there who are really into
coding and then there's gonna be like
ten people who are just like lost you
know people that is like they were gonna
be they were gonna be marketing and then
they're like oh that didn't work then
they wanted to do freaking real estate
that didn't work and like all they find
is this team treehouse commercial and
they're like oh you know what let me go
to a real boot camp this and that so
this those type of people in there but
those five people that really are into
this they really go in there soak it in
and like really do it you know get it
for what it is but I was telling this
dude I'm like man you don't have to
spend so you know ten or twelve twenty
thousand or whatever to just hang out
with other developers I go to a meet-up
like straight up I go to a meet-up
I'll hang out with people that's in
there be like yo bro like just come in
like I've done this before where I've
gone to like meetups I went to a meteor
or meetup like I don't know like a year
and a half ago it's been a while I went
in and there was this dude who was like
super smart and like super cool this kid
called James and I was like yo bro no
homo but let me get your number man so
you know what I really you gotta you
gotta hit him with it bro no homo
let me get your number so we could he's
like no problem I cool cuz sometimes you
just need that you need to have like a
friend who's in this or somebody who was
gonna help you get motivated because you
got to learn even more when you're
working with other people
like the idea of people staying home and
learning on their own there's only so
much you can learn by yourself because
everything is gonna take you twice as
long as if you had somebody else there
with you that's why pair programming is
so popular and a lot of companies
because let's say I might be gutting
HTML and CSS and JavaScript but then
this other person's go with databases in
PHP so then now we're both solving a
problem and finishing a project together
so then I learned what he learned what
he has and then he learns what I got and
then now I don't have to go through the
whole process of going through a you
know a freaking course or spending like
you know 10 hours into something like I
tell a lot of people to check out what
developers bootcamp because everybody
should know all the basics HTML CSS
JavaScript but a lot of those stuff
that's in that course is so long like in
reality is so long and it takes so long
like it's I don't know it's like 30
hours of class I'm like of the courses
of videos and I'm like man I could break
down all of the stuff in probably three
hours you know what I mean
but if I sit down with somebody
one-on-one you know what I mean
so if somebody comes in and trying to
learn everything in web development by
themselves in reality it takes them
longer so that's why they should go to
bomb to meetups just for that
interaction of like you might get stuck
on a problem and the next person is
gonna come in like oh now I know the
answer free do it like this because of
this and this and this and then now they
save you that time of doing research
online looking through documentation
doing a whole bunch of stuff that you
don't need to do you know so I
definitely agree with you know having to
work with other people man that's like a
parent I think that's one of the best
ways to advance as a programmer saying
that because I was on a job before we
had a parent stations you know or two
developers you got two monitors but
we're both working on the exact same
codebase
so like why you know where you're coding
on the exact same file at the same time
but you're both talking and discussing
it and working out problems and and most
important different ways to come out but
the issues so you might will say oh okay
I'm gonna do this like this but another
person well yeah actually it's easier we
could just just do this and then you
know there you get a light blow up you
know you learn so fast that was so we
have programming is especially for
beginner you sitting there you it's the
senior guy the whole time you're gonna
learn no session so ya know it's like my
last job like freaking one of my reasons
I stood there for so long is the fact
that the other kid that I was working
with this kid Joel he's legit like he
went to uh you know he knows a lot of
stuff but he's not really a programmer
he's a self-taught programmer but he has
other skills that I don't have you know
like there's certain things like you
know after a while of me looking at a
code I get frustrated and when I get
frustrated it's like my mind shuts down
and I can't continue but when me and him
work together it's like he will go in
and you know figure the things out that
I will get frustrated and then I will
come in and like imagine this thing I
would do 20 lines and then I get
frustrated talk to him he come manages
when I all just put a comma there and
then that's a that would retrigger my
brain to continue creating more stuff
and like just solving the problems as
soon as possible you know but when you
when you don't have that and you're in
your housing you're like oh man I'm
stuck I'm like now you like beating
yourself over the head you're like man
I'm stuck here and now you're looking
through tabs look into the documentation
whatever if you have somebody else who's
there with you
you probably is just a semicolon that
you're missing you know what I mean it's
like something simple a lot of times
when you stuck you don't realize but
most of the things that they're having
is really small things that you let you
miss a semicolon or a function was
expecting
a certain argument over you forgot to do
the for-loop properly or whatever you
know what I mean
like there's so many little things that
when you work with two people it just
makes it is yeah I don't know how many
times for two weeks and then I realized
then that all I had to do is put the
JavaScript at the bottom of the eighth
when I was coming up man always had this
idea of the low like like the do who's
locked in this class is just building

yeah when I started working over here is
you know it's crazy cuz the people
aren't worthless not all of them but
most of them right like we don't we all
work on like we're on the security side
of stuff so it's not a lot of like cold
going on there's a lot of scripting a
lot of PowerShell mmm-hmm but these
dudes are like he'll be doing some crazy
stuff man but it's wild because they
don't even think they're good enough to
do the stuff that they're doing but but
up so we just have conversations and
just by talking to these dudes like I
was learning more stuff then we start we
started challenging each other so we got
one guy he's I'm doing JavaScript
another guys doing Java another guys
doing Python and he's like oh yeah man
I'm working on this thing over here you
should try this so we're we're all
writing the same code in three different
languages and then we're coming back and
we're talking each other and he's like
oh well check this out doing this I
would write it like that and I'm like
yeah like the syntax is the same we just
leave off the semicolon they write it
like this and so that was that I'm with
you unlike the pair programming and
stuff like that man I didn't but even
still like today like I don't up like I
could do this man but then you spend
like you spent five days yeah trying to
figure out why your script won't work it
is because you put the at the top
of the HTML file and so the script the
script is trying to the script is trying
to manipulate the Dom that doesn't exist
you and
how many times you see that two or three
hours trying to debug the code and
looking in many different directions to
find out you know it was some simple you
know simplest thing like that yeah it's
like y'all bro like you missed that to
me cuz that's like what are you black
man I'm a terrible program and then you
roll up on the other beauties like y'all
bro oh you're a genius
nah man I just started you two have a
bracket right there man
try to use a IDE that highlight though
the type of error but no you get like
you get like a boost of confidence from
feeling stupid sometimes like you be
around all the smart people that make
you feel real stupid and then you do
something smart it didn't have like yo
that was really good and you're like oh
 man like I dunno I dunno this like
I I can I can do this that's pretty good
yeah talked about earlier about the
light boot camps and I don't have
anything against you know working for
the group and learn from each other but
it's you know the prices is like a big
issue for doing some intricate like
doing your home yeah you definitely want
to work with people but there's
communities that you could go to and
like the three or a month I've seen
something like a month and a half two
months and so much money and with you
know so many promises but by you know
how to read so you everything you need
yeah any internet and like it's it is
like the fast track right I mean so me
like I'm like when I like the side like
okay I'm gonna learn code I'm gonna take
this serious what's the best route and I
seriously considered a boot camp but
because of college debt and everything
else I got I'm getting married I got no
no I just I was forced like I was forced
to teach myself because of economics
like I I don't have 12 grand to just
throw around you know
well that's not bad that's one of the
things I think like it helps a lot more
because one when you're learning like
you have to actually pay attention like
you're not just sitting down
pretending osmosis is gonna happen just
like I'm here it's just gonna like get
into me I'll I'll learn it like you
actually that you read that line you
know ya know I think you know you you
brought up a good point because you know
I was telling people this the other day
man there is like I know somebody who
went to a boot camp who in reality
didn't need to go to a boot camp because
he he was like he already had a degree
from a good school right and then he
went to a boot camp
just to say hey I learned web
development and as I grow you could
actually teach this stuff by yourself in
your own house like why are you gonna
get yourself in that you know for
something that in reality you don't need
now for the people that have money like
that it you know more power to you if
you if you have twelve twenty thousand
dollars laying around and it's like it's
not gonna hurt you to throw it away
then in reality that's what you'd really
want you're throwing it away you give it
to somebody to say hey it's like you
paying a gym instructor tell you to go
to the gym it's like you could have done
that in your own house you could you
know go to the gym by yourself you don't
need somebody to tell you all the time
like oh go to the gym so that's what
boot can't really do but to me I don't
think boot camps is for everybody
because if you're in a situation where
you're like man you're coming from the
bottom you ain't got no papi and mami
you ain't got no you know nobody there
holding your hand you you gotta work you
got a kid you got there's so many
different things how can you come in and
say hey I'm gonna take three months off
hey somebody's gonna pay for my rent
somebody's gonna take care take care of
me for three months
like nobody's in that situation you know
what I mean like people are not the
regular people are not in that situation
there's a higher percent of people who
are in that situation which is like
maybe a good 20% of the United States
are in the situation where they could
say
I got a I'm a trust fund baby it's like
I could go to any stay and just go over
there and spend this amount of money and
don't care and I say that from
experience cuz I know so many people
here in New York like that come from
other states and you see them like it
and like in our neighborhoods and they
just they come here they don't work they
don't do anything like you the whole
time is like your vacation it's like how
do you pay rent how do you survive and
it's like that nobody wants to say the
you know the elephant in the room is
like yeah my dad sent me a trust fund
and you know when I was young right now
is like $500,000 you know what I mean
those people could go to a boot camp and
be like hey I'm just gonna I'm gonna
chill well if you have responsibilities
and you come in from the bottom and you
started from zero there's no way you
could go to a boot camp it taken to that
you know that promise you know you're
gonna three months after three months
that's when you're gonna really need it
now buckle down and keep studying hard
exactly yeah it's like you you learn the
syntax in three months you learn the
syntax you learn how to build a page you
learn how to put a route you learn how
to send back a response with a template
that's a you know web development that's
it that's what you know well you're
you're not ready for primetime it takes
time like I hear people that they be
like oh man I'm doing so good and and
you know I came out of our boot camp
which is another thing this one of the
things that pisses me the f off it
really really takes me to the next level
this one I want to curse somebody out
when somebody comes in and be like hey I
have a computer science degree and I
went to a boot camp bro you do not need
to go to no boot camp that's number one
that's number one number two the person
who's been coding his whole life since
14 years old and then for some reason he
goes to college and doesn't do coding
and then goes to a boot camp and be like
oh they taught me everything
okay no there was this dude that I used
to work with I wish he was find my
channel somehow this cakehole Steven
this kid goes like yo this kid goes like
yo we both working in this place and we
both like junior developers right
technically junior developers I was a
junior developer this kid was like you
already know all this stuff
he goes like oh yeah I just went to a
bootcamp and like you know I just
started coding three months ago so I was
like you I felt like I was are horrible
developer as he was like so advanced and
like he was like so good and I was like
yo there's no way so I took my own time
because I needed to lift up my own
self-esteem because at some point I was
like yo I suck I'm the worst developer
out here because this case started three
months ago and I've been here for eight
months and he knows so much more than me
I looked him up this kid got awards of
like hey the science team and his high
school win and freakin job o team the
Java team from inside school and I bro
you've been doing this since high school
what is it that you get to tell people
that oh you just started three months
ago because you want to feel like you're
a prodigy people do this all the time
like they go to these boot camps because
they need a low chip on the shoulder to
give them a low paper that says you're a
developer now when in reality they never
needed it feels like they throw in a
weight that money is like you don't need
to go to the freakin boot camps I'm like
you already know programming all you
need is more practice and better Pro and
better project you know that's a lot of
money for somebody that's the let'em
like to pay for somebody to tell you you
know you could do it exactly yeah
exactly that's why I shoes with the boot
camps it's like man like you know for
some people it could be great you know
if you have the opportunity and I get
let's say a 17 year old right 17 years
old he finished he finished high school
early all right
he's 17 his parents tell them hey Johnny
what you want to do you want to go to
the army you want to go
College a 17 year old could be like nah
I got this send me to a boot camp if the
parents got money send them to a boot
camp that would be a really good
investment for the kid so sorry I was
acting like this I've been thinking
about this a lot so like cuz you know I
got like cousins and stuff are going
into into like you know I wanna do web
development you know I had somebody ask
me about like I want to build websites
like what should I go for and colleges
and that I'm like don't go College um
but what was it was like I'll think
about the coding boot camps right and
and one thing that I Cindy hear
consistently from those who have gone to
it is like it's intense right like if
you take it seriously you are spending
60 hours you know 80 hours like it's a
full-time job and then some right but
then I was thinking about it I was like
but you know what like even if I you had
the money for three months of boot camp
why not just save the money take those
three months off and seriously 80 hours
60 hours a week just go hard for three
months do your own boot camp like it's
the equivalent I think it's a lot of it
is just the fact that when you're in the
boot camp you're forced into all that
time for learning there you know and you
can do that on your own
because I mean whether you're in a boot
camp online or at a location like you're
typing you're thinking I mean you have
questions you know like how much time is
there you know another thing tool
because like I told you guys I used to
do music right one of the main reasons
why I tell people not to go into boot
camps is because I've been down this
road but it wasn't for coding it was
more for music so I went to this this
Institute Co IAR right I went to IR to
become a basically a musical engineer
right all your engineer I go to there
and I'm like wait I'm not getting
everything cuz everything so quick and
everybody just got to pick it up if you
don't pick it up you still get passed to
the next level so it's like because you
already pay for three months no matter
what you still got to continue and skip
whatever you didn't learn
a lot of people that I see from
interviews that we interview people that
came from boot camps all the time it
seemed like they got rushed like they
needed more time you know they needed
somebody to be like okay continue your
good and html/css
you got to work more on javascript you
don't know how to program yet so focus
on that don't just think of like oh I
got to do this as soon as possible and
you don't create a project in and go to
stack overflow copy some code from there
and then bring it to my project so I
could pass it's like that's what happens
a lot of time you know as a people go in
there with a dream and then when they
come out they can't get hired because
that's another thing so they don't
prepare them with real projects you know
they go in there and be like oh okay
guys just let's just go build a a a
project that you know like Leslie
connects to a database shows up API so
you connect to Google Maps and that's it
but how about you tell them hey I want
you guys to build real websites go to a
business around your neighborhood look
at what what exactly they sell create a
big a website around that business and
then when you have you graduate from
here you show up with a real project not
just like hey guys there's my free code
camp called my little snippy this is my
little Fibonacci code they people show
up to interviews with nothing on the
resume all they say is at all I create I
have a github I saw this all the time
from people that graduate from boot
camps I have a github okay go to the
gear up all the projects are unfinished
you say hey I have all projects you go
to the projects it's like little snippet
it's not really like full websites it's
like little snippets of like oh there's
the Fibonacci sequence this is you know
this how you do an algorithm this how
you you sort trees and it's like bro
nobody cares about that because if
you're doing web we want to see websites
why are you coming in here with little
pieces of code you know what I mean like
people
they don't have the right ideas that's
why I created like that course with the
five projects not to plug my house you
know what I mean but pretty much it's
like those five projects show people
that you know you know how to make
websites you know what I mean
cuz that's what people care about nobody
cares about how much sorting trees you
could do nobody cares if you pass every
freaking test or free code camp nobody
cares about you got a a BS degree from
Udacity nobody cares because if you go
in there to any job and you don't have a
job if you don't have no projects you
don't have clients how can they trust
you with we're just hiring you you know
what I mean like you gotta go in and
give the Supersmile or like blinka at a
guy in back I got you but I got you but
you know what I mean like you can't go
in there it's not gonna happen you know
the Christian got hired on you know
right away like two three months from
teen teen tree house that's not gonna
happen to 98% of the people here it's
not gonna happen you know so you
definitely wanna come in with a weather
like a build project like if you come in
with a customer management ad you know
that shows that you could do this and
you could do a B and C and D because
that's what it encompasses exactly it's
like if you're going let's say an
example people need to have our
e-commerce on their resume doesn't
matter what it is it doesn't matter if
you selling pampers or are you selling
whatever you want to sell on that
ecommerce right going there have a
website that even though it's not real
half all the things they're half a car
have a place to take payments or you
know sign up to PayPal API connect the
whole thing so when you go to the
interview a ninety nine percent of the
people that got a higher you are
businesses and they need to charge
people so if you come in and you're like
oh I have this card I have this that
okay he knows the whole flow of how to
work in this this industry so you gotta
get hired but if you come in with the
Fibonacci sequence man I'll tell you
right now your
go to write under the whole list
there's nobody cares it's sad
sometimes it's sad cuz you know even I
get people's portfolios man and for the
people that send me this crazy
portfolio's the reason why I don't
answer back because I feel like I'm
gonna go so hard on you that you might
get turned off and the reason why I do
that because it's like you I don't send
no message back it's because I'm like
man you watching my channel you watching
my videos you know what I've been
telling you and then at the same time
it's like everything that goes in one
ear you're not practicing and you're not
putting it into your portfolio why are
you watching me and not doing what I'm
telling you is like if I had somebody
when I started this thing there was
nobody here like on YouTube there was
like 'i like the computer guy talking
about servers and freaking hard drives
on there was who else was here
that's it nobody he was here there was
no simple program or there was no Chris
Chris Hawkes there was nobody when I
started getting into this thing right
and I was like man I don't even have no
no place no outlet to to find like a a
senior developer somebody who's been
here for a long time to pick his brain
when I come in here on YouTube I feel
like I just let my brain explode and
just throw so much different gems at
people that people should just come in
and I'll pick this up pick this up pick
this up and just listen you know because
it's like I'm telling you something
enough of my my freaking you know for my
my experience but I all Joe is gonna get
something gutzler sharing what what
people need to do it's for you guys you
know it's like you send a portfolio have
a portfolio semi here's my github
account with my Fibonacci sequence and
two projects I different coast cool like
you gotta build real projects kids
you know Joe you just you just a hater
[Laughter]
I'm so like realtalk man like I came
across Chris Hoffs and I was like I was
like dude man Chris he nobody he knows
what he's doing man but this dude is
kind of boring bro like Hebrew a
monotone and to be Eli talking
about servers the simple programmer man
you wouldn't even know he was a
programmer exactly they're good but is
just what I needed at the time
number one day wasn't night at that time
and like just like you said it's just it
wasn't getting me motivated it's like
everybody here was doing a certain way
in you know was not even to like be like
grill a hole out here like seriously
when I came in here to this whole
YouTube thing everybody switched up
their whole format a lot of people
switched update their format because
everybody will see like a robot like you
don't even know their personalities you
don't know who they are you don't know
what they believe in you know like I
came in I just said you know what just
be yourself you don't have to be
monotone and all that you know yeah
that's what was cool about you it is
different to see like a you know or of
urban programmers like Jesus yeah
because then you realize it's possible
you like okay alright and then but for
me like my whole thing is the mindset
man like I tell people all the time like
you don't have to you can get a job as a
developer and not know any code no no
man you just gotta want it but those
people they don't I mean it's not that
they don't want it because we all want
like a
level of success but when I see from a
lot of people we've been programmed man
you go through you go through 12 years
of school at least right side he's like
yo everybody and your mom's your arches
everybody man you're like yeah and so
you go through these 12 years of school
and then it's like oh well man I don't
know if I should go to college or
whatever blah blah blah and you're just
looking for somebody to give you the
answer mm-hmm and a lot of people they
don't have it right and so when you come
across somebody if that's why you gotta
hit these people back up like you know
your portfolio's garbage bro like I mean
I do i do hippie I don't hit people up
but there's some times where I'll be
like I'm like you right you right you
you 100% right I need to hit them up but
sometimes I just send them the video
like you know I send or like you know
what projects they need like I already
hit people up already about this but
what what pisses me off is like people
that I know that are here all the time
and I'm like bro I see you on every
channel I see you on every single thing
and you're telling me from all this time
nine months that I've been in this game
and you haven't gotten the basics which
is build real projects I don't care
about if you know how to sort trees
because this is web development you're
not doing that type of stuff in this if
you're going to let's say software
development like you know then I will
understand but all you're doing like
machine learning or something you're not
working on that what we care about is
what are your websites looking like so I
can help you take it to the next level
if you want to get into web development
and you're trying to do something
completely different and it's like I
can't help you you know what I mean this
is like you're not really paying
attention you know that's how it is I
want to help everybody I want people to
know I don't want to be a a hole with
you guys cuz I'm never a hole with
nobody but it's just sometimes I'm like
man like bro I've been explaining to
everybody please just do websites man if
you want to get into web development the
reason why you're not getting
hired is very simple you don't have
websites how can you go to a job right
and think a job that's very competitive
there's a lot of people out here with
skills right and you're gonna show up
without without nothing when your resume
that's like showing up with a piece of
paper and having your last name on it
having your first names I hate my name
is Santos and no nothing no history can
you make a website can you make anything
it's just like I got a piece of paper
what up my you know what I really like
that's all those things that's how yeah
if you guys look when you don't have a
website yeah there are so many stories
about interviews where like a somebody
just you know got a CS degree or
something and they come in and they they
they know all of these you know she has
concepts but but no actual work yeah we
hired a bunch of people like it was
crazy man we hired like we it was at
least five developers and I mean we were
paying these dudes like like real money
like four or five thousand dollars here
and there and I mean there were people
they they had the courage like they had
the computer science degree they had
like a couple like I remember this one
dude man he had a blog like he had built
this whole blog system but later on I
learned that like it's the like when you
go through this Ruby course it's like a
Ruby on Rails course where you build
this whole content management that's
where he got that that's what you had
that thing from but there's a bunch of
people out there like that who just they
they really don't know and that's it for
me it's like if you want it you'll go
you'll go get it and you know sometimes
like some of us get lucky like we come
across a Joe in Joe's like you know like
he's real like it real do like just like
hey look man I couldn't get home one day
and I'm gonna get out and then he got
that I mean the first video I saw yours
what it was like 95 KS of web dev yeah
or something they had to do it on there
like he had the money and that's like
let me go see this dude
like okay alright this is a real cat
right here like yeah yeah nothing stuff
that did I be talking about like this
dude is do it like he did it like he did
it and it's done and I tell this wall I
say look me like like go like somebody
hit me up the other it's crazy man it's
cool being a youtuber right cuz somebody
hit me up on my channel and then a it
they DM to me and they were like yo man
what do you think about this course from
Joe where he's like guaranteed a job
from you yeah course and I was like yo
man I was like dude like go do the
course and he's like man but uh come on
bro
like if you wanted like like stop
 around with all this other stuff
and just and just take the course and go
all the way through he's gonna make you
bill five websites that'll be your
website that's that's all you need right
there and I was like but how long is it
gonna take you like bro like it'll take
the rest of your life never in turn
there's a no attorney I'm still learning
just got it you got to decide this is
what it is
and then just go and there's a funding
you got a bunch of the huge support
structure I hear like all these cats who
are like ill man like I started with
nothing and now now I'm here and I still
don't know what the hell I'm doing but
I'm figuring it out you know um that's
like a that's like a big thing for a lot
of people but you ain't made your
portfolio's trash dude like I mean if
they're deterred from from becoming a
web developer because of that man I mean
this is it is what like they weren't
gonna make it anyway that's true
Domitian the bottom line between all of
this is it'll be a passion and drive it
if you have those alone then everything
else to do to dispose in a place you
don't have to really wear anybody go
draw websites in there write the code on
the back side of the page mani be like
yo I don't have to github but I got this
notebook
you've gotta be you gotta be determined
and build websites man it's like you
gotta think about it like this some kid
you gotta always think about it like
this in certain situations where
somebody goes in and he's the architect
right he just finished school and he
wants to become an architect and get
higher in a firm right he's gonna show
up there his designs his drawings you
know his 3d models that's the same thing
as a web developer we are creators right
you cannot get hired into a company
without no history right with no
projects no nothing that that shows that
you can build it you know now this times
that I do agree this times that it's
just you know like high call is like
good luck extra help I mean I
like this K uh this allocate angel that
got hired in the company that I was
working with a brand new developer super
smart super smart but didn't know
anything about the web most of the times
you're not gonna get hired if you don't
have websites for basically a company
that is an e-commerce and sells online
but because we needed the extra hand
this kid got the break right so now look
at that like now he's working in the
company he got hired I left the company
so now he's this he's this kid who is a
junior developer who has no experience
in web development but now he's already
got the job and now he's in charge of it
so now all he has to do is continue to
do whatever I already set up for him and
in two three months he's gonna be a
monster you know what I mean and this
happens all the time like sometimes is
luck like let's say a 1 out of 10 is
luck and then the other 9 is people with
project you know I mean so everybody
just got to come in and just go for it
but it's gonna be in your in your side
better to actually have projects you
know you know be a man
freakin um so talking about you know I
want to bring it down to the family you
know cuz I think there's a part that I'm
not talk about when it comes to the way
I mean from you crazy said you about to
get married no man I so that was when I
started this I was engaged
mm-hm and not even married oh should
maybe husband longer than I thought but
uh yes I've been married for three years
now so I guess I've been coding for
longer than I thought but um but but
yeah so like that was like a big thing
for me too because I I was working doing
my own thing but stuff was going on with
economics and I was like you know am I
gonna commit to code and you know you
start thinking about family you know
five years from now ten years from now
like how hard do I want to be hustlin
furred to get work and stuff so but yeah
you can continue but ya know I think
that was really good and like the reason
why I want to bring into family because
also - one of the big parts for me is
the fact that now I can help out people
in my family and how I can you know take
care you know like this house my mom
lives with me you know so it's a big
difference when I was living with my mom
my mom lives with me you know what I
mean like it's like this is different
you know it's like I can help out I can
take care of people I have like my kid
is not gonna miss he's not gonna be
missing anything it's not like Oh daddy
I want this hey no don't worry I got you
you know what I mean is like I don't
know what you are no family or married
girlfriend a live with but like I was
saying earlier and I guess like you know
Kathy we know our DNA right the code and
the argh you know how passionate I am
about it so
again it doesn't really cut it mean so
make the relationship suffer in my case
because immediately this it's a way of
life and you know she understands that
and she sees the benefits of it so yeah
she's yeah right there I don't have any
issues are the relationships that's good
that's good
how about you cancer Derek yo by the way
Castle Daryl got like the cutest kids yo
this dude I don't know what he did in
there like deal with it
he won a he basically put the sauce in
it he say young if we gotta make you
kids is gonna be cute kids man yo oh my
god I was like Cassidy I was killing it
right now sure like dude is like my man
was saying like Christopher was saying
like you don't have to be a genius at it
right you just got it and I think that
trips a lot of people love me if just
trip me up
it's from Joe up in one every everybody
who gets there they were tripped up at
some point man am I good enough should I
go to school should I do a boot camp and
at some point you just gotta and like I
like what Christopher said he was like
yo man I got economics my economy is all
jacked up man we in a recession over
here I need to fix this and he was
just like yo i'ma buckle down and I'm
gonna do this thing and so for me it was
the same thing like I'm in the military
man no I'm making good money I'm doing
alright but I'm not happy right and it's
like I tell like this cold thing man
it's this is as close to do like
magicians bro like it's pretty like dude
like come on like like for real like
we're four dudes four dudes on the
internet right now talking to I don't
know how many people right tens twenties
hundreds of people right now like
there's gonna be thousands of people
that see this they see us talking about
this stuff man and we have the ability
to build that man in it that's like
super powerful right there but but yeah
a lot like Christopher men I got all
these kids if for me it's the money is
good like the money's gonna come but I'm
gonna do I want it I wanted to show my
kids and then through the YouTube
channel just show anybody like bro it
doesn't matter like if you want to write
code if you want to weave baskets if you
want to build backpack whatever the hell
it doesn't matter bro like there's cats
out there like always bring these I
always bring these women up because
they're so freakin cool man they built
the business they make 90 G's a month
selling smoothie recipes because they
love smoothies I'm like bro go to Google
right now and take smoothie recipe for
smoothie recipes but like people are
doing this thing it's so food for me it
was like this it just made the most
sense like and it pairs with everything
that like interest me so yeah man that
this I just I just had I had to decide
like this is what its gonna be and I I
wanted to catch that gal lucky man well
you know what I don't think it's all the
way luck because look it's about
proximity to right like like I'm the
dude who didn't know how to code who
showed up like like in Joe man you work
with a lot of people names yo bro like
which is crazy
the company one was named Joe another
one was that show and then I'm Joe I'm
like yo is the triple G's in here it was
crazy he's like you know he's not up to
snuff man like it's no doubt right cuz
if you got a guy like Joe running who's
running the coding phase Empire and he's
like yo bro I don't know it all right
imagine like like brand new Joe coming
in off the street he's like I don't know
man but he went out and took that chance
man so he he put himself in proximity to
luck and not everybody get like some
people they try it and then they miss
but then it's like yo you got it if it's
what you're gonna do is what you're
gonna do you got it to sigh like okay
cool I didn't get this job I'm gonna go
home and I'm gonna send my resume out to
ten more people and then I'm gonna send
out of a write some more coal man i'ma
build these projects and and that's the
kind of kick that I got on man it did
somebody hit me up and I was like yo bro
you want to come work over again I'm
like yeah
you know is for me like I get frustrated
man because it feels it feels like I'm
not moving fast enough but then when you
look back it's like you're moving pretty
quick man like a year ago like none of
this done like like just say like none
of this stuff was going on it seems like
yesterday I couldn't get home on a
training now
now I'm full-time in my crib like doing
exactly what it is I want to do like I
don't have to answer to nobody I don't
do it so it's that process man and I
just I just learned to embrace the
process and then you know I'm especially
kind of do make us like like like
Fridays don't excite me
I'm excited from one day because I know
that's what it's been like you know you
don't know what's gonna happen man you
might you might go out and get on a bus
and run into it run into some dude who's
got a million-dollar idea right somebody
might hit you in the inbox on a Monday
morning cuz they saw one of your videos
and they're like yo we want you to come
get down there Facebook like you just
you just don't know um if their Friday
is coming I'm like I'm kind of bummed
out because I'm excited I just got to do
my thing man and I'll be missing stuff
because it's just me man I think it took
it it's rough cause it's just my wife a
long time to sort of wrap her head
around the type of person I am
like I get obsessed about stuff man
mm-hmm it's so I mean that's been that's
been difficult for me money-wise we've
been we've been great timewise because I
forget a bunch of stuff and you know I
got the whiteboard over here and I'm
always thinking about their next being
like how can I learn this how do I wrap
my head around this concept if then how
do I create a video that doesn't bore
the out of people
Yeah right it makes them want to like
like really dig into the thing they want
to do right like if you find me you're
thinking about learning the code but
that's not what you really want to do
then I want you to figure out what it is
you want to do but yeah my wife I think
she still thinks I'm kind of crazy man
you know
like hey your kids are so great joke my
friend Joe the other day he'd say hey
man your kids are so so fantastic
fantastic kids fantastic kids but uh but
yeah man for me was just like it's just
deciding it's just a sight no matter
what's going on there right whether your
wife's down or not whether your
grandma's down and out whether your
pastors down or not you just got a look
you say look man this is me this is who
I am I'm gonna embrace this it is gonna
suck sometimes right there's gonna be
times I'm gonna be frustrated I'm gonna
be sad I might be broke you know but I'm
gonna do this I'm just gonna I'm gonna
keep doing it until the gets done I
got the rest of my life man like that
maybe that maybe I may eat these
noodles and drop dead right now right
this is what is gonna be if you wanna be
the best
whatever man the best the best toilet
plunger in the world like you just be
the best garbage
I'm gonna be the best garbage man in the
world man you tell people's like bro
like like I'm gonna be a garbage man and
in five years it would be a
millionaire garbage man Leah you put all
of your heart and soul into that into
hell with anybody who's not on your team
man and you'll be fine cuz people are
gonna fall off you're gonna have friends
who fall off I'm joking don't probably
tell the chief but I know for back I
know for a fact right there's got to be
there's got to be at least ten people
who were Joe's life three four years ago
who were like Joe the only think he
is out here out here being successful is
 stop talking to me stop coming to
the parties with me stop you don't want
to watch Game of Thrones with me okay
you got Bo Duke was out there like he
don't want in there
and chill other stuff man yeah and this
is all about me man and you just it's so
for me that's it right like my family's
there they're cool we love each other we
all get along but they need to
understand man I'm gonna be a real Casa
Darrow like no doubt yeah because it's
Who I am right in you know that's a
thing the kids are on board
[Laughter]
I'm talking to you guys watching us
right now
you may not be there you may not be
there you may not even know where there
is get out there and just do and just
keep doing and it'll come it will come
like you just believe in bet on yourself
believe in yourself man and like I said
forget what everybody else is talking
about just just just forget it if they
love you they'll be there if you're not
I definitely agree with you you know
like one of the things that I you know
one of the reasons why you know I
promote in a channel out here and be
like you know people need to check out
the real cast Daryl because you know not
only you know I like your channel from
the beginning I was like oh this dude is
real and then on top but I just you
remind me like I feel like we probably
could have been like best friends in
seventh grade and like taking the bus
together like you know and just cracking
jokes the whole time because you like
that type of person that gives that good
energy and then at the same time it's
like the same thing I had with and still
have way krishana
I like his channel because even if you
don't do
even a few nights of coding because
through watch those channels you know I
mean I still watch real casted arrow if
you like makeup if you still like doing
a gym fitness you still could watch cast
there because you throw in things that
will motivate you at the same time it's
just real life situation it's not just
like somebody that's there just like
hitting me over the head we just call it
cold cold cold cold because in reality
this is YouTube you know it's like we
here who basically get entertained
nobody really that I know of I'm being
honest I don't think people show up
besides like searching for a specific
problem like let's say right now right
now I could go in and search I want to
learn angular for right and I have an
angular 4 video it's gonna show up on
the search results now people watch my
my video on it right now people are not
going to come back to to my channel
unless they have something that is
besides angular 4 because if you
thinking like I'm just dead just for
code they use you as an encyclopedia the
same thing is ya know real like it
happens to a lot of these people like
you know like why do I this hard look at
it why do I have the same views as other
people who have a hundred thousand
subscribers right and I only have eight
thousand subscribers why do I have the
same views as them and it's not because
of YouTube's algorithm is because I have
a higher percentage of people that want
to see what I want to see in a date all
right
then those other people those other
people they find you because of angular
for right the signed up to subscribe to
you for angular for that okay this guy's
cool he got good tutorials oh he he got
good comments or on technology they
subscribe to that person but then the
next video that shows up on the
notification is another tutorial about
nodejs and you're like I'm not
for nodejs today that's not what I want
to see but if you come in and you have a
channel with well-rounded way it's
different things on it like real life
situations things that's gonna help you
as a better person things are I gotta
motivate you and start gonna come in
like you know what I come in in the
morning I'm going to work I turn on the
camera I'm like yo I feel great today
I'm like hey you already knows your boy
jumped back at it again I didn't did it
again yeah like we all know Joe ain't
got no job no more right now I was
thinking about that this morning yo
because this morning I wake up I feel so
great and then it's like do I do a video
of me walking around the house and go
into the backyard and put in water on
the plants Lord what do I just like
chill you know what I mean cause like I
used to have that whole Drive that's
that minute drive to work now it's just
like hey man your boys back I don't did
it again
you already know flipping pancakes we at
home that's why it's so crazy I already
signed up for a couple of meetups right
so I'm doing a couple of meetups so my
whole plan because who wants to be home
all day nobody right so my whole plan is
my whole game plan my whole game plan is
I'm gonna show up a whole bunch of
meetups go to a bunch of convention
pretty much interview developers ask the
same questions that we're talking about
right here and you know put them
together in a compilation like a weekly
thing and and just get people out here
you know I mean because nobody's doing
that nobody's really is going to revenge
in creating creating cool content
because when you look at a convention is
like hi guys this is Dan Abramov
whatever this is the brand new react 7
or whatever and that's it that's all you
see nobody's there interacting with the
people the people that paid money to go
to that convention nobody gets to know
the people's stories like this people
that come in like
once I went to a meet-up in this kid
just homies like man
creaking yesterday I freaking he says
having a since yesterday
this isn't that but I just knew I needed
to come to this convention and I was
like cool it's like that's a story right
then you know like people haven't shared
you know so that's one of the things
that I want to do cause it's like I'm
not gonna stay all day just making
videos my whole schedule is Monday to
Wednesday's do a whole bunch of videos
that's the whole day Thursday Friday and
Saturday I'm out I'm out in the city
amount in different companies I got
people inviting me to go to like events
in like creaking in Twitter
I got another event go to our Airbnb so
it's like I got a couple of things
that's going on you know but it kind of
sucks you know freaking driving in the
morning doing my little you already
knows your boy Joe back at it again
headed to work which is that you know is
like today I did uh-oh was a web
developers lunch break drive it around
don't guess yeah else I got again got
some gas because like yo man we missed a
web developers lunch break you need to
lose more often I'm like bro listen my
life is lunch break bro like lunch break
literally I were aware my company I came
back from lunch break I was like yo I'm
not coming back and everything that's it
so I'm gonna I'm still on lunch break
you know like I'm still on lunch BRE son
I got a question so so Joe it's easy for
you now because you're working from home
but even before that and then also
Casandra and Gregory like to know what's
going on so we're talking about really
like like bouncing family but at the
same time we're talking about like
learning all this new stuff and then
also like building a project and then
also like having a balance with family
and then like all this stuff right
I mean I'm kind of curious like how you
guys kind of fit that whole schedule in
like you know how that how you do your
scheduling yeah like me I wake up at
4:30 every morning 7 days a week
anybody great like my kid puts me to
sleep pretty early but you know I get up
early because I'm like you know what at
night I wanted to be family time like
Elsa after the day like I'm not gonna
stay up like I just I'm just not that
guy right early in the morning though
like I can do whatever I got to do in
the morning ain't nobody up baby's awake
like I can kind of like just Rock him
and watch something or whatever but but
yeah I mean that's that's my thing but
I'm kind of curious like what you guys
yeah I think for me what I had and I was
like working last week um pretty much
pretty much was like you know I'll be
honest like my girls been tight you know
we had some issues a while ago and
that's why people should check out my
family phase the channel now you know to
bring the no plug we have enough family
feel together me and wifey we're you
know everything's gonna be good it's not
like we're gonna be it's not a drama
show it's not like a ton of crates
around like god damn it and creating
freakin fake fake situations were like
oh man I think she's talking to somebody
on the phone like you know we're not
doing none of those crazy things it's
more like a family thing but bringing it
back to it like in that whole I think
the beginning of when the baby was born
the first month it was hard because I
was in a situation where it was super
stressful at work
then on top of that we wasn't sleeping
because the baby will be up in the
middle of the night and then on top of
that I had YouTube so I had to do you
too and on top of that I have my new
website so it's like I have to knock out
all the videos because people sign up to
the website right people sign up to the
website and at that time I didn't have
for the courses done
it's like I put up
the courses I'm gonna build right now
80% of them are done you know what I
mean but this are some courses are super
long like no matter what I do is gonna
take months you know what I mean
but what I was trying to do was to knock
out everything as soon as possible so
that whole month was like super hard and
stressful it was like back and forth
between us - because it's like man I
just had a kid you're not giving me time
you're doing all this code you also have
to work late nights because of the
project can't work so it's a lot of
stuff that it was just too much now
we're in a better space where we could
be like you know now we can relax more I
could spend more time with her which is
one of the things that I wanted to do
it's like I come in I wake up early and
let's say like 9 o'clock to all my
videos so five o'clock right at five
o'clock that's it I shut down I don't do
anything give her and the baby all that
time watch a movie watch a show Netflix
whatever you know what I mean
well before it wasn't like that I was
like I'll be doing videos after I come
from work I come home at 6 o'clock from
6 10 o'clock at night I'm doing videos
or doing research then I come back to
bed like a 10:30 hanging out with her
for like an hour and a half and the baby
so it was a lot you know this was like I
was getting overworked because in
reality YouTube is a job when you're
doing it as much as I'm doing it like
right now like people come in and you
know I see all the channels and they do
one video two videos per week I'm
knocking out three videos a day and I've
been doing that for a while you know
what I mean so it's like I'm doing a lot
of work but in the long term it pays off
in the long term it's paying off because
everything the way how I calculate
things is everything if I do I file
taking things to the next level right
and do three four videos a day right
basically those videos that are making
now our long-term videos meaning
questions that are answering for people
since our gonna be asked a year two
years from now so when those videos
people search for a is like passive
income so it's like ah I really busted
my my ass off this whole nine months
well it's thinking in the long term like
hey I want to do this because I want to
spend more time with my family and I
need to have that passive income like I
don't need to earn a hundred thousand no
more like already I put down that
checklist I'm like okay I got to 140 you
know I checked that off and say okay
cool I got to that point I could show it
off you know yeah I was at some point I
made that much now say who cares it's
not making me happy to do that
so what I'm gonna do now is help out
other people so even if now from my
calculations will be a total of like 60
K now I'm gonna make I'm fine because
isn't something I could live off and I'm
still happy you know what I mean
and my family's gonna be more happier
because I'm gonna give him a hard time
and I'm gonna do what you're doing
waking up by 4:30 I want to wake up like
a five six o'clock in the morning you're
not the 4:30 man said sometimes like I
was hired I am sleeping in I'm just like
five five five is five I wanna go like 5
6 o'clock so I could finish everything
by 2:00 p.m. and then just give that
whole term to family died the awesome
you know so that's what I want to do you
know but it was hard it was definitely
hard doing all this stuff you know and
still trying to learn I'm still trying
to learn go like people don't even know
like I'm I'm still taking a whole bunch
of courses on goldang and I really want
to learn it and on top of that I want to
learn how to make video games so it's
like I'm doing a whole bunch of stuff -
it's like I'm constantly learning you
know by the way they there is this
engine call gold I go check it out man
it's legit it's easy to learn if you
like Python the is basically is G
scripts that's the the programming
language but it's super easy there's a
couple of good youtubers here on on
YouTube that they're making videos for
it maybe I'm gonna bring them onto to
this channel pretty soon but if you guys
are into like
create video games just trying it out
because in reality is all programming
you know the only thing that sucks is
getting the acids like because you got
to draw yourself and all of that but do
you do any uh any uh web-based games or
these like native games I've done um
web-based wave what's the name of this
engine that was paper
oh no that's what's the name I hate when
I freaking blank out cuz I'm hungry
[Laughter]
phase phase i yeah i believe is phase
that's the name of the engine html5 Oh
phaser dial muffled yeah yeah you said
what um with the socket I have to make a
multiplayer video games
oh no WebEx yeah no try those those are
pretty cool you should definitely check
out look gregory check out our golden
and try to build flappy bird you'll
learn everything on it like the whole
engine is super easy for those of you
guys that have tried or unity3d
listen this thing it's not a unity is so
easy for you to learn cuz if you know
how to program you good
all you need is to know how to program
and then you're good
everything else is easy for you yeah i
played around with this a I don't know
if you ever heard of Supreme Court uh a
frank which is like like a virtual
reality uh framework for the way you
know and they use yeah uses a like so
you know who has thought like those cool
guy who thinks a little cardboard or
whatever hololens ting yeah you can use
that in you know we just you know
JavaScript API and you can make the
actual 3d models in the browser like
when you install the it comes with all
that so you like animate it has a
timeline and you know what's the name of
it called a frame API oh this is this
yeah you it can make little virtual
reality games and that's pretty cool
that's not I'm gonna get into let's get
some of it ain't $15 of Google cardboard
first time I Google cardboard I can't
find it surround ya have to look up but
I was gonna order one uh what's the
quality I mean like it's it's like a
really good way of like just kind of
getting introduced to VR um like I
haven't tried like an oculus or anything
but from what I hear it's like you know
nothing comparison to like an oculus or
whatever but for what it is like I mean
it's your phone and a piece of glass
it's it's pretty good and then like
there's um there's a ton of like apps
with videos like people have made like
like five-minute animated shorts or
videos and stuff and those like are
pretty boss to like actually look inside
there yeah you put on dude so for like
there's there's one where like
essentially like you put on like decent
headphones you can't hear anything you
put on the VR you kind of forget it some
stuff you know like I had a train coming
towards me and I'm like oh this is this
is VR but I got a headset on I'm in the
zone I'm like okay this is you know I
gotta look away so give it a try it's
high bucks
you know yeah w-well yeah man I think we
bout to call it a day we've been here
for like two hours and a half we had a
good conversation yeah yeah definitely
yoke Asadero coming through yeah you
know Casa Dara got the whole setup and
you got over there looking at the real
Mike
now the real set up you know I'm over
here with the the hoop I will be here
with the hooptie like hey man
times it's art we can't afford you know
shades we just like well maybe the most
exciting part about all of this is where
we're gonna be in in two three four or
five years man that's that's the coolest
part be it surrounded by people who are
like really passionate about this stuff
yeah three videos a day you 6,000
subscribers I'm coming to New York Joe
is gonna have a whole studio set up
right looking like it's like like Mark
Brown that's exactly what I want to do
sir like that's exactly what I want to
do I'm looking into you know of course
right now finances wise is not smart for
me to do it because it's like I have to
spend at least six thousand dollars and
I don't want to spend $6,000 right now
until I with him until I figure out
everything this is like I will have to
go in rent the spot and definitely I
want to buy like cool furniture but a
good lighting
you know like set up a nice setup
something legit but do it in a few
months
like once I I basically set everything
up here cuz another thing too is like
people don't even know I'm moving from
here from where I'm at in like by
January and I don't know if I must stay
in New York well I'm gonna move to
another state is like in December we
will find out where Joe goes it's like
right now all the states is like hey man
we trying to pick that number one draft
pick where is Joe going
California a Seattle rizona that's what
I really want to go to cuz number one is
so cheap out there like my whole idea is
I want to work one day of the week right
and then be able to pay every single
bill that I have so then everything else
I could just focus for the rest of the
week on cool things that I want to do
right I'm not looking to be like yo hey
I want to become a millionaire because
I've seen I feel like I've got into
situations where I could have made a lot
of money and I just I didn't want to so
then it's like what's gonna be my
motivation for the next five years every
five years I reinvent myself so this now
I feel like the time is ticking now now
I was like what am I gonna do for the
next five years so that's why I'm just
gonna make courses release courses
online and you know it's like put push
it in the hands of God you know it
sounds corny but just like you let God
do what he gotta do you know what I mean
like you do what you gotta do like God
you got me you know whatever he wants to
do let it just be be out there it's like
that song was a jesus takes the wheel
under yo going a hundred I'm going a
hundred miles per hour right now I'm
like yo Jesus hold that down take that
 is like this you know what I mean
so let's see what happens you know I was
like two three years I never thought I'd
be in this situation right now you know
I thought I was gonna be like you know
like freaking I could have been working
on some BS job doing IT like I thought
that when I graduated from school I was
gonna be end up working in a bank
cuz I connecting servers and connecting
a whole bunch of and like now I'm
like man this is like nowhere near too
that of what I do I was gonna be doing
by now it's like right now I'm doing
something completely different and I go
all going in a circle like I wanted to
teach from the beginning and it's like
I'm going back to the roots it's like I
went into the roots of I first I wanted
to do websites and then I did that and
then now somehow is coming back around
so when I wanted to do teaching and now
I'm teaching people and it's crazy like
I'm looking at my my stats like I'm
looking at my stats this on today two
hundred and seventy something people
what's on my website learning for me all
right things that I feel like five years
ago I was like man this thing's so hard
but now I'm teaching it I'm like go I I
basically found the the shortcuts in the
easier way for you to learn this so
learn it this way you know what I mean
and of course like what I tell people
what you learn from me is basically your
starter kit so get you out here get you
working now this is just the beginning
once you get the job now you gotta work
on whatever stack they working on you
got to follow whatever they they using
it's like you like Chris is working on
unless you know if like he goes in and
builds everything in sass but still when
he gets to that job he's still got to
learn whatever they have it's not really
up to up to him it's like you never stop
learning is like also to me you know
yeah I'll be I'm in PowerShell
I'll do my job is nothing but PowerShell
bro and I'm like really in great great
shape
a lot of a lot of women a lot of really
like next level whatever
man so it's all it's all PowerShell all
day and I mean these these cats do
things a PowerShell that just had me
like whoa like get the hell out of here
in the syntax is all crazy bro use the
equal sign you like eq is short for
equal this like black magic bro I'm
working with a bunch of I'm working with
a bunch of over there
freak it and now I'm getting in the sass
and then I'm doing this stuff with
Jacqueline a template engine so it's
always learning and I mean you know you
know when people got it but that's why I
say like man don't be don't look at Joe
or me or whoever Christian and be like I
want to be like that guy may not be be
like you like what is it that you want
to do like Joe and you like I want to
teach bro and the best way to teach us
to go learn it Asian you know how to do
it and if people ain't coming into
office at $39 does this thing and he
brings it to us yes best to keep met but
I mean like I'll do like the same thing
I don't think it's probably the same for
all of us bye
you got your thing popping in you're
coming home you learn and go I got my
thing popping I'm coming home and I'm
really focus on on JavaScript in the end
I'm sure Christopher's got his like his
pet project man it is it I mean that's
this is all you guys out there who are
watching it right right just cuz you
work just cause you work at a spot right
there you got it you got to do with two
ways man you got to think like there's a
micro and there's the macro the macro is
like you're on the job you want to be
you want to be the dude like you want to
be good at your job you want to be if
you can't be the first one there you
want to be on time like cats need to fly
look that dude is never late
yeah they need like they do never leaves
early then were you like I gotta leave
early nobody says anything Kyle still
like yo it must be important this dude
right he be like ain't gonna even ask
more questions say he gotta leave early
there something's going down
[Laughter]
at night you just got to go home and you
just gotta build it you just got it
whatever whatever they think is you
gotta build it and hopefully at some
point you arrive at a place like I was
very fortunate I'm in a place where
these things just sort of fit together
for me I'll be watching these dudes do
all this crazy PowerShell kung fu all
day and then I'm like oh I've been
trying to figure this on javascript for
forever right like maybe if I try this
method that he used to do this thing
like you know you know and you get
results from that kind of thing so
hopefully experiment today place where
like if you know if you know you want to
be a developer right now you're
delivering pizzas that the goal the goal
is to be the best delete pizza delivery
person you can be when you're delivering
pizzas and then they're not you're
working that other thing and and you try
to put these things together over time
like maybe you get out of the pizza
delivery business and get into something
that's a little more related to code
yeah and I think that's the ultimate
thing and Joe's which that I've reached
it I mean my man's out in Detroit he's
definitely there right
so but yeah that's I like that you
brought that up I like that you brought
that up man it's like are you your and I
mean it wouldn't it's not about the
money right it's about the lifestyle
yeah like are you happy living the life
you live and to get to that place like
you never know what you don't know right
so as long as you're learning new stuff
then then things they tend to get they
just came to get better man they just if
they just get better interview only dude
