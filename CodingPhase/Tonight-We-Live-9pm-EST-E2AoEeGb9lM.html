time is like there's like my gift to my
subscribers like I know people's gonna
find me on on on you to me they're gonna
find me on Google they're gonna find
Ellie right but this is my gift to my
subscribers right making sure that they

people here who will have been here
since I had ten people on my subscribers
right like you know what I mean like how
would I look like not taking care of
them you know me and it's like everybody
who's here
you guys start seeing what I'm doing you
guys seeing that I'm about to take this
to the next level I'm literally about to
be the biggest youtuber on this platform
like when it comes to web development
literally so you know I'm about to take
it to like a really next level I'm going
to meetups I'm going to to conferences
you know nexium I go to f/8 you know
next year I go to the Apple conference
I'm going through everything all right
so I'm taking this on a whole different
level where it's like okay now we gotta
really take it up a notch you know what
I mean like people already know me in
the industry but now they really gonna
know who the hell I am in this industry
right I'm just gonna kill the game man
you know it's not even to be like you
know I want to become popular I want to
become cool I want to be you know part
of the community know I want to
basically when people see me see
diversity see other people like them in
the community I want to inspire kids in
high school be like you know what you
don't have to be
you know superstar you don't have to be
a rapper you don't have to be a how you
call as a ballplayer listen you can make
as much money as a ballplayer doing
technology you could create an
application that's gonna take you and
make you more money than most of all
please because most ballplayers they
make a lot of money and in three years
they broke you know what I mean because
they don't have they don't even have the
right education on how to invest money
or how to take care of themselves you
know what I mean but this is actually a
very good Avenue for people to be in you
know so that's the idea behind this
that's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna do
that's what I'm about to do about to
just you know take it to the next level
kids you know but like I said man so
take advantage the people that sign up
now you're just like part of a group of
people who are here for since the
beginning you know what I mean so take
advantage sign up show love to your boy
you know it's like one of those
situations like you know it's like when
you listen to an artist right and you're
like man I like his music and I like him
now right but you know he's about to
blow up you know what I mean
that's the stage where I'm at right now
like I'm literally about to blow up like
I'm really about to just take it to the
next level and it's like you guys are
part of a community that are pretty much
like the first people I found me you
know everybody else that finds me after
this after this Murph is more like oh
they found me because of XYZ they found
me from advertising to find me from
there from people that you know told
them about me but you guys found me
organically you know there's something
to be proud of something to say hey man
we know this guy from day one
you know so that's why I'm saying man
like I'm here to really take care of you
guys man if one man is like oh snap we

gonna be on those two days 9:00 p.m.
Fridays or Sundays so today I'm doing it
on Friday that's why I'm here to let you
guys know because I know you guys get
the little notification which lets you
guys know like hey Joe is live right now
right coding face.com I'm super excited
kids man you don't even know because
it's like you know what it is like you
basically live in your dream and at the
same time you helping other peoples and
then I just have you know I just had a
kid like I can't enjoy my care now like
you know the whole first month I I
didn't even get to see my and my son I
was working so much and like the past
two three months have been like crazy
like me constantly going to work every
single day staying in lay being stressed
out like literally I got a whole bunch
of white hairs I never had this one when
I was before I started working in this
other place man like I was really
stressed out like I needed to get out of
there as soon as possible
I definitely was not for me you know
what I mean like well we back right now
kids you know that's why I tell you guys
man always have an exit plan always have
savings always invest your money because
whenever you want to leave a job you
shouldn't be attached to it you
shouldn't be stuck to that job you
shouldn't be like oh man
if I leave this job I'm not gonna eat
tomorrow if I leave this job how am I
gonna pay the rent at the end of the
month you should never be in that
situation you should always have a year
two years
worth of whatever your rent is on your
bank account at all times and that's why
I tell you guys a lot of you guys
probably can't do that right now because
the jobs are you working on they're not
paying you anything you're not making no
money there's no future there as I'll
tell you guys go to my website learn web
development take it to the next level
you see what it's done for me you see
how I've basically built what I've built
they come I'm building an empire right
now you know I mean like this is about
to take to the next level you know I was
like one of those moments was like you
know somebody about to you know blow of
love it's like man I know this guy
that's where I'm at right now man who
knows like we up their kids you know
this house is so cute man I need a house
like that like a house like in the
middle of nowhere where nobody travels

okay there you go yeah made it where you
know the dangers of live stream while
you drive
I'm gonna put in that gasps kids
full brains like I thought you had an
accident nah man I'm careful careful
hold on we're into everybody's comments
make sure you leave a comment give this
a light for sure I'm doing it tonight
I'm doing it every day you guys haven't
I mean who here has completed all the
videos from that react course I don't
think nobody has complete an audience
it sounds like each video is like 20
minutes some videos are half an hour
this is a video that's an hour so you
know reality a lot of people haven't
even finished it
they're not up to the end of the portion
and I mean of course the course of
course the course doesn't have a head
because we still gotta finish a whole
bunch of different projects and I'll
tell you guys in the beginning this is a
long course it's not like a course that
you go in and be like I know when you
guys took down the web developer boot
camp from cold steel think about it like
that how long is that for it's like 40
hours you know how long it's gonna take
to build it probably 80 because for
every hour there's like you gotta edit
things you gotta rerecord and there's so
many things to happen you guys don't get
to see behind the scenes but basically
if you follow along where we saw signed
up for the website has been the react
course I'm pretty sure you guys have not
gone to the anything so when I when I go
in today and I add another five hours to
the course and I I'm pretty sure a lot
of you guys
except for a while
because the world masa dough is it
better to have a knife site as a project
or personal project but you can get it
done faster and start working in the
next part I'm lost I'm lost on on your
question that no filler in your book
every time I get in my car I'll get out
of my car like it feels good like this
car is expensive but it's the best thing
that I did because I'm happy every
single time I get in this car man like I
feel like a human being you know like I
feel good my other lo Nissan that I had
I just felt like a worker
you feel like a worker like like I
wasn't gonna do anything like I was
working for no reason you know I'm
working so hard and I'm still driving a
little BS Nissan Rogue
I like moon F that I need you know if
life is not about about you know
material things custom or material
things that you get the more difficult
your life becomes but sometimes you got
to give yourself awards man trust me
guys you gotta give you some something
you can't just work and work and work
and work and work and not have nothing
to show for or you know I got seized up
some people that be like man they are
you know like I've known people right
they're so cheap
oh I have my
thank
bro you look like a bum you driving a
bumps car are you freaking you know who
are you saving that money for you know
what I mean like you're gonna die
someday
and then you're not even gonna live your
life you didn't go to no vacations you
didn't buy yourself something nice ever
like sometimes you just got to give
yourself good things man and material
things don't buy happiness especially in
this world but at the same time it's
like you work hard why wouldn't you give
yourself something like what for to say
like oh you know I'm saving money all
the time like nah man you gotta you
gotta save money but at the same time
you have to give yourself something you
can't be out here in this world and you
know god forbid you die and then that's
it what was the point of that you know
what I mean like now who gets to enjoy
all your hard work
Jerome was like Joel's flexing nah man
flexing is give me a year two years
that's gonna be flexing right now it's
just humble this very humble Joe right
now and you know it's just it feels good
you know what I mean you know I'm
basically paying like 800 bucks a month
which to me is a lot I don't know for
some of you guys might think my old man
you guys a lot of money who has doesn't
die he say he wanted to listen to listen
when you come from the bottom a hundred
dollars is a lot you know what I mean
like I never forget that I never forget
like how long it took me to get a
hundred dollars when I used to work and
Ian you know I freaking our money
exchange right I used to work in the
more right full-time and somehow come
out after taxes come out with like $300
after a whole week several hundred
dollars after two weeks so that means my
check per week was $350 that's crazy
no human being should be working for
that little amount of money because
nobody's gonna give you time this the
thing that people don't understand man
and that's why I get pissed off
sometimes at different jobs and
different people like who's gonna return
me back my time you know what I mean
like I'm here living tomorrow I'll be 40
50 years old let's say if I was a
statement in a company forever
who's that I return me that time you
know what I mean like who's gonna give
me those those years all right those
years of my youth of me being able to
you know see my family hey now it's like
my son was just born and I'm thinking
about him like young my sister passed
away in December
I haven't gotten no vacation I haven't
relaxed
I haven't taken some time off my son is
born and I came and enjoy my son like
who's going to you know who's gonna pay
me for that time when I think about him
like you know nobody's gonna pay me for
that time you know what I mean like
who's gonna return me those moments
those memories that my son is like you
know my son law says how you call it his
umbilical cord I wasn't even there I
didn't even get to see that I didn't
even get to see you know when when they
dropped or or anything that's the same
thing they're like if if the baby was to
have his first steps and I'm I'm on some
some freaking company 24/7 is like who's
gonna return me at that time you know
what I mean like who's gonna give me
those moments nobody alright so those
are the things that I think about now
I'm like I gotta enjoy myself in this
world and there's no matter what like
nobody nobody's gonna care you know
saying I was like thinking the last time
I was at work I was like yo like I was
getting like really bad neck pains and
like really bad headaches and I'm
thinking in my head I'm like yo I'm
getting so stressed down in this place
what if I just come and just get like a
high call it's a stroke or something
like something happens to me this
company continues no matter what why am
I getting stressed out for something
that's not even mine's like right now if
I get stressed out about my own business
Coenen face.com
then yeah I'll get stressed out but
that's mine you know what I mean like
something happens to me
I get sick something happens to me that
happens to me because I was working or
something that was mine I was living my
dream but for me to come in and just
like guess say things like that happens
all the time guys you know how many
people go in and they
like heart attacks and strokes and stuff
like that things like that happens you
know we're not getting younger you know
what I mean
one of my uncle's he got he got a stroke
at the age of 29 so it's like it's it's
in my family you know what I mean so I
was like thinking about like you know
why am I getting my son so worked up for
something that's not even mine's like
God who cares if people don't do their
work professionally who cares if people
are you know messing around about the
job like I take things seriously when
I'm working on something I want
something everything to be perfect and
sometimes that's why you gotta always
make sure to know who you work with and
what company you work on like because if
they're not the same level as you and
everybody just messes around then next
thing you know you're like you're
working double the amount that everybody
else is working and you're the only one
that that really cares about it now I'm
just like enjoying my life and there's
my gold man my goal is not to become a
millionaire my goal is not to accumulate
a whole bunch of BS material things my
goal is to give as much time as I can to
other people people that I love you know
my family give it to you guys like
believe it or not like
yep and believe it or not sorry you guys
I'm sorry I gotta curse them believe it
or not like I love you guys like every

like oh you know there's a PS channel I
don't care you know I'm not there for
them I'm there for the person that's
gonna watch this you know having a
really bad day already messed up time in
their lives and then I kill I need to
get out of here I was like that before
you know I was in that situation I was a
really bad situation like guys I went to
school and literally the only thing I
had was two dollars to my name right and
I'm stuck in New York City in New York
right and in my hand and I couldn't even
get back home I had to be asking people
for hey can you give me a swipe me in on
the train can you give me you know two
dollars to get back on back to Queens
I've been in situations like that like
really shitty situations guys really bad
situation where I'm like I'm never going
back to that
you know what I made a song that's why I
bought all of you guys get out of
whatever situation you're in you could
be in a really bad job and you're not
happy there leave that job you know but
of course you can't leave you because
then you're gonna be without no money
but if you prepare yourself you take a
few months before you leave your job and
be like yo get yourself ready do your
portfolio get on you you know get on
your career here guys you know this is
fun I'm done you know this is fun like
what development school programming is
cool you know the community the people
that that do programming are also cool
you know that man so that's why I do
this for you guys for you guys to really
go hard you know you gotta save me I see
me I'm going hard right now I'm going
all out for him and not don't worry
about you know a little tear
came out whatever who cares you know
it's my sister I don't care you know
what I mean like I love my sister me
muscles needs to you know support each
other we used to fight we used to fist
fight like we used to really fight each
other when we was little was like you
can't I feel like that was like my my
partner in crime you know what I mean I
was like my little Robin I'm like Batman
she robbed me you know what I mean so
it's just crazy
she's like whenever I talk about her I
guess that you know if I start talking
about that's why I keep myself so busy
you know when I I started doing all this
stuff I was like I was thinking about
doing my own YouTube in July 2016 and I
was like I'm not gonna do it that's
corny you know what the hell am I gonna
be doing like you know showing my face
looking super nerdy like That's not me
you know what I mean so then I didn't do
it I didn't do the channel then December
came and I was like I've got a really
small video so at the end of November I
released a video which was becoming was
a why become a developer in 2017
so I did that right then my sister
passed away and then I was like man I
gotta keep myself busy because you see
how I just got right now that's how it
was like the whole month right and then
what I said so you know what I can't
just stay here be upset every single
time
that's a things happen you know it's a
sad story that's it you know but at the
end of the day I can make something out
of this I can make something positive
and share my story of other people's and
help other people's and then keep myself
busy because when I'm busy I don't think
about none of that stuff you know what I
mean I people send me messages oh man
Joe I can't believe you you doing so
many videos I don't know how you know I
came and keep up with all your videos
and this and that like I have so many
other youtubers that any of that they
see what I'm doing but you know it's
like the reason why I keep myself busy
it's cuz I sort of like block everything
that happened in the beginning of the
year when I'm just busy the moments when
I'm not doing anything then I start
thinking about my sister start thinking
about everything and you know so it's
like I just try to stay busy you know
when I'm busy I'm creating videos I'm
doing stuff for you guys I'm busy I
don't even have time to think and
anything else other than cold so for me
code is like it's therapeutic I get to
just like forget about things
you know cold is my my drug my drug of
choice people ask me oh man you don't do
you know you know you don't smoke you
don't drink about nah man
what for like I'm already high on life
as corny as that sounds like I'm already
high like you know I'm doing so much
stuff that that keeps me motivated keeps
me high all the time so it is what it is
you know what I mean you know no
lighting is big guys I'm over here I'm
just driving right now I'm closer to the
store where I need to go to but I'm
looking at this thing I'm like yo I've
been driving for like 20 30 minutes and
like this freakin town of Carmack is
huge and they got a whole bunch of
bunghole bunch of of balls over here
like this is crazy
