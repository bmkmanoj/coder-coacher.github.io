back at it again
coach calm your boys back out here
people ask me like you know where the
hell you been at Joe's been like what
like a day two days no new videos you
know how to things be my view is be
there like you know what a you up
I'm good guys I'm just sick man
cuz I had to you know shovel the car out
the snow and do a whole bunch of I
guess that got me sick or something
I don't know I just feel down for some
reason like I mean I'm not like
depressed but just like out of
breath in my tired I haven't
been able to speak that much I've only
began like four hours of sleep and then
on top of I'm too late
of course I'm doing also
now they are doing the course I'm doing
this new podcasting I'm doing so much
things plus I got a full-time job and
this week we're rolling out a brand new
website is like this stressful
so it's like I'm doing a lot of sick man
so I'm just trying to figure out how to
cut you know come up with new videos I
have this new video which is gonna be
about my story which is gonna be very
well made which is my story of how I
became a web developer so it's gonna
call it's gonna be called my timeline as
a developer and I'm gonna go over
everything from like me being you know
in junior high school and creating
little websites for Dragonball
Z you say so you know so now and also
guys I have this new this new thing I
think it's called get er where pretty
much all of you guys can go join if you
have a github and pretty much we cool
chat at the same time because you know
people been asking for this they're like
oh can you create a swag can you create
a what's the other one for that but
create like a slag where all of us could
go actually chat not only can we chat
only on the
five videos but we wanna have a place
where we could chat while you still bake
: face car
and pretty much I created this thing
called get er so I think is get er that
I am and then search coding face.com
just like that coding face and then do T
CEO web search for that or go on github
research coding face.com
and you will see it I'm going to put it
on the live website and Conan face calm
I'm gonna put it there too when I got a
chance today once I get home but also
check on the description I will put the
link there so you guys can actually go
and check it out but yeah man I just
been feeling sick from the past two days
I don't know
like I need to get some sleep
doing all this work like people things I
know these guys come on YouTube we talk
 on YouTube like this takes
work
I'm doing like three three to four hours
every single day after work and then
like - I guess that is getting you
know taking a toll on me or something
because I'm tired I do a
full-time job and then on top of that
doing you too
doing a podcast and doing the social
media thing
creating my own udemy course only sick
man that is killing me
right now like I'm trying to figure it
out I might have to drop you know three
videos a week instead of me doing it
half and doing it with a video every
single day just because I'm getting
really tired like I need to take some
breathe like it would be different if
you know if you guys was to support me
and help me out and you know put a
dollar for every single person here and
they were to put a dollar on patreon
like man I will be able to do this shift
full-time straight up because I got
thousands and thousands of people that
watch my videos but it will be crazy if
you know if all of you guys can put a
dollar on the patreon then I can
quit this job like I love my job
but at the same time I really love
YouTube and I hope a year from now two
years from now maybe three years from
now I'm pushing it I could actually do
this thing full-time I mean I'm I'm in
no rush because think about it um I'm
actually on my why I started this summer
since December till now how many months
is that on our like four months three
months four months so the channels I
should have been growing been doing
pretty well so I think that would be
really good and stuff you know
especially if I get the opportunity to
work full-time on you to like you guys
don't know all the content that I will
be able to put it man like I really have
a lot of ideas I want to go to like the
hood and like the real hoods out here
like all over the United States and
pretty much go talk to people and be
like y'all listen man
instead of you being here on this corner
selling drugs so be in this corner doing
this and that like how about you get you
know into the program man learn you know
learn programming and learn the new ways
of where technology is going you know
like that's what I really want to do and
then on top of that like I would like to
interview people like in the streets
just ask them questions about being up
you know what do they know about
programming what do they know about
programmers are they interested on it
all of that stuff I want to do it but in
reality can I do it with all the things
that I have going on no the only way
that I will be able to do everything
that I want to do for this channel would
be if I was to do it full-time
I mean that's the goal so hopefully in a
year or two I could do it but let's see
man is crazy I'm so tired
man I want to go to sleep my chest hurts
I only got maybe four or five hours of
sleep last night and I'm tired I don't
want to be at work right now because I
didn't get no sleep yeah man I'm just
keeping you guys updated man yeah I
wanted to know where I'm at well here I
am doing my thing listen guys make sure
you subscribe make sure you like this
video make sure that you know you check
out the courses below the courses that
made me into web developer and also
man signed up for the getter man sign up
for a foot github and then go to the
chatroom man I want to see you guys on
it because also too you could download
that I think they have an app for it so
we could all actually chat and yeah I
could reach out to me through the air
instantaneously that's like sending me a
text directly because I have it straight
on my phone so I was like if you send me
a message through there or if you are on
chatting about something a subject or a
topic whatever I'm going to answer back
to there and it's gonna be it's
gonna be so hot man super cool and yeah
pilot your boy man codify comm is still
coming I'm working on it it's just now I
just gotta see how I gotta balance
