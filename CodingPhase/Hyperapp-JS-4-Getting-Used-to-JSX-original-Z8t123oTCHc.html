want you to get comfortable because
right now what we're going to build this
a little quick counter so we could have
an idea how to play around with JSX
so first thing that we're gonna do is
we're going to create a function right
and we're gonna create a function and
we're gonna call this let's say let's
say header right let's say header right
and then in here we're going to return
HTML so we're gonna say div and then
we're gonna say class name equals tool
let's say like that let's use this
better class name equals the header and
then here we're gonna do a div and then
we're gonna say something like this like
you'll see counter right okay sound of a
we're gonna put in a h1
okay we got a counter there alright now
let's make this capitalized I usually
like to make my components and two
capitalized so we're gonna do that
function header so down here what we're
going to do is we're gonna say header
and then self-closing as you can see
well that day was I created that element
all right technically this right here is
a component so I want you guys to get
used to that idea of creating components
and just breaking things down into
sections alright so you're gonna have
two header
all right we're gonna create another one
which is going to be let's say let's say
content area content area okay save that
and as you can see it basically created
the other one which is the counter area
so for this we're gonna say here a
number let's put the number zero all
right and then now we're actually gonna
make this a little bit smaller h3 okay
that's fine and then we're going to
create a buttons component alright so
you're gonna see buttons area I mean of
course like I said you can name this
whatever you want but whenever you going
to place that component somewhere inside
your your app alright you're going to
basically name it exactly how it is so
you have this one so now you see buttons
area you gotta always close the tag no
matter what you can't leave this like
that because then I'll give you some
error automatically it disconnected
because it gave us some errors you see
cannot handle that all right so it got a
half a closing tag either like this like
a div and what a div with a closing tag
or you know a self closing tag like that
let's do it mpro and watch ok refresh
this ok cool so here we're gonna name
this but in area 5 area this one we're
gonna say content area and I'm doing
this just for the hell of it is because
I like to have things organized alright
so here we want to create two buttons
we're gonna say div class name and as
you can see we're not using class I'm
saying class name
so in JSX you can't say class cuz the
keyword class means class so if I was to
go like this class automatically it's
talking about a JavaScript class but
what we want is a class name basically
just to give a class to this element
alright so let's do this let's say div
all right now I'm noting that we want to
do here is we're gonna say something
like this it's gonna say - so say like
that and then copy this again say plus
alright cool so as you can see we have
those elements there now what we want to
do is we want to style this up we're
gonna come here on the main all this
stuff is it's not needed at all we could
just pretty much delete all of this
stuff here
keep the h1 it's fine so let's say for
this we're gonna say was a buttons area
we're going to make that padding let's
say 20 pixels on top and 15 pixels on
each side
all right let's say content area gonna
say text-align:center
alright put in the center here we're
gonna say - and then plus we're going to
say display:inline-block okay and then
what we're going to do is we're gonna
come here and say make this padding 20
pixels background black color white
all right margin let's say 10 pixels and
20 pixels all right now let's see what
else let's see for what was that like an
H 4 H 3 and I remember H 3 you're gonna
say fun size
say 30 pixels okay we also gonna say
text-align:center for this we're gonna
say text-align:center
all right so right now we got a little
counter now for this we're gonna say
something like and hover so whenever we
hover on any of these tools buttons
we're gonna make the background let's
say like blues okay and then let's say
cursor:pointer and then now we good all
right that's fine that's a quick quick
little thing
look counter and this gift is a class
name of let's say counter route usually
like to write it like that like a string
counter routes ok counter routes now
let's eat counter oops and then let's
take all of this and put inside of it
now this we're gonna say margin:0 auto
and then we're gonna say matter-of-fact
put this 25 pixels you're gonna say what
else we gotta make this with 500 pixels
and then save that okay there you go so
now this counter Center and we should be
good all right let me see let me make
sure yeah everything is good this Center
that's fine
or let me see if maybe I could just use
say 50% of with yeah that's better
all right now this just for us to mess
around with JSX and get used to the idea
of writing HTML inside of JavaScript
some people hate it
some people love it but it's very simple
guys it's like if you're working in
JavaScript to me personally I'd rather
be working in a JavaScript file then
instead of jumping from a template file
which is HTML and then jump into CSS and
then jump into back to JavaScript like I
rather just do it everything here on one
single file all right now like I said as
you can see these are all components
right start getting used to the idea of
components and how things work all right
just get used to the idea of writing
components for all your application
especially when you're working in the
front end because they're very reusable
you know right now none of these
components I would say are reusable but
let's say if you want to create a
certain button a certain type of button
or certain type of form like let's say a
form that you're gonna use in the front
front end or in the back end like you
who use the same components over and
over again and you don't have to recode
everything you know just do it one time
and then you should be good all right so
get used to the idea all right
and like I said you know right here
we're using this type of function but we
can also just come here and make it like
a arrow function where we would just go
like this
take this and then put this little arrow
here right and that will make it into a
you know a arrow function you know so
I'm gonna make all of them into our
functions because you know we're in 2017
kids you should get used to this idea
especially if it's different if you're
using like vanilla JavaScript and
something like jQuery and you're not
going to compile it through wet pack or
anything but since we already have
everything set up for us then why not
use it why not use es6 all right guys so
now also what we want to do is we want
to declare this variables and we're
gonna say const header equals to the
function all right so we're gonna copy
this down oops
paste is here taste is here and we're
gonna say it's equal to all right now
this will fix the error that we had
that's why I stopped refresh and
everything should be fine all right so
now you're good this how you do arrow
functions I said this is the same thing
if we come here and we want to say
something like var buttons area equals
to function and then we come here like
that all right so that's what we have
here is right here all right I'll see
you guys on the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
