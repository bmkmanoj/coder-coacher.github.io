I'm always promoting it and like
literally it's funny I get about 300
unique users and unique users unique
visitors sorry alright unique visitors
every day on my my website but my
website is not up yet it's like there's
a preview it's still coming up is like
it's getting there but I haven't had the
time to sit down and finish the whole

starts putting me you know puts my
videos below everybody else so it's like
you have to be consistent you always got
to throw a new video every day for
YouTube to actually show you love and
and let people watch your your videos
you know so so it's like if I go our
Creator start working just on coding

that's weird
now if they change the extensions that
it must be something else I gotta I
gotta check it out your ride take care
man
have a good night Oh David Bastille said
was I born in the US and no I was born
in Dominican Republic back in the
motherland so it's a little island and
the Atlantic Ocean you know where it's a
whole bunch of people mixed where
there's you know like me I'm like I'm
light-skinned but I'm still black you
know what I mean so it's a lot of
mixtures man is this white people will
mix with black people and then they make
a beautiful country right and then
there's white people or light-skinned
people like me that they're black what
it counts you know what I mean so I'll
leave you with that I'm black you didn't
know it I'm half black man yeah my
girlfriend tells me the same thing she's
like how are you black only I'm half
black like
it's just a mixture it's just like
things that came out a little bit like
it's like my son my son is gonna be as
far as ethnicity right and race he's
gonna be black white and Asian right so
let's see how he comes out that's gonna
be a crazy mix that little baby is gonna
be a little lighter you know he's like a
super mix oh man y'all really want me to
start giving you guys stories man yo my
god I gotta do it on my own channel I
can't do it here and calling face cuz my
stories are too crazy it's a wild man
Oh sick girl okay huh what up
can I do a firebase back-end with nodejs
I mean if you're doing it I don't think
it makes sense to use firebase right if
you're already using note because note
is a back-end all right as a back-end
framework right it's JavaScript and then
whatever right use for the backend now
if you're already using node there's no
point of view using firebase you know
like firebase is good like let's say if
you have a full application right and
you created the phone application and
you need to connect to a back-end then
you will use something like firebase to
connect to it now something else that
you can do let's say an example you have
you could you just did your page write
in HTML CSS and JavaScript but you still
want to save the the users data but you
don't want to have your own back-end
programming language or your back-end
framework right so what you do is you
connect to for from to firebase that's
how it is but but yeah man okay whenever
I take a little post is because I'm
reading I'm reading the comments I'm
reading the messages by the way because
I know people is gonna watch this like
later on and they're gonna be like why
is he staying quiet I don't know where
because people I'm sorry but there's
people that don't know they really think
that when they see me here like this
with this this view of the falle of you
whatever like from here was it from here
so they really think that this shit I'm
recording it in a camera they're like oh
my god he has two worst phone he has the
worst thing it was like bro I'm doing
this live right so imagine you doing
like a Facebook live but I'm actually
doing a YouTube live right so it's just
live man so that's why
comes out that's why sometimes I stay
quiet because I'm actually reading the
comments that people put on the live
version right now also guys listen I
need you guys to if you're using or
you're taking the debate story tutorial
I need you guys to give the web
developer or starter kit the 2018 one
give it a start
because that's how I know who's actually
doing tutorials alright so and I need to
keep track of that because it's like
this is like the tutorials take me the
longest like a one video tutorial could
take me I don't know 30 minutes and then
editing it or I have to restart it again
or I miss something I have to redo it
again sometimes it takes and now we're
two hours to do one video a little video
that you guys see for 20 minutes it
could take an hour right so my point is
I want to know the statistics of who's
actually watching the tutorials because
if like nobody watches the tutorials I'm
not gonna do tutorials you know cuz I
know people love it when I come here and
come talk to you guys live and hang out
with you guys I know people love that
shit but it's like if nobody likes the
tutorials I'm not gonna do you know so
make sure on the repo on the github go
to github.com slash coding face d-o-t
CEO a.m. so it's coding face.com
right and then from there the start
but developer started kit 2018
I don't know why I needed that I should
have just named it I started kid 2018 or
something
oh boy you go in there click it give it
a start so I can know who actually
watches it all right
why because firebase cause money most
people don't use firebase unless like
they need to firebase can get very
expensive you know so it's like let's
say if you if you decide to get your own
server right from Amazon right you could
get an amazing server for let's say 60
bucks a month right same data that you
could you're gonna save in that server
is got in firebase because the idea of
firebase you
there's you know and getting data so
technically that's why the you basically
paying a premium to not be able to to
mess around with it you know
pirate tablet say hey can you do some
Tori's about Piper not Django Python
thanks have a great day
oh yeah I could do some little Python
tutorials but that's not my thing I
don't know who watches Python tutorials
I don't know if that's that's like a big
thing I mean I could do a little series
for you guys if you guys want me to
that'll be easy
um but yeah I could do that shouldn't be
so hard even though there's like a
million people doing Python here on
YouTube
but you know if you want if you want to
see me do it I'll do it you know
man man i'ma go in now I'll see you guys
later with it 20 20 minutes with you
guys right now all right guys so I'm
gonna see y'all later man
