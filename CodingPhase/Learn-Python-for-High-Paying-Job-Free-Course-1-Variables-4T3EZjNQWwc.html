coding fees.com
listen guys a lot of people been asking
me hey Joe we want you to teach us a
little bit of Python I want you to come
in and just break it down for us make it
fun make it interesting make it you know
something that we can understand it and
build some cool applications with you
guys this video is brought to you by
viewers like you and people that support
our website coding face.com go check it
out over 20 courses in there that's got
a guy you to become a developer from the
beginning to becoming a pro okay so I
said you know what I'm gonna do that for
you guys somehow you found me right so
you're probably watching me right now
and I say you know what let me give this
to you so today we're gonna start with
Python very simple one of the easiest
language out there it's also - one of my
favorite ones of course after Ruby but
that's another story so let's get
started
so I want you guys to come in and
basically go to rebel that I T alright
go to rebel that I T this is the
homepage okay I want you guys to click
over here somewhere and just register if
you haven't registered just register to
the website once you're here in this
area which is like that count section
okay I want you guys to come in and
click this little thing right you're
gonna click on all languages alright and
I want you guys to click on Python 3
alright now the next thing that I want
you guys to do is come here edit this
alright you're gonna change this to
let's say whatever your name is so
you're gonna say for me is Joe Python
course alright
and then from there just put in a little
quick description so we're gonna say hey
I'm just trying tight on out okay
very simple okay we're gonna click here
and now I'm gonna tell you exactly what
this is
so basically think of this as your
Python files okay and then here are
anymore
you could create new files for Python
you can also click here to run your code
that you put in in this section think of
this like a text editor but online right
and at the same time you get basically
whatever you put in for Python and the
codes here is gonna run right here okay
so let me show you an example okay so
I'm gonna say - okay
- plus oops
so plus - all right and then we're gonna
say run and it's gonna say four that's
it that's what you have to do for now
it's very simple very easy okay so the
very first thing that I want to do with
you guys is talk about variables okay
variables is something that you're going
to see in every language out there if
you've done JavaScript and you already
know about variables right you usually
will come in and say something like this
you say hey bar and then you will come
in and save our name equals Joe all
right
but in Python the way how we do this is
very simple what we have to do is say
name okay which is this is the name of
the variable alright and then right here
you basically add what's the value of
that variable so you say name is Joe
Santos Garcia and of course just fill in
your own name alright now if I come here
click one see nothing's happening right
because we're not returning anything so
if we want to actually print this here
that compiler well all you have to do is
you come here and say print okay and
then say name now actually prints it out
for you
that's simple okay now I want you guys
to understand a variable is just like a
box alright it's just a box that you
come in and you say hey this box I'm
giving it a name
and inside of it I'm giving it a value
just make it clear we can name this
whatever we want we could say let's say
my name just like that right and of
course this case sensetive which means
you have to type it exactly how you
wrote it so you can say my name just
like that alright so I could actually
work because if you come here and you
put this lowercase
you
error nothing's happening you see name
my name is not defined so basically that
variable is not defined is it doesn't
exist
all right it has to be exactly how you
wrote it okay so you will come here say
just like that and that will work all
right guys so this is a variable
something very easy I hope you guys
enjoyed this video let me know in the
comments if you want to see more of
these videos I'm going to do the whole
series about Python here for you guys
completely for free hope you guys enjoy
just when you get a chance go visit my
website : face comm that's the only way
that you can support this channel in
this amazing content that I'm releasing
here to the world so just go to my
