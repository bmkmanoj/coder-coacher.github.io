you get what I'm saying your boys out
here trying to grind it out teach you
some code get you get you in the game
right now
and we're gonna be good man we're gonna
be fine so anyways man let me see was
today's topics all right so today's
topics are a couple of things that I had
in mind but first of all I wanted to
talk about when you should do a single
page app okay now this is something that
people ask me all the time and they'll
be like Joe when the hell should I do a
single page app when it's the right time
like one doesn't make sense and to be
honest with you you just got to look at
the type of application you're building
okay so if you're building something
that let's say needs to be more SEO
friendly personally I will say do
server-side rendering right meaning like
I said you're doing a blog right you're
doing a blog you don't need to have
single page app you know people would
like to use react like to use view GS
angular etc whatever's out there right
ember they want to use every single
framework for every single situation
it's like nah you don't even need to do
that you get what I'm saying like you
don't need to use a framework for every
single thing like a blog you don't need
to use it
a ecommerce website you don't need to
use it right because
also for SEO purposes you want your
products to be able to be picked up and
yes Google does pick up you know
somewhat what you have when you are on
your HTML like JSX or like let's say you
have what is it the view X or whatever I
don't even know what what they call any
of you but JSX or any let's say in a
front-end application right a single
page app you you running everything
through there all of that is being put
in by the data that's coming from the
database and then the being displayed by
react right when Google started crawling
through your website a lot of times they
won't crawl it like the right way you
know I'm telling you at our experience
right when I go to different websites
that everything is done with single page
apps you try to do a search for their
website and you'll notice that even the
descriptions don't look right the
messages that are there or the pages
won't get crawled on the right way like
the right keywords that you might be
trying to push like let's say you have a
website for sneakers right you're trying
to push out Jordans whatever Jordans the
13th or the 11th right so now when you
do that and you do it through a friend
front-end framework and you try to do
everything on your website through
through JavaScript a lot of times the
you know the search engines won't crawl
it the right way how they supposed to
now if you do it with something like a
back-end server and you do it you know
just plain HTML then everything gets
crawled exactly how you want it right
you got you got all those a little Rich
Snippets at the bottom order legit
things right now
you can also because I know somebody
probably out there is gonna be like yeah
but you could pay a service to you know
to crawl your website your single page
happen yes you could pay a service but
when you're a developer and you're
working on your own and you got clients
your your clients most of the time they
don't have that money to
pay for the website to get crawled you
go don't say like you don't want to deal
with that right so what I would say is
definitely use single page apps when you
need to like let's say for example I'm
sorry for the people that are watching
this on Instagram I can't really show it
to you guys but I'm gonna show to the
people here on YouTube so if we go to
Zillow calm right it makes sense that
this website will be a single page app
okay let me fix the screen okay it makes
sense that this page will be a single
page app and then when you you know
you're clicking here automatically
changes by the URL and then comes in the
page loads has this map here you know
you click here you wanna see the largest
homes in the area I will show you which
ones are the largest homes in this area
that are either in construction or they
selling right it makes sense a web site
like this now if I go to let's say rap
radar calm this website right here it
wouldn't make sense to make you a single
page app you get what I'm saying
or if we go to Volcom see this type of
website it wouldn't make sense to be a
single page app or if we go to New York
Times hey okay let this load this
website doesn't make sense to be a
single page app at all so if you know if
I click here you'll see that it will
load but it's not really a single page
app you know what I'm saying so it
depends on what type of website you're
building
what's your audience what exactly is it
that you're trying to it
like let's say a situation where let's
look at this Leslie C mortgage
calculator let's see bank rate I'm gonna
show you right now see this right here
can be a single page app because it
makes sense you know this is something
that they're gonna be dealing with data
that's coming from the database that you
might want to have our real-time or like
let's say on the project that I'm
building right now for nodejs like we
built this with static HTML CSS and we
was using the edge template engine from
the Dhananjay yes to basically create
this page right but now we're converting
this into react yes because it makes
more sense right this page doesn't need
to be crawled by Google it doesn't need
to have anything like that but in this
situation we need it to be a single page
app because there's so many cool
features in this that we might be like
hey man we want to have this messages
pop up automatically you know with
WebSockets we might want to have this
thing where we come in here and I say
hey I want to search for Joe Santos
right and automatically as soon as I do
that and I leave it for like five
seconds automatically this view should
change and it should be looking for for
the user right this is like similar to
Facebook but I'm making it in a better
way than what Facebook has right now so
this is the project that we're doing
right we also we want to have comments
here so if I come in here I click on
like I want this to change and
automatically I want this to change for
everybody that's on the application you
know like this makes sense to be a
single page app you get what I'm saying
when you want something to be
interactive and you want something to be
like instantly
like you don't want a page to have to
load for you to display something to the
user that's when you use a single page
app for example you have something to
like airbnb.com you go to airbnb.com
and as you can see right now it's like
lazy loading the components but all of
this is a single page app this actually
is like a hybrid this is like a hybrid
because there's some parts start being
server-side rendered and some parts are
being that are part of the the single
page app so like if I come here I'll
click here automatically this thing
comes in like all of this is a
server-side rendering you know when we
click in there and it took us to room 43
33 92 there's a server-side rendering
and then this area right here was a
different component okay now if we come
here let me see a good example we click
on homes now this is a different
location a different route from the
website but all of this is a single page
app I hope you get the difference right
something that you might need to be
static like the room right showing the
room how the room looks like all of this
can be static all right but the thing
that cannot be static is what you need
to have that is gonna show the user like
things that's gonna be instantaneous
like hey I want to come here I want to
change the price I want to say I want to
have the prices from let's say $28 to
$50 a day click there automatically
searching for the data comes back it
loads it and then shows me the places
around the world where I could pay less
than $50 to stay per night you get what
I'm saying so I wouldn't have to go in
and refresh the whole page ok so this
makes sense to be a single single page
app so yeah man it's pretty much it just
showing you guys some examples on things
that that make sense
to be a single-page app in the things
that don't make sense okay who else we
got here we got garbage Gabi Mirza what
up son yeah what I what I we got my boy
Gavin he's in here
smile old nephew who was this thing here
we got Hamza the bag
Oh Quay about 96 yeah so let me see
somebody asked how does minifying
javascript and CSS affecting app I see
this a lot on my SEO report cache
caching and plug-in settings so what
this does like when you say minify your
CSS or you like let's say you you minify
you see a sense you minify your
JavaScript all it means is just taking
out order the blank space sometimes you
might want to have like instead of
having like full name for variables
sometimes what you might say a variable
that used to be let's say drop-down open
right let's say a variable name like
that what you would do with minifying
ugly finding instead of saying drop down
menu what I would do it would change it
to like the letter A or the letter B so
then now it's taking less space then
having that full the full name of the
variable you got I'm saying now what
exactly does that do we can come here
and check our site speed there's a
website that's pretty good I can't
remember the one is a whole company that
I used to work for so 39 dollar glasses
calm okay so this
all company that I used to work for
before I quit before I moved on before I
started doing my thing you know what I
mean
Sears oh this guy's here right basically
I'm gonna show you right now if we go to
GT metrics then we put in HTTP let's see
39 dollar glasses you can come here and
check exactly house like your site speed
can you fix it can you you know make it
faster and it actually tells you what
you need to do to fix your website
Google has another feature like this
that tells you sort of the page speed
and even though the browser has
something but it's not really that good
now as you can see like this this thing
is like is bad this is this website is
bad
actually before I left from over there
this thing was actually like us I think
it was like a b-minus and then this was
a seat
now after your boys out you know where
they had their like ID in an e so
whoever's I don't know who's working on
the front end who is doing whatever over
there but they're not really optimizing
and how they supposed to but yeah so
that's what happens when your boys not
there you gotta say you know so yeah man
you start looking at this so you start
seeing like this a whole bunch of of
different JavaScript that's being parsed
see you got component had a search
vendor like look Oh all this stuff
that's here technically what you're
supposed to do is you put it into one
bundle right and then once you have it
into one file one single bundle
definitely what you do is you minify and
you Agnes I it right from what I see
here they still kept the things that
were for like development so I don't
know who's working on this website
kind of feels good kind of feels good to
know that it's like okay cool who I was
working I don't know who what the hell
they doing it's a big loss you boys not
there's a big loss for the company but
um but yeah man so that's how as far
like C SEO in reality Google wants you
to have your website really optimize you
know I make it faster than than the
usual like if you have like a see like a
C or B then you're okay you know if you
check other websites like let's say
let's see this one say HTTP I'm saying
New York Times calm
let's analyze them let's see what
they're doing I know their team is
pretty big so most likely their website
is gonna be much faster so let's give
them some time let's see how it is
there's the test server is in Vancouver
Canada
testing testing analyzing yslow hmm
that's even worse I thought they would
be doing good sometimes when when you
have a lot of things like you don't
minify your your JavaScript you don't
minify your CSS you have a lot of images
you have a lot of ads you know websites
like the New York Times has a lot of ads
I think like they should be ashamed of
themselves it's a ten seconds basically
nine point five seconds to load the page
364 requests like that's pretty bad
right so I see sites that are pretty
fast I haven't really before I used to
look a lot into the see if I could find
like a good example
Missy let's try a Zillo cuz I know
Zillo got a good team and also - is he a
team man sometimes there's the main
problem with company sometimes companies
they want to have their product out
right and they're just like okay man we
got an idea let's just put it out put it
out to the world and yes it's cool to
try to release our projects out and you
know whatever product you might have
look like this loaded up pretty fast
you're gonna see generate a report so
you got a see as page speed and why
slowest is a beat so it's pretty good so
it says leverage browser caching okay so
that's fine it has a couple of things at
Google tag manager so Google tag manager
is another thing that could definitely
help you out when it comes to speed
especially when you have like a whole
bunch of tags like from Facebook Google
and a whole bunch of things like a bunch
of JavaScript that makes your website
slow you could use Google tag manager to
make it faster says many file requests
got a couple of things see it's not that
bad it's like three kb c gzip
look the minified javascript that's to
the maximum you see 96 so they
javascript is top of the line specify
image dimensions you know how sometimes
you come in and you put in hate just
image source and then just you put into
the address of the image like that's
cool but what you're supposed to do is
actually put in the the width and the
height of that image - so now the
browser is not thinking like oh is this
image gonna be big as this image gonna
be slow it's like it already knows it's
gonna be this size you gotta say like
those are the things that definitely
help you out minify your CSS look like
their whole CSS is like 53 bytes like
they got a 99 percent rate like you
can't make it smaller than that let me
see you remove query strings from static
resources
yes so they're not really using like
query string or any static resources
anima see of our bad requests so avoid
bad requests means like they don't have
no errors so let's check it out let's
see if they they don't have no errors or
I see inspect okay refresh this let's
see let's see if let's see if if they're
legit okay so as you can see everything
that's loading on their website is
status 200 which means everything that's
there is there for a reason like you
know sometimes you you put up a library
that you use it only on one page and
like you use that that library like
three four years ago but you never took
it out out of the the the HTML header or
the HTML fricking footer so sometimes
you might get like a error like hey they
can't find this there's on this file so
you definitely get penalized because of
that so I mean just go check this
website out
it's called GT metrics comm that will
help you get your website faster and as
far as like going back to your original
question which was like hey how does CSS
minify javascript uglify work and how
does SEO come in to intuit like it's
just basically about speed you know what
I mean there's another thing too there
was another thing that from Google
Google speed know there's something else
that I can remember and like they have
other things like that would give you
like pointers on how to make your
website faster right now I can't really
think of everything you know but
definitely check them out so
let me see what else is in here man
got Chris Shawn in here Chris Shawn
without Chris Shawn showing some love
yes sir let me see let me make sure we
get the the sound coming through can you
guys see me good yeah Kojima good hey
there you go hello donation you know
what I mean a little donation you get
what I'm saying like yes sir man we here
man get that donation going man listen
we dropping gems man this this for us to
have fun and talk about cold you know
I'm your neighbourhood developer you
gonna sing so let me see what else you
guys want to talk about I have a couple
of other questions that people wanted to
know but I want to talk to the people in
a chatroom see if any of you guys have
any other questions let me know
let me see y-space comments can't remove
yes let me see what else
yeah yeah Ramsay Jordan is hilarious man
Ramsey Jordan says he's like young
seeing like your old job and knowing
like they don't have legit people like
yourself then you're like yo it's like
man it's like it's like seeing that X on
the street and she has let herself go
and her new man looked like a bum you
know I mean but man god bless her man
try no man list that I oh yeah we could
check it out that's my boy that's one of
my mentors levels that I yell so let's
see
no mad list I think was it no matter I
or calm I can't remember
let me see let me see let me see let me
share the screen with you guys okay so
no man list is this website this is the
website from levels that I yo he created
an amazing website where he just pretty
much shares you know knowledge about you
know different places around the world
where people could go live for a few
months and just be a digital Nomad it
tells you how fast the Internet is it
tells you how much money you need per
month to survive you know what I mean so
it's pretty legit okay let me see
something let's see the GT metrics
they're not that bad they're pretty good
too
they got all all they're missing is to
optimize the images and then definitely
will get even a better or better score
server scaled follow images are resizing
HTML serving scale let's go save to the
under floor so yeah doc could definitely
save you but look at that man he got all
A's man like that's pretty legit man
he's been doing good man if you don't
know who this guy is the guy that
created this go check him out he's
actually I consider him one of my
mentors you know the same way how a lot
of you guys consider me one of your
mentors even though I haven't been there
like hands-on with you are like teaching
you oh this is what you got to do this
is what you got to learn and stuff like
that I consider him a mentor just like
you guys consider me your mentor because
when I started doing this I literally I
was just looking up to him like them
this guy's making money this guy's doing
business guys traveling the world this
guy he learned how to code super quick
he freaking build a website he had a
YouTube he's like he's living it up man
and like now he has this website where
he just means
he makes money man he makes you're
talking about like $30,000 a month you
know it's like look look at it it's like
I passed fifty thousand in a monthly
revenue as an indie maker like that's
good okay you gotta say like fifty
thousand dollars that's that's a lot kid
make 1900 month remote okay he making
twenty thousand nomad list thirty
thousand you get what I'm saying like
extrapolate it in total six hundred and
thirty four thousand a year you get what
I'm saying like like there's a do that
you you want to look up to you know what
I mean like and even myself like I'm
grinding I'm doing other stuff I'm doing
Conan face.com I got my own personal
websites I have a a side startup that me
and my friend were planning on building
like you see me what I'm doing I'm
working you know what I'm saying like
I'm not here playing games I'm really
working I'm doing all this stuff for a
reason now you see it a hard work now
but all of that doesn't pay you off
right away it pays off for a year two
years like I just started last year you
know I've been working full-time for god
knows how long
like now I'm comfortable that I could
say hey I make enough to be working from
home you get what I'm saying so I'm good
in that stands but once you touch that
two-year mark that three-year mark of
like working on your own like that's
when things go up like for him I
remember when he was making like $400 a
month he's like oh man I'm surviving off
$400 a month look at that I didn't even
go to his website for like a week and
now he's making fifty two thousand
dollars a month like that's crazy that's
as big baller style
you gonna say but you know god bless him
that's a board level sign that I yo go
check him out he's a legit legit okay
guys let me see let me see what else any
more topics any more questions you guys
want to talk about let me know
Taliban is like yo your sight is bad
right now yes to be honest I haven't had
no time to optimize my website at all
I've been just literally like building
releasing building releasing building
releasing I haven't had no time to
optimize and even at that I don't get no
no hits from from people from Google
like let's say Google searches and stuff
like that I barely get any any any new
people from there most of our people are
from here from YouTube from Facebook
Instagram from you know Twitter wherever
they found me somebody told me that they
found already about me already I don't
know how they call that ready already I
don't know I don't even know about ready
you gotta say so people talk about me
people share my links people share what
I do right but if my business was about
Google like let's say Google sending me
traffic then I would definitely have to
optimize everything and you know spend
like a good week on it to optimize my
whole website but I don't have time for
that bro I'm doing like a whole bunch of
yes subreddit I'm doing a whole bunch of
of like websites and you know it's like
this it's like I build things quick
release it built release built release
now the things that start generating a
lot of money then I go in there
optimizing and you know start fixing it
up right now my website is just like
y'all I'm knocking it out put it up from
there well I'm really putting time into
it's the course it's not really the the
website itself
yeah man so I'm reading what everybody's
out here saying let me see let me see
how PHP related question Dante go ahead
ask me I'm new to PHP I'm trying to
figure out where my focus should be okay
where should you focus on the very first
thing that you should do is understand
PHP just a programming language
understanding just you don't have to be
an expert understanding right understand
where to find the answers understand how
to look through the documentation that's
the first part second part you gotta
know how to work with a framework rain
cuz writing PHP by itself like I don't
think anybody does that anymore some
people do you know the guys that want to
be cool and be like I do PHP role I
don't even do no framework and it's like
okay buddy you've rewriting the the
wheel every single day right so those
people they get hype but for you you're
smarter than that right so what you want
to do is you actually want to come in
and and literally go and start focusing
on a framework so you want to focus on
something like laravel you might want to
go look into something like CodeIgniter
CakePHP now saying to try to become a
master in it just take a look go like
this okay cool that's CakePHP oh that's
cool that's coding NIDA ah cool I just
looked at it now let me go back to
laravel focus everything that you you're
doing with on laravel laravel is the
answer Larry Bell is the thing that is
gonna be popping you know it's gonna be
good for a long time from now like that
community it's the only thing that in to
be honest with you it's the only thing
that's keeping PHP alive when it comes
to it because if it wasn't because of
them right now PHP will be just like
okay super legacy and like I just
WordPress that's it you know or even
Magento that's it that's all what
people will be doing but thanks to Larry
Bell and the fact that you know they
copy a lot of stuff from Ruby on Rails
and they even got more more features
than Ruby on Rails now like they passed
there's so many good developers on on
Larry Bell that they already passed Ruby
on Rails as far as like new features and
new things that are cool about the
framework that save you time as a
developer so definitely check it out
focus on that also too you have to focus
on my sequel right PHP and my sequel go
hand-in-hand you get are sayings like to
you know a guy and a girl holding hands
it's like that goes hand in hand
together you know what I mean
so if you're know PHP you gotta also
know my sequin you gotta know how to how
to work with it right there from there
after you're already building
applications start launching them start
releasing them online put it on
different website on different websites
like Heroku hosting services right
Heroku use something like GoDaddy you
know cuz you're gonna have two different
type of clients and you're gonna have
the client that's gonna want everything
done through github and you know through
gear and then you might have the other
client the client that says hey man I
have a GoDaddy website I need you to go
in there and fix it up and if you don't
know how to even work with FTP you know
files and how to work with the admin the
admin page of gold Daddy or Namecheap
like you're gonna be effed up you know
what I mean and at the end if you really
want to go to the deep end look into dev
ops right so what that means is like
you're gonna be focusing more on the
server side and how to optimize your
website how to basically keep track of
your servers if your service is about to
go down you know how to chain them and
say hey when this was about to die yeah
because I got so much traffic load up
this other one you know look into AWS so
it's like there's a lot of things that
you could go into
but the very first thing you gotta focus
on is learning PHP the basics
understanding where to find the answers
and how to look at the documentation
there from the object-oriented
programming
understand how to use it then jump to
Larry well after Larry Braille try out a
couple of different frameworks like
legacy frameworks cuz you never know
what other companies might be using you
might go into a company never like hey
man we're using cakephp here it's not
the newest thing but hey they just gave
you a job so now you're getting paid
take advantage you get what I'm saying
and then from there you focus on my
sequel that's it so yeah let's see what
else what else what else what else
Joe talk about learning strategies yeah
I kind of have gone over that a couple
of times but okay so let's talk about
learning strategies switching up topic
learning strategies what should you do
you know as in brand new developer how
you should try to tackle this I'm taking
this the side of somebody who's never
cold was never programmed in their life
who has never done anything like this
first of all which is something that's
very important number one you cannot
give up right I see a lot of people that
they come in and they think oh yeah I
cook Oh what I could do listen that and
they cannot even install no - yes oh
they can I even stole MAMP well they
cannot even install PHP or or Ruby on
Rails on the computer you gotta
understand how to work with a computer
you know that's something that you know
people take for granted right like I
take it for granted I've been using
computer since the age of like you know
oh no since I don't know when since like
eight nine years old I've been having my
own computer and messing around breaking
it going in there going to the command
line or freaking zipping unzipping files
using torrents using distance and that
there's people out there
want to jump into becoming a developer
and don't even know how to use the
computer itself you cannot jump into
coding if you don't understand the
computer if you don't understand how to
work around the computer how to debug
and debug just means like hey I try one
thing if this thing breaks if I can't
get it to work I continue trying until I
fix it right and find where exactly is
it that I'm having this error right why
I can't install my my sequel on my
computer why no js' is scaring me
problems it might be hey you need to
install Python hey you might need to
install the latest version of nodejs hey
you might even have to update your
computer you got I'm saying like those
sort of basics that's where you start
right if you try to bypass that and say
hey man you know it's like it's like me
telling my mom right now
hey mom I'm gonna teach you how to code
she don't even know how to use the
computer property you gonna sound like
she knows how to use the computer before
what she needs to do go to Facebook
check our email check her bank that's it
she don't know how to go into the
computer and look around and you know
open up files and and you know try to
look with the C Drive you tell people
hey just go to your C Drive put
everything on the C Drive if you're not
gonna put it in the desktop you tell
them that that sounds like I'm talking
to them in in gibberish like it's like
hey man what is that wall Iguala
like they don't understand what that is
you're gonna say something try to
understand your computer first before
you try to jump into the world of coding
like and even if you decide hey I don't
know that much about my own computer but
I want to learn how to code then the
first thing that you have to do is to
write on a big freaking on a whiteboard
or right in front of you put a big
sticker on your laptop says hey don't
give up yet that's it cuz you gotta
learn the whole process I know some
people even people in my website hit me
up like man I want to start with the
course I want to do this and that and
they can't even get nodejs installed or
they can't even get PHP installed or my
sequel installed my first of
right after that this is my second
advice you know scratch that second
advice right make sure you have a
computer that makes your life easier
right you want to become a developer
don't don't use Windows I'm being honest
this is not me telling you like oh don't
do this don't do that
nah this is not a preference this is not
PlayStation versus Xbox
this is not ps3 versus Xbox 360 this is
now a ps4 versus Xbox one this is not a
freaking what is a Yankees versus
bossing now this is not being biased
this is me telling you what you need to
do go and buy yourself a cheap MacBook
go buy yourself a cheap iMac iMac iMac I
think that you go get it for $400 all
right look you you gotta make your life
easier to get into the field right with
Windows every Windows computers totally
different some people might have a a sir
computer some people might have an HP
computer some people might have a Dell
computer some people might have far I
don't know a samson computer a sony
computer every computer has different
things installed in it even though they
say oh yeah we installed Windows 10 we
install Windows whatever every Windows
has a Windows version it'll be Windows
10 - be point ten point three some crazy
number right look into it write your
word from coding face this is my new
word write it down on a piece of paper
new word look into it right you're gonna
hear that a lot from now on um so pretty
much on the windows right every single
thing every single windows has their own
version has a new version when you buy
from a manufacturer you don't know
exactly what they have installed what
they don't for somebody on an Acer
computer the experience - to freaking
start coding like my saying no js' or or
I don't know
no Jes Ruby on Rails whatever their
experience might be easier than
somebody who was using a Dell computer
because there are certain packages and
certain things that it's not installed
in your computer so if you're not super
technical and you're not tech savvy to
install all of those drivers and all of
the things that you might need all right
then you're basically shooting you
yourself in the foot and just like okay
cool I'm gonna buy myself a Windows
computer because I could game in it and
it's like nah this is for work first of
all a gaming computers for gaming are
freaking a computer for a Facebook and
Instagram and you know Twitter whatever
that's for that right when it's come to
tool to work and say hey I need a
computer that freakin is gonna help me
out learn how to code and get to build
all the things that I need to build
listen max are the best ones no matter
what nobody's gonna come here there's no
way not anybody out here could be like
oh the max are not the best
no max are the best like it or not the
Mac OS system is for professionals if
you are a developer your life is so much
easier you literally could go in and
stole anything that you want with brew
just say brew install dah dah dah brew
update that are not like it doesn't
matter what it is I'm telling you right
now if you're watching this take
advantage of the gems that I was
dropping here you're gonna be fine okay
so what was the first thing we say not
to give up we say making sure you
understand how to use the computer make
sure that you have the right computer
you know so your life could be easier
right then from there you have um just
coming in and start with the basics HTML
CSS start with the basics from there
once you you're able to take a design
and somebody says hey little Johnny hey
little Cindy here's a design build this
if you could build it you're ready to
move to JavaScript if you can't build
that stay there stop trying to jump on
it and be like me but they hire for
react they hire for angular they hire
off it isn't that
listen you don't
know the basics don't even worry about
frameworks don't even worry about
JavaScript you don't even know the
basics so if you don't know the basics
stop it
you know what I'm saying like don't do
it to yourself now the thing that I'm
gonna tell you after that jump into
JavaScript learn the basics of
JavaScript you're not trying to master
it the the problem with people is that
they'd be like oh man I'm gonna master
JavaScript no JavaScript you're gonna
learn it with experience there's things
that I can teach you here but the
reality is that the the real teaching
ground your real university is at a job
when a client comes in and tells you hey
I want you to connect to this API that
sends a message to to somebody's phone
and and you know frickin tickles tickles
me when I go to sleep when the client
comes in and tells you some crazy you
know situation like that will be like
man when I send that email
I want this email to go to my email send
me a copy
I want the page to load comes back the
hole request comes back and just tickles
me right under the arm like when you get
a situation like that that's when you're
gonna be like oh shoot now I know
JavaScript and I know it's just me being
funny about it but that's how it is the
clients in and the jobs are gonna give
you things that you're not gonna learn
on no tutorial we as an instructor
there's no way an instructor can teach
you everything right so the things that
you're gonna learn for in JavaScript you
really gonna learn it sat at the job
write all the things that you can learn
from me is how to build applications
right but to master something you only
learn that by building things building
projects right and then the next thing
is don't get trapped in situations like
you know saying hey I'm just gonna
follow a free code camp oh oh I'm gonna
do this this and that or well I've seen
somebody that sent me a message like man
I'm doing I'm doing a West boss 30 days
of JavaScript and this and that I'm like
bro you doing that in 30 days like you
wasting your time you could
literally started building a real
project a real some real project that
you can go in there and build it and
from there actually have something to
show for you gonna say like nobody's
gonna care about hey I did uh uh you
know a JavaScript watch I did some crazy
stuff now mind you those things are cool
to practice right to practice just to be
like oh cool I'm gonna practice but it
doesn't take thirty days to do all the
things that was boss has on his or his
website you literally could do all that
stuff and maybe like three four days or
30 days of the whole thing you could do
that in like three four days so if you
go in there and fall into the trap which
I was saying to other people like a
frico camper or so lunar know what this
is man but like I'm just gonna I'm gonna
take my time I'm gonna finish the
timeline I'm gonna go one by one of
these things and you know as if that's
gonna make you a developer that's not
gonna make you a developer that's gonna
make you learn how to practice and know
the basic stuff that's eight now when
somebody tells you hey could you build
me a website with this that connects to
this and then sense to this MongoDB and
then also does it to YC cool then talk
to me
you don't know saying like those are
real projects those are not you know
like hey let's build this little thing
it's like you know shameless plug but
here you go you know what I mean like we
got this this website right now like
there's a full application like you got
on saying you come over here logout get
one saying you log out you could come in
here email you know click on register at
the same time can't come in and say Jane
Doe at gmail let's say let's put car one
two three
that's a password car one two three four
it's the password register okay from
there we're gonna say we're gonna log in
Jane Doe at gmail.com car one two three
four log n now you're logged in you're
getting session
notifications if you refresh this you
got a r-real you know you're getting
real notifications this website is built
with we built that first with regular
HTML CSS now we use and react so it's
like you got a saying like we're
building real things like this is not
like some stuff that it's like oh cool
alright nobody cares about that you need
to build real projects go to dribble
calm and find things in there that you
say oh cool there's a nice website you
know so let's say you go to the dribble
calm and you find something like I don't
know I want to build a restaurant right
so come in you got a restaurant let's
click here let's see this fine wine
okay traditional web page you look at
this and say oh cool let me build this
now can you build this and you might get
stuck you might say oh I cannot build
this because I don't have two images no
you don't need the images all of those
images and image is similar to this you
can find it on Google you need grapes
find out Google do a Google search for a
great bright here you need mushrooms put
the mushrooms right there you gotta say
you can't find this this shape fine
build a circle you could build a circle
with CSS it doesn't have to be exactly
how the design is you know what I'm
saying
you need a wood background you could do
the a wood background you know you could
actually stack up a whole bunch of
elements on top of each other and do
this whole design you get what I'm
saying like you could build it now just
go out there man
and that's it those are my my strategies
for learning to become a developer out
here all right so let's see what else
what else we got man let me see look at
the chat room
let me see let me see let me see reading
the messages shaking Christian looking
good my and I am what I am on that
burned-out slow programming funny I
could quit I'm just reading the stuff
that people are saying hey job angry
reading from defenders of PHP that the
upgrades of PHP that came with Sam for
porno made it competitive with other
backing languages yea PHP the new PHP is
like it's up there man
it's up there's like the problem with
PHP is that PHP has been around for so
long that a lot of developers that are
now doing nodejs or doing Ruby on Rails
or doing Java or doing whatever is out
there that's hot at some point they used
to do PHP but that's PHP from like 2001
PHP for 1998 and it's like they think
like whatever was in that time is what's
happening now is like nah same way as
JavaScript lookup for JavaScript
JavaScript has changed over the years
you gotta say CSS has changed over the
years
web development has changed over the
years I remember there was a point where
everybody used to do inline Styles right
at some point that wasn't even CSS files
you get what I'm saying like there
wasn't even CSS files like I hope you
understand that so it's like things
change let me see
yeah hey you know we got some new
subscribers go subscribe man II let me
see let me see Brian I met my heart is
what about Pluralsight is any good I
would say Pluralsight is more for like
companies right Pluralsight is more for
companies it's not really for a beginner
if you are a beginner Pluralsight is not
the place for you right if you are a guy
who works at let's say I don't know oh
let's say for example you work at at
Microsoft where you work at some
Enterprise company right some huge
company
I don't know company that freaking sells
gold or you know freakin Exxon let's say
you work at Exxon all right hey wheel it
right now we can subscribe all day you
know what I mean
so let's say you work at Exxon the the
oil company right you work at that
company most likely Pluralsight will
have a deal with that company for
students well the employees to become
students so that usually what they do is
they sell Pluralsight as a service and
be like oh you who as a high college
like like a perk to actually go in there
and say hey I'm part of Exxon and I get
free Pluralsight right but most of the
courses they are not targeted to people
who are beginners from starting from
zero you're not gonna find like the type
of questions that I'm giving you for
people to learn in and making it easier
for you the courses that you're gonna
find in there is for the guys that
really do like computer science you know
I was like guys who have been working
for like 10 years 20 years in dotnet and
therefore
oh let's check out this nodejs so then
they get another technical guide to
explain it to them in a technical way
you get what I'm saying I hope that
makes sense
that's what Pluralsight shines on but
it's not really for a beginner like
let's say my website is for the average
person my website is now for the guy
who's looking for the most technical
thing the thing weighs I hate I'm
looking for every single thing to be
explained
that's not my website my website is for
the people are coming in and they want
to get this introduction to or what
development and are looking for a job
right if you're looking for jobs and you
want to get hired as soon as possible
then that's what my website is for you
know for the people that is a plural
site that's what people that is already
working in the industry and they've been
there for 5-10 years already and they
say you know what I want to learn an
extra little skill so then you have
somebody else explain it to you you know
what I mean like a website my
Pluralsight will be perfect for me like
if I wanted to jump into dotnet right if
I want to learn net I'm most likely
gonna learn it from Pluralsight but
that's because I already have the
technical background to go in there you
know what I mean like in Pluralsight
they don't break it down for you as a
beginner they go in and be like oh you
they're already expecting you to know
all this stuff you know what I mean so
that's the difference you know let me
see so what else QW Gaming says it's the
rest of the toku app tutorial going to
be on YouTube no there's gonna be like
I'm putting up another video probably
after we do this live stream which is
how I change from server side to single
page app but that's about it and maybe
at the end of the the project the final
look of it and that's what I'm gonna put
on the on the channel cuz to be honest
with you I'm already like 20 hours in
and that's 20 hours in of content right
that's not counting how many hours I'm
editing how many times I'm recording it
or how many times I'm planning things
out like it really is a really big
application it
pretty much building a social network
from the ground up right this is things
that people pay me for you know what I
mean as far as like if a client but it
came to me and say hey I need you to
build me a social network this is what I
would have built for him you got a
saying so in reality it wouldn't make
sense for me to put on YouTube now if I
was in a situation like where let's say
traversing media right where my my
channel wasn't bent my channel was bent
out here I don't guess many subs I don't
get as many notifications I don't get as
many people that add my channel as other
channels and if I was like on on a level
of like traversing media when he came in
Google said hey let's give an order the
search results that's given everything
all the tutorials right so if I were to
bring in that situation I would have
been I hate cool everything that I do
would be free you know it's like
traversing median making like 20 30
grand a month minimum you get what I'm
saying like who who wouldn't want to do
that for free I would love to make
twenty thirty thousand dollars and be
able to give it out for free because
then I would just work for YouTube full
time you get what I'm saying so but I
can't do it unfortunately
hopefully one day maybe where we become
you know bigger or something then I
could do another social network with
another language or another framework
you know what I mean so hopefully but
literally you go to my website you
subscribe for ten bucks like you go in
there if you just wanted to do that you
could go to the website the course
itself is gonna be $30 that's how much a
course but if you use the link of my
description you get 50% off
automatically so you could get it for
$15 if you wanted to buy it
now if you wanted to say hey Joe I want
to check out all of your other courses
literally you go to the website you
subscribe and you put in the code you
get 50% off so for $10 in in that whole
month you could do like four courses
pretty much it's like you're getting
courses for two dollars and fifty cents
so when you think about it you know what
I mean like I've seen people gamed the
system come in and
do as many things as possible and at two
months canceling and leave or or move on
you know what I mean so you gotta know
how to game the system I guess you know
but yeah you gotta go in there and just
it's worth it man to be honest with you
let me see hey Joe
I almost done with the HTML CSS social
media course then I'm moving down the
timeline when should I start building
the portfolio and put it online when you
should after I would say mmm let's look
at the timeline all right let's take a
look at the time like cuz I don't I
don't want to give you information
without having the timeline present
okay so let's click display okay so
let's say we got front-end so let's say
you want it to be a full stack right
let's start it up with full stack okay
how many hours can you work per week
let's say the average person does 13
hours per week okay so I 15 hours per
week is gonna take you 40 days to
actually finish this okay so it's three
hours per day all right and what usually
happens most people get to only do like
five days for per week that they could
actually work on things two days to take
off or even sometimes three days they
might just chill and relax so what I
will say is know how to use a text
editor learn HTML CSS right now you're
all the way in the beginning right you
still have a lot of things to go right
so what I will say is you know once you
do this then you're gonna go and do
build a responsive app right this just
to teach you how to use CSS media
queries okay then you learn advanced CSS
so there's like the latest things that
just came out CSS our flex boxes and CSS
grids okay now you want to learn how to
use sass alright you learn how to use
sass you
how to do HTML set or HTML CSS with a
dashboard right this is like a practice
this you could add to your portfolio
right you could add this a future-proof
JavaScript now this is when you learning
to to to build javascript or files and
learning how the basics of JavaScript
functions variables loops you know once
you get through that then you learn how
to build your own web developer starter
kit okay now from there you will say you
get over here you have built a static
site so let's calculate this let's see
from here okay so that's I say one day
two days see that's three days yes how
many days is that there's five days
that's six days okay so six days seven
days okay so ten days say go let's say
that's like an hour so eleven days okay
- thirteen days so at 13 days in you can
start building your portfolio like
you're gonna build it with this one
but then from day you can start building
your own you know what I'm saying
Whitman says can you just start a new
channel yes yes and no I can start a new
channel I try to do it right I try to do
it with the new channel where I said
coding face bytes right so let me see
or is it creative studio let me go to my
channel show you what it is so I try to
do it I try to actually test it out
right so I put out a video I said hey
man
subscribe to my channel coding face
bites just to get as many people as
possible to subscribe not that many
people subscribed right only 122 people
subscribed right I try to do this like
last year do my family phase only 91
people subscribed to it right I'm not
saying like people need to subscribe to
this this is not for everybody right but
this was like my trial I wanted to see
how it went right if I created a brand
new channel and I you know cleaned it up
and made everything proper and legit I
wanted to see how it would work out but
the problem with that is if I do that
then this channel drops right now most
people here don't get the notification
so if I release a video maybe maybe 800
people out of my 19,000 people maybe 800
people out of 19,000 people will see a
video that actually tells them hey man I
got a new channel go subscribe mm that
one and we're leaving this one most
people won't see it you gonna say so
then everything that I've worked for and
even though this is you know it is what
it is it's small but it's big at the
same time everything that I've worked
for for the past year would be for
nothing you don't I'm saying because
then the
20,000 subscribers that I have being
able to to put together over a whole
year will mean that basically it was for
nothing
you don't know saying can stand I will
have to start from scratch I will have
to go to another channel and start from
zero you're gonna say and then I do a
livestream and god forbid somebody from
here flags they or do whatever then now
my channel my other channel where I'm
starting from zero gets penalized you
get insane so you know and then on top
of that like you know if I was to do
this there wouldn't be no support you
know I try to do it I try to reach out
to other people you know cuz people come
in all the time and that's why one of
the main reasons why I was like yo every
youtuber here everybody out here is
super fake super you know what
I mean everybody comes here it takes
idea for my channel and runs with it
everybody comes in and literally leaves
comments and say oh man you have great
content but nobody wants to promote my
channel I don't know why nobody's goes
in and be like yo shout-out to coding
phase dah dah dah and this and that to
help the channel grow or even if I was
to create another channel no none of
these youtubers that I've helped out and
show love to will come in and but I hate
man go check out the new channel from
coding phase go subscribe to that
nobody's gonna do that you're gonna
saying even the bigger youtubers that
come here all the time is like oh man we
love your channel Joe we love what
you're doing here none of them have ever
given me a shout out none of them have
helped me out on anything knowing the
situation we're pretty much is like I've
been banned it's obvious right so it's
like nobody's gonna do that right
because in reality when it comes down to
it like if as many people get to see me
as they see them it's a wrap
you know what I'm saying it's like who
wanna if if I'm eating right think about
it like this if I'm eating right why
would I help out the guy that's creating
a lot of
that I'm doing why would I do that and
then he would be at the same level as me
or beyond that none of these people is
gonna do that you know what I'm saying
so it is what it is you know so that's
how it is just curious has programming
with Eric starting a new channel I don't
know I unsubscribe for every single
person out there I don't I don't watch
anybody's thing I don't look at anything
the only thing that I see if I see it is
if it shows up on on my my home screen
like the other day like I'm not
subscribed to try to death but say hey
man congratulations on your 10,000
subscribers but that's because it showed
up on my home screen now because I'm
subscribed not because I'm looking for
anybody's channel it's just literally
like me saying hey man congratulations I
saw this now say it's like Chris Sean's
channel I'm not subscribed to Chris
Sean's channel I don't look what's in
there I don't look at nobody's work you
know because of like if just just like I
don't know I just I felt like I just
don't want to look at into nobody stuff
you know I don't want to look at what
they're doing like you know cuz it's
like at the same time it's frustrating
the situation where I'm at where I'm
like I know my content is good I know
what I do is good I'm more knowledgeable
than 99% of the dudes out there I'm
actually making money out here
passive income making money on my own
like most of these guys don't do that
you gotta say like most of these people
are not even self taught most of these
people are already paid for by bigger
companies where they can't even share
their own opinions you know I'm the only
one that could actually share an opinion
out here most of these people already
pay for you know either
they're looking too much into the udemy
links right they don't they can't talk
bad about any youtuber they can't talk
about any bad about any udemy instructor
they can't talk bad about any bootcamp
they can't talk about any
service team treehouse Pluralsight
because that's how they make their money
I don't make my money from that my money
comes in from other places so it's like
I could go in there and be like f
everybody if you your service is not
good I'm gonna give you the real deal if
I could tell you hey save some money at
this other service like they can't do
that because everybody's on that payroll
everybody's getting that little that
little money on the side you're gonna
say so yeah man so I don't know you
gonna say so as far as like Eric I don't
even know like let's see what he's up to
I hope that you know he's good I haven't
really looked into him in a long time
since like what like maybe maybe May of
2017 yeah man yeah now I don't that's
I don't look into nobody you're gonna
say look into nobody I'd do my own thing
you know it's like cuz then at the end
of the day I'm like yo why am I gonna be
getting upset uh dudes that's just
copying what I do like who cares you
know what I mean I'm helping out this
the small community that I do have and
the people that's in here that are
grateful for what I do so it's like you
know what that's all I need you know one
day whatever one day we'll make one
viral video or whatever happens you know
and somehow we have to force you to show
us you know what I mean and that's when
everybody's gonna come back sucking your
boy off and I'm just gonna be like yo

oh don't leave yet I'm catching up now I
love that kid right burgerstein was in
here man three times speed activated
yeah but yeah I was gonna tell you guys
about this listen whoever wants to be an
affiliate to coding phase comm send me a
email I said it on the last livestream
is super quick but listen guys I know a
lot of you guys show me loving a lot of
you guys sherry on you know ready Cher
website on freakin Twitter yeah Sharia
everywhere man so I want to extend the
love back to you guys and pretty much
when you share the link you're gonna be
able to get money back right so you get
paid for the link in that link you
basically you get paid forever as long
as people signed up or they subscribe to
the website or they use your your link
you're always gonna get paid you know um
let's see this is the first month that
we're doing it and I want to actually
come in and I don't know by the end of
the year give like a big award to
whoever signed up as many people as
possible or whoever shared it the most
right cuz I can actually see the link
and see how many places got shared you
know I don't know maybe by somebody like
a two thousand three thousand dollar
computer or I don't know buy them a
brand new camera or whatever they might
need I don't know or even cash it
somebody doesn't hey Joe I just want the
cash man you know at the end of the year
whoever wins the most shares the the
most long freakin signups whatever etc
right it's gonna basically get a large
price I don't know what it is yet but
we'll figure it out next year I'm gonna
make a video an official video for it
I'm just talking to you guys you know
just shootin the right now but um
yeah so you pretty much like let's say
somebody subscribes to the channel or
buys a course you basically get 30% off
not 30% off you get a 30% of whatever it
cost right if somebody uses your link
and they put in the coupon code for 50%
so if it's ten dollars you get three
dollars every month that they are signed
up right if they didn't use the the sign
up or the the coupon code then basically
you get six dollars every single month
now you might think like hey it's not
that much but trust me next thing you
know hundreds of people signed up with
your link and then you get paid
thousands a month right
that's being honest I'm telling you guys
ahead of time like it happens alright so
I'm actually gonna do do that all you
have to do is just send me an email at
coding fees coding phase at gmail.com
and I will set you up already half hour
like four or five people who signed up
to become affiliates and it's like hey
you have a friend that wants to learn
how to code giving your link you know
you can say hey this is coding phase
combo use my link for a discount you
know what I mean so you given the
discount and at the same time you get
paid because you shared it to him
and then it's like you get paid as long
as the person is subscribed and you also
get paid every time that they buy a
course so it's the best way because it's
like like that you help me out and I'll
help you out at the same time so it's
like I'm the one really busting my ass
working all the time and doing other
videos and other courses and then you
just get paid for literally just sharing
something that you could have shared it
to a friend or shared it to somebody out
there you don't know saying so it's up
to you and we also have another thing so
for those of you guys that been waiting
for the coding phase gear we have two
coding phase gear guys so let me see I'm
gonna add it after the the link I'm
going to be adding it to the website and
pretty much we got a couple of things in
here
we also adding more designs this week so
let me share it with you guys and there

background you pretty much you get the
sticker and that you cut it out how you
want it
we got the coated face iPhone we got the

hoody we got the code if it's premium
ditions you know there's different
versions it's the ones that depending on
the material that's how much it cost and
