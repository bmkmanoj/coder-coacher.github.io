back at it again man : face calm
listen alright kids make sure you
subscribe make sure you like this video
your boys back I did it again
alright so somebody asked me hey Joe
what do you think about lynda.com and
I'm going to put lynda.com and
Pluralsight together I think I'm gonna
do a little comparing you know compared
to you to me so it's gonna be like this
man
it's like Lynda and will recite verses
verses all enter me what do I think
about it well I'm gonna say this guy's
basically Lynda has some old-ass courses
they're courses are so old man like this
course is there from 1914 99 2001 and I
did still charging the same amount you
know it's like why would you want to go
in there and start watching some old-ass
courses some people want to say hey man
you know programmer is timeless and this
and that but if you're doing like a a
PHP 5.3 or some like that or 5.6
and you know that right now you and your
company is selling point almost everyone
why the hell will you be studying like
some old-ass tutorials of old ass course
right and then the same thing as
Pluralsight galore say has a whole bunch
of courses that they're just old they're
from like 2002 or 9,000 2012-2013 like
lots of 14 their courses are old they're
old it out thinking now the good thing
about Pluralsight is that Pluralsight
has people who are really known in the
industry people who like let's say they
work for Microsoft or they work in the
react team or they work in the high
colors in a Microsoft like you know for
the typescript team that created type
script right so that's a good thing
about it but the problem is that most of
those people those experts they create a
course accordingly to whatever version
they're working on and then if something
that comes up now whatever they were
teaching it breaks and then they don't
even do updates on it you know so that's
my problems with those who don't sue you
know later and fluoro site
you know that's my only problem with it
is just their own they barely barely
putting anything new so you know it's
not really working because now you're
just watching old as coded that
probably broke or people updated and
changed a is like it's not working now
when you watch something on unity
there's a chance that might be hope so
but the good thing about all you mean is
that at any moment the instructor could
just come in and mean I hate hey guys I
just created an update make sure you
check out the update so now that you own
the class now that I get on the course
you pretty much get on a free upgrade so
so let me say the ideality I was
watching on different grinders are
reacting reacting readers because I was
like retouching or some stuff that I
forgot about
and then basically he said send out a
message way says hey guys I just updated
to the latest react router and I'm like
man you will never get this in and
 unit and I remain Pluralsight
and Linda at all because those sites is
like they show you the videos and not
saying those those instructors they make
their money like that and then I look
cool that's it
I created the course I never have to
come back to it
but people actually can Grider and even
calls field still add some new content
to a course that you bought you could
buy a course and then a year from now
you're still going to get the upgrades
and whatever came up with
whatever is new with the time so to me
that's it's cool you know what I mean so
that's what I will say about it you know
if I'm going to choose between Linda and
Pluralsight or you to me I'm definitely
going to go with you guys like I'm not
choosing to watch all those videos I'm
not going to pay to watch some old dance
videos it's just not worth it if you're
going to pay for something you want to
people something that's really good you
know what I mean yourself but that's
just me you know I know what I don't
know what your priorities might be
different you know sorry man I'm
for some reason I'm like allergies is
killing me right now plus is a little
bit dark today because
they arrange still super cloudy there's
barely any light outside so yeah
not my RiRi morning it's awesome plus
another good thing about udemy is that
now either you get updated courses stuff
like that but the same time people drop
all your courses constant like if you
didn't like instructor you could go and
check out another instructor in Linda if
they created one one or video or course
on nodejs that's it there's no more no
GIS that's the no J's video for Linda
you know what I mean now in Floral site
there might be there for videos for like
let's say no to yes but then no J yes
the videos that they have might be like
a super old version like I saw a video
where a guy was it was recently - I saw
already when I was talking about talking
I think no J is version a 4.0 or
something like that
Eric wait are we in no genius
version 7 poisoning like why are you
dropping a brand new video on no GS 4.0
it doesn't make sense you know and then
it's like you're paying for money for it
Oh God paying a lot of money for this
courses if I want to get something good
I go to Gilligan you know it's
that simple right but here guys listen
make sure you subscribe make sure you
like this video and at the same time if
you want to become a web developer and
you keep asking me hey Joe what do you
do to become a web developer the courses
are there now exact courses that I took
so become a web developer basically a
programmer software engineer anything
you want to call me you know we're not
learning in our unit and once again I'm
gonna put this out there I'm now getting
 paid from you to me I'm not
getting like Oh our sponsor for you to
me I'm not the reason why I always say
check out those courses because number
one I get like $2 out of them that's one
two because the courses are actually the
ones that taught me you know if I if I
was to be like hey I learned everything
from coke Adam II I will say hey guys go
check out a cool planet or co-captain if
I learned everything from team treehouse
I will tell you hey guys go check out
team treehouse if I learned anything
from a youtuber you know say hey guys go
check out this youtuber but I didn't
learn my from anybody out here I
learned everything that I know
straightening from from you to me so you
know what I mean and at the same times
it's not like a bias very long where I'm
like hey you know forget about
Linda forget about flora so I go check
out you to me no it's just that I've
tried everything I've tried every single
service out there try for it on Coursera
I try Udacity I try to treehouse I tried
coke Adam II I'll try free coke am and
from all of them literally the best one
that I found the best videos of
instructors have been on YouTube and
that's just any other thing so it's like
I said but that's just my opinion guys
you know some of you guys might say hey
man I can learn from videos I learned
from reading a book that's great
me I don't like reading a book
when I could just see how the person
call it you know what I mean but
everybody's different

definitely improving and yeah man and by
the way guys make sure you keep doing
the projects guys keep making projects
so just you know take a course and get
our cool I took the course this is not
like riding a bike this is something
that you have to keep on doing until
it's just like you know engraved in your
 mind like you just have it there
and you're like okay cool I know this

that's going to happen is by you
