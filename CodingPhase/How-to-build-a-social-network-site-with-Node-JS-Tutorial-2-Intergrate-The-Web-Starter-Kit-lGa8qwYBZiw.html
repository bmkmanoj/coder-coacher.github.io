coding face.com
I hope you guys enjoy the next video
that you're about to watch this is part
of my no Jes course we're building a
social media site with no Jes alright
guys don't miss on anything that happens
on coding phase comm subscribe and click
the notification and you get notified
every time that I drop a new video or a
new content all right guys so we
basically initialize the project now
what we're going to do is set everything
up okay so let's go to Adam we're going
to do fire open go to projects go to
toku okay
let that open up okay minimize that and
basically this is our project okay we
have everything that we need if you guys
have follow the course yeah I have seen
this already so that's how it works okay
this our setup now what we're going to
do is we're gonna do here we're gonna
say npm install - - save my sequel
that's my stole my sequel okay now the
next thing that we want to do is we want
to make sure we bring in that project
remember when we downloaded the
basically the starter kit so what we're
going to do now is we're basically gonna
implement that to our application okay
so we're gonna go to our downloads or
its downloads
okay downloads okay and you guys can see
we have our starter kit right here okay
there's the latest one try to download
all the time a fresh starter kit don't
reuse the same one because what happens
is a lot of times I do changes that
makes the starter kit better so make
sure you look out for that so definitely
take a look on that okay so this is the
latest one now the next thing that we're
gonna do is open up a new Finder window
go to projects okay from here we gotta
find we clean this up
okay I'm gonna
toku so this is where our projects
located here what I'm going to do is I'm
gonna unzip this okay we got a starter
kit 2018 master alright now what I'm
going to do is I'm going to take this
file move it into my toka file okay let
me go pick this up a little bit I'm
gonna move that to there I'm going to
move my web pack config that J yes I'm
also going to make sure I have another
file that's called something RC let me
just make sure
sometimes it's hidden depending on your
computer so try to open it with with
Adam so you go to download starter kit
2018 and open this project okay Babel RC
okay doc beeble RC copy this you need
this because of how web pack and Babel
works so you definitely need this so
we're gonna paste this I say dot Babel
RC so that creates a new file
you're gonna paste that in there okay
the next thing that I want you guys do
we have our package that JSON so let me
check this out okay hold on
when I was
our decay is going to our package.json
we're gonna copy everything that's in
here okay copy all of this okay we're
gonna go into our package that JSON from
our total project okay
right below this we're gonna paste this
okay the next thing that we're going to
do is we're gonna come here and copy the
DEF dependencies and put it inside of
the DEF dependencies all right then
after that we're going to pretty much
copy this here all right we can say this
copy this okay and what I want to do is
basically we're gonna put this inside I
will start okay so this is where our
scripts are are located
okay so we have NPM start is gonna run
the server and PM test run stat okay if
I do an PM run watch it's gonna do gulp
and I'm gonna add another thing I'm
gonna say maybe server watch okay or
watch server the watch server makes more
sense so in here we're gonna say Adonis
serve and then i'm dinah serve - - dev
save that make sure you put in the comma
okay and let me copy this I'm gonna put
in server
okay so Adonis serve
so basically when we say NPM run watch
is gonna run gulp when we say MPM run
server is gonna run a diner service when
we say MPN watch server is gonna run
adonis server that's - dev and this is
just gonna make it easier for us to run
things instead of us having to type it
down constantly okay so the next thing
that we're gonna do I want to make sure
that I have everything in here I have
all the dependencies okay we're gonna
come here change this the name we're
gonna say toku social network save that
so the operation for okay that's fine
and here I'm just gonna put in this is a
social network built with Adonis J yes
okay all right we are good for now okay
so let me see do we need this we don't
need none of that can rename that's fine
okay fine so we are good we got
everything that we need now the next
thing that we want to do here we can
actually if you have like I said before
if you want to do this through your
terminal you can
do everything through your terminal okay
you can also come in and run your
terminal on Adam okay so if you have a
platform you'll ID which is a package
you could go here install a search for
platform yo ID okay you're gonna get
that make sure you also install edge ok
syntax highlighting for edge templates
make sure you have prettier okay and
make sure you have JSX okay so language
JavaScript JSX
hafta installed and that's about it as
far as the the package is you're gonna
need now we're gonna say MPM install and
that's gonna stop everything now if you
have yarn you can see yarn and that will
install everything for you so it says
package name contains the little
characters that's my fault
save that we're gonna say yarn okay
let's see what's going on package that
JSON okay let's see what's going on
package that JSON name okay
so doesn't want you to have
I just put taco save ourselves to
headache okay so there you go
usually the spaces are issue so
you
if you just leave it a stoker you don't
have to say social network or nothing
okay this is installing everything for
me luckily I have you know yarn it goes
way faster than NPM for some of you guys
if you're using NPM is ok just to npm
install and it will install everything
for you so you should be good
okay it still takes a lot like it's a
lot of packages that we are installing
okay all right
now the next thing that we're going to
do is come here we're gonna say either
NPM or on watch okay
it's telling me we have errors and
that's because we haven't set everything
up yet I just wanted to make sure it
downloaded the the proper things okay
now the next thing that we're gonna do
is we're gonna come here and we gotta go
like this you're gonna say side of this
we're gonna change this to be resources
slash assets J yes okay for now you
don't really need this okay good take
that one out
okay resources assets J yes first comp
first comp okay and what I'm going to do
is I'm gonna go to resources I'm gonna
move assets into there
okay now let's try this one more time
give me one second make sure our
resources meaning this folder and then
the assets folder is in there we're
going to come and go to the gulp file
make sure this is saved I'll go to the
gulp file change this around so so for
this is going to be resources slash
assets slash sass okay we are fine now
next thing that we're going to do is
basically come here we're going to
uncomment this okay so this is gonna
create like a proxy for us to be able to
use NPM run watch and then what we're
doing is basically saying hey all right
now we're gonna have localhost 3333 okay
localhost 3333 save that you're gonna do
a couple of things here - let me see we
got this okay so we're running localhost
33 33 which is gonna start our our
server okay and we're gonna take this
options from here just copy and paste it
on the top
sorry decided to clean Europe the screen
down here because it was getting too
hectic the terminal had so many things
going on it was bothering me so what I'm
gonna do here is make sure you come
under this and put that there put a
comma save that now you're gonna come
here and make sure you comment this out
so this is for situations where you have
like a
that excite you want to run the the web
developer starter kit this is when you
have a server already running so do it
like that like I said this is running
the localhost 3333 make sure you say
yarn run what in this section here
you're gonna say yarn run what server so
basically so to be honest what we're
doing is we're running our server which
is our at dynasty yes project and then
we have another server here that runs on
the side that's gonna be on localhost
3000 which is gonna look at all the
changes on localhost 33 33 and it's also
going to look at the changes as far as
the assets and it's gonna refresh the
page accordingly okay
so let's do this let me go back if I
come here refresh the page you see
localhost 3000 it's pretty much a mirror
of what's happening on localhost 33 33
so if we open this up you can see it in
localhost 33 33 this is the same thing
okay
now let me see let me make sure
everything is running nice and smooth
okay well we run this it basically
compiles our JavaScript into here so
everything is fine our CSS sending it to
Cardassia says sending it here so this
is fine I want to try something else I
want to go to my resources views I'm
going to say C
yes and instead of CSS I'm gonna put in
let's put in Maine okay let me see
something
okay so none of the styles are there so
when we do this run like the assets with
a dynasty yes of how it has it it's
actually looking for the files inside of
the public folder which to me is no
bueno so there's no good okay
so we're definitely not gonna use this
at all so what we're gonna do is we're
gonna go to the Welcome that edge all
right
we're gonna come in here and put in link
okay and here we're gonna say main that
CSS refresh this and there you go we see
some different styling okay now I wanna
be able to go to resources assets sass
and I'm gonna change this here I'm gonna
come here I'm gonna change the
background so purple say if that's a
purple okay see if it watches the
changes okay so we got a see what's
going on so it didn't refresh it didn't
check for those changes so let's look at
the goat file okay it's looking for
assets and then sass so we have to fix
this we have to come here and add
resources okay so let me copy this from
here change on the watch
we're gonna come here paste that in
paste this in okay and what this is
going to do is if any chain anything
changes inside of the public folder is
gonna refresh the page okay so let me
see
go watch so yeah so I'm gonna save that
okay stopped the gulp so to do that
press control-c and you say yarn run
watch
okay so that's finishing up refresh this
and there you go we got purple now let's
see if we change something in the SCSS
make this yellow there you go
we see the changes automatically okay so
so far we're good okay if you guys want
you I could delete everything that's
inside of here okay yeah I can also
delete the card is CSS we don't need
that the regular J yes we don't need
that either
and the first comp we just leave that
there for now so that's like using react
if you guys want to use react you can
use it okay so you know what before we
move on let's let's make sure this is
working just in case we want to use
react later on so we're gonna come to
the Welcome edge right and then here
we're gonna create div id app put div
okay the next thing that we want to do
is basically do the same thing that with
the here we're you know a public file we
have these two files which is the vendor
and the first cup the name of our
component goes like this okay save that
and I also want to do a change so
let me go and see so we got webpack my
fig let go to the gulp I want to be
watching not only just a public folder
and any files inside of it but I also
want to be watching the resources views
so whenever we see something on the
resources views like let's say we change
our view we want to be able to change
things and then refresh the page ok so
let's do that right now so here we're
gonna see resources ok and then
resources we're gonna say what else
we're gonna see slash views slash any
files in there and then we're going to
also copy this put a comma here okay and
paste this in and then we're gonna put
two stars with means any folder inside
of the views folder and any files inside
of it I'm just going to trigger a reload
okay so I'm gonna come here press
control-c stop it now run yarn run watch
remember our old times we have another
window that's running our add-on is Jay
a server ok so get used to that it's
gonna have those two windows open ok so
refresh this and there you go see all
this stuff this is coming from our react
component now let's make sure this
component is working really good by
coming in here and saying this is my
first react component ok
yeah they you know so firstly it had to
load everything and then it was good
okay now go to the Welcome that edge
we're gonna change something here we're
going to say say testing the views save
that and as you can see it refreshed and
showed testing the views okay so we are
fine guys we're doing good
that's all we needed to do and I'll see
you guys in the next video
guys this video is brought to you by
viewers like you and people that support
our website coding phase comm go check
it out over 20 courses in there there's
got a guide you to become a developer
from the beginning to becoming a pro</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
