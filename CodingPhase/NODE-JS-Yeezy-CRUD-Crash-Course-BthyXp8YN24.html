coding phase comm listen today I got
some good news for you guys
I got a course on no Jes alright and
what's cool about it is I'm given the
first project completely free for you
guys to do here on YouTube and try it
out see if it's something that you would
like to learn I'm going to be building
two more projects besides this one I'm
gonna build an online store and I'm also
gonna build a service that you can use
to make money okay so if you're one of
the people that love laravel if you're
one of the people that love Ruby on
Rails if you love Django this is the
course for you because this is basically
nodejs but with a structured framework
it's no longer Wild West
let's pick random libraries let's pick
30,000 different packages let's focus on
building applications so enjoy the next
video guys hey I hope you guys enjoyed
this video that you're about to see now
just make sure that you subscribe and
click on the little bell because that's
the only way to get notified right guys
so now what we're gonna do is start our
very first project okay and this is how
you really learn by building projects I
know it's gonna be something very simple
but let's start it up so what we're
gonna do is we're gonna go CD right come
back into our projects and here we're
gonna say Adonis okay we're gonna click
there now to create a new application
we're gonna say Adonis Neil and then put
in the name of it so for now we're just
gonna say something like easy just like
that let's say easy okay so what that's
gonna do is create a new project for us
alright
let that load a little bit
you
okay cool so we got that done all right
now we're gonna go into this location of
easy so I'm gonna say CD and then
changes to the easy folder okay
click LS and there you go so we are good
okay now the next thing that we're going
to do is I'm going to say Adonis and
then I'm going to put in make controller
alright and we're going to say sneakers
controller and we're going to choose for
HTTP request
okay so Adonis automatically changes
it's a singular it so sneaker controller
and that's fine okay
so don't worry about it next thing that
we're gonna do is we're gonna go to Adam
you're gonna open up another project
okay go to projects click on easy okay
and click open
all right put a set aside and there you
go
so we up and running right now all right
now let's go into the resources views we
got the welcome page
we got the start where we have two
routes very first thing that we want to
do is we want to stop the server that we
got running here press ctrl C we're
going to go back also and change
directory in to was it easy okay and
then here we're gonna say believe was a
Adonis
can't remember to wear with them down in
a server surf that's death okay so
Adonis serve - - death okay so that's
running our server and we are good to go
let's refresh this there you go so it
works
we are good kids now the next thing that
we're going to do is basically come here
create some routes alright we're gonna
create a couple of routes and it's gonna
say something like this I'm gonna put in
route on sneakers okay
delete this from here we don't need that
we're gonna make this to be a get
request and we are going to pass in the
sneakers controller so sneaker singular
controller alright
your controller and we're going to pass
in the index so we're gonna have a
method called index gonna save that
we're going to open up the app open up
controllers open up sneakers controllers
dot J yes and here we're going to pass
in a new method we're gonna say async
all right we're gonna say a sink in here
we're gonna say index and so here we're
just gonna return for now we're gonna
say return all sneakers save that now
when we go to sneakers that's all
sneakers so we're fine okay cool we're
gonna copy this and we're gonna paste
this a few times okay we're gonna go
back into the documentation of Adonis
and I would just want to show you guys
this okay for the routing you come here
and let's say route resources we're
gonna follow this convention this is
something like I said that it's being
used on Ruby on Rails laravel and it
just works okay so we have users or
let's say sneakers and that's gonna be
the index we're gonna have sneakers last
create that's gonna be the create method
a we're gonna have sneakers for a post
method that's to save which is a store
method we're gonna say users slash ID
and that's gonna basically find the
specific sneaker that we want then we're
gonna have sneakers / ID / edit we're
gonna be able to edit that sneaker
through a form and then this is the
location where we're going to send that
post method to as a put method okay so
we're going to send it to here
we want to delete one we're gonna just
delete by saying sneaker slash the ID
and we just gotta basically do it delete
method okay so we got index create store
show edit update destroy okay so we're
gonna do that now we're gonna just add
those right here with an index create
was a store Eddie I believe oh yeah show
edit so we're gonna say show add it and
I'm gonna say update and destroy okay so
you got one more we're gonna save that
now we basically gonna put in create
we're just gonna put in a for now create
one sneaker
safe one sneaker okay
matter of fact is shell create page I'll
save one sneaker shell the one sneaker
okay
edit page so let me just say show page
for one sneaker edit page for one
sneaker and update is going to be update
one sneaker in database and this one's
gonna be delete one sneaker and database
okay
so imma see we got the old sneakers page
shell create page see if one sneaker
show page for one sneaker and a page for
one sneaker updates for one sneaker in
the database delete one sneaker in the
database okay so that's fine so we are
good
we're golden okay we're gonna do the
same thing that we they over there but
we're gonna do it here through the
routes okay looks like that
think is 7c for three okay so there you
go so we have we're gonna follow the
same methods that we see here so I'm
gonna say slash sneakers slash create
and then we're gonna have users which is
for us sneakers so we're gonna do a post
method to this poster sneakers okay then
we have
what was the other one we got showing
edit so we're gonna say I deep that's a
get method this one is gonna be ID /
edit this one is going to be a put
method
so there's route and this one is gonna
be a delete method to this routes so you
got put delete post so we're good okay
now the next thing that we have to do is
make sure we are linking to our right
methods in the controller so to the
create let's create to save if a store -
this one is show
so this one is edit so this one is
update and this one is destroy I think
yeah destroy data so we set up our
routes we set up everything that we need
it and yeah I'm gonna start creating the
pages now alright so I'm gonna see you
guys in the next video bye guys this
video is brought to you by viewers like
