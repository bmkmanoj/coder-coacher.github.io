right listen
today's topic this beautiful morning is
to talk about some stuff that I started
seeing in the comments yesterday and you
know people commenting about you know my
first job you know in making well like
70 K when I first started get him
getting 70 K and some people like Oh 70
King lit in in Atlanta that's like
35,000 in in San Francisco that
was like 20,000 and it's like
bro you're missing the point
the point is not where you start at the
point is what's going to happen after
you spend a year two years and the more
experience that you have some people are
even lucky to just off the gate they
find a good HR who doesn't know and
it's like oh this guy's a junior
developer he knows a little bit of
reacting he knows a little bit of
angular let's give him a hundred
thousand if you're one of those people
that's lucky like that great little
power to you but the reality of things
is like a lot of the people are not
getting those those are prices
on salary a lot of them don't even
deserve it not because they don't
deserve it it's just they don't
have experience you know and then a lot
of people get let go after three months
what's the point of you getting
a job at a really high salary and then
you get let go in three months
you know what I mean like but me I
didn't have that rule I actually grinded
I actually went from you know from the
bottom my first my very first like what
related job I was getting like I don't
know like $15 an hour but I was just
going there I got my you know my foot on
the door got my feet wet which is that's
the point when I tell you guys about you
know my first job it really doesn't know
 it hires you then good luck you
know what I mean but at the same time
it's like don't look at it as a numbers
you be like oh man you know I'm from
this area I should be trying to get in a
hundred thousand ninety thousand and
it's like bro people's gonna look at you
like you don't even have no
experience kid like you know what I mean
and then on top of that a lot of you
guys that are leaving those comments are
 retarded like I'm still being
honest like I go through your YouTube I
look at your videos that you have posted
you live in an area where you know
you're you're not making no money
you're your rent is probably $700 $800
which means you're probably earning you
know $30,000 $20,000 so it's like for
you to knock off somebody who gets 70 K
or 80 K or 60 K is like bro you don't
even make that so it's like you're you
have this dream in your head of like I'm
gonna make a one hundred twenty thousand
eight to three years I'm gonna make two
hundred thousand it doesn't work like
that guys the real world is totally
different
especially if you're coming from the
hood or you're coming from the bottom
and you're like over here knocking of
getting 60 70 thousand the man if you
get sixty thousand for your first job
you should be grateful I'm being
honest you should just be grateful
because that means that somebody
trusted you we know
I know in my company we want to hire
somebody who's a junior developer he's
not gonna get nowhere neither you know
what I mean so that's what I'm saying
like you guys need to stop thinking like
oh man I'm gonna make a hundred thousand
on the Gecko like it doesn't work like
that guys it's just like every other
career the more experience that you have
the more money that you get you know the
more talented that you are the more
money that you get and that's just how
it is so I just don't want you guys to
have this high expectations of like man
soon as I get in this and I do this you
know a couple of courses and I knock
this out I'm gonna make 100k no it
doesn't work like that guys you gotta
 put in work is experienced I get
you the money it's not just of what you
can do
it's the experience it's like people are
gonna you know they're gonna test you
they're gonna see if you if you're
really about that you know they're
gonna see if you can really make the any
design that they give you they're gonna
see if you cool or if you fold when you
have a problem like like that
happens all the time you know what I
mean so when I see people just leaving
dumb comments it's like oh man
70 K 30 K 20 K in your Lana or 20 K
 Zimbabwe
whatever will you wanna say but
it's like man I'm looking through your
YouTube I'm you looking through your
account bro you're enough you don't look
like you're making any money so it's
like if somebody comes and gives you a
job for 60 70 K Tinky stop thinking that
you're gonna be like oh I'm gonna say no
because it's only 60 70 K I know I could
get more than that
it's like bro it's your first
job like take the job shut the
 up and just do your work at
your experience on your next job you go
my bag nor they in the company in your
end they want to give you a higher race
then you stay there if you like them if
now keep it
even done comments for other people to
be like oh yeah maybe that's that's not
enough in this day and age
stay in the same shape I know people who
 who work still on the ball who I
told them like years ago when I used to
 work in the mall and like my
early 20s I used to telling my girl bro
like go do this and I go to this
train and go dude oh now man you know
like even if you go to school you ever
graduate you're only gonna get 30,000
40,000 mind you they're only making like
20,000 so it's like bro who the is
you to be talking about somebody who's
making thirty forty thousand it's like
they're making more than you you know
what I mean because they have
experience so it's the same for you
as I give you if you over here Oh
knocking somebody else's thing and be
like oh man I'm not gonna do this
because they're only making on their
first job is 6070 K is like bro that's
how every job is out there you
cannot expect for you to be making
 100 hears that's not a realistic
expectation because then you're gonna
stay looking for a job there's people
there's people who are talented
and they can't find a job and it's not
that they can't find a job is that they
have this higher expectation they think
that they're going to get into Facebook
they think they're gonna get into Google
they think they're gonna get into
 Twitter all these big companies
and they're like oh man I'm awake so I
get into this this position no any
 start working and then keep
applying to those jobs
you know what I mean like people just
 retarded like you're not gonna
stay in your house learning all this
 for no reason without getting paid
it's like you might as well get paid
like even right now if I was a brand-new
developer and somebody comes to me and
tells me hey you're a junior developer
we just need you to come in and help us
out with a couple of little things we're
gonna give you 30k I'm a brand new
developer I've never had a job I've
never had an experience what am I gonna
do what am I gonna say no to that
because it's only 30k I have no
experience of course I'm gonna
take the job you know what I
mean so you guys are retarded
the ones that are thinking that way of
like oh man I'm looking at these people
making 100k 150km
bro you're not on their level at
all there's a lot of you guys that came
if I can do the simplest things in in
JavaScript and you think that you're
going to get 100k the that I work
every day is complicated like
this is not the regular stuff that you
see on or even tutorials or courses this
is that's complicated
this is that is going to take years
it took five years for me to get to this
level so it's like you're not going to
come here be like oh I'm gonna get all
this in the first year and I'm
gonna be at the same level with this
other person it doesn't work like that
guys it's just it doesn't you know so if
somebody gives you the opportunity to
take a job take it don't come in
with this mentality of like I should be
getting more it's your first job
you could literally go into that job
work for one month and now you have
experience now you can go to other
interviews and be like hey I was getting
you know I was getting thirty thousand
on this other job but now because I have
the experience I know how it feels to be
working in a team I know how it feels to
get jobs and get tasks now I could go
into other interviews and you know acing
and get those jobs where it's
like 50 60 K and then
you keep moving on up now you have a
year in now you're okay cool now I'm
gonna go and start applying for other
jobs now you're getting 70 K then from
there you might bump into a cool HR
somebody who doesn't know because
most companies don't give out $100,000
to people off like one year two years
that's like the exception that's like a
 a dream for people you're not
gonna get that right away unless you
bump into somebody who don't know what
the hell they're doing like sometimes
you might bump into a startup that has a
lot of money and they need developers
right but the HR the person who's hiring
doesn't know technically they don't
know anything so what they do they look
at your resume like oh yeah he has
angular he has react he has this and
that but what they don't know is that
your experience of reacting angular is
just like two three little
projects you did on YouTube and then
they hire you thinking oh yeah this
person knows what they're doing when you
get to a job the other
developers look at you like what the
 this guy got hired he doesn't know
what the to do he doesn't know how
to how to do anything that's
more advanced but now you're getting the
higher pay so then what happens now
those developers who have experience
they go to the HR they go to the
managers or project managers or CEO and
tell them like you know I don't think
you know Johnny is is the right
candidate so now you got that a hundred
thousand but in less than two months you
got fired already because you don't have
that experience and that's what happens
all the time I'm telling you guys from
experience from what I've seen I think
that you happen all the time somebody
gets hired because they have certain
skills on their resume and a HR person
interviews them they like you they're oh
yeah this is a good guy he's cool but
you don't have that experience you know
and I will I will tell you guys don't
even apply for those positions because
if you don't have the experience you're
gonna feel dumb
you're gonna feel dumb it's
going to be discouraging it happened to
me in the beginning started
applying to really
big-ass companies like one of my
first jobs that I applied was tumblr and
then when I got to the interview I was
like holy I was lost I
thought it was like I'm just gonna show
my web sites and that's it it was a lot
of complicated and I felt stupid
and I felt discouraged I was like man
I'm never gonna find a job but then I
realized I'm like wait I'm skipping
so many levels I'm going from
zero from learning in my house to try to
work at tumblr where all those
guys are there they're like the
CTO was like some guy from
 MIT another guy was like from
 Harbor and I'm like what the
 I'm like I'm over here coming from
you to me I'm like skipping steps you
know like those guys that went to those
Ivy League school they got a really
 great education so I can't
compete with them at that time because I
was just brand new developer I'm like
yeah I'm learning on a ship from you to
me so it's like how the am I
thinking that I'm gonna get there just
by skipping so many steps you
know those guys they have years
of experience you know so that's what
I'm saying guys you guys got a
is a stepping stone this whole is a
stepping stone you gotta understand
you're teaching yourself you're learning
on your own you don't have a you
know you're not coming from MIT
you're not coming from from
harbor you're not coming from Stanford
you're coming you know from from
your house so it's like the way how you
gonna make money is from experience and
knowing knowledge and knowing what the
hell you got to do you know so don't
think in your head it's like oh well now
I'm away until I could get that hundred
thousand and it's like man you're gonna
stay in your house for a long time
waiting for that
just go for the jobs get hired
get paid at a job I mean okay I
got 40,000 50,000 get paid at that job
while you're still learning by the time
you finish that job in a year you're
 gotta have so much experience
plus what you've been learning in your
house and still taking you to me courses
and still taking courses like our
tutorials like the crystal Lang tutorial
which is going to take you to a more
advanced level than just being a regular
developer you know it's like you gotta
put in that work man this is not about
thinking like oh you're gonna come in it
anyway oh this guy is a web developer
let's throw him a hundred thousand
dollars it doesn't work like that kids a
 doctor doesn't go to a
hospital as soon as he graduates and be
like hey guys I'm a doctor now no he has
to do a residency you got to do
your residency in this too
this is not gonna be easy this
is not gonna be like oh you just gonna
pop in and then I go
my name is Joe Schmo and and
you're gonna give me a job and
then I'm gonna stay in my house I'm like
oh those guys are applying for it you
know forty fifty thousand dollar jobs
I'm gonna wait until I get my hundred
thousand you're gonna stay home for a
long time buddy especially which is the
thing that got me not pissed off
but it got me like I'm looking at
this cake Channel and I'm looking at the
 I'm like bro you got an old-ass TV
because it sounds crazy but you could
tell how much money somebody is making
by the that they have in the house
and the type of that they
buy so it's like you could calculate
exactly if somebody's lifestyle so I
could go into your calculate your
your lifestyle and be like bro
you're not making more than thirty
thousand dollars so if somebody comes to
you and gives you sixty thousand dollars
it's not a a life changer but
it's an upgrade so why would you say no
to it you
know what I mean oh why will you leave
comments to other people here but like
oh man this is why I'm not doing no work
development I'm a joint I'm gonna start
doing or is it software engineering
because you know you're gonna get
$100,000 and even those guys don't make
that much those guys do not make that
much at all on their first job they make
like 60 K 6070 K if they're
talented so it's like you gotta know
what the you're doing guys but here
man
make sure you check out the crystal
tutorials guys it's right there on the
channel I will be making part 2 of the
views tonight and I will be making I'm
probably going to drop two to three
tutorials tonight on crystal Ling so I'm
gonna do one on my lunch break and then
I'm gonna do one I'm gonna do two when I
get home and then we're gonna get the
 poppin
yeah man
I'd am John Joe going in no I'm just
going in I'm just you know going in deep
now just you know I want you guys to
have a realistic expectation guys man
like is is I got to tell you it's like
even right now if somebody tells me hey
I'm a brand new developer and somebody
tells me man there's this agency around
the corner from my house did hiring for
30,000 right you're you're gonna
basically do the same that you're
doing in your house but you're gonna get
paid for it so why not take it if you
stay in your house and you're like oh
man it's only $30 there's only 40,000
you're gonna stay in your house
for a long time kid you gotta work man
yo 84 music man that's what's up son yo
