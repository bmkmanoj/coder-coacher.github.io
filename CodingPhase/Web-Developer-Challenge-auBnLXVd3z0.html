want you guys to do is on this video I
want you guys to post up what you have
from a website either from let's say
coke pen or rebel rebel wait die what
what is it rebel tighty yeah so one of
those websites well we could actually
see the code and see your your work and
then I will announce the winner at the

cocaine use cocaine or use rebel the I T
one of those okay guys it's something
simple something very easy there's a CSS
drop-down menu okay
the one that has the best one wins for
the day so every single day I'm gonna
try to come up with a new web developer
challenge for you guys something that
you can do in less than 10 minutes 10 20
minutes for some of you guys to our
beginners it might take you a little bit
longer because you got to do the
research I gotta find out how to do it
etc but a lot of you guys know how to do
this yeah so all you have to do is
pretty much add the link of your code
pen or your ruffled iit and put it here
on the description not the description
the comment so we could all see what
everybody's working on and at the same
time we could declare who's the winner
at the end of the day so let's see who's
in here we got Freddy Martinez we got
that was awesome we got Ramsay Jordan
Taurus were in Tyler Benton Ibrahim Al
Amin Joseph Alba we got else we got
Maile 3000 he already knows Wolfpack in
the squat you already know
all right who else isn't here drop down
menu yeah drop down menu no problem
CSS only sometimes for some people
they'll be like man like doing it on a
hover yes you could do in a hover or you
could do it on on a click you could do
it on click you know using active it's
pretty simple not that hard so I just
want to challenge you guys give you guys
a little challenge that you come in
build a quick and see if you are the
winner of the day you know keep you guys
engaged keep you guys active on coding
and not take too much out of your time
right I don't want you guys to be like
hey man I want you guys to build me a
social network today like now like who's
gonna have the time for that like you
know what I mean it's not gonna be able
to be done
so there's small little things like this
that I know you can do
and then basically just show it every
day I'm going to come up with something
here to challenge you guys it could be
either HTML could be CSS it could be
JavaScript it could be I don't know it
could be an algorithm there could be
anything out there
okay it could be like hey let's build a
slider builder reverse the string for
game I don't know fizzbuzz us killed
could be anything man could be just just
to challenge you guys man
does YouTube doesn't YouTube delete
links yes and no because what YouTube
does is basically when you put in the
links it basically lets me decide if I
want to actually approve it or not so go
ahead put the links and then if I see is
a link to a coal pen or a rebel die T
I'm the one that sees it I'm doing that
proves it so that from there I'm gonna
approve it so everybody to see it but
yeah man we out here kids back at it
again
greetings to everybody greetings
everybody man
yo I got this new video that I'm
dropping later on today which is how to
install Bastion boom tool on your
Windows computer how to set of what
developer starter kit pretty much
everything that you need to get started
because I know a lot of people have
problems with nodejs and the issues on
their computers and their terminals and
they're like man why my doesn't
look like Joe's why it doesn't work
properly so that's what we do it later
on today it's gonna be a cool video it's
gonna be pretty easy I think the video
is gonna be less than eight minutes or I
might just chop it down and you know cuz
there's a lot of waiting you know when
you're downloading MPM files I know I'm
probably gonna cut that out so it could
be like less than five minutes how to
install no js' window smash and
everything that you need so start as a
web developer only show so much freaking
traffic
yes I'm doing that today I mean I did it
last night all I have to do is just edit
it and then post it up for you guys
how to bootloader Boonta from our USB
for noobs yeah I should probably do that
I probably probably will do that later I
have in my computer I have one hard
drive with Windows one hard drive with
Linux probably sure
this is not moving this traffic is
so bad man look at this
this is bad
kids this is really really bad I did not
know that there was traffic like this on
this thing we are not moving well I
guess I get to hang out with you guys
now yeah make sure you give to some
likes man give to some likes guys the
things about YouTube it is that look I
know a lot of you guys enjoy this
channel I know a lot of you guys love
this channel the only way that we can
actually succeed in this channel and
continue to grow it's up to you guys
it's not even up to me anymore
like yeah I know my content is good yeah
I know what I do I know I come in here
every single day it drop something new
for you guys but it's no longer about
it's no longer about me anymore it's all
about you guys what you guys can do for
the channel the only thing that you can
actually do for the channel that will
help us
it's just literally just give likes and
leave comments even if it's like the
dumbest thing in the world to just leave
a comment in there like something super
simple but it's up to you guys you guys
can't can be the ones that make this
this channel grow me I did my part I'm
doing my part now it's up to you guys
you guys gotta give dislikes you gotta
give this um you know share it around
share it around the internet you know
you got a Twitter put the link soon to
your Twitter once in a while when you
like a video you know and you find that
there was information in it share it you
know only you guys can make this channel
grow because the way how YouTube is is
like they show you to two different
audiences but they count more if the
people share it and they like it and
they leave they leave comments if you
leave comments it tells them okay
there's a video that people are engaged
that people are having conversations in
you know so yeah man you know I try to
not to do too much like promo like hey
make sure you leave a like make sure you
leave a comment you know do this in
there you know hashtag this this and
that
cuz I mean that's how you hack the
system you know what I mean but I don't
do that because I like to leave just
like hey I do my content and I'm saying
then it's up to you guys but
unfortunately the new algorithm for
YouTube is the way how they work you
have to leave comments if you don't
leave comments it's as if you never
watch the video
yeah you know in shout-out to Ramsey
Jordan always coming through leave a
comment on all the videos even if it
says hey first or hey second yeah my
fault you know there's new freaking
YouTube update that they did sucks cuz
the stream cuts out like after you do
like 12 15 minutes it cuts out you can't
do like long live videos anymore
the the freaking application crashes
like that sucks yeah I remember what I
used to be in here on my phone on my web
developer lunch breaks for like I don't
know for like an hour
scheming it leaving for leaving for
lunch for like an hour and a half
 that company man I was you know
coming in here doing like a long-ass
livestream and was sweet you know
now at 12 minutes the video cuts that's
crazy
yeah man yeah you two finally got smart
if you love the things like a lot of
people they watch the videos they enjoy
and they're not okay cool like myself I
do this all the time I watched videos on
YouTube and I live a like maybe alright
because it's like if you like the video
i feel like if you liked the video
that's a you watch them you like then
you moved on but in how you colas but
now in nowadays in YouTube you have to
be engaged if you don't have an
engagement even if it's the dumbest
like oh you got a you know I don't know
whatever whatever type of engagement
that you wanna have so long as the
people leave a comment your channels
gonna is gonna be good if the people
don't leave a comment then literally
YouTube just doesn't she doesn't care
like you know what whatever let
hey yo Maurice whoa
maurices hurry judges like um nah you
know are you guys watching this on the
freakin on the live streams chat man do
it is like go Maurice you're pretty
crazy man
music yo 84 what the hell you been at
man
you don't come through no more man I
said 84 had another kid I said that goes
the career it goes walked over there
goes way to her web development we
haven't seen the kind of minute
the word man
Hey driving and watching listen we all
driving out here man
we're stalking in traffic stuck in
traffic I did a major why would I
come through here like I'm an idiot like
this was supposed to be a 10-minute
Drive now this is gonna become a
one-hour thing
hey tea for me any for lurking out here
nah that's cool
Maurice that Maurice is probably this
guy was this guy's name Casey most
likely I could bet you my left nut
that's probably Casey like straight up
like that do it's my game like every
live-streaming comes in now because we
know we don't wanna with him now
here we are creating a new a new account
called Maurice Ashley like come on
really
what a picture some black dude come on
don't do that let's hide them from this
channel there you go message delete it
and get him the hell out of here
don't mention the mention left around
Maurice yo this is crazy this traffic is
crazy like it's just not moving period
you know it's crazy - about this this
freaking the the highways and the routes
the routes or whatever on on Connecticut
like I don't know who we building the
the designs for this this freaking
highway is like they don't know what the
hell they do it like it's so bad like
instead of having like exits to the
right you know like a normal highway a
lot of times the exits here are on the
left side like who does that like nobody
does that nobody does exits on the left
side man thank you like seriously
yeah I'm sorry guys this YouTube app
sucks like I don't know why they did
this change sometimes they they be
effing up man isn't even my Wi-Fi no
more man it's the application itself it
crashes like every 10 minutes equally
last 10 minutes and then it crashes
it's just crazy but yeah man make sure
you do the challenge for today man go do
that also finally is moving so yeah
yeah man there's a lot of people I don't
mess with no more man from like from
YouTube and there's like you know
there's a subsection of like subscribers
people who subscribe to the channel and
then they think it's funny to just like
constantly talk behind the
youtubers back but then when when they
come here to the channel they're sucking
me off you know what I mean they're like
oh my god John I love you I do you know
you're the best earner ah and you know
I'm the type of person that I open my
arms so everybody and just I'll be cool
with everybody you know so I opened my
arse
everybody and I always think the best
from everybody but like this people like
they just like I don't know they're like
snakes you know there's like snakes and
just like they don't understand that you
know I'm probably gonna do a video about
this later on like as a developer to be
honest like I expose myself out here
like I don't have I have no need to be
on the internet right and this is the
main reason why I didn't want to create
a YouTube channel about coding right or
even programming or anything because of
the scrutiny and how people hate on you
and the fact that everybody that's out
there thinks that they know more than
you and you know guys are like oh I'm
smarter than this guy why is he on
YouTube I'm like why am I on YouTube
because I actually have the balls to
come here on YouTube and talk about code
most of you guys are the smartest guys
in the world but yes such a nerd in such
a cornball that you came and going the
internet and talk about something that
you're passionate about
you know a lot of these guys are
straight corn balls you know what I mean
like they're insecure you know social
anxiety like they don't want you know
they don't feel comfortable with
themselves they're like oh they're too
ugly they don't want to be on camera
that's just in that like burrow like I'm
not worried about that you know what I
mean I come in here and do what I do you
know but it's like you expose yourself
like I have no reason to even create a
YouTube channel about coding or even
talking about anything like I could live
my life as a developer and nobody even
knew that how much money I made
nobody even know that you know all the
moves I'm making nobody even knows what
level I am as a developer but I come
here and I expose myself so should i
internet the world of the trolls and the
snakes because I want people to take
this as motivation so get into this
field I want people to to come in and
learn how to code I want people to learn
how to you know jump classes because if
you if you're somebody who works at
McDonald's right that doesn't mean you
got to stay at McDonald's for ever at
some point you could come in to a career
like this and actually change your life
and change your mom's life in your you
know your kids and your you know even
your grandkids grandkids that you don't
even have like because you jump the
ladder you know what I mean so that's
what I wanted to do in this channel but
these people they don't want to stand
that they don't understand that hey I'm
just some regular do I'm just a regular
human being and this is my whole this is
my whole stick I'm just a regular person
just like you and anybody that's
watching me through you too
if I was like a expert a professional
way this dissing that Lake I wouldn't
even do all the crazy that I do on
my channel you get what I'm saying if I
was like somebody that was here to sell
you courses and sell you Shane affiliate
marketing this like I wouldn't even do
nothing that I do on this channel I
would even show my family I wouldn't
come in here and have conversations with
you guys like those other people that
are leeches in the world
I don't do none of that I don't
come in here and tell you guys with
clickbait titles like how to get a
million dollars in two days how to
become a developer with no experience
how to get higher with this like as soon
as you start seeing like that you
know this person's all you're trying to
cash in on the people that are gullible
you know what I mean so if you wanted to
make somebody's miserable life miserable
it should be somebody who's out here
doing like that like I'm literally
like the most coolest developer you're
gonna meet most of these people are corn
balls and and dweeps
guys that you don't even want to talk to
you know ain't secure they could be the
smartest developers in the world but
there's not people that you want to be
hanging them around with you know what
I'm saying so it's like if somebody like
me comes in here and exposes himself to
the world to say hey man if I could do
it I'm just a regular dude like embrace
that and just enjoy it you know
don't come in here and be like you know
it's like the same thing way with like
man I feel like Matt felt at some point
like oh he was learning to code in the
beginning were hitting oh he was
showing mad love as soon as he start
learning a little bit more of code you
start feeling hey you know what maybe I
know more than Joe maybe I know more
than this person and there's like now
what you don't understand is like I want
you to know more than me if you feel
like you know more than me great you
know what I mean but that don't mean
that you're gonna take away what I
already did for you and what I'm doing
for other people I want people to become
better developers at me yeah I want
people that become you know even way
better than me or I'll get to where I
got to my career faster than me that's
the whole point of the channel but most
of these people they come in they get
what they want and then from there one
opinion that might be different than
what they have to like oh man this
youtuber doesn't know anything this
person is this isn't that my bro likes
you you don't think like you knows like
I did a video law last year when I first
opened its this channel about how you
call that shake elixir I said 10 reasons
why you shouldn't learn elixir and it
was a parody right so I made that
as a parody and I was just laughing
through the whole video this dude
they took the video save the
they put it around like the Alexa
community hates me like they hate me
like literally they hate me right
because I told the truth I was like yo
why will you be learning something that
you're not gonna get no money on like
most of the people that are learning is
elixir they're not getting no money out
of it like you're spending so much time
into a language that's gonna be
a second each language like people are
not using them you get what I'm saying
like most companies are not using that
so if you're going into a field and
you're like man I want to go and learn
Pascal is I think nobody's freaking
using that like you're not gonna
find jobs so you know they freaky hate
me because of that and then they
don't understand that I made us
literally as a as a joke like as as a
joke of like how corny some developers
are like you know I feel like there's a
lot of people in this field that take
coding massive religion and that's one
of the main reasons why I started this
channel too
cuz I wanted to break that like you know
this is not a religion this
 is a job you know people come in
here and act like man it's like you're
talking about Catholics and you talking
about Jewish and you're talking about
Muslims and you're talking
it's like nah man we're talking about
stupid programming language like stop it
like get off your your basement
get off your you know playing Dungeons &amp;amp;
Dragons like come on man like a lot of
this dude's is out here they think this
 is like a religion this is not
a religion I look at the shares to check
you know when I got into this field I
looked at it from the beginning as a
check on like coding I like building
websites but do you really think I like
building websites for companies no I
like building like my own websites like
I like going to my house and and
building you know my you know once in a
while a little Dragon Ball Z website put
it online create some animations put it
on coal pen that's the fun part
alright but what I work for a company is
a check I'm not looking at that
like oh my god is a religion I'm
subscribed to the religion of PHP I'm
subscribed to the religion of nodejs I
look at this as a check you know I
go in there and I look at it as a check
like hey
how can I use something that I know and
get paid you know it's like that's how I
look at it you know but there's like
subscribers so coming here and be like
man it's like oh this person is not real
is like I'm the realest in
here straight up at least I'm honest
with it a lot of people are in the field
for the money like and they just don't
talk about it the worst thing that
people do is when they hide you
know they're not all here is like you
know I'm a developer for the love of it
but if you're for the love of it
how about you work in a company that's
gonna pay you $40,000 a year they'll be
like no I can't do that man I gotta get
a hundred and twenty thousand dollars a
year so then you're here for the
money then so shut the up you got
what I'm saying like that's the thing
like there's not gonna be I'm telling
you right now I had a talk there's not
gonna be another youtuber like me
there's not gonna be another developer
like me at all because most of the
people they're either just like they
just not honest they just don't be
telling you the truth
you gotta say
yes so it's crazy it's crazy because
it's like people you know people act
like this of religion that
is not a religion man this is a job
they said is some that you do for a
living and that's it you get what I'm
saying like I love to code on that
i like when I work for a company I work
on that don't like but I'm there
because of a check most of the
developers that are in companies they
work there for a check you can work at
Google you're there for the check you're
there for you know going in there for
the perks though you know the free
laundry the free food you know you're
there for something you know you're not
there because you like man Google's the
best company in the world they're gonna
pay me $20,000 a year I'm staying right
here and say nah buddy you're lying to
yourself
you know and I think that's like the
problem where most people they either
start hating me or they started like
talking Chevy I'm out back because they
just like they disagree with it's
like hey we supposed to disagree with
things like I love when I disagree with
a channel because then the next video
I'm gonna be able to agree with them
they drop something else every single
day I drop something different you know
what I mean it's rare that you might see
something the same shape like on this
channel you know anime so that's the
thing man I wish more people will
understand that and you know even a lot
of people that be like man this guy's
worth you know the best developers in
the world but they just assholes you
know some guys are just assholes that's
just the truth just because you're smart
just because you found you you put in
ten thousand dollars into a language
that's not gonna make you a better
person that just means I hate you
dedicated but if you're an asshole
you're still gonna be an asshole you
know what I mean and that's what happens
a lot of time
I'll be hearing so many times that
people be like man we we shouldn't let
this people win like what do you mean we
shouldn't let these people in like if
people want to learn to cook learn you
know let them learn to code
it's a job it's not uh this
is not a religion and it's like
you know like Green Man
if dirty they have sex with with guys
and their gauge they can't join my
religion like that's how it feels out
here you know Armenians I gave you you
like money in you or you come from
underprivileged situation people they a
lot of developers out here they're like
nah we should we shouldn't let this guys
in because it's like they're here for
the money and it's like why are you here
you gotta say like there's so many
clowns and sometimes it does piss me off
it's like man it's a job that's
like that's a good guy who's was in
construction and he's earning $50 an
hour and then a random guy comes in and
be like hey man how much you getting
paid Oh $50 an hour damn how can I get
in
is there a hookup you could put me in
and the guy tells him nah man we only
accept contractors and we only said
except construction workers that love
this wait what
you get what I'm saying like those disco
balls sometimes like I'm grateful for
web development that's why they'll
switch
I couldn't easily some people day like
man like some guy was I left a message
on one of our covers like you know
you're not a software developer I'm like
girl I never said I'm not some foot
developer I'm not I've stuck to what I'm
good at
I stuck to the web because the web has
paid me good has treated me good
whenever I want to get a job
I could literally look online and get a
job within a week this times that I've
got a job in one day I quit one job and
got a job the next day you can't do that
in software development so if we develop
me there's so many people trying to get
into software and you know and more
technical jobs that literally is
flooding plus these guys that are waived
better developers are coming from like
India coming from freaking China with
master's degrees and in guys who are
like freaking you know super high class
math you know I really like way better
education than what we got here in
America and now you're competing with
those guys you know what I'm saying so
I'm not into whether I'm lying to
software I'm not into anything else
sometimes I play around with game
development but that's about it I'm in
the WebKit that's where the money is
that that's where the opportunities is
that you know that's where I could just
come in with my eyes closed and get a
job and it was like right now I'm
basically working from home by myself I
got different clients I'm working here
with you guys
creating courses for you guys creating
content that's a that's what pays me
alright tomorrow somebody I don't know
YouTube says you know what we killing
Joe's channel we my I don't know
teachable says hey you broke a policy
you got too many videos on your channel
on your on your website whatever it
could be they tell me some like
that I'm like okay cool tomorrow I'll
get a job as a web developer $120,000
work from 9:00 to 5:00 I don't even have
to do anything else I don't have to come
in
I'm I work almost 16 hours a day just on
YouTube one what developmental on
websites that I have on clients 16 hours
a day I earn my you know what I'm
saying
but dudes come in here and be like man
it's like this guy he comes and he drops
one video a day and and he gets money
and this and now he shouldn't be here we
need to get him out of here
we need to get this do about it here
which it understands that this 16 hours

you know what I'll do I'll go straight
to Hartford go straight to ESPN which
they constantly emailing me like oh
because soon as I put in that I moved to
Connecticut now like all the recruiters
that I know they're like man - there's
so many jobs will be here in Connecticut
oh come on man we could get you in
because you know recruiters they get
paid when they see a good developer and
they know that you are in a certain
state or a certain area they get paid
every time they get you into a job they
get like five thousand ten thousand
dollars every time they get you into a
job so they constantly emailing me like
oh man come on man you sure you don't
want to work Joe no I don't want to work
right now I don't want to go and work at
a company all right but if drops
and I'm on the floor I'm like man and I
see man and I'm making less than five
thousand dollars a month
you know if I'm making like four dollars
in a month I'm like you know what it's
time to go - time to go to work man I'll
get 120 thousand dollars a year with my
eyes closed
go work out ESPN put that on my
resume like literally so it's like
sometimes you expose yourself out here
and you create all this content it's
like you're doing this for the people
but people is like they don't understand
that they don't sound like what you're
trying to do you know what I mean like
the amount that I hate that I get on
this channel since I created it from
everything from the races people like
there's so many races developers is not
even funny like this dude out here are
extremely racist but they just they they
create account start hitting right
you're not gonna say hi my name is Shawn
Smith and I work at you know XYZ comm
now they're gonna put in a crazy freakin
crazy nickname to the YouTube account
it's like little tickle Bell you know
what I mean little tickle Bell 23 that's
his name on YouTube and that's what he
puts in all his his hateful shame like
oh man it's harsh this sauce freakin
sang niggers and you know it's brown
niggers and this isn't that that's what
those be doing I'm like come on man like
what makes you so mad what makes you so
mad that a Hispanic dude is out here
getting money that's the money that you
could be getting if you weren't so
negative and you weren't so such a snake
in this world you go saying people don't
understand that if you constantly
putting out negative energy nothing good
comes to you while you at your job and
you're getting $40,000 a year and you
can't get a job in your area because you
live in Wyoming and you've been trying
to become a developer for the past two
years but you only put in two hours a
day and then you come in and all you
know is HTML CSS you barely know how to
use jQuery and then you come in and you
get mad at somebody and because he looks
different than you you're like why is
this guy here why does he get to make
money why does he get to have a job why
can't he do this isn't that don't don't
worry about what I do like you should
worry about how can you make it on your
own how can you get to that point
I'm saying like I don't understand how
people who are like people should just
like they should really try to better
themselves and enjoy their life instead
of like creating fake accounts and
trying to make somebody else's life
miserable because it's just not working
link every time that dudes get me pissed
off or even like a youtuber and this
isn't that like those dudes fall off you
know like dude I try to try to talk
and I had to put him in his place and
hey you know we're not saying no names
yes you know who they are they channels
dropped people don't like ugly people
don't like people who are snakes you
know what I mean like one thing that
people can tell from me
it's just I'm just a real dude you gonna
say like I'm just some real do a regular
guy
you gonna say I'm not the bully in the
the backyard and I'm not the bully over
here and the web development
I'm just here sharing my opinions and
minding my own business I don't look at
nobody's channel I don't look at what
nobody else does
I don't do none of this but if you
f with me I'll put you in your place and
people will see that there's a couple of
people that are already putting in their
place
you got us a link you can you can't win
against a kid
you catch else you know I give out elves
like candy you get what I'm saying so
you try to go against the kid when you
know I'm only doing positive out
here and each yeah those get sent in
body bags out here okay link because
it's like look as you guys in the
audience right everybody that's watching
it's 50 people in here probably like 300
people already came into the livestream
in and out right because the live stream
keeps dropping and freaking application
keeps on keeps on freaking crashing but
one thing that you guys know everybody's
here that knows this I'm just a cool
dude
I'm just a dude that lives around the
corner from you all day you know when
you was little used to go outside you
should play tag with play handball with
you know pretty freakin basketball with
I'm that dude that's it nothing special
nothing else but at the same time it's
like when people try to come in here and
talk ish about me or this isn't that the
audience don't like it it's not me I
don't like it but the audience don't
like it the people just don't like it
because they know what it is like when
you come in here and you try to go
against me you gotta catch it out you
can't you know when you yeah I'm like
the people's champ you know I
mean like I didn't get to to this point
because of no algorithm I don't get to
this point because of like I'm freaking
the smartest dude I'm in this
literally because people want me in this
 you can't go against the peoples
champ that's just how it is
you get when I say there was a thing
where like I don't know if you ever seen
this interview so they were saying like
you know when 50 cent came into the
scene right talk about music cuz I know
a lot about music flip to the die nology
well 50 cent came into the scene jay-z
was like yo he took all of his guys fall
back nobody get on 50 nobody talk about
50
don't even mention this guy's name right
because at that moment he was bubbling
so much that even if jay-z with a guy on
50 cent jay-z woulda lost because the
people were with 50 cent you know what
I'm saying so it's the same as here
it's like you can't go against me when
the people were riding behind me you
gotta you gotta go against people that
you know you can win against you gotta
talk about people that you know you
can't win against you can't talk
about people that you know damn well
there's no way you could win that soon
it's like you go to let's say there's a
freestyle battle in the world all right
the you could be the most talented
talented rapper out there you know who
wins whoever brought more people in
there
you gotta sing - who wins
now who's the most talented who was the
best the person that wins is the person
that moved the crowd and the people
loved him
that's it you could go in there and drop
the most metaphors you could go in there
and drop everything that you want it's
like look look at the whole thing with
Kendrick Lamar and Drake why you think
Kendrick Lamar hasn't really going hard
on Drake he can't you can't go against
drink bro like nobody can the general
public loves drink you got on saying
 it I'm the drink of web development
you know what I mean it I said it
it's Trudeau sign like you can't go
against you can't go against somebody
that the general public like I could go
in there and and literally you know like
let's say like oh no could be the
smartest dude in the world right the
dude is expand I master every
programming language
I get kudos I get kudos from Mark
Zuckerberg you know what I mean I get
stars I get it smiley faces from bill
from Bill Gates you know I mean guys is
like yo I get the smiley faces from from
smiley faces and kissy faces from Elon
Musk right you could put that guy
against me and still win cuz I got the
general public
you gotta say like people I love those
guys will be like I'm nothing I'm Upton
I love I'm saying like a as an analogy
like you know what I mean it could be a
guy that even the tech community loves
so much
and he could try to go against me and
it's not gonna work because I'm with the
general public
I'm a regular dude I'm not out here
selling dreams I'm not how you sing oh
man i'm i'm the most technical guy i'm
this dissing that nah i'm the regular
dude from down the street playing
basketball or his freakin garage
you gotta say i'm dad dude people
gravitate to that I'm not you know what
I mean like you could go and find
subsections and of guys who are
superstars in their their expertise but
if you got the general public
ain't nobody with you because
the general public is everybody you know
what I'm saying it's not just a
subsection of the subsection you get
what I'm saying okay guys listen God's
plan for real man Cody face papi
God's plan yo guys I'm actually here
damn it took me 51 minutes to get to
this freaking FedEx this is ridiculous
yeah
what's my opinion on engineer truth I
think he I think he's good he got in
each I think I respect him for what he
did he created something new something
that nobody else was doing which was
literally interviewing every single
person from every type of field and
giving people an inside look into what
it is to be a developer to be a doctor
to be a dentist to be a lawyer to be a
graphic designer like nobody was doing
that like people you gotta give him
respect he nobody has done that ever
like nobody has done that ever you know
so I was like he's killing it
it's just still going to do member life
strings where multiple people can join
in yes I'm still doing that
Sunday Sunday's man every Sunday 9 p.m.
I'm reading the comments when you guys
are hilarious yeah
guys listen the challenge of the day is
literally to create a CSS drop-down menu
CSS only you gonna say like CSS only
nothing else not unless no more
now I don't think one thing he will
interview me man because the thing for
me like in the beginning like when I
first saw him I thought he was his
channel was cool but then I realized
like I don't know like 90% of the stuff
that he had there was like it was just
straight affiliate affiliate marketing
right almost everything that he has is
affiliate marketing so you know there's
a lot of that I talk about here
that I don't get a dime for a lot of
 most of the the only things
that I get a dime for is literally the
udemy links and those udemy links are
the links that I've used right those are
the courses that I've used personally so
in that in that case I'm just pretty
much getting paid for promoting
something that I already use but his
whole model because in reality you can't
really make that much money on YouTube
where he banks in is really to you know
promote other people's products that he
probably don't use and tell people hey
this is what you should use for this
this what you use for that
like right now I'm in the talks of
getting my first sponsorship
right I've gotten so many different
sponsorship opportunities with like boot
camps but I just don't want to do it you
know there was a boot camp I was telling
me hey man we'll give you $5,000 a month
to promote us once a week and I was like
nah because automatically that will
discredit me automatically right they
told me hey man $5,000 you you put us in
and you know we're freaking you promote
us and we'll give you $5,000 plus we'll
give you some Commission for whoever
actually uses your link and signs up to
the bootcamp so that could have been
even more money I'm talking about maybe
$10,000
you know but did I do it no right I
haven't really used any sponsorships the
only one that I'm gonna use because I've
actually used it is uh it's like
template monster you guys have ever
heard of this when I was doing like you
know freelancing and doing like the
digital agencies we used to buy
templates from from like template
monster that's it so they actually
reached out to me and they told me that
hey they're gonna sponsor for videos for
videos a month so I'm actually going to
help them promote from all their
services and it's gonna be just like at
the end of the video or maybe I'm gonna
be something like hey hey guys this
video sponsored by template monster but
that's because I've actually used them
and I know that it works especially for
you know back-end developers who are not
good with the front-end if your back-end
developer and a client comes to you and
be like hey we need a website for
distance in that what do you do do you
hire a designer do you just say hey
ma'am just gonna buy something on
template monster for like 10 bucks and
and keep it moving create the
application sell it to the client and
whoop-dee-doo it you move on right that
makes sense but I'm not gonna have like
you know the most random thing is like
hey use my software for freelancer and
I'm like I've never used that like
how do I look telling people a use this
 this software for freelancers and
like I've never used that you gotta
say
yeah man
Avengers website project yes that's
coming up soon man I love coming up I
might do the design of it you know how I
did that Takashi 69 video yesterday I
might do the the design for the design
for the Avengers video first so I might
do that first because a lot of people I
feel like a lot of people want that so I
might do that yeah man see you later man
Taliban it already knows you already
know I'm on the spot already I'm already
at FedEx I need to go and send this
stupid I got a contract I gotta send to
to Dominican Republic for those of you
guys that don't know I'm buying a condo
in Dominican Republic and literally is I
gotta be sending contracts and people
work so what sucks is $70 every time
that I send it which is kind of
ridiculous now you're telling me to send
a letter it cost $70 like I could
probably send a midget 2d art for
cheaper than that you gotta say so it's
like okay little people I can't say
midget but uh but it's crazy though like
you're so expensive $70 man yeah
somebody last for a letter it's not even
a package imagine if it was a package
god forbid it was a package
and Joe get a body cam word when I'm
coming today you came in hopefully I
don't know maybe somewhere the end of
the year or early next year I want to go
so bad the only reason why I haven't
really traveled like that is because my
my wife doesn't have a passport and we
waiting on that but once we get the
passport we out I mean your boy got his
passport but you know me man
if I go out out there man what happens
in England stays in England you know
what I mean I'm trying to get some I'm
trying to get some Cheerios you gotta
say where they're Cheerios that MA go in
there can you get some tea okay that's
if some of your team ah you're my girl
watching is y'all just plain ma I'm
joking I'm just saying if I I don't even
trust myself in another country I'll be
honest with you I don't trust myself you
know I mean so I should have the type of
person that I am like y'all I need
somebody to go to sleep with like I
can't I'm like one of those people that
like I know you right you can't fax that
 people is retarded but contracts
like that you have to sign it yourself
and you have to send it it's like in
person so you have to really sign it and
send it you can't fax it you can't copy
it and you know scan it and something
about the sender by email
it's like Grilli like it has to be your
handwriting has to be everything yours
word its Trudeau if I moved to Jersey I
feel like like I failed in life and this
is nothing against Jersey but if you
from New York
everybody knows Jersey is like the dirty
backyard that nobody was to go to and
that's how New Yorkers feel you know
Jersey is Jersey but nobody wants to go
to Jersey Jersey it feels like a dirty
backyard of New York and it's like
that's not a come-up it's like people
leave from Jersey to go to New York how
do you look like going from New York to
Jersey even though some people they do
it because the houses are cheap in
Jersey and this isn't that but it's just
I wouldn't do it
or exactly most of the people most of
the people are from Jersey and they're
trying to leave the spot man yeah now
there's definitely spots are expensive
in Jersey but it doesn't take away of
the fact that Jersey is trashing my
Jersey is trashing like if you ever been
to Jersey like let's say done the inner
cities are really bad and then the
suburbs are trashy Lake is trashy out
there
moving from New York to Jersey is not
like a come-up it's not like something
like man I moved to Jersey man
