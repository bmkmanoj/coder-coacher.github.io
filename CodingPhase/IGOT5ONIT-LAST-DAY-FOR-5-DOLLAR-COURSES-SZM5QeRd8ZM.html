I done did it again you know happy
fourth of July right you know
everybody's going out people went to the
beach people hanging out with their
friends people going to you know to the
barbecues they chillin right you know
some of you guys are here with me it's
fine that once I got to see this
it's fine if you don't get to see it I
understand but I just wanted to tell you
guys man
it's the last day final day of I got
five on it
that's the coupon code man it's the last
day that you get 50% off on everything
basically fought on the courses so you
can't go wrong with that I spent more
than that on freaking you to me right
and udemy courses are really great but a
fight out of course $5 per month like
you're not gonna find that
you know anywhere else right so only
reason I did this is for my subscribers
then everybody else is gonna have to be
you know breaking the price but at the
same time I just want you guys to know
it's the last day at 12 o'clock it
expires Eastern Time
you know whoever got to got it what we
got to get it sorry can't speak right
now
who ever got to get it ever got to get
it right it doesn't sound right whoever
had the chance to get it hey you're one
of the lucky peoples and um and enjoy it
go through there man and take the
courses man stop put your own
procrastinator stop leaving
for last minute I'm telling you do one
corset thing right one video or two
videos which are I think most videos are
like 5 minutes 10 minutes do that then
from there managers you know take a
little break then come back 1 over 5 10
minutes
you don't take breaks but I want you
guys to actually get this sale because
you know it's got to go up
it's gotta go up on you know tomorrow
and I don't want people to miss out you
know because they're specifically just
for my YouTube audience you know and you
guys see the commercials on on YouTube
it's not gonna be at this price when you
guys see it on udemy it's not gonna be
at this price it's not gonna be at this
price on Skillshare it's not going to be
at this price on Pluralsight so at least
for the ones that see this take
advantage it's like you're investing
five dollars into your future right so
take this little time and just sign up
go to coding phase com make sure you
register even if you if you don't want
to buy nothing find it school register
so you could get at least two free
courses right so go there right now
coding phase calm and just register man
every day I'm dropping four or five
videos they're straight tutorials
straight breaking down making it
simple it's not a regular course is not
how like rain I'm doing the HTML CSS
introduction right it's not like any
other other course out there where
basically people explain in a way where
it's going to be a little bit difficult
if you've never done this before I'm
explaining to you exactly how I talk to
you here you know breaking it down as
simple terms and just make it easy for
you guys
now let's talk about something else
right because now I'm just like talking
about it but whoever wants to actually
go register do it today man it's the
last day you're not gonna get that -
freaking sell again trust me I'm not
doing on 50% off on anything ever again
cuz there's no money on it you know I
spent more money promoting and
advertising and you know creating all
these videos for you guys on there so it
wouldn't be worth it to put it at 50%
maybe a 15 maybe a 25 or 50 percent it
doesn't make sense as the course itself
costs like $10 $15 so if I'm selling it
for $5 it's like I'm losing everything
right I'm basically paying hosting and
doing everything that I gotta to lift
that money that little $5 right but I
want you guys to have it man I'm I'm
guaranteeing it guys trust me you're not
gonna be let down it's gonna be worth it
and now
I just want to know what you guys is up
to me
you know link what you guys is up to
right now see what the hell you guys is
doing man
say what y'all doing for today man I
think even though today is fourth of
July and I understand a lot of people is
gonna be like yo we busy be hanging out
with the family man go in and at least
go something today
cold I love something just a little bit
one hour give yourself one hour you
can't do one hour okay to 20 minutes
I'll call something today man
at least something of copán right just
to have it just so you don't lose the
touch sometimes we leave something and
then we come back to it and we forget it
like there's been times that I'm
learning a programming language on my
whole yeah I already got the syntax but
then when I come back to him at all sure
I don't remember it now I gotta go look
at the documentation but if I would have
just continued learning it or continue
practicing for a good week that
will just got stuck to my head I would
have remembered it right but we're human
beings man sometimes we lose focus and
that's okay but you know you just gotta
do it man so let's go everybody
if Boyd 84 was good kid greatness I'm on
my way to New York back to New York City
kids your boys going back back to the
hunt leaving Long Island right now
heading to New York man I was like
coming out out of my house and I'm like
okay cool
Maserati right in front of me I come out
right there at the corner a freaking
brand new Corvette then as soon as I
make the left somebody's out there
killing it with a drop-top Bentley I'm
like damn and he will be killing it my
neighborhood I'm over here just some
 bands sorry made me laugh I'm
just don't know some eyes Bend
those is out here killing it I need to
step my game up man
we need to come up with the next
Facebook assign man
his motivation man sometimes its
motivation you know especially now when
when I downsized I feel like I'm gonna
just save so much man next apartment
that I moved toward the next house I
moved to I'm gonna have something
comfortable also too I wanted to ask you
guys what do you guys think about this
so since I'm probably gonna move in a
few months right I was thinking I was
like yo what if I get like a decent
sized apartment decent-sized house and
then I could have some extra money in my
pocket and then I actually rent out like
a loft right we rent out like a good
office space so I could do all my videos
you know buy some lighting you know
maybe get some interns in there you know
like have like a nice studio set
but aside from being in my house at the
same time I feel like when I'm home I'm
home you know what I mean it's like even
I get lazy but if I go and I rent out my
own office space and I say hey this is
just for work I think it's gonna be more
than JIT you know so what do you guys
think should I should I open up my own
office like I think that would be so
don't man like I'll be so excited I'll
be honest with you like I was looking
online I was like it's not even that
much it's like say Sunday's office a
hundred dollars a month to rent a pretty
sighs sizable freaking office I was like
oh it's not bad I get my whole
office
sorry legit
I'm thinking about doing that cuz look I
was watching this guy on what's this
guy's name unbox therapy right I think
that's his name on his YouTube channel
and he has like a freaking compound he
has like a a building for him to
do YouTube videos I was like man I need
to get on that level I need to really
work hard right now this year so I could
do that you know maybe I opened up
like a small office but then next year
we just open up something big you know
have like a nice studio nice lighting
nice cameras what else
I have like a music room half like a
music studio have another studio or like
recording another studio for
post-production I don't know maybe I'm
thinking too big right now I'm just a
low low ass youtuber I thought I was it
was 5,000 6,000 subscribers right what
the hell do I know like I feel like I
could do it I really feel like I could
do
I was watching who I was watching to
today I was watching Chris Hawkes so
Chris Hawkes was talking about that he
don't know what was his purpose for
YouTube like he got the mic or sponsors
and this and that but at the same time
he don't know what the hell is his focus
on on YouTube and I was thinking about
that that she made me think too I was
like man I think I know my focus already
I think I know what I want out of this
like I want to create a cool community
have people to just be motivated at the
same time give them advice share my
experiences you know let them know what
happened to me the good things the bad
things
the tech industry
but yeah I was like watching him he's
like talking about that heat you don't
know if this and that like you know if
he's gonna come back around he should
stop Bay or you know he's getting too
big because you know a company might
find him online
he might you know and it's kind of true
I think about that too like you know
sometimes I come in here I curse on
YouTube and this and that and I don't
care right but what if let's say right
now I'm stable I'm financially stable
one good but what if I can't
for all you know provide for my family
or some like that or I get fired or
I get whatever it something could happen
right what if something bad happens and
then I'm overhearing you to cursing I'm
over here you to give it out so much
knowledge and somebody comes in and be
like oh man you know we would hire you
but you know you got this YouTube thing
I mean can you leave it alone or can you
do like on a press conference or some

saying like you know you denounce
whatever you say on YouTube or whatever
and I was thinking about that was like
man that's why this this is why I want
to go so hard at this because like I
don't want to be in a situation where
I'm gonna need anybody else I don't want
to need nobody else I don't want to need
another company to pay for me
in my family to survive in this world
you know like I want to be independent I
don't want to be focus on that
 but I oh my god what if somebody
sold me online cursing because this just
stays sealed forever right so I don't
want that I don't want to be worried
about I just want to live my life and do
the videos I want to do and do what I'm
gonna have
yeah man that's what we got right now
Yeah right have a freaking another
channel where I'm just covering my face
with just a ski mask just like hey guys
what the
welcome to Joel's workshop
alright something like that but to be
honest with you guys
I don't care I really wouldn't care if
like an employer time and at all we
googled your name and your name came up
on this website what is YouTube account
where you know you're cursing this and
now I'll be like yeah that's my personal
time I don't care about that well
I'll be honest I kind of wish I was in a
situation I just woke up quick this I
could be like okay cool time to quit
give me a reason to not come in here
I got I'm pretty much done as far as
like working for anybody else ever my
life and now because my company is bad
it's just I think I've outgrown it I
think I can do other stuff I can do
other things
you know even with my private clients
you know I could just come in and make
enough to wax and survive if I wanted
talking just go remote and just work
from like you know from my house for
multiple clients or companies I have the
skills you know like that's a went
bad in my life like if I was like really
really bad I'm gonna kill man I just got
a call a remote you're gonna find me a
fiver oh but that's what you got to plan
your life out man you can't you can't do
crazy plus like I told you guys
just because you know code it doesn't
mean that you have to work for a company
you could make your own business you
basically create websites for your own
clients you don't have to work in a
nine-to-five
all right all the difference is you're
gonna have to pay for insurance and like
who cares if you make enough money who
cares
people are like benefits is like
something great or something amazing
like out-of-this-world benefits is
pretty much they're saying okay
what you've got to pay for insurance 50
dollars who cares if at the end of the
month you got to pick 200 others like if
you're not what a company with benefit
that's fine you paid that $200 on the
others is not gonna make you
poor you know what I mean like who cares
if you gotta pay for your own insurance
I'm not gonna see me crying for that
shape
Plus people act like people get sick
every single day it's like I have
insurance right I haven't gone to the
doctor I went to the doctor went like
around February so all this time
the insurance is just getting paid for
no reason like that always
pisses me off too because I'm gonna kill
every month they take this money out of
my check right and technically it costs
me $50 and then the employer calls him
like $400 $400 right there's a really
good insurance and so for $50.00 I get a
super super discount all right but it's
like my employer and me are paying for
something that I'm not using you know so
it makes you wonder
makes you wonder like yo is that
really working it's worth it if god
forbid you get cancer doubtful but you
get a is god forbid you get oh
no it's a tumor some crazy like
that right it's really worth it in our
situation but if you're just a person
with
you know headaches for a few years a
person with
I don't know what was like simple
 like oh you catch a cold
every winter you're pretty much paying
insurance for no reason
but that's that
yeah I would do last year
sorry guys sound freaking garlic carbody
now I would do that open up my own
my own firm but the only thing is that I
I don't know it's weird I just don't
want to be coding for other people's
projects like I love to code but I'm to
the point where I'm like almost nobody
has a cool project right it's not like
somebody's gonna come in to you and be
like oh man we're gonna make the next
freakin I don't know the next Spotify or
we're gonna make the next
RDO or the next world star or the next
 I don't know what other website
I would like to make the next Facebook
no they don't want that people just
want to sell products online right so
you're always gonna be working either on
an e-commerce website or a real estate
website or you're gonna be working on a
finite financial website like stocks
stockbrokers that's it or you're gonna
work for a digital design agency you
know building
little restaurants or Rena
states or a musician who wants a little
website you know nobody's really hiring
for like the cool jobs you know like
when it comes to it when it comes down
to it
that's how for you I guess I've been in
this game for too long right but I feel
like there's not that many cool projects
where you're like oh man they hire for
Krystal Lange and get like yes imma go
in there I'm gonna work in Krystal right
like there's no jobs or like that the
 that we like there's no jobs you
know right so we have to do things that
we don't like like PHP it's not my
favorite language everybody knows that
all right
but it's the language that puts money in
my pocket so is it going to work every
time that I go to work I gotta work on a
PHP PHP has been around for like 20
years
you know if PHP is your favorite then
yeah you're gonna have fun but I would
really love to work on maybe like a Ruby
on Rails maybe on crystal and maybe
Python
well there isn't that many jobs for
there's like jobs for machine learning I
would love to to learn like a machine
learning and
all the cool that's coming out
about the same time there's a big
process to it you can't go in there with
you know a calculus tool you know you
gotta go in there where at least linear
equations and advanced mathematics you
can't just show up in but I hey guys
could you hire me for you know they you
know i coalition machine
learning and data mining all this
right they're not gonna hire you for
that because there's this duel that
just came out of MIT what a
 math and science degree who's
been doing nothing but math for the past
 seven eight years you know what
I mean so you're not gonna get hired and
even myself I'm not gonna get higher
because this is a whole different world
it's like right now it follows to the
sign but hey I'm gonna switch out to
software development software
development is totally different from
what development is at the same time for
a guy who's blowing software development
to switch up to what development is
totally different it's a whole different
world
man man even Christians luck could bring
him into a chop like to that man
behavior his luck his luck he's not
gonna bring
he was like Oh Chris Shanker doy he's
lucky
now even the luck
unless you go in like I intern or some
 like that and work just be a way up
they're not looking for that
we gotta have a set amount of you know
math experience to get those type of
jobs
that's why I was like when I look at how
cold is website on Udacity and they're
like oh machine learning come learn
machine learning it was like this
 people like you think Joe Schmo
the mechanic is gonna be able to get a
machine learning job no man so it's like
I feel like this should be an honest
with people but I hey man there's other
requirements you know before you you
take this courses let's be honest with
you what do I think about freak okay
freak Oh campus like it's like solo
learning right it's like some something
to just go in there and just practice
you can't come out of there as a web
developer you just know how to
you know remember
because I see so many people that they
come in and then I oh they put on their
portfolios on our own freako Camp Creek
okay I'm certificate front end
fronting whatever front end certificate
and then you look at it and you're like
wait this person he don't even know how
to call it his website looks
super basic
it's like Rico chemists go for practice
man
but trust me guys it's not a place where
you're gonna learn how to become a web
developer
you know I like the guy who created it
wasn't it Quincy something you know I
like what they're doing they made it
into a community and they even have a
YouTube channel which is pretty cool too
but I don't think that that website is
gonna teach you how to cover what people
need better structure than that you know
following little things to do is like
like this if I go I'll tell you hey this
is how to write a function and then the
next step is you write the function that
I just made for you you don't know how
to code all you did was just
remember whatever you just saw in two
minutes ago right there's a big
difference but when you have like an
instructor or somebody that's pretty
much breaking it down for you and
explaining to you like hey this is how
we we build a website this is how we
start you know going section by section
I think to me that works better
that definitely works in many times
better cuz like Foucault cameras just to
practice guys it's not it's not a
freaking thing where you're gonna go in
there and learn how to code
you're gonna get practice with us it's
not gonna make your brain start thinking
like how do you start coding this thing
all it does it just helps you remember
certain things and it's cool because it
gives you like a little algorithms it
tells you hey there's a cool algorithm
whatever doing like this this how you
splice oh object if I use Rhys
I'm like it's fine it's not
it's not that bad but it's not a place
that you're gonna learn everything it's
just gonna be like a good prey no place
to practice I was saying if you're
taking a udemy course free cocaine will
be a good place to practice so like I
say once you watch a course and you're
like you know what let me give myself a
little practice or like let's say you at
the airport or you're on the train
you're like you know what let me just
try this out real quick and practice my
little HTML CSS or my JavaScript that's
why it's good for
all right what
Oh God I'm so sleepy
yeah
tonight I might do another video that's
the thing that I really love like
teaching courses and then teaching
people tutorials and just teaching them
right cuz I'm laying right now I can't
wait and I came out I was doing courses
this morning and I knocked them out all
other videos for today all right and
then I started playing ps4 for a little
bit and then now I'm outside and now I'm
like man I can't wait to get home and
start coding again like I want to finish
all this right because right now
I'm doing all the HTML CSS videos I
finished them today then now I'm gonna
code the page then from there we gotta
jump to JavaScript JavaScript is gonna
be a little bit more exciting than these
thing know CSS because like I've done
this for like almost ten years no
HTML CSS in the back of my head for so
for me it's kind of work all right I'm
excited for the next level
we're gonna jump to JavaScript and then
from there we're gonna jump to PHP and
laravel then after that I might jump
back to JavaScript and start doing so
react
and after that I don't know what else
maybe I'll teach Ruby
then after Ruby I don't know
maybe I'll start teaching
Oh Jas
I'm probably gonna do after JavaScript
I'm probably gonna do no js' there's a
lot of people wanting
forgiving what they were
Oh
so Stevie
all right guys this half an hour trip
from the lot into New York it's over as
you can see we're in New York City look
at that beautiful city Ben see that
right there boys
Empire State Building
I'm a city boy and if you can't make it
in New York you can't make it anywhere
man look at that city boy
I'm losing it my whole life man
my whole life in New York City man
New York is
it's not that bad it's just there's too
many people
there's way too many people look nice
and was reading my stuff about New York
City is that all the rich people and
other people that make money that live
in the city and then outside of the city
like Brooklyn the Bronx Queens
there's two working people so it's like
most people their dream is to move to
the city and they're like oh man when I
get to move to the city that's what I'm
I made it but their reality man
it's staying worth it
hey guys I'll see you guys later man</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
