back on it again man coating please calm
listen guys man got their asses out here
the summers hear your voice out here
bouts are making videos outside you know
little lifeless this enjoy my day send
them out here man and you know enjoying
the weather all right done so right now
we're just gonna talk about just
following instructions you know when you
work in a company you have to follow the
instruction there might be a senior
developer there might be a project
manager there might be somebody above
and you gotta basically different action
you know I'm sorry for god damn bird how
here but is real Linda mesh so yeah
yeah you've got to make sure y'all
ethnicities make sure yeah you know you
pay attention to watch out boys you know
like most of the time to them gives you
a list of the things that you have to do
and just follow that list a lot of
companies they use something like ah
with the project camp of custom images
but my company we use our free cap which
is pretty good pretty legit nuclear and
user for yourself I will recommend it
you know yours you want to keep a list
of all the tasks that you have to do
your job you know anything
changing the menu resort I new features
whatever it is that you actually need to
do you know this pretty much keeping
order in the task manager now going back
to the main title you know you see what
I said a title what cut is going to be
you know you guys got a final
instructions hey there's somebody that I
know that pretty much pretty so much
might get cut off you know like somebody
might get him fired aside here because
the person doesn't follow instructions
only pretty much government he may
follow up what I was convention tomorrow
i revelled documenting said no matter
what we do and while we give him and
what we tell him who the guy pretty much
does whatever he wants and his own way
older developers so somebody who who has
man have it on that habits like you know
and most of you guys are bringing
developers but hopefully when you get to
a senior level the only you know you
don't come in with your bag right you
just come in and new job do is you have
to do but at the same time if somebody
tells you hey this the conventions that
were following today's well when we
actually talk for the project just
because they used to do a certain way or
another company doesn't mean that you're
going to do it in weight and demean you
got to remember that
there's always going to be somebody of
fun even with the person younger than
you even as the person might be in the
industry less time than you you might be
a super senior you might be 20
years in into the industry you got to
learn how to follow instruction right
you know when I go into a company I know
people who thing above me and they only
bring around for like a year but the
same time I follow instructions because
that person he's put in the position of
our manager role or position or pretty
much project managed to hold the whole
project whatever right so that's what
I'm saying hey like you know this person
most likely you've gotta get let go most
likely is gonna lose his job and for
what we're not listening not paying
attention now now listen to what people
got ourselves or what I've got to say
you know I was like come on man in order
me late w game up listen to what your
managers have won your other developers
are selling if they have a convention if
it's to two spaces instead of all you
know orc attacks or whatever it is where
it could be hey we don't use semicolon
here which I was Korean whatever it is
guys like just phone stop trying
to come in with your your own style or
 I'm gonna hate man is my style
guide it's how I cold it doesn't work
like that we work in a big teeth you
have to basically somebody has to say
hey this is what we're doing we can't
just come in and start coding however
