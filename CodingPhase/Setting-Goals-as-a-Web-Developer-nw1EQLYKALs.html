again man coding phase comm your boys
backing out and did it again you did
so we ain't here man we gotta talk about
goals man you gotta have goals when
you're developing when you're
programming when you are a software
engineer you gotta have goals for
yourself and see what you did last year
you know right now we in December and we
have to understand okay
cool what I did last year that was great
that was awesome now 2018 I want to do
way better stuff right so you got to put
yourself some goals okay for example
let's say you oh what the
all right you already know HTML CSS I
can throw you any design that I can give
you and you could pretty much build it
right what's the next step for you you
need to actually say hey okay I can
build any design well how can I make it
interactive
all right so make sure your JavaScript
skills are really up to par and also you
want to make sure that if you already
know the basics of JavaScript you're
looking into another framework right so
you want to get yourself into the flow
of being a front-end engineer all right
so now you gotta know stuff like angular
stuff like react it's up to you which
one you want to choose and which one you
will stick with everybody works
differently and you gotta understand one
is more for startups or honest more for
people who are like to have control of
things in other words more for
enterprise you know corporate companies
so you gotta choose between one of the
two now what I was saying personally I
would choose yeah because react is gonna
make you a way better JavaScript
developer and you don't have to really
worry about learning ng this you know ng
finders or your freaking V binders V
buying that like you don't have to worry
about
all you need to know is just JavaScript
so instead of you having to learn a
framework it's more of like okay this is
JavaScript and this is just a framework
that makes my life a little bit easier
to work with the DOM and have everything
more reactive right but that's why I
like react that's on me
you know not everybody thinks like me
some people be like I don't want to
write HTML in my JavaScript I want to
have my views completely separated from
everything that I'm doing in JavaScript
I want this to be two different things
javascript and HTML if that floats your
boat go ahead you know what I mean it's
up to you now the next thing that I will
say is start writing down applications
right just because you know how to build
things and you know how to actually work
with JavaScript doesn't mean that you
have to just stay there and but okay
cool there's all I know how to do with
this you know when somebody gives me a
task or gets me a project out building
now put yourself some goals be like hey
this year I want to build a social
network this year I want to build up on
Instagram this year I want to build up a
mobile application this year I want to
do down our software you know think of
things that people need right make a
list of the things that you need like
you know sometimes you go let's say for
example to Macy's and you're like man I
hate waiting online how about they
create an app where you could literally
come in sign in through your phone and
say okay I'm gonna sign in and then send
me a text when I'm ready to go to the
cashier
that's it that's application right there
you know little things like that people
are gonna be grateful people are gonna
come in and but oh cool we could
actually use this you never know you
might sell that as a
software-as-a-service
or you might sell it as an application
you know what I'm saying like you know
skies delivered you know only you as a
developer can create things that haven't
been done yet but you have to think
about it in a way of like hey what do
people really need you know don't just
build things just to build them but I
hey I'm gonna do it to do happen every
single framework that's out there that's
not gonna make you a better developer
right so you have to put in goals for
yourself you know last year you did the
front-end cool this year focus on the
backend learn my sequel my sequel is the
most used database out there period you
could access anybody at some point
you're going to have to use my secret no
it doesn't matter where it doesn't
matter what language doesn't matter if
it's in Python PHP JavaScript doesn't
matter if it's c-sharp some point you're
gonna have to use sequel you know what
I'm saying so put that as a goal right
of course you wanna play around with
MongoDB cuz you never know there might
be a company that hires you say hey we
use MongoDB it's not the norm but
nowadays a lot of people are jumping on
it so if you go and work for a start-up
most likely they're gonna be working
with MongoDB so you want to know the
basics to be honest with you I think the
moment you know JavaScript you're
already comfortable with MongoDB cuz
MongoDB is just like JSON data
and just you know to me I look at it
functions and methods from JavaScript
that's it that's how I look at it that's
how easy it is to me but for some of you
guys you might want to you know go look
around you know there's a couple of
courses that I have below that you guys
can definitely check out you know
there's a lot of good ones coldsteel
