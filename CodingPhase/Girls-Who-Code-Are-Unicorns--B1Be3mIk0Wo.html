back at it again man listen coding
face.com the only place to get the ruse
yeah alright guys so listen so we never
talk about females as developers right
so I saw this online somewhere where
people were like pretty much hating
little girls code they're like oh my god
there's so many girls trying to apply
that you know there used to be designers
and nothing they want to be developers
like come on guys like let them cold man
code is not just for guys cold is for
everybody
you know what I mean like stop any
freaking sexist stop being a freaking
asshole out here straight-up like I love
girls who actually called man I don't
know if you guys know about this girl
who who basically came out and in a
campaign and basically she was like hey
I'm actually a engineer and like people
were saying oh she's not an engineer
that paid her to be a model in that like
why did getting you know such a pretty
girl to become a model for engineers she
don't look like an engineer like come on
guys like you know how stupid you guys
sound like this guys out there who are
pretty much hating on girls who want to
learn how to code man you know why and
it's for the same reasons like there's
no not hating to anybody but this is a
small section you know like those little
nerdy guys who like playing Dungeons and
Dragons and and dissing that like you
know it was like super truck easing like
super nerdy like they don't want other
people to get into the industry so like
when they see a girl especially with a
you know a beautiful girl be like oh my
god she can't join the club
she cannot join the club like they see a
guy like me come into the gaming just
 off the game
you cannot be a developer like I'm
constantly reading comments and people
who you know leave dumb comments are out
here like oh he's funny like I seen this
the other day like he's funny he can't
be a developer
he cannot be a developer he gotta be
freaking come on man like just because
the kid is real like that doesn't mean
that I'm not a developer man come on
anyways getting back to the girls man
girls who code are the best man like in
my company right our back-end developer
it's a woman right and she's like super
smart like she'd be busting our ass all
the time and you know what she's been
doing this for years like it's crazy
like she's been doing this since like
the eighties so she's I think she's like
57 60 something cuz she's semi-retired
but still work with us like it's weird
but she's like legit legit super smart
lady like she just comes in knocks out
all the database she comes in knows any
language that you throw at her she's
been doing this for years
like she's nasty with it so that goes to
say like come on guys
we cannot be out here you know hating
our females who gonna become what
developers or they want to become
programmers or computer scientists like
we have to actually motivate them it and
push them forward cuz I'll be honest I'd
rather see a girl who's smart and like
busting my ass then a girl who's like I
don't know like in a strip club and I'm
like girl like you who actually be so
much more than this like you know what I
mean like there's more to this world and
Instagram being like Instagram home or
or like trying to catch guys for for
money you know and stuff like that I'm
like you who actually be like super
smart like right now there's like the
Renaissance era right now man like
straight up me if you were woman you
could become like legit like oh oh oh
super developer out here it's
straight up like I'm not even lying to
you guys you know what I because number
one you have certain advantage a lot of
the companies they work willing to come
in to work to balance things out because
it's weird to have 95% male and then
there's no females in there like it's
just weird you know what I mean
like the world doesn't you know work
like that so most companies they
actually given the women a lot of
chances that even guys might not even
have because at the same time they're
like hey we're trying to bring domain
you know females are actually a minority
inside of the web development industry
so I would say girls go ahead man
cuz you know what when when you see a
female who's a developer it's like don't
take it the wrong way but it's like
seeing a unicorn out here man like like
women are like the new unicorns of like
development like straight up like they
got you know the super smart
they're like super helpful
they help you out with
everything and like their energy is
always positive
like straight it up I haven't met one
female developer who's like a you know
like a bitch like straight up ain't like
somebody who actually show me one and
maybe I'll change my mind
but so far like every woman has been
super cool that I bump into like they
play video games and hang out with the
guys and then at the same time you know
like they're super cool of course once
in a while you know there might be a
queue lower you know a little developer
girl and guys is trying to swarm in
because they don't know how to act
they're like oh my god there's a girl
you know there's a girl in the club like
they don't know how to act so it's like
guys come in in the way oh can I take
you out and I do this and that which I
don't think is wrong but at the same
time is in a work environment it makes
it weird because what if that girl goes
and be like hey listen I got a boyfriend
so now from now on you're gonna
that we're vibe between y'all where it's
like it's God trying to hit on me or you
know this girl said no to me like come
on guys don't even do it to yourself
I'll be honest with you guys if it
happens naturally anything year but
don't go out of your way to be trying to
holler at a girl just because she's a
defender for me like oh maybe I could
get in there you know what I mean like
don't do let's see yourself guys but
yeah man
I just wanted to say like this man girls
are the new freakin unicorns out here
girls who code are the new unicorns I'm
here man look like straight up like
there's no way around it like when I
have my own daughter I want her to
become a developer like straight up
