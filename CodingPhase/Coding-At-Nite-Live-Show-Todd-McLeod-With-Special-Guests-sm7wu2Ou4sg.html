again man : face calm listen my fault
man I was just recording a video live
and there was no audio that's my fault
okay kids you already knows the boy jump
back at it again man coding phase calm
me in here alright so anyways I'm
summing up basically somebody left me a
comment told me the hey man you know
like you basically bringing down Todd
McCloud he's a great professor and he's
dissing that and I'm like yes he is I
think his course is great for a college
course right it's not great for you to
me I don't think that the format that he
does the goal and course is good for you
too and that's pretty much what I said
in my last video which was um I don't
know a few months ago he you know and I
feel bad because now whenever you search
Todd McLeod like my video shows up so if
you come here and say Todd McCloud hey
you search his name shows up my my
review of his course do you guys really
think that I wanna like bring this
person down guys really think that I
want to be here leaving a bad comment or
a bad review no I actually bought all
his courses right and I couldn't return
any of them I returned one of them
because basically that was the only one
that I had that was not expired I
claiming get my my refund back so pretty
much he got my money anyways so I think
I have a right to leave a review about
his course if I think it was bad in
which I do think it was bad it was it
was really a bad course and not because
the content itself is battle that he's a
bad teacher that he don't know what he's
doing is just for online course
especially for you whenever like you
sign up for course on udemy you say hey
I want to learn sass right you're
expecting to learn sass you're expecting
to get a few projects on sass right
you're not looking for the introduction
to JavaScript you're not into looking
for the introduction to computer if you
don't if you don't know how to use a
computer in 2017 you're not looking for
a Todd MacLeod goal and course right
that's where it comes down to if you
don't know anything about how computers
work you are not looking for his course
so pretty much the people who are
looking for his course which is gold and
no beginner and I mean no beginner there
is not somebody who just woke up today
and say oh I know I wanted to code it
element to my first night was to be goal
a nobody wakes up like that right so
everybody that takes that course they're
pretty much intermediate to already
expert in web development right or
programming in general they'd be coming
from job are they coming from c-sharp
that's why don't review for it was bad
it was like hey this course gets a
failing grade because if I'm coming in
I'm like hey I'm an intermediate
developer I'm a expert developer and
uncle I want to learn go leg why am I
getting 3-4 hours of just like
content that I know already you know
what I mean like that's why I gave it a
bad review it's not because I want to
say hey Tod MacLeod is bad I don't hate
the guy I like the guy then he's funny
and he laughs at every two seconds I do
that too so we got a lot of same
common you know so I think he's cool
right he's a good guy seems like a
family man which is great I'm a family
man too but all I'm saying is I have the
right to leave for review right it's the
same thing when I had left a message
about Chris Hawkes do I want people to
when they search
Chris Hawkes - for my thing to show up
first before any of Chris holds video no
I don't want that to happen right I
don't want it that the first thing they
see is a negative thing about Chris
Hawkes that's not my fault that YouTube
does that right that's why I deleted
that video but for this course
I'm not going to delete this this review
because the reality of it is that it's
not a good goal and course it's not guys
I'm sorry for all the fans that time
MacLeod might have and you know you're
for Todd I'm sorry bro Lake this is not
nothing against you at all I think
you're super cool right somebody might
do a review my channel I'm not gonna
come in and be like oh delete that video
because it's showing up I'm sorry
that's YouTube's problem that's not my
problem right that's not my problem that
is showing up I have a right to make a
review and make an honest review you
know unlike some of the practices that
udemy does you do mean if you leave a
bad review they'll push it down to like
200 levels below but if it's a good
review I'll bring it up I'm gonna take a
person that I don't go through the first
reviews alright good I go through the
word start bad even when I buy something
on Amazon I don't care if it has 4.9
stars
I wanna know why somebody gave it a word
star because most likely that problem
that that person had I'm going to have
right so that's why I make the review
right it's not against Todd McLeod the
person it's against the course I have
the right to just basically come here
and do a review on the course if it's
good it's good if it's bad it's bad and
the reason why I even most of the time I
find so many courses are bad now I don't
even waste my time to even you know try
to do a video body but it was the fact
that I had so much expectation for this
course not only is it a best selling
list
not only does they have supposedly he
has 45 thousand or something
that are people that have full courses
for him so technically he's supposed to
be one of the best right so I'll go and
take the course and then when I get
there I'm like wait this is pretty
mediocre for somebody who's in the top
and the tops here which makes me think
at the same time it makes me think like
there is some type of connection between
advertising and you know um opportunity
sometimes you know somebody could create
a course in udemy right it's like what's
the guy's name Rob personal suction like
that right
what development 2.0 assumption like
that that course is another course
that's horrible you go in there and
you're like why am i going to
this this is horrible
alright sometimes like right now
somebody could come up with I don't know
um let's say the Harry Potter Network
right Harry Potter framework right and
they the first person to make that
course udemy latches onto that person
says hey you've been here for a year and
a half
not reviewing not going through the
course and say oh this is the best
course know what they do is this
person's been here he was the first one
to create this course so now because he
created this course now he gets all the
promotion now he gets to show up on
everybody's search results when
I research goal name is the first course
that shows up at the top not because
it's the first it's not the best one
it's because it was one of the first
right so the system is messed up right
now one of the reasons why I created
this channel so basically say hey this
was our good and this was our bad nobody
here wants to come here and spend time
 several hours in into a course
and be like man this is is bad I'm
not learning anything I'm well
it's like for me I was seven hours in
like four hours four to five to seven
hours around there in and I'm like where
the am I gonna cold go lay you
telling me I'm going through this whole
 introduction to computer science
introduction to computers and
action to how to close up
windows and you tell me in those
hours I don't get one golden
 coat I can create one
application you're telling me in all
that time I can't go in and
create a application when I pay
for ball and chords that's what
I'm saying you know so it's not
impersonal against God
same for me like somebody might
come in and give me a bad review but I I
 hate this chat Oh fine go ahead
hate it man leave a bad review leave a
bad comment I leave for the bad comment
if it's racist I'm the lunation cuz I'm
not gonna have no racist up in here
know what I mean I don't want people to
see my my comments and be like oh man
there's racist and what development I
don't even want to think like that even
though there might be some racist dual
down here a whole bunch of
racist Russians that'd be even
common Demetrio wait and
check through barking leaving a whole
bunch of crazy but I'm deleting
those if it's an honest review I'm
leaving it that's it you know what I
mean
so it's the same thing with this I'm
leaving that that review there man
I'm sorry Todd it's not against you I'm
not getting no fuels out of it I'm not
gonna know oh how you call this
oh no new subscribers out of it it's
just pretty much like hey we have to
just beyond this year it's the coiler
for somebody who is trying to learn
golden no and it's not what kind of
sucks is that there's not that many good
courses in : there hasn't been a good
instructor a good professor who comes in
is be like hey I'm gonna teach : I was
actually talking to Stephen Grider the
other day through email and I was like
man you gotta create a goal and course
man because it's much needed out here
like people want to learn it but there's
nobody here doing it justice nobody
doing this properly
so hopefully one day he'll do it he he
says it's on his list
you know let's see what happens you know
is like a lot of people are making so
much money in JavaScript to just leave
JavaScript or courses out and start
focuses on :
because what sucks is there's more
beginners more beginner courses because
there's more junior developers taking
courses right now for somebody who's
intermediate or expert there's really
not a there's really not a group for us
you know there's not not somebody who's
like hey man we're gonna create the
courses for you guys now they're doing
it for like super beginners so that's us
we kind of get
no because it's like now we don't have
nobody now we don't have nobody that
speak up for is nobody that comes in and
gives us a chorus that's too many for
other people two hours of hey
this is a variable and we gonna
spent two hours on how to write
a variable and we're gonna make the
courses look long because we actually
want to make it long and make it 42
hours so people could think hey you're
getting a bang for your buck this is
 that's all I'm gonna
say
but anyways um I'm pretty sure our
people relate to this thing where it's
like you buy a course in my arm and is
32 hours 30 so you take it out you're
gonna create so many absence when cool
 you get there is two hours
of this how you write a if statement
this how you write a switch statement
and you're like wait what why are we
spending so much time into this
create the app and create and
 teach me the language
it's not that hard
alright let's go to the the live
sorry guys man you know how I do man
sometimes I go in it's not a rat is it's

right now um as far as like are you you

what level you a crater so you like yeah
yeah yeah that is trash
yeah I would look when I first started
seen tree house I don't know for you boy
Chris on it worked right but for me when
I went in there man I'm like yo
team tree houses viel like you
go in there and you're like I don't know
like they go and teach you like one
little thing then they go and teach you
like a little quest like a little quiz
I'm like three questions and then you go
and move on to the next subject and it's
like when are we building like a full
application like you know what I mean
like that's how I learned I learned my
building I don't learn by breaking
things in little things that all here
here are functions here are switch
statements like I don't learn like that
you know that was much I'm trying to
warm up at mindful that you sure trying
to say give me a second hold on i mister
give me one second let me check I have
one so people could actually hear us
good and you got molera a how do they my
sock Hey oh man
I mean led if you used to head out with
me like no bag not this internet troll
shape but you'll be like it let it he'll
be like oh your boy Joe is front man I
try to have fun man this kind of stuff
uh give me one second I don't want
nobody to leave I want everybody to stay
right there I'm just looking for my
headphones this is because I want you
guys to have a really clear audio and
you know I don't want people complaining
like oh my god it sounds like and
also you know love it
hi I'm back a national health goals
I gotta see I got some throwback
headphones real quick sorry I got this
wasn't prepared guys this was just live
in Ohio man on spontaneous I'm liking a
woman
let's bring two people into this man
let's go live let's get the squad in
right back
I got it I'm in here
all right man here we in here we got it
we got it
wow she did handle with it yeah ask me
whatever man we in here
whoo-hoo
Oh spit and got your boy camming here
now man
you know that's I'm saying MA
but yeah so um we gotta get back right
back to you cam
let me see well one more boy kay Green
is insane right now so using that you
gonna jump from PHP back to the web
developer who can't write that's what
you just said
alright so I mean to be honest with you
look if you were too evil to stick with
the what developer boot camp right from
clothes that are assisting already
brought me the the headphones now but uh
basically is like this you guys should
stick with the what developer boot camp
right because what the what developers
or boot camp from copes steel what it
does it teaches you the whole the whole
range of from the front end to the back
end right once you understand those
concepts right once you understand ok
you if you know HTML and you understand
how to create tags and basically how to
use tags to build a page then you're
ready to jump to CSS once you get to see
a sense and you could say hey I know how
to change a background color right
you're ready to move on like because
once you understand how to target
something you say ok this is how I
target the classes there's how target
the IDS this our target a div inside of
a class where div inside of an an ID or
you say hey this is how I target a
paragraph inside of a div that's inside
of an ID right once you know how to
target those things let's say you're
ready to move on to the next step which
is JavaScript then JavaScript you
basically you use JavaScript as your
first programming language because HTML
CSS it's not programming it's more just
for the view it's just for basically to
style your page or to order
Peter all right then javascript is the
one who's going to teach you what
programming is meaning what's a variable
how to do loops how to do or how to
slice a string how to add things to a in
array which is a list how to add things
to an object like those concepts that's
what you learn from JavaScript right
definitely there I'm pretty sure and
cost of course he teaches you about
jQuery so jQuery is like an easier way
to do a whole bunch of things to
JavaScript but in an easier way you know
now then from there I'm pretty sure he
jumps to bootstrap to teach you how to
do responsive layout with bootstrap yes
when you jump to no js' what it does it
teaches you what the backend is meaning
what's behind the scene because when you
go to a website you create a page you're
like okay I created the page well how do
I save information a website is just a
web picturing but a web application is
when you actually can save data and you
can actually save it to somewhere and
it's persistent meaning if I add it like
let's say an example right I'm on the
home page right and I signed up through
the home page and my name is Joe Santos
and then email is Joe Santos Garcia at
gmail.com and I submitted that in a form
if that information gets saved to the
backend is saved into a database now I
could go to the about page and it still
has that information saved in the
database so all those concepts is what
you learn through the web developers
bootcamp
all right most of the time I tell people
if you're starting from zero start with
the web developers bootcamp right but
then it's up to you if you say hey I
already know how to build a page and I
already got a couple of the concepts now
I want to find a job
as possible then soon as you feel like
hey I'm comfortable and understand a lot
of things from just how websites work in
general then jump to PHP in my sequel
because PHP in my sequel you can find a
job by the end of the month you know
what I mean so it's all up to you you
know sorry my forgiving you it sounded
like a lecture your boy just
went in okay okay now okay yeah so
exactly so so that's the thing that's
another thing about it like you live
close to New York you live in Des
basically in the tri-state area this
most likely plenty of jobs for no GS
when I say there's no jobs is for junior
developers meaning it's like me right
I've been doing JavaScript for five
years when I go to a job interview they
you're gonna like let's say me and you
go into the same job interview right
I've been doing JavaScript in the front
end for five years you've been doing
JavaScript you know you know a few
months right now me and you're going for
the same position and then I okay we
need somebody who knows JavaScript in
them we're gonna teach them how we're
running nodejs
internally here in this company so who
do you think they're gonna hire first
most likely they're gonna hire me
because I've been doing JavaScript for
five years now because I know no js' but
more because I know JavaScript language
right so for you as a brand new
developer it's a little bit harder to
get that position right ask your first
job now for you to say hey I want to get
a job as soon as possible your best
route is gonna be PHP because you
going to have by the wordpress there's
like a whole bunch of jobs of people
that need to be done in WordPress
or let's say you find let's say a
factory uh-oh ecommerce website or a
wholesaler around your neighborhood
right which I'm pretty sure there's
plenty of right because in all urban
cities there's a whole bunch of
resellers right so your first job is not
going to be that ninety thousand dollars
but that's not what you're going for
you're going for just the opportunity to
get in get that six months you know
three to six months experience so you
could go to your next job and be like
okay let me get that 70,000 let me get
that 80,000 you know so if you're
looking for it right away
PHP is definitely the way for you
because it just is so much easier yeah
yeah that's it sounds crazy that just
sounds so I'm so I don't know
man so Zimbabwe yeah that's just
that's the only way sound right that
 is up that's what I thought
but um I know you could definitely get
started more man for sure but I know
what you mean because at one point I
wanted to move to like that area between
Oklahoma Kansas because I've been trying
to get out of New York cuz I feel like I
can't I can't live the lifestyle that I
want to live in New York because I don't
see myself earning four hundred thousand
dollars a year five hundred thousand
dollars a year million dollars a year
right I don't see myself doing another
 cuz I'm not I'm not going that hard
at it
right so when I look at other states
I'll be like man I know one of my
friends who basically has his job is
like $40,000 a year and Florida and also
a huge house I'm like why am i
doing here you know but then when you
look at the jobs over there you start
looking at you don't places like over
there like Oklahoma and they're like man
what the matter
fifteen dollars an hour I'm like whoa I
can't even pay my car with that you know
so it's like how the am I gonna
survive so I definitely understand you
when you telling telling us is like man
I'm only making $8 here you know I
definitely feel yeah exactly
in what you up to can't let me know
okay time so right now have you started
well you start any course or any
websites that you working on
okay yeah but I mean you can still you
can still go through it you can still go
through jQuery because even though
jQuery sometimes it can mess you up in
the sense of like you can use it as a
crutch you know even sometimes I still
do it right this times I'm like man I
don't want to do document gate query
select like I don't want to do all this
 right so sometimes I'm like man I'm
just putting jQuery in this you
know but that's because sometimes at the
job that's what they require that like
they need speed you know sometimes
you're if you write something in
JavaScript like it could vanilla
JavaScript which is gonna be a 20 30
lines of code right with jQuery you
could write down three lines you know
sometimes it's gonna be easier and I
think for a junior developer it's really
really important for you to come to
learn basically jQuery because jQuery is
going to open the doors for you to get a
lot of jobs like a lot of jobs they even
put it on the gang over jQuery because
if you go to a website like let's say
you you get hired for a job in over
there Oklahoma and then they have a
website from 2009 2008 most of their
code is gonna be worth jQuery you know
and it's gonna be for you if you already
know Java square it's gonna be easy to
pick it up you know but definitely just
don't let it stop you just continue it
it just knock it out the way just when I
can continue learning jQuery get through
the whole course and different there
come back swim back to more JavaScript
like a deeper learning of general of
JavaScript itself I don't know if you
checked out the learning was a
understanding and I forgot the name from
this guy yeah from Anthony on the sail
how I used it when I was learning
JavaScript cuz like my story my story
with JavaScript is I had to go back and
learn JavaScript because when I first
started learning JavaScript I learned
the basics and then from there I jump
right away to jQuery to make myself you
know quicker and to be able to be more
more productive so what I did was there
was a lot of things that I didn't know
about like you know prototypical
heritance like uh you know how to
basically do object-oriented programming
with JavaScript so I had to go back and
relearn JavaScript
alright and sometimes some people say
hey that's that's the wrong way to do it
but when you're in a situation where you
need money and you need you know money
in your pocket sometimes you got to skip
certain things and then go back to it
because it's like there's gotta be more
jobs for you like you know if you're
looking for a job right away like when I
was looking for a job I was with my
mom's house man I was broke I
was like yo I'm either gonna be here for
 six months to a year learning
JavaScript you know to the perfect to
the you know to the dot or I'm gonna
just learn what I need to learn and try
to get a job as soon as possible and
that's what I did you know but it's up
to you what you want to do
yeah yeah yeah now some people some
people there is in between right
so the rap course I'm thinking about the
one that the one that are you talking
about the one that's on my description
right now I would that was the
fifty-fifty the reason why I put it was
because that's how I learn PHP that's
how I learned on PHP in my sequel right
so when I first put this thing and I
started creating this YouTube channel I
was like you know I'm just gonna share
the things that I used right but now
there's definitely better courses for my
sequel which that's why I'm gonna re
update on my videos and I'm gonna remove
that because even though the course from
coldsteel blows down without the Box
like you know what I mean like is so
much better than the PHP my sequel
course that I have in the description
like so it's like what yes it's not even
close it's like so good cuz cop Steel's
are really good instructor he
really knows his thing we know so that
that's what's really good about him
that's always tell people man between
coal steel and Steven Grider like any
course that you buy for them is good
like no matter what so you know what I
mean so yeah sass um ah
to be honest with you sass I learned it
from Missy what's this guy's name I
learned on YouTube
sass is one of those things that is not
it's so easy it's not worth buying a
course I'm gonna tell you right now I'm
lookin it up yes
oh yeah it's pretty similar oh let me
see I'm gonna tell you right now okay
level up tuts sass tutorials mislead
ship share yeah so this guy level up
thoughts his channel is one of
the greatest like this one of those
channels that I used to pretty much know
the things that are easy like if you
want to learn jQuery and you want to
take like little tutorials like his
channels legit like he really
knows what the hell he's doing and cuz I
think when he started he was doing a lot
of very good quality tutorials but now
what he does is he drops three to four
videos and then he tells you okay if you
want to see the rest of our videos you
got a pic you gotta pay for it and buy
and his tutorials are way too
expensive I'm like yo I could get the
same for $10 and you to me why
would I paid 50 $100 free course you
know but Milkmen exactly he's like yeah
of course of course
huh this Drive enough they try
to recruit you ass early kick shots to
milk my yeah nah man you know I have no
problems like you know with boot camps
and it's just like the charging
wait so much money for something that
the you know you have like good
tutorials even on YouTube there are
really good tutorials on YouTube right
now the thing is the thing about YouTube
is you've used find more time looking
for a good tutorials than doing code
which is why I pay for you to meet
courses right because when I look at you
limit course up it okay this person took
their time it took them three to six
months to create this course and not go
in a buy it right it's only ten
dollars that's like McDonald's money
right so I buy the course what I
go on YouTube is like I got searched
through like a whole bunch of
videos to find which ones are good who's
actually creating good tutorials who who
actually I don't know who I could
actually stand their voice cuz
sometimes you listen to somebody and
you're like man I can't see myself
listening to this guy for seven
hours you know so that's the day you
know but uh yeah man um if you guys ever
check it out level up touch he got he
got some pretty good tutorial of like
basic stuff you know case another thing
to that I always tell tell people like
not only do you have to take a course on
on you to me right like when you take a
course on udemy it's like right now oh
can you told me that you could you
basically you got through though the
whole cold steel course right you finish
the whole thing okay so now your job is
to create to create a couple of
applications on that before you jump to
something else before you jump on that
have you done the what I told everybody
create a restaurant website creator a
real estate create a blog creator I
forgot the other one our ecommerce store
have you tried those yet cuz do that cuz
this how you gonna basically master this
whole like you basically look at
the code that you did before with cold
steel and then start creating those
websites create at least three different
type of websites you know with user
authentication with uh you know messing
with the database like let's say if
you're gonna create a real estate create
like you know create a tables that's
called our
apartments right or like let's say you
could do a listings right you say okay
listings and like let's say right now we
know those real quick um let's say you
come to Zillow calm right and you try
not to recreate zimmel degree before you
start coding anything you start breaking
things down and you say okay what do I
see I see the half of by ranks sell
right so let's say this to two
categories buy and rent so then you
start writing this down but okay you
create this and say okay this categories
by rent break this down like that
okay that's one table right then you say
okay there's different listings listings
have informational salary so you say
okay you know categories buys rent
that's the categories then you see
listing and you say inside of it you
come in you say title see description
you see rules so you can put in how many
rooms do each listing has then you say
categories type so you basically with my
sequel you will say categories ID
definitely there you say let's see what
else
price okay that's it so then that's
another that's another team then okay we
got that information that's to keep
something simple
now let's say for the login you
basically say users and then you come in
and say okay first name last name um
let's say
was a year income okay let's say frozen
eyes name and put address 1 address -
zip phone what else
hey I mean you got the picture right so
basically you go through that you create
this website with like two or three
different pages it's more like probably
five pages you gotta have a home page
you're gonna have a page that shows all
the listings you're gonna have a page
that shows one listing at a time so when
they click on a listing it takes them to
my show page right and then from there
you have an area where they can register
in a area where they can log it right
also to add a section where you can see
cards all right even though you're not
buying anything well let's say you could
you could add up like let's say items
world listings to that car and each car
is owned by one user so you'll say
something like this you say user ID art
a user ID and then you say was the
listing listing ID and then that's
say so you have that information inside
of it and then like let's say you do
something like this item and then inside
of item you will put in listing ID and
that's it so what that does is basically
you say okay there's a cart right so
when the user adds the listing to the
car they'll take this item and create an
item with the missing IDs information
and now you basically have a real estate
website now that's what that's like one
of the easiest way to practice and to
build you know build upon the the
basically the skills are you learning
from cold steel because if you go and
you start jumping for one satori you say
okay I learned one tutorial and then I'm
like okay I learned PHP and nodejs
whatever never day you jump to something
else and even okay now let me try to
learn on Rails or let me try to learn
Java then you're not really learning
everything you don't know how to put it
together yet so the point of this is for
you to be able to create those websites
without going back into looking at and
whatever calls still create it for you
you know and the only way you're going
to do that is by repetition this thing
is just like you got to repeat it repeat
it repeat it because all of these
websites you will notice that they're
all doing the same
it's a hey there's a page there's the
route there's the shoulder page template
is the the form this form submits to
hear this from once is submitted from
here it adds it to this tables and
that's in every single website does the
same shape so for you to get this thing
like in your head right away just repeat
it multiple times and yeah nothing yeah
yeah yeah no no definitely I mean the
best way is like I said man you gotta
you gotta look at your area look at look
at what what I told people
and I think a video go to videos ago I
said look at your area look at what
places have websites reach out to them
if they don't have a website or they
have a really old outdated website reach
out to them I mean I hate listen I have
this no I'm a work developer in the area
I actually passed through here all the
time and I was like searching through it
I noticed that you guys don't even have
a website
or I noticed that you guys have a
website that hasn't been updated in five
seven years you know I could I should
come in and build it for you guys you
know sell yourself you know because it's
like you have a skill from what I'm
hearing you already have a skill of like
you know you already gone through the
whole tutorials and you already
understanding a lot of the concepts so
let's start implementing that because
you know keeping that in your head
keeping all that knowledge in your head
and not making it work for you it's a
waste of time like right now if you're
making $8 that's it you need to
bust your ass now and start getting
those clients get those freelance jobs
where it's like even right now like even
right now if you go in Christ it's try
to find somebody who needs a website and
they're most likely people pull or post
up gigs and post it up online and be
like oh man I need a I need a website
right charging 300 400 dollars right
it's not a lot it's not thousands of
dollars but extra income that's coming
in if you start getting three to five
different clients every two weeks and
they each pay you three hundred five
hundred dollars you making a decent
amount of money especially if it's
cached no cuz you don't have to clean
that you keep that to the
pocket you know what I mean exactly you
notice I keep that to the pocket
straight-up like that's what I do right
now I do that all the time my god I
just did that for one of my friends
he's opening up all it's funny he's
opening up a strip club so he's actually
need somebody who who can build a
website for him man like your brother
hey Mia I'll build it for you you know
so that's a little come up that's coming
in you know the next few weeks which is
gonna be like extra three thousand
dollars to build this whole website for
him but you know I
don't have to declare that I don't
have to tell nobody hey I made $3,000
extra no you know so for you you go you
know what I mean
now it's definitely you could you could
get it there you could definitely get it
there um that was one of my dreams too
I mean for me was different as I I had
so much man it's like I was I was
in a relationship if I was in a
relationship I would have left New York
I would left a long time ago and
my dream it was to just get to Ari
you know cuz I've been here my whole
life I've never seen anything else I've
never been outside of New York I mean
I've been out but I haven't lived
outside early you know I came here seven
years old from the Dominican Republic
and I've stayed here period I'm not like
one of those people that be like oh man
he you know I lived in before I came
Florida I lived in this and that
my story is New York that's it your boy
never lived anywhere else so for me I
was like man I go to other youtubers
like Chris the freelancer or this other
guy Johnny FD is like this guys they
livin it up man you know it's like
coffee like for me it now is a little
bit a little bit too late you know cuz
they got him you know I already got a
kid I can't just drop a lot of now
but for you if you don't have that
responsibility you could just go and if
I can start living remote you know for
me I'm trying to my goal is in the next
2-3 years is to have a certain income
coming in where I'm not looking for you
know what I'm making now if I can make
about 80 K remote I'm good cuz then I
could just move anywhere that I want but
the certain lifestyle that you already
used to you can't go back down you know
what I mean so for you if you start now
like my favorite yeah like brain now son
you feel exactly like you if right now
you decide you you've been like man I'm
gonna work hard I'm gonna save myself
200 ohm you know $6,000 right you save
yourself $6,000 you bet okay I'm a web
developer I already have clients people
that need my services I know how to get
were clients from websites like Larry
jobs or indeed calm or dice calm and I
could get remote jobs from there because
you already have a certain skill right
even if you decide to be like hey I'm
gonna go to Thailand right now right
Thailand the rent with six six
to eight thousand dollars you already
paid the whole you don't like it
came for the whole year right so now you
can live your life in in a in a way
where you could be free cuz nobody told
you to stay here in the US that's I I
think that we have psychologically
where's like men the u.s. is the best
country in the world it is but the same
time doesn't mean is the best lifestyle
you you know how to live the best life
that you can have in this world it's
like there's people you know even
my cousin's I talked to my cousin's in
the are my god they don't make naive or
 a fraction of what I make here
but they happy all the time because
there's so much to do it the minute
cover public this so much freedom
there's like you know every day
there's a party every day people
go to the river people go to the
beach every day they do something new
here the u.s. is like ah ah you're stuck
to a grind you're grinding all the time
you're like oh man I got a page right I
gotta pay this I gotta pay that so for
you guys that don't have
responsibilities if you can make
yourself um more you know money on the
side or remotely then that's the way to
go man
like I'm being honest that's the best
way to go it's like you could do like a
job here in a company for like a year or
two get your experience and then you
just go remote go wherever you want in
this world you know is I don't get stuck
to just one place and even if you get
hired don't get stopped in the same the
same job because when you come in that
first job then I gotta pay you I'm
being honest with you guys what people
don't come in boot camp don't come in
and tell people that with your
first job you're not gonna get paid
you know they tell you oh you we're
gonna find you a job right away listen
that's what percent of the
except I get those big jobs
right so therefore you who are just you
know the the unlucky words from
 destiny because that's how the
world is it's like if you think
positively think oh I'm gonna get that
number one job in the world I'm gonna
I'm gonna get Google money no that's not
how the world the world works it's like
you know that's like the MBA you
know now everybody's gonna make it to
the NBA so you're either gonna be your
whole life trying to practice to get to
the NBA or say that I'm
playing internationally while doing this
and that you know like you know what I
mean so for you guys just grind it out
but don't get stuck in the same place
you know that's my advice
exactly the only little spoon yeah
yeah yeah yeah now definitely uh I'm a
strong believer in that too cuz they
even went here and like I'll be looking
like you know trying to buy a house and
 like that and I'm like man even
after I bought a house
I gotta pay this for thirty
years and then on top of that the pain
thirty years you pay taxes on a
house which is like 15 mm ah this a
month on a just just on taxes so
it's like it's kind of ridiculous so
you're pretty much a slave no matter
what for the rest of your life you're
always gonna have to hustle to keep
paying these taxes even after
you own it in other countries you don't
do that you bought a house that
said you bought a house goodbye that's
your man and also it's like you
know I know people who go and retire in
places and that's a then I oh they only
make you know whatever they're retired
money which is like $1500 but they live
like kings now somebody who's here who's
earning six thousand eight thousand
dollars a month still got a struggle and
still gonna feel like they always trying
to catch up to the bills you know so
best way is to go remote man and you
know don't don't get attached to things
man cuz that's the thing is like you
start messing up you you got attached to
a car you got attached to your girl you
get attached to a neighborhood
you get attached to your boys you get
attached to this this and that and life
go you know next thing you know you're
like man you 37 years old 47 years
on you like man there goes my my
young age you know so you got to enjoy
that I mean that's that's the good
old man I feel like I busted my ass
learning all the I've been learning
for low a long time even right now I'm
learning again cuz I want to switch up
from being a web developer to actually
becoming a game
developer right so now I'm gonna start
from zero you know so it's like I'm
starting from scratch with like um I'm
gonna be a junior developer on that
you know what I mean so even though I've
been doing web development for a long
time but to me is getting boring because
I'm like I want to challenge myself so
that's I knew so that's why I create a
coder phase one because I saw an itch on
my girl people need to find the
right resources you spend so much time
looking over learning which was the
first programming language I learned
which courses should I buy which website
should I sign up next thing you know six
months go by and you just spend more
time trying to figure it out which was
the right way instead of you learning
anything you know
yeah mother sure happens all the time
yeah
that happens all the time yeah yeah
no that happens to people all the
time like I hear emails
from people that descend me messages be
like yo man I started this
killing four years ago and I every
 I leave it I come in for three
months I'll leave it then the next day I
try to come back in I'm like bro if you
wanna just continue with it back
then you would have been good by now
but the problem is number one you you
don't find the right resources you don't
find people that keep you interested you
know like I tell people all the time I'm
not the best developer I'm not the
 most articulate person in here
in YouTube I'm not the guy with
a stick up his ass and it's like
hi my name is Joe Santos and here are
functions no I'm just here to mow to me
I'm just a regular dude in a
shitty ass room you know like you know
everything I'm just like that's just how
it is I'm just so good yeah I'm just
some regular dog like you know what I
mean like what a this how
how can I keep my I keep my shake
yet okay I keep my shake get on like you
know I mean it like I let her keep
snitches like you know what I mean I
have no shame with it like I just come
in here to motivate I want people to get
out of like you know this the same
 cycle the same circle cuz I yeah
cuz we I know that we could all do it
you know like for me I got out that that
that cycle right but then it's like the
same shades like more money more
problems right so now what I'm realizing
is I want to cut down the problems it
have a certain amount of money that
comes in but with less problems meaning
I want to move to somewhere was cheaper
where I could make every dollar worth
something
you know the here in New York now
I don't know like here where I live
maybe I mean people walking around with
you know like freaking uh you know
Tesla's and a Maseratis and Bentley's
where I live and I'm like man I'm moving
human some ass Nissan Rogue
right and it was like I'm busting my ass
for four or five years to two-door this

and I still feel like I'm not gonna get
to that point because I happy where I'm
at but I still haven't reached to that
point where I'm like hey I'm good I'm
like you know I'm freakin successful and
 like that I'm more to a point where
it's like I'm comfortable and it's like
I don't like being comfortable I don't
like feeling like like I'm uncomfortable
I'm in a comfortable area I'm supposed
to be excellent
I'm just type of person that I want to
be excellent I want it that when people
look at me like yo this kid went from
nothing to like something you
know what I mean so I can't be
complacent I can't see myself being
complacent and be like oh that's a I'm
making $100,000 a year oh cool that's it
that's my goal
no like that that is because
there's other people that I look
in my neighborhood I'm like how the hell
does this guy have this house how the
 does this person on this how the
 this person did this and that and
it's all about hard work sometimes you
thinking ahead oh man they got an
average parent or they got a
have you no money in the bank from back
in the days now sometimes it's just
people work hard you know sometimes
people I was talking to this guy the
other day by RIT I was out riding and a
guy goes to me he's in a Tesla
and he tells me all nice car looks good
and it's like I'm like man I'm like unit
Tesla man like you complimenting me it's
like it's like who the hell am I you
know you're in a testament I ain't
so that's how my mentality is so then
the guy goes like nah man is like you
going up you got a Benz
you should be happy I'm like yeah but
you got a Tesla there's a big difference
you know what I mean so he's like now
don't worry the
it's like 40 years old so he's like
telling me like how old are you I'm like
29 is that man don't worry you're gonna
get one of these in three or four years
it's fine
it's called a growth in life yeah and is
that your is growth in life so you have
to keep pushing yourself and keep
pushing forward so it's like learning
how to code it's just it's just like a
way to to make money in in different
ways it's like just because you know how
to code doesn't mean that you have to
work for a company you know how to call
you it's just the first step exactly
it's like you know some people come in
and they'd be like yo man I I wanna
 create a story to sell keyboards
I don't know mechanical keyboard now
because they know how to create their
own website they could build it and they
could also start selling it or they want
to create a store for clothing or
sneakers or whatever but now they
created it by themselves what I happen
to pay to what developer well happen to
pay a designer you know like this is
just like the beginning you know you you
can't think in your head like oh this is
just like one step it's like my goal is
to work for Google
I'm like no kid Google me I want to
make the boom I'm gonna be there
and have my stamp is like my goal in
mind my success in life was I work for
Google I work like some guy I know from
from my last job he's like listen Kate
like I'll never forget that he was an
asshole he was like listen kid I work
for IBM I work for Intel and I'm like
and your boy and you still here with me
like you know like your achievement was
you worked yeah no he was just like he
was another senior developer but he he
got like this this like you know his
little cheap white shoulder late
night I worked for IBM I work for Intel
and it's like and you still here with me
so it's like that's how I looked at him
like yo bro you went to school
you went to a Columbia
University for computer science I want
to the community college you
went to
try to get a master's I went to a
 City College you know and I
didn't have a degree in computer science
and I'm here with you so it's like you
know what I mean so that's what I tell
people - don't worry about if you have a
computer science degree because when you
get to this jobs in this position
there's going to be people with computer
science degrees that you're gonna be
neck to neck because this is a skill
that is only learn by practicing this is
not something that like oh this person
went to MIT this person went to
Yale no this is about who puts
in two hours
it's like who knows this you know
that's what people care about employers
only care about that they only care
about how many hours have you put in can
you build the website can you build an
application can you create
something cool that's a you know hit him
with it gotta hit him like a kid
let me see who's in the chat room right
now man now we got we got 30 we got 30
people we got 30 people were here
you got 30 people man we got let me see
wasn't here man
yeah yeah notnot because it yeah it's
different type of channels you noticed
it it's different type of chapels
different type of how you call it a
 different groups because these
people that autism Chris Shawn that um
they follow him they don't follow me
and there's people there for my channel
that don't follow him it's like but the
same tell me him we're cool because we
basically came up at the same time you
know there's a two different type of
channel 6 channel is motivational in in
a way of giving you guys good hope and
telling you guys the good things that
have happened to him because of coding
you know like for somebody like me I
look at his channel I'm like yo you know
when I was going through a lot of stuff
where you know my sister passing away I
liked his channel because I was like man
he has such a good positive vibe and
like there's no malice to him like you
know as a person that I liked his
channel cuz sometimes I was like friend
depressed I wanted to see his channel to
feel better about myself and like life
and feel good but my channel yeah he
gives you good vibes like my channel is
more about a man like stop playing games
let's get this money like me and you as
a channels for the people that come from
nothing like I noticed this a long time
ago the people that are privileged guys
who are coming in from we're already
careers they don't come to my channel
meaning guys who already have money and
they like oh they're good and like there
was somebody who sent me a message
inside is like oh I work as a marketing
a microwave on director and I just find
your your channel offensive that's what
I'm not subscribed to you and unlike bro
it's like you is that you don't
understand the ground you you coming
from a place where you're trying to get
into what development but you're coming
from two different places when I started
this thing I come into this channel
giving you guys the same vibe that I
want
to get when I started it's like man I
got a bust - I gotta get money I gotta
get better I gotta live a better life
then where I'm at right now
but there's other people that they're
looking for you know the up up to the
tight ways like you know you come in
with a British accent and be like hey
guys my name is John Smith and we're
 you know it's like here's how to
do : you know this is the proper way to
write a functioning nah man that
doesn't work for me because I don't live
in this fantasy world I live in a
up world where you know people don't
have money where you're Broadway
you don't have nothing Christmas
where you don't have nothing for your
birthday that's where I come from ah let
me notice from month try to heat
up your house with gas
with the oven with the stove
like that's where I come from you know
what I mean you know people
huddle up I run the the oven
like this is a bonfire like
you know like that's what you know what
I mean like I'm coming in here with no
Hollywood like I'm not trying to be
 fake on on YouTube I want it for
people that are like me who coming from
nothing to get motivate if you don't
like this channel is because you feel a
certain way and you've never been
through the struggle that's the reality
is she
anybody who's been to any type of
struggle loves my channel the people
that never been through anything they
have papi and mami to take care of them
and people who coming here and
be like oh yeah I went to a four-year
college and and this and I I went to
Arizona State bro I couldn't even go to
a four-year college because who
was gonna pay for that if I if I
would have run I would have been in debt
I would have had him added money to eat
you know so it's like what the hell did
I what choices I had I had to get on you
to mean and bust my ass learned it's
quick you know I'm just saying though
because like me and Chris are we have
two different types of channels his
channel is more positive my channel is
more realist the people who are in that
situation when
man is like you cameras and you
getting $8 and I was it for you to not
like my channel it would be crazy
because this is the channel that you
need to get motivated and be like yo why
am i doing this I'm doing this
to better my life and bust my ass and
get out out of this thing right you know
so it's like for somebody who comes in
here who doesn't go through that
struggle and don't know what to help
that feels like they like oh man he's
cursing on his videos is I know they can
there's a reason why there's a curse on
it is because life is not happy for me
life is not this uppity world where you
know you're gonna be super freaking I'm
gonna come in every day with a smile on
my face on YouTube no my life is up and
down this deist is gonna be happy this
deez nutz gotta be tight as there's
gonna be sad these days that just gonna
come in like yo we gotta talk people
like you know like that's just how it is
man but which one oh yeah yeah the two
percent it's like people people that's
another thing too you know why come in
here like this right you know this
cause money I'm not gonna lie this
 cost money but this ain't drug
money this ain't no hustling
money this is work money this is
that I got for work you know if somebody
came in to me when I was in high school
you know instead of me seeing like you
know the kids that were hustling or
seeing people that would come in you
know like I remember this the
dudes that would come in with a
beamers in in the Benz you know right
around the school picking up all the
girls and be like y'all and then one
came to me but you know where I got this
money son I got this from Cody if
somebody came in to me out a minute whoa
I gotta start coding son so that's the
the idea that I want to give with a man
you could you don't have to be this
square because this what a lot of people
think then I call man you gotta be a
nerd you got are no math you gotta know
this and that is I know man you don't
have to be a square to axe
the be curtains in this thing
it's more about dedication and loving it
loving to coding and enjoying it and all
the good things is going to come to you
you know so that's why I do it McGill
red plus it it kind of sucks whenever I
go to like a job and I'm like I
gotta go in there and like I'm either
the only Spanish person in there or it's
me and the person that cleans or me in
the warehouse guys are the only
minorities and it's like wait what like
you know what I mean you know because
that's like even one of my jobs right
where everybody in the company
is white and there's nothing wrong with
it but at the same time it kind of sucks
because it's like man why aren't they
more black people more Spanish people in
these positions and it's because this
they don't see that it's like if I go to
worldstar and I start seeing some kid
like you know like risk the kid with a
Maserati money in his pocket I'm
like why do I need school why am I gonna
do this when he's getting money why we
can show you know like you know a black
a black and Latinos
entrepreneurs who are making money out
here
with technology and be like oh those are
the guys that we want to be like I don't
want to be no basketball player I don't
want to be no a football player where
it's like - it's like lottery that's
just the lottery
most of us is not gonna make it today I
rather just be one of those guys are
making money with technology you know so
that's that's a plan man if that's a lot
than to like most people come to my
channels they see that video they see
the all the girls that come to my
channel to see the the the video essay
coding girls are are the cons because
it's true it's like when when a
girl codes everybody's like oh like she
she a developer like oh she had engineer
I was like or most people would take out
all this girl she's the marketing girl
or she stole heiko - the web
designer but nobody thinks that she
could code you know
and sometimes it's up I think for
women in this industry to come in and be
like man number one if you're pretty you
know guys is gonna be on no matter why
you can't run away from that you you
know you you can't run away from that
you know it's like I was this girl's
name April you know due to reckon he is
like whoa
get me Eddie get me April's number give
me a boost thing it's like you don't
think she goes to that all the time
or like when she goes probably out with
like a co-worker and she's like oh I
like John you know he's a cool guy and
then the next thing the guys like you
know April you know what's up you know
if she want to get up in this company
like you know you throw me a little shot
inside it it's like I bless you
you know the girls god bless ya dude do
the Birmingham leg like oh you
can't make a work wanna code like
there's dudes like that you like you
know what I mean so for girls is also
struggle and therefore like you know
Latinos and black guys is like number
one they say you like I don't know now
it's cool it's cool to be awkward you
know what I mean like awkward in the
sense of me not liking the same
that everybody likes you know I remember
like back in the days I used to
love to skateboard people come up to me
like you trying to skateboard that's for
the white boys listen why is it for the
white boys like what does that have to
do anything all right let's say I
remember this K um this K this K Adaro
that I used to know from like junior
high school if I can people he will be
like super cool his mom was a
doctor duh his father was a college
professor right and people will always
be like oh Darrell's not black Darrell
don't even sound black what does black
sound like you know what I mean like
we're like what does black sound like
like you know what I mean like
there's really no no sound to me you
know it's like so sometimes it's like we
just gotta break those barriers and just
be like man right now everybody's just
 human beings and what sucks
about the tech industry is that there's
not enough of us in there so we have to
feel some type of way because it is kind
of weird when is one black guy a
 three Indians and 3450
 developers who are white it just
there's something weird about it to me
is weird because not because they don't
want to hire you is because nobody's
telling this community's like hey you
guys can do this - this is not
something not this is not magic there's
nothing that only white people can do or
smart people can do it's just do
it you know a lot of people don't even
 have it like a option you know
they don't think about this I said
absolutely like all computers man that's
what smart people I'm not trying to be
in front of a computer it's like the
 they mean you be on Facebook all
day
on your phone
bluh
yeah yeah yeah yeah No
yeah yeah yeah yeah you know that's why
yeah yeah no no no no done that's why
this chat and that's why the channels
here that's why these shadows here and
because there's a lot of people that
feel the same way in like you know it
happens to so them to like me
yeah I told my boy my boy Brandon I love
this kid I love this kids like one of my
best friends right and I told him yo son
you gotta get on this I pay for his
courses I gave him like four
courses of you to me did he ever take
him nah cuz I would I logged into their
account and I saw that none of
them got started so I was like bro I'm
trying to put you on and you know what
he does now he cleans windows
and high risers and I'm like you putting
yourself in danger to clean up
somebody's window instead of
being inside of the building you want to
be outside of the building watching the
 window you know so it's like it
don't make sense you know some people
they don't want to they don't want to
get out they want to get out but at the
same time I feel like there's a lot of
kids who are coming up like now just
like this new generation you know I see
it now even from like how everybody's
starting from um just like even though
the whole gay like you know like
the whole gay agenda that's out
there now like people are more used to
being themselves you know like when I
was growing up people will be like oh
you can't do this you can do that if you
want to be gay you could be it
if you want to be a black kid
who likes rock now you could be a black
kid who likes rock you
just beat the same kid who who
like rapping like oh who you like son 50
cent or Dipset like people is
already it's like you have to be in this
box now is it's more open you could just
be yourself and be like hey just enjoy
life and be something else
so I feel like now is where is the time
where kids need that like
the kids start coming up Lego was this
kid's name all milk starts he is
actually a developer because he started
in a program where he was a game junior
high school of like learning how to make
websites for in a camp right for little
kids if he wasn't in that camp he
wouldn't have been a developer most
likely he would have been doing
something else but one of the reasons
why he's he became a developer because
he went to that camp and also he
influenced a lot of other little kids
because even after he graduated from a
camp he stood in the camp and was like a
mentor so now as a guy who's you know
who's african-american you could come in
and but I hate kids I'm just like you
you can make it too you can come in here
get into this industry and you know do
your own thing you don't need to be a
basketball player you don't need to be a
formal player a rapper to make a good
living it's all about this if you have
an idea in your head you can build it
now is the time to create like now
there's like the Renaissance era
where you if you have an idea
you could make a living out of
it you know exactly you know it's gonna
be just like in the 90s you know when
the Internet bubble came in people came
in saying like oh there was an internet
Baldwin and then it burst
alright but what people don't talk about
is the people that became
millionaires and they good till now and
their kids are good till now so it's
like right now we're in an era where
it's like you could come in it's just
like how back in the days with Ford
GMC Jeep when those companies came in
right there's people spoiled a
great dog
not great but grandparents who were
working in the 50s right and they were
able to work in those companies in those
factories to make money in own houses
and own that now they could pass
down to their kids and now it's
generational money
I feel technology right now is the same
the same thing so if you're not in this
industry you're not making money if
you're Joe small the mechanic you're not
making money if you're Johnny dang the
 FedEx guy you're not making
money if you're Antoine Walker
the a vasco player trying to get
into this shake lucre making
money yeah if you you rascal - on the
 lift you're not making money
right now
you know it's like right now look at
this guy like Brasco -
right you're telling me you're telling
me with we hates and
amazing music that he can make you're
telling me he can't use his brain to be
able to make money online selling
courses not necessarily selling songs
selling albums these people who are who
are making it with almost nothing or
even if you right now they were gonna oh
 a Roscoe - works at my
facebook you think people will be
clowning him no they'd be like okay
Roscoe - it's yeah yeah exactly
because you know you know what what to
do with it
you know but um it's crazy like
with Roscoe - I'm like yo bro if you
were such a need you should've just went
to a I don't know even a boot
camp or something and but I go I'm
trying to grind I'm getting back to my
in a regular life shape there's no need
for you to be going to become a driver
like that sounds crazy it's like I
would have been like yo my dude like
what the are you doing with
yourself
here's a course for you to me
kid like why wouldn't you serve them
however I hear something here's a dub
here's a dub of you to me there you go
hold that you know like what is
great
whoo
ohoo
amount of mist yeah exactly yeah no
because she is gonna you gotta talk
about it like this right now it's the
Renaissance era of Technology the people
who get in now and the worlds that make
money now they're gonna be good this
shit's not gonna be here forever right
 we just an EMP could just
hit everything and just there's
no more electricity right so if the
 people who who got in and made
their money they're gonna be good the
ones that didn't get into school
and they missed out like who knows what
the hell's gonna happen twenty years
from now this whole could just be
automated so if you'd be like oh I'm
twenty years old now I'll get in this
when I'm 35 no bro by that time this
 is gone the people who came in and
got into this thing they they're senior
developers they the people who were
already legit you you're gonna start at
a zero who knows what this
economy might be two years from now so
you gotta try to make as much money as
you can man
when it's good yeah
yeah exactly so it's like yeah yeah
ya know definitely people just gotta
gotta grind it out man you gotta come in
and just try to get yourself in there
man
don't waste no time you know just go in
become a developer you know do this
thing man for real like stop playing
around
stop playing ps4 they play ps4
after you're tired of coding that's what
I do like right now I'm tired I
tired because I went in I did a couple
of tutorials on elixir definitely jumped
into this we've been here for what like
an hour two hours I'm tired from here
and then from there I'm gonna go play
ps4
but I'm gonna play ps4 I played one game
I go to sleep I'm tired you know so
that's how you should be especially if
you want to do with your life man
because you know nobody's gonna put
money in your pocket
that's the that's the part that nobody
tells you you know when you go to school
like they tell you when you're little
kids like oh you could be anything you
want in this world was like man was
gonna put money in my pocket I don't
care about no NASA I don't
want to be an astronaut I don't want to
be a fireman was gonna put money
in my pocket to live good that should be
like a a required course in every school
is like hey money money won't work like
you know okay yeah
yeah yeah no exactly is like exactly
like people should just have like I
don't know like some type of course
where is like people should you know
chef I can tell you like hey man this
what is an important life this
was gonna help you feed your family this
was gonna help you get a house is what's
gonna help you be successful you know
cuz nobody tells you this people tell
you oh just go to college
what the does that mean go to
college in what and then when you go
over there people people end up taking
art classes people end up taking liberal
arts people end up taking um
what is their hike all this
the with people dance on
the stage drama class doesn't
 theaters some theaters
like you go to Starbucks and
people earning $14 and hours
like all of them got degrees of
 of acting it's like like exactly
so not your slaves to this you know
so that's what I'm saying like people
just need a 101 I know a
survival kit like a summer camp with
like a man this is what happens when you
don't take the right career
choice here's what happens when you have
a kid early in life that's what happens
when you you go to this parties
all the time and you up your
brain cells this is what happens when
you do a whole bunch of drugs and you
 end up a junkie and everybody
that you know put you on it's like even
like myself look even I never really got
into any like hard drugs or
anything like that
I one of my friends got me into
cigarettes when I was young right when I
was like 19 years old around there he
got me into cigarettes right he me and
here Arlo forget this Shamir him was in
a party we drank a beer and then after
we drank a beer
he comes to me he goes like yo son you
want some buddies I'm like nah man I
don't smoke cigarettes he comes getting
his cigarettes like man trust me she's
gonna feel good because now you're drunk
is gonna lift up your your drunkness I
say you I'm gonna do
I was half drunk already so I go smoke
this cigarette next thing you know I'm
 smoking cigarettes for two years
you know what he quit smoking cigarettes
the next week after he put me on
to smoking cigarettes so so now mind you
this happens to thousands of people
where it's like somebody put you on the
wrong path in life lucky for me it was
just cigarettes but who knows I
would have taken the wrong path and I
wouldn't end up like one of these
 kids from Middle America guys
who live like in Oklahoma so
middle of nowhere
where's the game man you want to try
this little bit of heroin you want to
try this oxy can you want to try
this percocet and it's like now your
 you know so yeah that's enough
happen yeah yeah yeah man
now that's awesome I you know but it's
just wrong choice and sometimes you take
the wrong choices and nobody tells you
ahead of time people tell you all don't
do drugs but nobody shows you
the we saw or drugs or nobody
shows you all you remember
whatever the Jennifer the cool girl from
high school she got seven kids
now and she lives in this project like
nobody goes like that should be like a
field trip you know it was like hey guys
we're taking you guys to the life field
trip of like taking kids to situations
were like oh you remember this care who
was the high school quarterback
whatever and now he's over here
the addicted to pink
pills and he lives under a bridge like
like that you know like sometimes people
need that yeah but yeah man but for
game we bout to start calling this a
quick call isn't this thing
night-night call this a lope a good
get-together a good bonfire between you
know amongst men amongst minorities this
was a this was a yeah yeah
yeah all right cool
I co Coco Coco definitely good tutorial
from Maribel um barbells is weird
because I would say go to Lara cast calm
it's not even a you and me course cuz
the thing is that most of this guys from
you to me they go to Larry cast and copy
was America
so then they create their own course but
I would say go to Larry cast and take
the course there they even even for PHP
they have some pretty good courses there
so you can actually go there is free so
you go actually learning pretty pretty
damn well so I will say yeah check it
out Larry cast calm yeah if you go to
Larry Bell dr. Watson RL calm it should
be they're stopping a link directly to
Larry cast and they're from there you
sign up um and then you got the series
it's nine dollars a month right but they
have things dark the courses for Larry
well they're free but if you wanted to
learn like more advanced PHP or stuff
like that they have courses - $9
no no no no start building the websites
cuz laravel laravel is good but you need
to you need to practice to basically
understand what is that you need to
build this web applications so like I
told you like creating the categories
created the listings like all those
things is was gonna teach you how to
build this applications because once you
learned that wants to build a real
estate trust me every other one is easy
you just got to basically start building
a one step at a time cuz it's like if
right now if he wants to jump on
something else then you're gonna forget
the things that you learn from from the
nodejs in my sequel course so start
building the yeah
yeah exactly
exactly like him what I like what I
always tell people go to dribble comm
right search um real estate and the
final design that you like and then
recreate it in HTML CSS and JavaScript
and then from there build it in nodejs
and start building the backend for it
that's it
alright guys I will see you guys later
man
make sure y'all take care yourself um it
was a great show we're gonna try to
continue doing this at night and got my
