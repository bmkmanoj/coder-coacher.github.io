again man coding phase calm your boys
backing out and did it again oh my god
version five came out for angular wow
this is pretty crazy for just came out
the other day and five is here alright
and once again is a whole different app
it's a whole different library once
again
are you surprised though they do
whatever the hell they want Derek Google
you know it's a couple of nerds together
and they're like you know what eff the
community they learned something last
year they're slow they need to learn it
again this year
anyway what like what like that's all
I'm saying you know what I mean like I
find it a little bit a little bit just a
little bit a little bit annoying how is
it that Trump says this is just a little
bit annoying a little bit just a little
bit annoying guys man is is really
annoying
I mean I'm gonna tell you my story with
angular um I came into to this thing
like 2012 you see one when angular was
released no I ain't gonna one let's see
what was angular Ward released I'm
trying to find that out okay so yeah
that's crazy zone it seems like it was
released around the same time well it
was conceived back in 2009 and in 2012
that's when it was a gritty out it was
like the booking it's out so pretty much
I've been around this whole time right
when I came in I was just like you guys
right I was
checking on coke Adam II I was checking
on team tree house I was checking on you
to me I was checking Pluralsight I was
checking Linda I was checking you to I
was checking ready if that matters or
whatever right
I was checking everything you know and
back then it was everybody's using
backbone all right if you don't use
backbone you don't have a backbone
but I gave for the backbone you know
what I mean yeah I don't know man like
this how it was back then man everybody
was using angular in 2012 and I think
for a long time people use angular so
maybe like what 2014-2015 angular was
like the king the king dominating you
know from 2015 to 2016 react came into
the picture and say you know I guys here
we are we got everything that react
native we got a whole bunch of cool
stuff so you know what I mean like we I
kind of took over now everybody's on
react all right but what happens to all
those companies are still using angular
I know companies are still hiring people
who are experts on and get it one cuz
they bet it everything on angular they
say Oh angular is great and angular was
great when it came out man compared to
everybody else and we thought man
two-way data-binding it's the best thing
in the world and we was just loving it
hey loving that two-way data binding
until reacting through like you guys are
doing something crazy guys you actually
have a whole bunch of bugs because of it
and then everybody started switching up
okay and then you have life cycles and
you have all this good stuff that just
angular didn't have right so then I'm
gonna say okay we had a whole different
product so now we're gonna copy what
angular is doing it and start working
about you know components and they
jumped the bandwagon or was it angular 2
and
and I don't think there was an angular
three and they just you know everything
that you learned or angular one is
thrown away because angular 2 came
through and then angular four came back
to break things up again is like like
yeah what's this guy's name it's like I
turn I turn it came back with a vengence
to slap you like hey Tina you like you
like you like mrs. mrs. link was
happening right now he was just like you
like angular right here's another slap
here's another slap guys I don't know
why I'm slapping there but this is
what's happening to the community every
single year now it is like you know it's
like yeah it sounds so messed up is like
okay you know that priest that keeps
touching in the wrong places let's go
back to that same church like wait what
every year is a new priest that's doing
the same thing to you but just a little
bit different let's go back to that same
church right late but no what's going on
I'm just listening to this I'm like yo
man I'm watching this and this like a
thing man it's like a upgrade to angular
this like upgrade to angular 1 to 2 then
upgrade to angular for now it's upgrade
to angular 5 upgrade to angular 5 let's
see if we can find it find it there's
like so many things are completely they
named different so it's like if you have
it's not this one this one official word
from from Google
that I just saw man I don't know I I
have to find it but it's just ridiculous
man it's really ridiculous like every
single year people's gonna have to learn
something completely different in yes it
has some type of the same concepts but
is different and the problem with
angular is that is the fact that you
have to constantly keep learning new
things like ng-app dis ng injection this
ng double injection this ng triple
quadruple injection this like wait what
that's all I'm saying you know what I
mean like why are they keep on changing
things like name it the same way change
it around
but name it the same way keep things
that are doing something similar keep it
on the same level like if it was
returning if it was returning a string
keep it returning that same string don't
come back and be like now we're gonna
return in component a return any
function it's like wait what now my
whole app is broken right it's like
every year you're gonna have to learn
something new from angular that is
ridiculous like they said that they were
doing it for you know for progressive
apps okay if you're doing it for
progressive apps add a section to it
that is X is just for progressive apps
right add a section to it okay this is
angular tool point you know 2.4 or 2.5
and now 2.6 has a little thing that now
makes your your apps better for
progressive apps voila right
keep it simple there's something called
keep a simple stupid kiss you know but
these people they just don't know that
right for some reason the the geniuses
of of Google don't understand that like
react was almost like a new rewrite they
almost rewrote the whole react framework
right the
we wrote the whole thing of how it works
and then they just kept everything the
same way like a little bit such react 16
into my folder apps and everything works
how come every time they do an update or
upgrade so angular everything breaks
it's like now you have to tattoo on your
your arm is like okay angular two point
four point six seven like you have to
put in the the version number the
upgrade number on your arm as a tattoo
to remember which version was that you
was using in 2016 because if in 2017 god
forbid you click npm upgrade or was an
MP an update like now your whole app is
broken like you get with us and I just
don't know man but you know more power
to the angular's out there at man and
I'm still gonna create a course for
angular because I don't like angular
once in a while you know but it's just
like everything you knew you thought you
knew last year is gone now you gotta
learn it again this year like you don't
got other things to do like you don't
have other things that you you wanna do
like when you go to work you want to
come back and let a man remember last
year we created that app yeah we're
gonna break it this year we're gonna do
it again
you know same things that you did
yesterday we you just gotta redo it
again for no reason to add progressive
app features to it when in reality it
will save you more time so just do it
yourself and add those features as you
need it instead of you saying hey we're
going to add new features to this
angular framework that is already
bloated for the size of angular let's
block this out way I don't even know
besides I need a fire sighs listen
60% that's good so the new version is
gonna make the components actually a
little bit smaller that's good I wanna
know was like a big a big app from
angular five including angular 5
including everything like how big is is
the files like by now we gotta be like 6
megabytes so hey man you want to use
angular you got a download 6 megabytes
of angular like wait what you know what
I mean so that's all I'm saying man I
love you guys but you know sometimes I
come in here I'm just like I'm coming
shocked with the industry sometimes I'm
like man every single year they're going
to continue creating and that's because
people gave them a pass if companies
would have been like we're officially
dropping angular from our stack then
everything would have been fine but you
know they keep it's like I keep coming
back and slapping your across the face
and you're like here daddy
come back to me like the guy keeps
slapping me in the face every single
night go leave them but an industry
doesn't want to leave angular because
it's part of Google so in their head is
like man they're always going to be
upgrading it and updating in keeping you
know the latest thing story so you know
you know this is blasphemous right right
I'm gonna say sign but to be honest with
you guys man if I was a company right
now I will go with huge a guess right if
I I'm a brand new company right now I
would choose I like that style of coding
right the angular way of doing things
like hey separate templates separate
components separate logic separate this
this is not right if you like doing it
like that what I would say is
blasphemous my arm yeah I will choose if
I was a branding developer I was a new
company right but this is the problem if
I was a new company I would choose for
UJS just because I don't think even even
you is gonna be doing crazy stuff what
go will be doing but at the same time as
like even you was not Google you know I
mean the team that Google has and other
people are working on this thing people
always coming to school besides you know
third party you know Johnny small from
creating his framework whatever right
but personally I will say if you was
looking like a better option now if
you're one of those people that love
that angular style of JavaScript
framework know what I mean
unfortunately you know cuz it's just
angular angular team just keep you know
I was like I keep telling drugs is like
they keep they keep just doing crazy
stuff to people thank you
no look no nothing's I gave man you
remember that's here you spend a year
and a half
training to become an angular master
here's another way to no loot no night
just like your kid jail style you know
what I mean how can we just do the whole
industry jail style like nothing maybe
some speed yeah really
angular team doesn't care about
developers and even teams doesn't care
about companies I feel like they come up
with new things and cool stuff at their
job in the light you know what you know
what we did yesterday we did it better
this year let's redo it again wait what
and then everybody would just being
follow
for the past four or five years is like
oh man
once again so you gotta come back is
like okay angular go ahead angular jet
jato style let's go
that's what they do into the industry
alright so anyways all of you guys that
enjoy that oh good taniwha angular I
will continue loving react and enjoy
reacts right yeah that's it that's what

a little bit too graphic but it's pretty
much what they do into the industry so I
