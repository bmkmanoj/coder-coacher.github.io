of what I've been doing for the past
five years which is web development

basically everything that you could
think of when it comes to the web right
anything that you could think of that
you want to create
I'm the guy that I can make it right I
can make that you know anything from the
front end to the back end databases to
servers I've done it all right so pretty
much like I created this channel and I

tube like that like your boy Joe you
know what I mean so that's why we in
here and by the way just in case you're
wondering man was Wizards accident from
where he firm man what why he got the
swagger what he doing this was his
shoulder like what's going on with this
kid man I'm from New York I'm Dominican
born in the yard raised in New York
raised in a little town called Ridgewood
Queens that's why I'm from it yeah so we
here live man we killing the game right
now and basically I just wanted to show
you
exactly like Who I am before you start
seeing me going harder on d2 like y'all
wait who is this guy wait what he come
from whose kid is this you know I mean
before people start going like you know
whose kid is this yeah you know what I
mean like I had to come in do a proper
introduction you know and yeah so
basically we've been killing the game on
YouTube you know one of the probably if
not the most fastest rising stars on
YouTube killing the game this past year
when it comes to web development of
course I'm staying on my niche right I'm
staying on my niche I'm not PewDiePie
you know what I mean we ain't talking 50
million making little videos on our
freakin you know little games we're
talking about this professional manner
you know what I mean but with a little
bit of sauce and a little bit of style
something different starting to keep
people motivated right so I have this I
have you to me I also have my own
website coding phrase calm where I
basically create courses free courses
premium courses for my subscribers my
viewers people that find me on youtube
people die find me on Korra people that
find me on on forums I don't know people
find me somehow all right so now how did
I
I got you know how did I get into this
right how did I get into this this thing
called D Toobin and steamy well of
course your boy Jerry Banfield if you
guys don't know who this guy is you guys
should definitely check him out he's
always coming up with new ideas new
places to basically share your content
and that's why I follow him I like his
ideas I like what he's done I like the
fact that you know he's always on to the
next he's always getting what's new and
what's poppin so I definitely have a lot
of respect for him make sure you
subscribe to the kid
Gary Banfield you know he's constantly
you know number one when you look on
steaming like constantly every time I
look there you go steaming the he'd
steam it see me everywhere he goes like
he's constantly there somewhere let me
see if he's on the training I guess not
today but he's always on there so he
definitely put me on to steam it
a lot of my users also send me messages
like Jojo check out D to check out D to
Bent YouTube is going down
check out D tube so I came in today I
basically set up everything finally set
it up and yeah man I'm looking at it
it's pretty simple right now
but it's it has a lot of potential man
it's on the way up man it's definitely
got a lot of potential and one of the
cool things about body is like this guy
created it
hi we're just we're just hilarious how
you how you user name is hime in danger
like seriously basically this guy
created it it's a pretty simple website
you know I definitely I would say like I
have a lot of respect for this do for
creating this because I've created a lot
of websites and I know this thing wasn't
like something that he just did in like
two days
it took some time so I definitely
understand it you know one thing that
I'm gonna reach out to him because on
his post somewhere around here I think
somewhere around here he said pretty
much like hey he just built us with
semantic UI it's pretty bare-bones man
it's pretty bare-bones and I think me
myself I can come in help him out also
too and create this you know with a
better designer I'm a designer myself
you know some may a couple of things to
him see what he thinks you know what I
mean and let's see let's take it from
there man like I said I'm I'm in danger
listen I'm here whatever you need you
need an extra hand as a front-end
developer or you know just back in let
me know I'm here I'm open to you know
give you know a few hours out of my day
to work on on d2 I really like what you
did here a lot of people online they're
loving it they have a lot of respect for
for this platform so you know I'm here
man all right so this is my first video
on the tube and listen guys I know I
have 9,000 subscribe
on YouTube for those of you guys that
want to get into this because this is
pretty cool like you basically like
let's say you sign up to steam it right
it takes a few days to get get approved
after your proof you pretty much can go
in leave comments up vote things and
depending how much you know how much
clout you have and how much
cryptocurrencies you have your your
votes cost even more so like let's say
somebody like Gerry Banfield could come
in and give me an upload right that's
worth $7 automatically just because he's
so super high up there you know I mean
if you come here and you come to this
community you know like a lot of times
you're in YouTube and you you put so
much time on YouTube and you don't even
get nothing you know what I mean like
YouTube is getting millions of dollars
you know per whatever per day or per
year right that billions of dollars per
day billions of dollars per year right
and it's like the people that's there
the people that's in the community the
people that not doesn't even have to be
the content creators like you guys
should be getting something to like you
know it's like I see like Matt Barber I
see a fin fin tag I see you know a
couple of the the people who are here
constantly on the chat rooms are on the
comments and I'm like man these people
should also get something you know what
I mean like people make money off the
advertising why can't the basically the
people in the social network also get a
little something and that's what's cool
about the tubing and steaming it's like
everybody gets a little piece of
currency the more you post or more you
you comment the more you get right now
I'm not the most technical person when
it comes to cryptocurrencies there's
probably somebody else out there on the
internet way better than me that can't
explain it you guys do your research
search steaming right or its search D to
basically do your research you know do
your Google's kids you know they're your
googles and check it out but it's
definitely cool
form I have my channel there which is
coding phase exactly how we have it here
let me see let me see this is my steam 8
ok my channel currently right now is d2
that video
hashtag bang /c / coding phase of course
you probably gonna just search through
here coding phase like that together and
I'm gonna pop up kids you know for those
of you guys that I already have steam 8
or d2 like grant check this out man
alright so I'll see you guys around man
and for everybody on D tube and steam 8
