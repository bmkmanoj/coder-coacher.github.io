this egg a your boy calling face.com
alright kids
your boys back and not and did it again
alright we here live live from New York
not from New York City but live from New
York Long Island the suburbs you bullies
livin good alright guys so this topic
for this video in this live video that
I'm doing with you guys is about my
first six months on YouTube and what I
learned from Chris Hawkes live alright
so I just wanted to do this laughs I was
gonna actually pre recording editing
have like you know the nice little intro
of coding face calm when they have the
nice little outro of hey guys check out
my coding courses right I was gonna do
all of that but then I say you know what
man
then it wouldn't be Who I am I want this
to be just genuine and just real and
just talk to you guys and talk to any
future youtuber who's out there right
and what I learned in the first six
months so I'm gonna go almost month
right so we got started like this around
December around there I created a video
which somewhat in the web development
community became and you know viral sort
of viral right and we started getting a
lot of views a lot of subscribers at
that time I took some some break because
I was like I don't want to do YouTube
like what the hell am I gonna be doing
like I'm gonna become another nerd like
oh here on YouTube you know I mean like
that's like I don't know I didn't I
didn't know if I really want to put my
face out there like that you know if I
want to come in there and be like
alright guys my name is Joe Santos I'm
I'm a web developer I I didn't want to
do that right I just want to come in
here and just be like a dad hit with a
hit on with the sauce right so I just
wanted to hit him
sauce so that was my first month I
didn't even know that this thing was
gonna become popular in whatever I
looked at everybody else's subscribers
and viewers and and compare myself to
everybody that was in this niche because
I don't even know what I need was I was
just like okay cool
I guess I'm gonna be a youtuber now so
that first month I said I started doing
some research and finding out people and
I was like you know there was a couple
of people that say you know I could
relate to
I like their channel I like what they're
doing one of them was definitely Chris
hooks and I had seen his channel from
before I had tried a python tutorial
that he had and I was like you know he
was like cursing in a video he was just
like talking about his when his favorite
bands are Bayside and I was like girl I
 with this guy I like him a lot
right so that was my first month when I
was like you know what man I like that
guy I like his energy man and you know
he's like me he's like sort of a
pessimist sort of negative but positive
at the same time so that was my first
month man and then whatever I was like
you know coming in my views were coming
in it and then I said you know what I'm
gonna reach out to him and I say you
know what let me let me try to get in
this I say oh if I really want to do a
collaboration it's gonna be with him and
at the end of the day the he didn't
reply back to my message that was like
the like you you can't reply back
just super immature super immature
because I'm the type of person where I'm
like okay if I reach out if somebody
reach out to me I'll email them back or
I send them a message back but you know
in my head I'm thinking like there's
gonna be like a whole bunch of people
probably so he probably didn't even see
it but then later he did a video where
it was like something like oh you know
you guys want me to do a collaboration
with me after you know four years three
four years of hard work that I've been
you know grinding it out and going up
the ranks of YouTube rain so I was like
I first I was like pissed off I was like
bro I got some good content I got some
nice I got a new sauce that nobody
has ever had like people should be
grateful that to do a collaboration with
me that's how I felt super ignorant
super um super young in the game right
which I am made now and I was like man
 this I'm just here on some
kumbaya and try to help out
everybody whatever so things happen
whatever I did a video by him which was
weird one of my best videos because it
got so many views and so many
subscribers a lot of people came to my
channel because of that video but then
at the same time I was like man I don't
want whenever you search Chris Hawkes my
video to show up cuz then it shows me
just being negative about a person I'm
like I don't want nobody to find me in
the Internet talking negative about
nobody especially when he never did
anything to me alright
oh he was you're sayings like he putting
a lot of work and it doesn't make sense
for somebody that puts it in a lot of
work and and now is getting all the
gratification you know the good things
that that YouTube has to offer and it's
getting finally the the views so
whatever that that was like my second
month I was like you know what delete
that video um are we still growing I'm
doing collaborations where people I'm
thinking oh this is gonna help me out
mind you um I'm up here and everybody
that I'm doing collaborations with they
down here right they down here right so
I'm doing collaborations with guys that
have like a hundred subscribers you know
200 subscribers and you know who are
like 2,000 3,000 subscribers below me
which in the YouTube world that's like a
no no this you're not winning anything
you're not winning anything giving them
light alright so I learned from that
because now six months later I realize
I'm like looking at the stats and
looking at everything I'm like yo my
soon as I started doing it my channel
too
my channel took a hit from YouTube
sending me a whole bunch of traffic and
me helping other people out sending
traffic to them right so then now when
they started going up nobody was
throwing traffic back and even after to
this day I still do videos where I'm
like ill I'm stoked shout out now people
you know who they are I don't need to
put the name out there gave them
shoutouts gave them links sent to
them you know what I mean and then at
the end of the day it didn't pan out
right because my channel started going
down as far as subscribers you lose I
get more views now than before because
now I have to know your fan base but my
subscriber count as like new subscribers
started going down because I started
switching up on the content I was doing
too many crazy ideas ideas for a brand
new channel when you're hot and you're
like the hottest guy right now focus on
what make you hot stop focusing on
helping other people out stop focusing
on creating experimental videos stop
focusing on saying hey I'm not gonna do
SEO
clickbait titles because those type of
videos they they people are gonna say oh
I'm being now click baiting and
this and that those are the things that
I learned because at the end of the day
it did hurt my channels growth now my
channels coming right back up now that
I'm doing back the same things that I I
was doing from the beginning but to me
I'm like man this is crazy
I kind of did some really dumb I shot
myself in the foot in one sense like you
working hard you're busting your ass and
then you focus so much on help with
other people out and try to do
collaboration and then you don't think
about it you're like this could actually
hurt my channel because I'm throwing my
audience to somebody else I don't know
if this person's gonna reciprocate in
and throw it back to me they're not
gonna throw that audience or their new
audience at you right so that's
something that I learned
in this six months right I learned from
that I learned that now everybody that
approaches you here on YouTube has good
intentions now everybody that talks to
you is you know a genuine person some
people they just dare they're like
leeches you know because people take
this thing seriously
they're like this is like a business for
people people know they can make money
people know they could if you could
either be a viral video maker arraign
you get a million views a month
you said you could make like
$10,000 a month easily or more right now
if you're in a small niche like this and
you're like okay I get it
I'll get everybody's audience then you
know now you could just retarget them
with it's like having a list of emails
of everybody be like hey I could
retarget them with other stuff and be
like okay now guys check this out and
try to make money from that all right
when I came into this game I was not
thinking about that at all I came
in with just a video talking
about web development how I made money
how I was broke and I started making
money right with a blue background
freaking a blue background a shitty ass
lighting shitty ass whoa freakin Windows
computer that I had at that point and
that's it that's all I had
right so what did I learn from this I
learned like him as a youtuber you gotta
be thinking of this as a business you
can't come in here thinking this this
 is kumbaya and like that's
something I learned from all Chris walks
you know like when he was saying like yo
man I can't be throwing the
competition like I busted my ass
for four years and then i'ma throw my
channel is growing now after four years
of hard work and I'm gonna throw it to
you you only got like 800 subscribers
like nobody knows you I don't know you I
don't even know if you're gonna be
around before you know the next week I
might throw you know cosign you and be
like oh this person's really good
and next thing you know they don't even
make another video you know what I mean
so that's something that I learned from
that I definitely learned from that it's
like and like I would say guys I always
just try to keep it real keep it 100
with you guys you know not to be fake I
don't like being fake with nobody but
it's like now it's no more no kumbaya
you know what I mean you can't be
kumbaya in this world you know people
come in and it's the same thing for you
guys you guys might have like a really
good idea there ain't like a really good
idea like let's say you have an amazing
app in your head and you're like man you
just can't wait to tell somebody about
that app that you're about to create
like man I can't wait I'm about to
create the next imagine this imagine if
tinder Facebook and YouTube had
a threesome how does the baby look right
how does the baby look I have that app
right imagine you come up with some
like that right you come up with the
next greatest thing and you go and you
tell somebody because you're so exciting
you tell them hey man this is what I'm
gonna do and this is my business plan
this how I'm gonna get things poppin
next thing you know that person soon as
you turn around that person is over
there like this writing a note oh this
what you do a word this how you do it
sometimes people come around you to
basically get your sauce get your style
get your your views get your viewers get
your subscribers right and that's what
they do
and you can't be mad at it it's like
it's like you you put your hand out in a
 in a bucket full of snakes and
you expect not to get bite you suspect
not to get bit by a snake
you stupid you know I mean so that's
awful
you know that sounds like man I know I'm
thinking in my head man I know how the
world is but at least here on YouTube or
you know whatever developer isn't she
you're not gonna find people like that
trust me there's people like that you
know I mean like people come in here
take ideas and run with it
all right then they they leach on from
one person now they go like I'm besties
with the other guy I'm messing with this
guy in and this in that mind you her in
your channel you her in yourself because
you over here just kumbaya with
everybody but people don't throw that
love back to you so that's something
that I learned I learned a lot from this
six months you know this next six months
is not gonna be the same kids you know
it's not gonna be the same you know the
last people that I'm gonna throw out
there is the real tough candy and real
Casa de Harold that's because I watch
him every day i watch the content so
it's like I have to talk about the
content or I talk about Chris hoes
because I watched his content
all the time I don't agree with every
single thing but that's because we're
two different type of people he I feel
like he comes from more of a corporate
side and I come from like more of like a
hipster slash urban kid who was
like you know what I mean like I I can't
see you know what I mean like me and
Chris Hawkes is completely different
opposite worlds but at the same time we
I feel like we both respect what we what
we doing out here alright so why did I
even you know put him out there like
that in this video is because it's I
wanted to say this I wanted to say just
a public apology because I learned my
lesson just like hey sorry my fault I
learned I came into this game very
humble and and gullible and thinking
like you know how this thing is like
kumbaya with a bunch of developers and
it's like nah man is this is YouTube
some people come in here as a business
you know what I mean it is not fair that
somebody puts in 3-4 years of work or
even like myself commanding I'm super
hot and then I'm going through my
audience and my you know subscribers to
somebody else and yet they don't do that
you know like these people who are done
collaborations where I'm like yo let's
do another collaboration and then
they're like nowhere to be seen
but ask after they already already gave
her the stimulus package I gave them the
stimulus package of like hey man I'm
 at the top I'm getting all these
views I'm getting every search
every time you search what develop my
 is on top now when YouTube is like
a you know what man we throwing you to
the back we throw you to page 2 page 3
page 4 because now there's some new
blood
alright those people don't throw that
love back to you alright and then it's
the same thing it's like do I sacrifice
what I've been doing here and just start
click beating the out of this
channel and just be like hey guys
 how to how to make react
faster like you know I mean I get do I
come out and just start making chatter
like videos like that I don't know I
don't know if that's worth it luckily I
don't live off this you know what I
mean I still don't don't think of it
like oh I'm trying to become a
millionaire from YouTube I'm not I'm
just here trying to you know give people
the best resources because I know how it
feels to be a self-taught developer
these people who's out there you know a
year 2 years 3 years just looking for
the right resources they go from a book
they buy a book that by html5
for dummies JavaScript from John ducky
 they go in and going buy
a subscription of you know the premium
from Udacity and it's like $200 a month
for some crazy like that right
they keep spending money and they still
can't become developers why because they
just don't find out the right resources
they keep going hopping from place to
place and trying to learn everything and
they they don't understand what it takes
to become a developer so that's why I
created this challenge just to give
people the right resource and be like
man don't waste the time or free cocaine
stop wasting your time there start
 learning algorithms
that don't mean anything and it's
 when you're trying to get a job
as a junior developer learn that
later on once you have a job and you're
going for mid-level senior level
you know position right now don't worry
about that you know those are the things
that I wanted to do for this channel but
that's just how it is man you know it's
a lot of that you got to learn in
this world I'm always I keep learning I
feel like every day in my life I keep
learning I keep going a level up I keep
going from you know not to be like Oh
super cold with everybody but it's just
you got to learn in this world you got
to learn by doing mistakes you got to
learn by making mistakes yourself in and
just keeping it pushing you know
learning for me and not doing it again
you know what I mean like now it's like
me like now I'm like I got like six
people who hit me up now and they're
like hey man you know like love your
channel man can come into a
collaboration I'm sorry man I can't do
it I'm busy that's my that's my new
excuse I'm busy and it's not because I
want to say that is because it's just
how it is you don't know what type of
you know mentality people are coming in
with are they trying to leech onto you
or are they trying to take your sauce
find out some things they like hey man
how do you make money out here can you
show me I've been trying to do this for
like two years and I haven't made a dime
can you show me and then you show them
and then you see they start doing the
same sins that you do they start taking
the same that you've been doing or
retargeting the same people that you are
target and I just started learning what
it so it's like I'm I'm learning
and I'm teaching other people how to do
so it's like you know I learned my
lesson from this you know you gotta
learn kids so you know it's just a quick
little conversation that I wanted to
have you know with you guys in if for
any youtuber I don't know a lot of you
guys here and you're like yo man I wanna
start a new channel and y'all come here
I've seen this plenty of times as they
send me a message like hey man I'm so
inspired by your channel I'm starting my
own channel
and it's like man good luck man I wish
nothing but the best for you and you
know and then they hear me away oh but
what how how you getting you know how
you get it going man how you doing huh
how you get so many views how do you do
this in that I don't know man that's
gonna be my new Excuse I'm busy man like
I'm gone you know and yeah probably
manage oh you already sort of talked
about this but it does
bother me I'll be honest it does bother
me that I come in here kumbaya helped a
lot of people out show love and don't
get the love back right same people that
the collaborations with that didn't need
to do collaborations with they nowhere
to be seen
they know what to be seen to even show
love and be like yo bro let's do
something this link-up is let's
let's give you the stimulus package how
you gave me the stimulus package back
then they know it to be seen you know
what I mean so and that's just how it is
man you learn from it you know you learn
from it you learn from making mistakes
sometimes you can't have you know this
is like infiltrators man you know people
come in and you know camouflage
dudes be out here looking like scorpion
coming out to out the tree like
y'all without from your friend and then
once they get what they needed they
disappear they go right back into the
bushes
never to be seen take what you got take
your sauce take your your knowledge
disappear that's just how it is that's
how the world works kids you know and to
me I'm just like man I don't know man
like what the like this supposed to
be some kumbaya a couple of
developers you know teaching people how
to get it how to get to the next level
this and that I was never thinking of
this like this is a business this is a
way how people eat you know people eat
so if you're eating
they wanna eat off that plate that you
eating on right now you like a you you
got steak there boy
well you got that steak you know what I
mean that's how it is so yeah I just
wanted to make this video completely
apologize to Chris Hawkes because now I
know what he was doing now I understand
him now I understand I'm like later on
I'm okay that's why the whole thing
where it's like oh man like you know it
just doesn't make sense if you're if
your channels up here and do it really
good there's really no point of you just
come in and just out of good love and
good heart to know your whole
audience at them
there's no point especially when you
don't know this person from a hole in
the wall this person could be literally
a a wolf in dressed up
like a sheep you know what I mean but
that's what I'm saying though you dick
anyways guys this was just a little
quick video you know how I do it I come
in here I feel a certain way this is now
my channels not just about coding my
channels about myself this way I come in
and you know also let things out
let the frustration out show you guys
was really going on you know like when
 goes left I have to tell you when
 just one left you know what I mean
so that's what it is so today I'm doing
it I was gonna do this little podcast
tomorrow but I'm doing it today with you
guys so though the people that want to
come in and and want to join this little
podcast little conversation just send me
an email right now coding face at
gmail.com come talk to your boy come
chill with your boy you know take two
seconds send me your email let's come in
here let's let's have a conversation
work ask me anything
actually boy anything dig
we in here man right now we coding
face.com
killing them right now man whoo your boy
just got approved
I just gotta prove to steam it calm I
don't know if you guys have heard of
this I just checked my humor right now
hold on boo you guys gotta get it on
this man I gotta put you guys man this
is thing I keep telling people
everything that I'm doing man I need to
stop doing this
Oh God removed that I make I get so
excited and I want to tell people about
it it's like now man you shouldn't tell
people
everybody all your move boos man I'm
such a good person like that man I just
I just wanna she is like I find
something it's like you know when when
you find like the spot way you know the
African spot where where they sell the
the brand-new Jordans and you're like
man we got Jonas for $80 they're
probably free but they got a 480 you
know you want to tell somebody about it
or when when you find out where where
you know somebody stole a couple of TVs
like man you know Johnny from the black
guy a couple of TV's menu you want to go
get that but yes team is like you guys
should look it up man and you guys
should join it's called Steam its ste
m.i.t calm all right and watch I'm gonna
do a couple of things I'm trying to I'm
trying to flip it up you know not only
do youtube also wanted to steam it
because steam is I got a new a new
platform for people but at the same time
like since I already told you guys I
already put the out here watch a
whole bunch of other people start
jumping on it a bunch of youtubers
because every time I do something
somehow and it's not because I'm like
thinking in my head like oh they
copy no they watch my
channel and copy a lot of the
 that I do man I'm not making this
 up man
yo captain alpha what out what out what
up I'm gonna send you a invite so you
could get on this Google hangout yeah
man
 is crazy though outside I'm just
saying though yeah probably like man Joe
what you talkin about this hey what
are you talking about these people
giving them light man is I yeah but the
problem about that is that you know if I
was if I was just like a grimy person
then I'll be like whatever like you know
but it's like I literally help people
out and then people don't throw the same
love back that bothers me
that's the type of that makes me
want to knock somebody off you know what
I mean like I mean but it's my fault you
know
I come here I help people out I never
get that back and then on top of
that throw my audience there then from
there when you two start switching up
the algorithm and cuz I don't make click
beats I don't make clickbait
videos I make original content so
because I do that and the people that I
 help out don't throw love back
I'm like hey you doin click me
videos right so if you don't
click bait throw some love back
the same way to the floor throw
some love to you but that's not how the
world works
all right I wasn't even thinking I'm
like yeah I might just start and just if
I can make another video like not
another video another channel
because I'm like y'all just like start
from scratch and just be like
everybody you know now my
subscribers but yes everybody else man
but yeah man I Missy Missy it wasn't a
chat room right now we got 30 people
lives man make sure you give this
thumbs up make sure you give to some
love we love right now
I'm just reading this thing right now
I'm mad at the whole world I'm mad at
the world man yeah I was good got your
boy cam got Ryan John's who else Joe Jay
no Bustos Neil Floyd Adam Castillo
FinTech Leandro Cunha code let me see
let me see who else
how important is to know Linux as a web
developer I will say just play around
with Linux guys Mike is definitely going
to help you out think about it like this
when you go in and you get something
from how you call it's like let's say
you go and you check out something like
digital ocean like and you want to put
up your website if you know Linux you'll
be fine if you don't you're gonna be
struggling
as Siri hi wife tell your wife I said
what up tell her we love while here we
got the crew I hope that she's learning
to code and she's really busting her ass
working you know I want her to learn how
to call her man now man the thing about
a key for this is like what they did Joe
man let me know so I could've beat him
now then the Chris hearts ever get
annoying with you Joe probably he
probably did get annoying I won't point
but guys there's a thing man
you'll boil Bing hot out here right so
you to automatically know what the hell
I had right so automatically just on my
first month was like subscribers and
keeps growing where I messed up where
was number one throwing my audience to
other people and number two on the hike
on is the mentorship program the
mentorship program my whole channel
what up let me put you gotta put on some
headphones Brooks
yo yo yo yo can you hear me yeah yeah I
could hear you let me see
we're trying to see how phones bro I
could hear my voice in the background on
your speakers helpful role on a no I'm
on then me for more I'm gonna put this
mom how could I go here but let me put
you in here man I got a mutant my fault
man we got a mutual until you got some
headphones right all right but yeah man
yeah so whatever I did the the
mentorship program so then that cut
everything in half because I was in
doing like a whole bunch of like I call
as like SEO type titles and and then on
top of that I'm giving like half of my
audience away to other people so it's
like at the same time it's like y'all
that don't make no sense you know what I
mean so YouTube is an algorithm it
doesn't matter if you have the best
content doesn't matter if you got the
best sauce it's about playing the game
like you know back in the day people go
into a video and putting a million
thousand tags that had nothing
to do with the videos and then they'll
get views from that but that doesn't
exist no more now it's about you know
like learning how to play the system how
to put on Facebook how many views
are you getting for Facebook pay a
company to promote the on Facebook
like that's what a lot of people are
doing you know playing the game oh yeah
so as far as the Chris logs he probably
did get annoyed at one point he's like
man you don't know you know like because
my video that was free it's funny
now thinking about it it is like my
video I had a video where I was like man
why I unsubscribe for Chris Hawkes right
and then pretty much I was like before
you even saw any other videos from Chris
Hawkes whenever you search Chris hooks
my video will show up so I know that
 got under his skin is like you know
what the I didn't do not into this
kid and like literally whenever somebody
searches my name they seeing you know
his video before mine so I know that got
him annoyed but you know I took it down
because I'm not one of those people
where it's like I want to hurt anybody
or bring down the channel or give bad
energy especially cuz I love his channel
I'm really doing I wanted to work with
him but it's like you know it I know he
tells me always because you know I don't
really do collaboration with nobody and
this and that but it's not really about
that it just doesn't make sense if you
you have a popin channel to do with
videos what a channel that's nobody
knows my channels popping and it's still
growing every day is gonna keep on
growing you know what I mean like by
next year I wouldn't be surprised we
have 50,000 subscribers easily probably
you know break it and just hit a hundred
thousand subscribers like was this guy's
name simple programmer simple program
was been here since 1998
right so I'm joking now he's bringing
you things I don't know for like four or
five years and now he's about to touch a
hundred thousand subscribers right now
by my calculations and how YouTube works
I'm probably gonna hit a hundred
thousand subscribers in like a year and
a half two years from now so I think I'm
doing good you know what I mean like
compared to how everybody else they've
been around for way longer than me like
I'm doing pretty good you know I only
been here for seven months kids you know
I'm learning I'm learning how to
navigate you know it's how jay-z said
learn you know I'm learning how to
navigate in a room full of roaches you
know what I mean so it's like it's a lot
of roaches in here in YouTube so I just
gotta learn how to navigate and not not
to like associate myself with the
roaches and just separate myself I'm
gonna eight sorry you can't shame in so
well yeah man yeah definitely a k47 say
I agree bro mentorship was not good yet
the mentorship was a good program but
it's not a good program for YouTube you
know like the mentorship program it was
bad you know it was bad because number
one I was focusing a lot on everybody
else and I started like slacking off
from YouTube and not creating content
like content that that would get me hits
and get me up there so then that's when
you had other channels you had like you
know Chris Shaw popping up even more I
was like before Christian was up there I
was already number one and they he came
up started popping up then from there I
brought back from the dead was this
other guy
I forgot his other me brought him back
out of the dead there from there
helped out Eric Eric had like 300
subscribers when I picked him up so I
think picked him up lifted his ass up
Aaron Amira Nevada he was doing his
thing but I don't know what happened to
he kind of fell off like I want him to
come back somebody sent him email saying
like a man don't leave you too
you know who else now rules Barry rules
Barry is a at the same position as I was
six months ago where YouTube is like
okay this person is hot we gotta give
her all the views so she continues
making the same content and not
deviating like the other day I saw a
video where she was like doing her
makeup I'm like no don't do that don't
do that rosemary you don't understand
how YouTube works
the moment you start deviating from what
you're doing the views and subscribers
that you're getting is gonna come down
because they they care about you having
a consistency so it's like the moment
you start throwing wild that
is from left field your channel is gonna
start going down you know what I mean so
yeah yeah yeah that's it that's the day
whose thing here let me see home ah whoa
got your boy cam in here man yeah get my
pizza out of the oven the joint oh man
can't believe that Peter the truth on
camera Lee was not delivering some
like that yeah you remember the
hood pieces the the picture from the
lunch break from school back lunch
specials man I'm day over there in
 Kansas Oklahoma my father oh
yeah we had yeah we had those pizzas
those pieces were father
word and come in with a little fish
fillet ruff again a little
hamburger a that up
chocolate milk that up everybody
stomach like it we even had the every
time they had those strawberry milks you
know like everyone smile everyone like
this - yeah well I wonder what happened
tonight there I think they probably
stopped it
puts not reason but yeah man have you
have you heard of this thing called
steamy now what's that steamer is is
basically is like a social network right
that when you create content and just
this is a disclaimer right here under
under this this screen right here
disclaimer before every youtuber starts
doing this remember what you find first
heard this from and it was from
your boy Joe alright because every time
I do something somebody else
comes and starts doing it so I must say
anyways cuz we we in between family
right now it's me and my boy can't but
steam is a place where you basically is
a social network and what they do is
whenever you you release content like
let's say your post your post is worth
something so it's worth money in
cryptocurrency so we're talking about
like you know like Bitcoin litecoin or a
good right so whenever you release
a content you basically you get paid
because other people watch your content
or you get paid because other people are
voting
like right now if we all here and we
just uploaded a post that I did if
depending on how big your audience is
you get I get paid more so like let's
say an example I uploaded your video
right and let's say you have 5,000
people and you have you have 500 people
on your on your like your friendship
your friend friendless or whatever when
I offer your your your post your post is
worth like three times as much as it is
now so because now I shared them with my
5,000 people
when I upload it right you get paid in
esteem it points like cyma points which
also you could sell late for bitcoins
and then bitcoins you can sell it for
dollars right so I mean that's like the
dumbest way to explain it but it's like
it's pretty legit because this is it's
like how it should be like somebody
creates a content and you know the
content is really good and you give it a
up vote which means you're you're really
saying like yo this content is
good it's not just like how they have on
YouTube like you give a video or like
nobody cares only YouTube cares to share
it to other people but if somebody says
hey there's some value whenever I give
something alike or dislike then people
are you know they're gonna think of the
content more instead of just start
giving our likes to everybody you know
what I mean yeah that make sense yeah
yeah so yeah man but what's going to man
how's everything yeah I've been working
my ass off this past weekend actually
made me work the back and I was doing
like pal Jack's and all that stuff I've
never done this before I was like man
I'm working my ass off yeah that's good
man I'm breathing I'm over here reading
the comments like people on the live
chat general Smith is like yours Joe
stop stressing go finish up the
courses man and it's true I'm finishing
it up I just uploaded like three videos
today yeah but I have started working on
Mac so uh websites though work have you
checked out the the JavaScript course
you started the JavaScript yeah that you
get to the last parts right now the
projects yeah I'm on the projects right
now okay yeah boy cam don't play that
game he's out here grinding
yo any websites you built like you have
online that we can see I'm on the
beginning stages I'm actually just now
finished like a basic layout on the side
of him working on actually was stuck on
getting my floats right because for some
reason like I couldn't get my floats
like to be a hundred percent height for
both the columns now what like I had
trouble until today someone help me out
with giving my floats on one hundred
percent high down low into columns my
sidebar was for some reason not with
just staying on one block instead of
like 100 percent you know all the way
down oh well I mean that you try dome
overflow:auto on the parrot div yeah I
gotta figure it out it was a the problem
I had issue I go back to it my problem
was I had my footer it was on absolute
instead of fixed and that messed
everything up yeah it was just something
smaller that I was I couldn't figure out
for the longest you know that should
happen sometimes you you bump into
things that you'd be like man having
problems with this but then you
figure it out and you'll be good yeah
yeah because I kind of wanted to get
like my layout good before I start
actually working on the actual site
itself you got a you know to start
putting up man soon as soon as you
can man so we could check that out
see the progress
yeah it'd be done this week for sure let
me see it I'm checking my emails if
anybody sent me anything
captain alpha say next time he'll come
in you'll find some some headphones but
listen man you gotta get me some some
nice
 headphones on Oh like some cheap
shake some $0.99 one always have
headphones close by man you're gonna
need it
Diane Oh Diane Jones sent me an email
saying thank you for the channel I'm in
the coding bootcamp and your channels
helping me so much I try to get the site
on a weekend and watch the YouTube
nearly everything Thank You Diane that's
great man you know I'm excited I'm
excited to help people out man that's
what I'm here for man I'm here to help
people out take them to the next level
or just to keep them motivated you know
sometimes I'll be honest this could
get boring like this she can get boring
and you're like man why should I
continue trying to learn this well at
least you know your boys here trying to
help you out and try to keep you
motivated you know forgetting well yeah
Kim did you check out that the app that
hype was a hyper app that framework I
haven't seen that video yet how about
the watch the video right before you
went alive and I was like I'll just
watch it whenever I get out there yeah
now the the app is not that bad the
frameworks
it's called hyper happen it's pretty
much like super fast you know I don't
know if he's bringing that much new
things to the table but at least it's
faster than everything that's out there
you know what I mean like somebody sent
me a comment saying I'm gonna tell you
right now I'm a read it up looking it up
right now I'm trying to get there okay
this is the comment that I'm gonna say
you right now cat purr roar goes I don't
know he maybe he's Russian or he's four
somewhere out there so he said Joe I
love your videos
are you promoting hyper app for being
the newest latest amendable while you
dissing vue.js for the same reason just
seems a bit contradicting and then
pretty much I guess he missed the whole
video because the video that I made is
it's more like being sarcastic I'm just
using sarcasm to explain this new
framework especially because right now
it's really hot everybody's talking
about it
every blog is talking about it
everybody's trying to create you know
tutorials on it and say oh this is the
greatest and latest thing out there
right so it's hilarious to me right so I
just make the video like a sarcastic
video about a new framework because it's
kind of ridiculous that every single
three months there's a new framework
right and every time that a new
framework comes out it's better than the
last one
and people don't understand I'm not
upset of UJS and not to come back to
this goddamn UJS topic again but
I'm not matter of UGS because it's the
latest and you isn't the most minimum no
I'm mad at vgs because UJS copies a lot
of other from other frameworks and
it's like people don't
acknowledge it it's like it's right in
front of your face and and
people's like nah but it's okay they
could copy and they could take from
angular and take from from you know from
a react and merging into one
framework and call it our new framework
and there's like no for me is like to
meet us or no no you know what I mean
that's like hey man build your own
you know build your own or try to
be try to be a little bit different you
know then I'm all behind this
jeans VJ yes is different yeah man it's
pretty much the same they took the
same ideas from react and just decided
to keep all their from angular
we bind every bind that compute this
compute that like it's the same man
so that's why I don't like few J yes
once again I have to explain it but yeah
man I'm just talking you know this
framework is cool I like it
it seems pretty minimal and it's not
copying anybody else is original it's
influenced by Elm but at the same time
it's doing it in its own way without
having to you know for somebody who
wants to mess around with Elm there's a
great way to get started with and that's
it
so that was my my video on it
well yeah let me see what everybody is
saying here framework hype is all bs yes
I agree with you i speech and ice
fishing man people have names that I
came to pronounce man yes speaking of
that what would you recommend me learn
like frame requires as far as like front
end like angler or react
it depends depends where you live it has
to be one of those two I would say react
if you planning on working for like a
startup now if you gotta work for
enterprise like a big company like let's
say you was to get higher right now for
HP or Dell or I don't know
what's another one one of those
big companies that they're like
super strict with everything then you're
gonna have to learn angular because
that's what they use but if you're
looking to you know working a more chill
environment
you know is you have to let me act
because that's what everybody's using
all the hipsters are using it you know
so if you want to work on that like
let's say if you go to Austin you decide
to go to Austin Texas like or something
like that or San Francisco or you know
here in New York like you have to learn
react because that's what everybody's
using here you know well you just got to
do the research man do the research on
where you like you know where you want
to work at and then from there find out
what what they happen in that area all
right
but ya mannan but I will say messing
around with both of them see what really
like sometimes people like angular
because you don't have to write HTML in
the JavaScript but but you lied to me is
stupid because if like if I'm not
working of front-end framework
I want everything the JavaScript you
know what I mean but some people they
want to separate HTML to be on the HTML
template and then they want to have the
JavaScript on a JavaScript side so it's
all up to you you'll find out soon
enough
let me see what else anybody else got a
question man let me know let me know let
me know any questions for your boy can
ok code said you do a react course Joe
yes but not at this moment cuz right now
I'm finishing the JavaScript course
after I do this Pokemon it sounds so
stupid every time I say I'm doing a
Pokemon tutorial like it sounds
retarded but it's a really good Pokemon
tutorial guys there's a really good
Pokemon - Tori because it teaches you
everything like I have a right here
let me see maybe I could share my school
give you guys a little preview for the
for the people that haven't seen it yet
and you're probably thinking like oh man
this is retarded why would I want
to learn JavaScript
with a Pokemon game well I'm gonna
explain it to you guys let's look at
this there's the code right so I have a
couple of videos I'm gonna give you guys
this the curriculum that I have right
now coding phase comm all right
the future-proof JavaScript okay going
here okay
now coming here to the pokemon game
let's build a Pokemon game so we have
let's build a Pokemon game so far then
we have to web developer start okay so
for the people that are going to be
taking this course I don't know if
you've seen my web developer starter kit
I don't know who uses it if you guys
want to let me know on a chat who has to
use the web developer starter kit let me
know in the chat right now because
basically we using that to start up the
app then from there I'm showing you guys
how to set up a project setting up the
project like editing the starter kit and
just making it fit to our code for this
Pokemon game then from there I'm showing
the two views of the project which is
the Select screen and then there's the
screen which has the Pokemon battle and
then I basically go section by section
you know how a user selects a Pokemon
how user selects a character you know
keeping track of the game state you know
a lot of you guys don't know those
concepts about state how to keep track
of something like when you're working
with a single page app cuz this is
pretty much a single page app but we're
doing it with four
the JavaScript when I use a react when I
using angular we're not using view when
I using nothing we're doing this
from scratch so I'll teach you guys how
to keep track of the state so I called
it the game state and there from there
how to let the CPU pick a character
which is pretty simple it's just having
an array and then basically having a
random number choose a function that
uses a random number like right here and
then basically we use a function that
creates the CPUs pick which is the
computers pick and then we save it to
here to the game state all right so it
might seem simple but there's so many
pieces to this thing that everything
that you're gonna get from this you're
gonna learn how to build any type of
application after this thing because
you're basically using almost everything
that you learned on the course itself
everything that you see here
you know from numbers strings arrays
objects functions control flow loops Dom
manipulation you know all of that
you're gonna using that project so I
don't know to me it's a really good
project now it seemed pretty cool when I
was in my third yeah so that's a lot of
cool on it I definitely would
recommend it to anybody who's trying to
learn and especially cuz it's like I'm
breaking it down in a way where it's
like I'm not trying to be scientifically
 I'm just trying to show it to you
guys and teach it and make you guys
think like oh this why I gotta do like
hey I got a like Messi a reverse an
array most courses they're gonna
teach you oh this is dark the reverse
method but that's not what I'm doing I'm
teaching you guys like oh we're stuck
here let's find out how to find the
answer let's look on Stack Overflow
let's look on on on Google and
see how to find a JavaScript
Frances you know understand how to find
a method for each primitive type or four
functions or four objects so yeah man
it's a pretty good pretty good course
man for real so how many more products
you got after this one by the java
screen after this one I'm gonna do
another one that's gonna be a form like
a form validation and then that's it for
this project I was gonna do five but
then I I said you know what I probably
could come back to a later on but I
think it will be enough for everybody
who who's trying to learn because
there's a beginner's course this is not
an advanced course I don't wanna I don't
want to do what a lot of other people do
where they give you 40 hours of
courses like 40 hours of videos
when in reality you're like I'm not
gonna get this done right away you
know what I mean at least when you
finish a course you get that
gratification of her oh cool I just
finished this course
let me start making websites with those
skills that I just learned sometimes
people just go from the beginning of a
course and it's been a whole month two
months three months trying to finish a
course and they still haven't started me
building their own pages you know so
that's why I didn't want to do it like
that where I'm giving even the advanced
things on the course it's just there's a
beginners course there's like a course
for people who are trying to get into
JavaScript and then from there I'm gonna
release another course which is gonna be
mono from future proof JavaScript part 2
or future proof JavaScript advanced or
something like that I'll think of a good
title but yeah let me see let me see
who's in here see what anybody everybody
say Joe you're well looks like a global
function make sure you
FinTech yes there's a lot of stuff like
right here okay so we have this here as
you can see it is a global it is a
global function well a global wow loop
right but the reason why it's a global
while loop is because I'm doing other
videos are we're gonna put everything
inside of a function so right now this
is like the first thing I haven't even
separated this thing because it's like
I'm separating it into two files one
file is gonna call select screen and
then the other file is gonna be called
battle the battle screen right so what
I'm doing here is basically I'm showing
people how to code and how to how to
build this right and then after that I'm
all probably doing where I put
everything inside of an object to teach
them a little bit more of
object-oriented programming but right
now it's just like this are very early
stages of the video like of the course
well another course the project because
I find that when you throw too much
stuff too many concepts I don't use
paper you confuse people if I come in
and I start putting in like everything
inside of an object somebody's gonna be
like wait what the hell are we doing
is this how we code every single time
and it's like nah you don't code
everything in an object-oriented way
every single time you do that in special
occasions when you you want a certain
how you say this a certain project to be
organized a certain way but if right now
I'm prototyping I'm not gonna start
doing it like that from scratch right
now there's like the prototype stage
right now this is like the beginning you
know you Cola this house
code you know I'm teaching people how
our code I don't code called
coding from from scratch as
object-oriented because there's a lot of
 that might change there's things
here that I might decide later on to
rename them something else or change the
order of things and it doesn't make
sense to start you know organizing my
code like that until I'm like I'm ready
you know since I'm showing people to
process you know I don't want to I don't
want to come in here and show you guys a
finished project you know I want to show
it the way how things are being built in
the way how people are gonna build it
cuz this is exactly how people are gonna
find find their answers like right now
if I give this project to somebody in
their head they're gonna start building
things you know piece by piece they're
not gonna come in him and build the
project as if it was finished and then
putting the missing pieces to the
finished project you know that's how
that's not how people call it in real
life you know sometimes people you see
courses where there's like there's no
mistakes the guy never does a search or
on Google the guy never look at
the documentation and you're like wait
what
you know them well you've never
used that method before how the hell do
you know it but behind the
scenes you don't see it cuz on another
screen he has the full code of the
already done and they say here guys this
is how you do this so then when somebody
comes here and takes a course and this
happened to me every time man I
will be like in my head I'm like yo I'm
not ready I suck because these
guys they know oh they're the
method I don't know every single method
I don't know every single property in
CSS I'm I suck I'm a really bad
developer and in reality is like no bro
like none of these people that's
not how you code when they teach you on
a course that's not how you code in real
life in real life you're constantly
looking at the documentation constantly
looking through w3 schools you know
unless there's things that you already
know like the top of your head like a
wire loop a compilation when my eyes
clothes you know but there's certain
methods that I have to look it up you
know I don't know every single method in
JavaScript it's almost impossible to
have every single one you know so I
teach people in a way to how to find the
answers because when you start working
people are now gonna come in and be like
hey they gotta throw problems at you
that you're not gonna find on YouTube
you're not gonna find on a tutorial
you're not gonna find anywhere else
so you have to start thinking from now
how to find the answers you know sake
nobody's gonna come up to you on your
job and be like hey hey FinTech can you
build me a to-do app like nobody's gonna
come to you and tell you that or be like
hey FinTech can you just come here in
you know and just show me how to submit
a budget like no then I gotta
tell you that like those things are easy
they're gonna throw at you
that's gonna make your brain
explode and you're like what I gotta
build some that's never been
created before and I don't know all the
methods of JavaScript how do I find the
right solution right so that's how I'm
teaching to people how to actually learn
how to look at things you know but yeah
man just the best way to do it exactly
yeah cuz I know when I started learning
I you know I was taking these courses or
you know watching these tutorials and
I'm like they go from like real simple
stuff and all of a sudden just go real
advanced and I don't know what the
happened to get to that point exactly
yeah because it's like there's no growth
there's no girl flight people just show
you from zero to 100 they don't show you
like what happens in 87
what happens at 54 you know they
just go straight from 0 to 100 as if
it's like that and it's not if people
have this this fake idea in their head
of like oh when I got a job you know
it's like I gotta be the
top-notch of the what
development world is like nah man that
she's gonna come up with time with with
you know time that you put in
and just experience you know order this
 that people try to do it doesn't
come on the first year no like a lot of
 that I do or on my cone now is this
 that I wouldn't expect people to
think like that
from from scratch you know so you got
people in the check with the seal
comments again yeah man so now we just
grinding kids in boxes you know hit him
with it this year man we creating about
a cool concept man and you know right
now like I just finished getting this
approve from Steam it I just got today
my approval from you to me the
course is gonna be on udemy now I was
talking to a couple other people from
stuff from you to me I don't know if I
should say this or not but your board
might be this is not a guarantee your
boy might be showing up on a udemy
commercial which is pretty big cuz I'm
not even a big youtuber but somehow they
want me to be on it so let's see let's
see how it goes man you know I shouldn't
be saying because when doesn't
happen then people who like oh what
happened to that udemy commercial but
you know I'm excited man I have a lot of
good happening to me man you know
like the beginning of this video was
just more like what I always come in I
come in and give you guys a piece of my
mind
I'm looking at my my I'm like man I
 help a lot of people out show
love to allow people wear them people's
act right where where are those people's
you know you help them out you get into
a certain position and then they they
know it to be seen you know and you know
it is annoying that's why I was like yo
I gotta apologize to Chris hooks cuz now
I know exactly what he meant is like yo
there's really no point of him helping
me out at that point
because he wasn't gonna get anything
back out of it and then he don't know if
at the end of the day if I'm gonna be
like a good good person that's
gonna reciprocate the same favor that he
did for me you know what I mean like
this there's no guarantee cuz he don't
know me from the hole in the wall you
know so why the hell would he show love
to me you know what I mean so now I know
how it is man I learned my lesson
there's a lot of fakes and leeches out
there yes sir that's how it is right
that's all the world revolves around
that it's just like people are just
they're they there for a reason they
dare to either scheme me or you know
leech on whatever it is you know get
your sauce do you ever listen now like
any tracks while you're coding stuff or
you just kind of just I think it's hard
for me it's hard to listen to anything
it's not me to focus like I like to be
focused on solving the problem you
listen to anything yeah I got listening
to some Meek Mill you know just listen
to his newest album wind and losses it's
pretty legit yeah that's my boy he's
nice man I love that kid he's pretty
good you know I feel like he he
he's like me he's like one of those
people like they just you know
they feel certain way and they just let
you know it's like that whole thing with
Drake and him it was all about that like
you know he he show love to him and then
when he told Drake like yo I'm doing a
concert like a welcome back concert and
drink is like now I'm not I'm not gonna
be able to make it this and that and
he's like what like I did so much
for you you know what I mean so I
understand where he came from
- but he's killing it he's definitely
one of those people I listen to for
motivation whenever I'm in the car I
have a long drive
I definitely listen to him ya know that
video you said the other day about the
industry the music industry is pretty
much spot-on which you know with kind of
how the politics and stuff is you know
probably even with you know coding -
exactly you know that's how it is I
think everywhere people are just you
know the industry any industry anything
that's a business it's up you
know so that's the that's the problem
anything that's a industry is
going to be definitely up I'm
excited about this thing man this
 steamer thing I can't wait cause
it's like a brand-new proton platform
and like there's so many cool people on
it look at this guy call Jerry Banfield
this guy he he makes a lot of
money man he makes it was making like
half a million dollars on on udemy along
and then he has a couple of websites
that generate money in and he's always
grinding I mean the guy is super nerdy
but he his channels legit cuz you get to
learn a lot yes it's pretty cool so what
is that like the YouTube replacement or
no it's not a good youtuber placement
it's a good it's a is how you call
social network where people they post
different things they post photo
they post blogs they post uh machine
type of content any type of content and
people are voting and like if like let's
say right now somebody's a whale like if
I go and I buy $20,000 of of steam
points right I'm a whale so I will go in
there and because I'm a whale well if I
offer you your your post your
post might be worth a thousand dollars
you know at the end of the day because I
gave you that much promotion which is
good now to think about it like a
hearing youtuber all this that been
going on with me a couple of people here
it's like if I go and I show you love
and I vote your your video like
 I should see something out of
that right I should guess I'm back out
of it so that's what this there's a
platform does is like it gives you seen
points and it's like you could sell that
 for big bitcoins and bitcoins can
be sold for for money so it's pretty
legit man I think you should definitely
check it out sign up for it at least
signed up for it just for the hell of it
because even like when you leave a
comment like you see how people here
leave a comment right everybody here
leaves a comment and Lisa upvote now
imagine this you get paid if somebody
gives you an upvote on your comet you
leave a good comment and somebody gives
it an upvote and then because your your
comment was had good content and now
with the advertising on the website you
get paid off the advertising so it's not
just how how youtube does it when
YouTube just pays the youtuber or
sometimes they don't even pay the
youtuber so if you drop something at
least you get some money back - like if
your active user on this platform you
get pay for them
huh you know I mean in like right now
like let's say in example you know this
are are are like bitcoins where this is
money that is traded every single day so
right now let's say an example this team
points you have a hundred strings team
points 102 points right and you was here
since the beginning now right now a
steam point costs $1 if you go and you
stay and you keep all those team points
and let's say three years from now this
platform becomes even bigger than what
it is now and now those steam points are
worth $2,000 now you're talking about
 mad money right yeah exactly
yeah cuz you bought it for $1 but now
it's worth two thousand you know
what I mean like and that's just how it
is that's what happened with Bitcoin and
cryptocurrencies they're not going away
you know they they hit the state that
shitty that's the future so yeah mmm
when Bitcoin first came out and I should
it actually jumped on the right thing
because it was like it was like a
hundred bucks or something at one point
and I was like I'm not trying to mess
with this cuz I didn't know you know how
the market would go I was like I'm gonna
lose a hundred dollars per you know
Bitcoin and now you know mm you know
plus you know four per Bitcoin and I'm
like yeah what had a mini fortune no
exactly that's what I'm say like I
remember the first time I heard about
Bitcoin I was like three years ago and I
saw like a thing like that $600 and now
is that mm it's like a $1,800 so imagine
that like all the money that you can
 make you know like that she's
not going to wear it look like in my
company my my boss no CEO is
talking about he's switching up the
company to be able to accept Bitcoin
because there's a lot of countries out
there that
people don't sell to them because they
don't they don't have you know credit
cards and this and that like I get
people that send me emails from India
like y'all I want to buy your course but
I don't even have a credit card I can't
buy a course so what I do is I give it
out to them for free if you can't if you
really can't buy it I give it
out for free all right but don't
guys like if they if I let the company
that I'm working with teachable if they
were to take Bitcoin they could be able
to buy bitcoins and then you know pay
for the course like that with bitcoins
not every country has Visa MasterCard
yeah so that's the thing man that's what
I'm trying to jump on this man
let me see but yeah man I can't think
I'm about to call it a night kids it's a
quick little video for you guys once
again I apologize to Chris Hawkes I've
seen the truth I understand how this
YouTube works
I understand how you know sometimes your
coming here is trying to do some kumbaya
 you know trying to be like super
friendly for everybody
it just doesn't pan out it doesn't work
out and that's it and it's the last time
I talk about this topic guys so don't
worry your body you ain't gonna hear
this no more cuz we doing too good
to be worried about other people but it
is annoying and I'm gonna say it again
it's annoying if I help you I
show love to you and then I don't know
where you just like you just I
don't know you acting weird
listen man that's on you can the boys
still got the sauce - gotta hit him with
it okay my website right now is doing
amazing right now
websites doing amazing I haven't even
put this on on udemy when
this thing gets on
on you to me it's a rat kids like
especially especially go ahead go ahead
camp about to say you probably haven't
even been any advertising you have you I
haven't spent no advertise nothing
nothing to so everything that I've been
doing has been just like off the
strength of like me just like here
hanging out with you guys in they've
also put it in the work you know but
once I really go hard and I finished
every single course and say hey I'm
gonna put some money like I haven't
spent all the money off me throughout
this whole seven-month I haven't spent
one dime from YouTube money again like
$300 from YouTube a month from
advertising and from you to me affiliate
links there's some one star good some
one star bad right because people don't
buy courses every single day which is
fine you know if like you already bought
a course cool that's it
you're fine you know if you're a fan of
mine
then you whenever you're gonna buy a
course you come back and use the links
if you don't that's fine too because you
know that she helps me out if you don't
wanna help me out cool don't help me out
it doesn't really matter but this whole
seven years seven years seven months I
haven't spent one dime so I have let's
just say I have a good amount for to put
for advertising so right now I'm just
getting my together finishing at
least three to four courses because I'm
gonna continue doing courses but once I
finish that HTML CSS right I gotta do
the video for the conclusion so we just
ended up nicely right there from there
I'm finishing up right now this
future-proof JavaScript which is a
beginner course for JavaScript there
from there I want to do a beginners
course for laravel and then after that I
want to do a beginners course for react
was those four core courses on my
website I'm gonna come in and go okay
here's $15,000 of four
kierra ties for the rest of the year
right and it's not $15,000 it's not a
lot but for the niche audience and the
right people that I want to target to
that 15,000 is gonna become 200,000 okay
so a long way so I ain't gonna be
worried about it you know what I mean
like you know this you to say is just
for fun this way that's why I tell
people I come here for fun or hang out I
like helping people out but this isn't
the place where I'm thinking I'm gonna
make money I'm talking about like my
second career cuz I started as a
web developer I've been here for five
years gonna go to 60 years and after
that I'm leaving this I'm not gonna
be doing what development inside of a
company I'm gonna do what development
for myself
because I love coding I love programming
I love teaching
to other people but I don't like working
for anybody you know what I mean like I
don't like working for any company
because it's like you got to be on their
time you know so at the same time once I
release this this course is with the
right advertising right commercials
start putting this out here start
looking like ty Lopez but with a
real a real meaning behind it
not a tie Lopez both say like
hey have you ever seen it a
 Lamborghini with a a
bunch of books behind you and this and
that like that is so stupid and
people fall for that I'm like in Spain
you know how much his courses
his cost $600 $800 people signed up
for that and it's stupid because
you can't do anything way the knowledge
that he's given you you know what I mean
so what I want to do is is teach people
so at the end of the day I feel like I'm
doing my my own thing you know
so we killing them right now camp we in
here you dick yeah
we're a man now I'm a French egg FinTech
is like yell Joe Krishan slacking with
his death life merchandise time to kill
the competition release your merch now
that you know I actually wanted to bring
out some fittings I wanted to do some
footage and then I say you know what I'm
not gonna do it because Krishan is he's
got his own thing he told me about it a
while back that he wanted to do his day
of life and merchandising and it's a
good idea because there's really no
clothing for developers out there so
it's good if he wants to do it so I
didn't want to jump onto that but at one
point I'm gonna do my own even if
it's like I don't know USBs so
so USB so coding phase you as a
man you being here or the coding phase
 hard drive you know what I mean
like I don't know and then have like
your slogan like every time the USB
comes in where every time you connect
the USB the used vehicles like word man
coding phase rolling papers Oh people
are crazy
yeah crazy right now I don't got none
guess
Krishan man let that boy live he's going
through a lot of stuff when he comes
back he'll come back vengeance you know
he's doing his own thing right now I
wish him nothing but the best
hopefully one day he'll come back in
show back love to the K well after all
this has been going on lately yeah
I have no hopes for nobody
let's say but we wish him luck man
hopefully he comes back somebody tell
Aaron invaded to come back
man for real for real man like he his
chatter was pretty good and I don't know
what happened so he just stopped making
videos mm-hmm like I actually forgot
about it myself until you mentioned a
couple days ago yeah man like I don't
know what happened to him he was doing
his thing he fell off same thing with uh
what's his name what's that guy's name
not Aaron but the other guy that you
know gee um milk stars yeah milk stars
yeah man what happened to milk stars man
he was doing his thing he stopped I
don't know why people they start
something good and then they just
disappeared like I've been doing this
 I think I've been out of everybody
I've been working the hardest cuz I do
this every single day I come in
here every single day I do what
developers every and what developers
lunch break every single day Monday to
Friday I do like the courses I
do videos for you to I do reviews I do
how much a shake out of everybody
I'm the hardest-working person here so
if somebody was to take a break I feel
like it should be me like people that do
a video every three days you have no
excuse to disappear like you do a video
for every three days it's not that hard
like you know what I mean like come on
if you're gonna be a youtuber it'd be a
youtuber and I say if you're just gonna
come in for a little bit and get people
excited then disappear come on man don't
do that
you know but let's see what happens man
oh yeah man I'll see you guys later cam
thank you for coming in show love like
always yeah yeah we can talk yeah man um
check out steaming cuz I want you to get
on it so trust me son it's so a place
where I'm telling you right now if you
sign up now it's gonna take you like a
week two weeks to get approval but then
from there it's money that's ranking it
don't take out the money now like right
now you when I come in
if you oppose me I'll give you an oval
your oval you're gonna get like $5 $10
every time that I do that for you but
don't take that money out keep that
money in there that's like an investment
that's gonna be there for the long term
because those points are gonna be worth
more money later on so just keep it
