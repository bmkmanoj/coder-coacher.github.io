it's your boy joke back at it again man
I didn't did it again
all right kids we ain't here man live
from New York City man they took me out
the suburbs
and then I'm back in New York City right
now for the moment because I'm going
back back to my neighborhood because I
like to feel safe so I'm going back to
the neighborhood yeah man
day two of you know I got it for five I
don't know I got it for five but I got
five on it sorry I'm trying to you know
worry about traffic kind of
messing me up but yeah now we're gonna
take a little trip man we're gonna take
a little trip you know back to Long
Island and we're gonna do a long I know
a live video man I know this ain't this
ain't safe but it's okay man
I'm going at a safe speed nothing about
65 you know nothing too crazy
so yeah man I'm just wondering what you
guys is up to man like we here life
again I know this probably not gonna be
that many people on again today because
like I said is for for July weekend is
you know most people is probably
chilling hanging out with the family
chilling with their friends you know
sending where wifey you know a little
late-night Netflix and chill you know
something simple right or maybe you're
working on a personal project right now
so I understand you might not see this
live feed and it's okay man don't feel
bad about it sometimes people would be
like oh man I missed the feet again man
is okay it's fine don't worry at least
you get to you know watch it again you
know what we'll watch it for the first
time through you know here on YouTube
imagine this what if YouTube didn't save
the live videos I will be tight I'll be
like oh man if it was like Instagram
Instagram you create a a very
infomercial type of live video or like
whatever you create an amazing video
right and next thing you know that
gets deleted you don't even get to keep
a copy of it
but yeah man we here live what am I
gonna do today people asking me what am
I gonna do today when I get home I'm
gonna work on actually this JavaScript
course that I'm about to release for you
guys everybody that actually signed up
you know more power to you guys man
everybody else that haven't been able to
sign up guys sign up man you have
literally you know you have like what
four days was it from five days
basically five days to actually you know
either buy a course individually or
basically sign up for a yearly which I
think right now is that forty five or
you could do a one-time purchase four
hundred fifty or you could do five hours
a month like five dollars a month is
nothing right so some people might be
something you know if you go
international subscriber but if you live
in the u.s. man father's that's less
than Netflix right now man and you're
gonna get pure quality content for you
know before your career as a web
developer trust me
but anyways man that's a I'm not talking
about this cuz you see the link is right
there in the description if you wanna
check it out you know give yourself that
chance you know five dollars a month you
know
you can cancel anytime so check in the
description there's a link right a link
to coding fees.com
but with the coupon code or you could
just add it yourself at the cart you
could say hey I got five on it
alright you put in that coupon code and
you should be good
you got 50% automatically but anyways
let's say I don't want to talk about
that I want to hang out with you
guys man and tell you guys what I bring
up today you know because like I said
this thing is more not only just about
coal but also about me like people want
to know what the helping up to so as you
guys to remember yesterday's life feat
was like til 3 o'clock in the morning
man that it was late man
I got to hang out with cam I got to hang
out with this cake off bunny this new
Indian developer pretty dude was pretty
cool man I really enjoyed talking to him
then we had your boy diamond I really
loved talking to him he was pretty cool
he dropped a couple of gems he in there
you know I was wondering like what do
you guys think like what if I take the
the live feed right and break it down
into small sections like let's say five
minute videos ten minute videos because
sometimes you know we have a long
conversation for an hour two hours three
hours and like not every every minute of
it is like interesting or you know or we
say something cool or like we share some
knowledge right it will usually be like
you know be like five minutes five
random minutes that you guessed like a
crazy gem you know or I'll be like I
don't know
20 minutes of like some fire advice you
know so I'm thinking about actually
chopping it up even after I do the live
video I'm gonna have the full version
and then also chopping it up into pieces
so the people that don't want to watch
three hours of it they could just watch
at least five minutes of what happened
there 10 minutes what happened there 20
minutes will happen you know but yeah
man I wish I could read your comments
right now
you messed but as extra dangerous I'm
not man I'm gonna talk about this new
JavaScript course right so you know now
that I'm creating this course like from
the ground up it's crazy there's so much
like so much in JavaScript that you
know we take for granted right like I've
been doing this for five years and
like I know it from there like you know
like the bottom of my heart and I got I
already know this right now
cuz I've been doing it for five years
but then like for me to break it down
for somebody to take this course I'm
like yo I have to explain every little
thing like you know every little detail
of the Dom or like you know break it
down to people that hey was a variable
hey was a string what's a object
what's a integer
you know a lot of times like people if
you're a beginner in this feel as a web
developer or you're trying to get into
it most people don't even know about
those things right so creating this
course I'm like damn and I gotta really
explain all this now that you know
now I understand why you know Steve and
Grindr told me something actually why
don't you have a course like the web
developer bootcamp like cold steel and
he told me something like he said I just
don't wanna be a I don't want to have to
explain everything from the beginning
cuz that's boring
right and now I understand the way he
told me that I was like man he's so
right because it's like it's really
really really boring to explain you know
what's a string or what's a variable
especially for a developer who who's
been doing this for a while so I was
like now now I mean his position now I
understand them that which is cool man
man and for everybody that signed up you
know yesterday the day before yesterday
and yeah coming to to the website and
yeah be like man this one course that's
complete and there's other courses that
haven't been completed like you know
completely uploaded and yes you're right
some of them they're being done right
now as we speak some of them have
already been done
I just gotta upload them so I'm doing
all of that this week I'm uploading
adding descriptions to way adding the
quizzes because not only are you gonna
watch the videos you're gonna get quiz
quiz upon the video that you just watch
you know multiple-choice keep it simple
and also to like you know I'm gonna be
giving you guys little tasks of what to
do like hey create this you know how to
add and remove an object of inside of an
object like little like that stuff
just to practice right so and then from
there I'm gonna actually do it myself so
you could actually see the answer for it
but there's a lot of concentrate like
now that I was thinking about it let go
you're getting a lot of content
for five dollars but I was a forty five
dollars whatever you you decide to buy
like it's pretty crazy man yeah I don't
know why there's so much traffic it's
like everybody's going to the Hamptons
right now so because of the July 4th so
I've never seen traffic going back to
the line ever like whenever I come to to
New York City I never see traffic going
back to the line and so there's like
everybody's going to the Hamptons right
everybody's like this lid right now kids
this is lit look at this I've
never I'm telling you right now never
seen this much traffic
drive safe yeah man I'm driving safe
don't worry about it cuz I'm not looking
down on the phone that's what what
messes it up I think you could have a
phone in your head what you can't do is
be looking at the phone like right now I
may be looking at the phone I don't even
know what you guys are writing about or
talking about yeah I could be talking
that about Mirena
I'll read the messages after I start at
home
like that's fine man but we in here man
I dropped off my wife he dropped off the
baby by the family so I'm gonna do a lot
of work tomorrow tomorrow Monday and
then Tuesday I'm off thank God
Tuesday we off kid no no maybe I want to
sleep early today I wanted to do like a
couple of videos before I want to sleep
but I don't know I think I might just
knock out there's a weird man like the
baby you know the baby doesn't sleep in
the nighttime but he sleeps in the thing
it's so freakin weird like I don't
understand how does the baby just
 sleep throughout the whole thing
and they're in the nighttime he wakes up
like every hour it's really
annoying but I love him I love that baby
it's my little baby Kenji
most my first son man you know my first
kid it's a being I think is it is great
you know I think everybody should have a
kid at one point but you just got to be
ready
you can't just be popping a kid you work
in McDonald's you're making $9 an hour
man don't don't have no kids because
then you can't afford to have that kid
that now the government is helping you
out or if the government's not helping
you out you just basically barely given
that baby something you know any food or
a good living or you know giving him a
good education when he starts growing up
you gotta have kids whenever you ready
man you know don't have kids early man
like I'll tell you this story
I had this chick this crazy it's crazy
put Rican chick full
you know in her head she's like oh that
she loved me and this and eyes like she
wanna have my kid it's like you know we
wanna have a family and this and that
and I'm like kill I'm not having a kid
with this girl man I was like I think I
was like 23 24 when I met her and she
was she was great she was a great person
a bit psycho
like I'm gonna tell you that story man I
don't know man maybe I should do this
maybe I should start creating like
little sessions where I'll be like hey
story mode this is what we go into a
story mode so whatever so I had this
chick right she goes like I remember
like this I'll tell her hey I'm gonna go
to college I wanna you know I'm gonna
get my bachelor's I'm gonna do my thing
and she was just graduating from being a
teacher and she's like oh man it's a
good you good you don't have to go to
school you don't have to go to college I
like I'll take care of you you'll be
good you just gotta have a regular job
and I'm like nah man I gotta I gotta
actually do something with myself I
can't just be above that student without
no money in my pocket and she was like
super jealous so then I took her to my
college right which is called City
College and
 happens that she goes like no when
we get there I'm applying for financial
aid well we are financial aid
two girls come up to me this girl called
Agatha and this other girl called I
think Linda I think Linda I can't
remember her that well but I know it was
Agatha right
so we there and the super girls come
over like Oh ciao what up you coming
back to school and like date younger
than me because when I went back to
school I was already 24 years old and
there's girls there like you know
freshmen they're like 18 years old 19
years old so my girlfriend at the time
was pissed she was pissed off she's like
what the hell is like this way you want
to come back to school because you got
mad bitches over here that I and I was
like what they're my friends like how do
I look like I'm 24 years old how do I
look like trying to you know
pipe down some 18 19 year old like we
don't have the same state of mind you
know like I wasn't trying to deal with
that and also but her crazy ass was like
oh that's what you want to go back to
school because there's girls and this
and that so mind you right that was on a
Thursday right this story is crazy
that was on a Thursday this girl we had
a little argument and we made up you
know you know a little Sun inside a blue
earth back out next thing you know I'm
sleeping and I feel her like she's
getting off the bed and she's leaving
and I say what are you going to see that
oh and I'm just going home so I said
okay cool so she went home and
happens that I thought she was going
home but this crazy chick just left to
Florida and then she sends me on she I
didn't know but I fact I don't even hear
from her the next day Friday night and
I'm calling him I yell what the hell
happened are you okay and this and that
she don't pick up for two days she
didn't pick up so then on Saturday
morning like a 12 o'clock in afternoon
she's coming it tells me that hey I
drove down to Florida if you wanna if
you want to be with me you're gonna have
to move to down here you're gonna have
to move to to Florida because you know
too many bitches in New York if you want
to be with me you you gotta come over
here so you can start at zero and you
don't you don't have nobody here because
I can't trust you in New York
and I'm like what the hell what I want
to do is just go to school so more rules
the story is there's some crazy chicks
out there man I forgot where I was going
with this story but this is like that's
one of my stories man one of my stories
of going to college going to school my
early days and bumping into all these
crazy girls that I used to have back in
the days man cuz it was like I'm not
saying I'm not saying like brace lookin
dude I'm an but I gotta say man I got
the sauce cake like I never struggled I
mean I I guess you know your boy just
had half the sauce man I always been
doing my thing since the beginning of
time man like I've never been shy I've
never been like you know scared to talk
to people and like
women they love that plus is like I
always been smart I always been on top
of something new or like working or
something
but man that's why I stopped I stopped
dating you know freakin put her Rican
woman after that girl she was just
psychos she was just like how the hell
you gonna tell somebody hey you're
pissed off because they're going to
college
oh yeah the moral of the story was you
gotta have the right partner guys you
can't just like be having kids with you
know the first chick that tells you oh I
wanna have your kid man if a woman comes
to you and she's telling you like she
wanna have your kid off the bat like
she's already a weirdo and she's she's
weird you don't want to deal with that
oh another crazy right when I met
this chick two weeks after I met her
right she tattooed my name to her
 neck on the back of her neck she
put Joe and I was like scared as hell I
was like man now I'm stuck with this
girl forever like god how can I leave
her she got my name tattooed and then at
the end she left me that she was
insecure like you know it was like one
of those funny odd situations I'm like
man why am i keep bumping into this
crazy people right luckily I found my
wife either one that I have now you know
we have have this baby is my first baby
so we good you know
and like she understands me sometimes
she gets pissed off sometimes she gets
mad because you know I'm putting a lot
of time into this you know it's that guy
I told her I was like yo I'm putting a
lot of time into this you know this
career I put a lot of time to learn how
to code and then now I'm putting a lot
of time to teach how to code so it's
like I'm asking a lot from her you know
and I feel like I'm very lucky because
at least she understands it she does get
mad she'd be like yo like I want you to
spend more time with me and hang out
with me but at least she understands
what I'm trying to do no cuz thought the
goal for this is for me to be able to be
spend more time with her you know even
if I work twenty five thirty hours a
week on YouTube creating courses just
having that little extra ten hours to
spend time with her and the baby like I
think that's that's worth it you know
all the hard work that I've been putting
in for the past five years and it's like
now creating courses my new passion my
new my new goal in life you know just
teaching in general right so
second I'm asking a lot and if you guys
you guys that are in relationships yeah
I know y'all know how it is man yeah
definitely know how it is
especially now like you guys are taking
courses right how do you tell your
girlfriend let go I need to spend two
three hours four hours in front of a
computer to study you know how do you
tell her tell her that damn right and
now like my girlfriend to study in the
beginning she's all cool
you got a study that's fine but now it's
like I gotta tell it's like you remember
a few years ago when you let me study
and you it was very supportive now
you're gonna have to be very supportive
of me teaching it so it's like it's like
a never-ending cycle you know what I
mean like some people that they finish
school they finish college and I say
they move on and they never study again
but being a web developer a programmer
software engineer UI engineer it's like
you never stop learning you know it's
like right now I know HTML CSS
JavaScript Ruby PHP nodejs laravel
framework Ruby on Rails like I know a
couple of you know I know crystal
Lang but what if next year a brand new
language comes out whatever they said
cottony right cobbler becomes the
hottest thing in the city right and now
I have to put in all this time to learn
that that language right
you know that's a kind of effects
affects the homes right affects the
family because like now you gotta put in
all this extra hours that you could have
been hanging out with your family and
this and that you know so I don't know
it's a weird situation man so that's why
I told you guys like you have to really
find the right person that's going to
accept your career and also another
thing another advice time I'm gonna tell
you guys is you gotta be with somebody
that has goals you know you can't be
with somebody that doesn't know what
they're gonna do in their lives because
that ship brings problems because
sometimes you have a lot of goals in
your life sometimes you'd be like oh man
I want to be able to open in my business
I'm working hard to open up my own
business I'm working hard to create my
own web application in my own software
you know so I could Sally as a service
or whatever it is right and sometimes if
you would the room person if this person
doesn't really understand you or she
doesn't have any goals then that should
hold you back
I really can't man because you know it's
like you over here trying to work hard
and this other person just doesn't do
anything else besides you know breathing
and eating and then you
know just the regular things that every
animal in this planet does right if they
don't have a goal or something that to
look forward to then that brings you
down because now you you're the weirdo
who actually has goals you know what I
mean so like that happens man so
you got to find the right person that's
my advice
you know what I'm saying even now like
with a kid I'm thinking about him I kill
I gotta find a balance of being able to
cold and also give time to my family
like because I also don't want to be a
messed up daddy you know what I mean
like your son is asking you hey Dad come
play ball with me outside and and you're
like oh okay
hold on I got a I got a learn no js'
version 27 on something like that you
know what I mean some like that
happens and you know I don't want to be
him I stop that that's one of my my main
goals too because like you gotta be
there for the family man so it's like I
have to find like a balance so I'm just
trying to figure that out
yeah luckily my girlfriend she
understands
kids let me park my car
alright y'all
let me see who's actually on right now
your boy Andrew who else is in here your
boy cam Mike Lee Brooks Jerome's in here
let me see who else
who else is in here JJ Smith paper J yes
I'm done with 40% of the web development
boot camp nice so you're doing your
thing right now you're working hard
congratulations Bunch oh let me see it
was a bunch of stuff
