at it again listening today is a very
special day because we're gonna continue
with the Ruby programming so basically
you really know what series let's learn
Ruby all right okay plus you got one
more thing we actually here celebrating
the 1000 subscriber right and it's crazy
because in like one day not only then we
get 1000 subscribers but I don't know
where we've gone up we got like 80
subscribers in one day but anyways right
now let's get it alright so this road
wheels up to that so pretty much up case
indicates remember that we were talking
about how to method you know inside of
the objects right so now we're going to
continue with this write-up k janaki
right so it says curl up case on your
name to make your name old caps and use
put it to print it okay cool so let's
the lattice a put down that up case and
what I was going to do is is want to
make everything uppercase alright let's
see how it looks Joe you see uppercase
same continue oh don't forget to close
it down case yeah sorry alright so let's
say hey remember we could also put this
in a marriage remember that we could
always go like this and say hey
I'm going to try to put lard like a
JavaScript well it's not JavaScript all
we have to do is say a name and just say
name equals joke so now show me how to
ride it two times all I have complete
assist me layn down case see it works go
to the next day okay remember in the
beginning I told you guys about single
line comments so pretty much if you just
say hey let's say let's write something
like this this is a calm sea okay we got
a bet there you go I guess we got over
the you know simple beginning stuff okay
let's do a little multi-line comment so
something like this begin and then dang
so more time I'll common just glad for
something like this like let's say you
want to do copy that and put it like
that for like a full paragraph things
that's how you will do is say okay big
ears and then and you know instead of
having to go something like this for
every single one every single line
create a hashtag see how he is see
that's a common tool but what we want
this is a multiple lines there's like a
large paragraph we basically use a
multiple line comments right okay let's
go to the next one naming conventions so
what is this there are many books and
cuddle variables you encounter as you
progress through these courses but right
now we just considered
regular old local variables by
commencing these variables because
should start with a lowercase letter it
should be separated with underscores all
right so Ruby will stop you for stopping
in local very move without dollar sign
or am percent no Michael app the app I
forgot how you call that but yeah well
my commencement is mentioning it does
mean the means of differential it's best
to avoid confusing I do what the Ruby
community does I guess okay i'll create
a variable name okay exactly what i was
telling you that can just name it Eric
saddle up with Eric all right the string
can be capitalized but should be all
lower-case isn't in the capital okay so
let's go okay there you go that's it I
see what we up Salina okay so now we're
going to do a review I guess all right
let's see if everybody remembers how to
do it okay let's quickly review creative
every moon called my name there's a
quick review guys nothing new okay so
and they're not age okay 29 ok now let's
go Matt to say sum equals 2 30 plus 379
product equal look slim all right listen
equal to 9 23 times 5
and there are for sure equals 2 30 29 29
/ 17 oops it look like the wearing of
product isn't quite that you set equal
to 9 vitamins me also things yeah that's
what I did sometimes it's coke a
day will be messing up I don't know what
the hell Missy 19 30 that's what ruffle
maxalt alright guys that's what it was I
put a 5 instead of 14c that's it alright
guys so let's continue with this with
this is just another review guys you
guys already learned this right so what
is saying ok string some string methods
right so it's saying okay the clear
variable name so that equals containing
your name all right now let's say name
down okay okay with the same Chloe's
down coat down case on your name to make
it a lowercase okay we did that and then
call me worse oh I forgot to teach you
guys that yeah so you could actually
change the methods like you see how we
have this little dot here all right that
little dot right there you see it
basically you could actually do another
method on top of the string so now you
go actually change it so that's not
saying you want it down case and then we
want to reverse it so we could do
something like that and then it says
then after reversing it then call up
case cool alright so let's eat this is
right yeah there you go so first what we
do with this with the strings with the
create a variable
alright named Joe and then with the name
very basically set down case it make it
all lower case then revert Lee right and
then after you reverse me put an
uppercase all right so remember that
everything goes by order so it goes from
left to right Donnell case it now
reverse it and then up case it that's it
now let's say create a single lot in a
multi-line so it was like this right
single line Tommy and then I think it
was like this begin and then and another
just copy this thing multi-line come
back that's right we got the first one
guys introduction to Ruby you did it
don't you feel smart right now man you
should feel good Matt because most
people quit they came and get through
this whole first thing alright guys so
let's see what other the next so I guess
I said we'll review everything we
basically will run over variables and
data types you know and then we their
strings and methods and then from that
we basically did writing the code you
know putting single line comments
multi-line comment naming conventions
basically knowing that start with a
lowercase on your variables right and
then basically we have a review that's
it we did it guys there's move on to the
next thing alright guys make sure you
