yeah I think they did that mean I'm
gonna be switching all my videos to
there because YouTube is good but at the
same time it's like it's limited you
know so people are already known here on
YouTube people already have their own
fan bases and I have my own fan base
soup but I want to go to a place where
it's like everybody started from zero
you know there's not the same thing if I
would have started I don't know what
five years ago who knows where I would
have been right now right but since I
started in what last year yeah like
around December last year which is like
a karma like a good sex six seven months
of them yeah so I'm gonna start with
Vinny and I'm gonna give you guys the
link I mean you could rise already set
up the account yesterday so you can go
to event dot mean insert calling face
that's the new it's basically like the
new alternative to YouTube
if you're tired of dealing with like
YouTube it you want to see new content
creators and new people instead of
seeing the same people that they put on
on YouTube then check out red dot me and
that's what's popping right now
that's the new thing
there's a new thing on the block so yeah
man I'm about to take my talents to to
fit me you just must you know wanna be
more fun I'm gonna be happier I've also
got to do video see a YouTube let's not
say damn stop the videos on YouTube I'm
just going to upload to both places
until people start going directly to
hate me and it's a better way to you
know support here your content creators
is that listing for example you like a
video and you okay I like this video I
only like there's a video alone I don't
like this person every single day other
guy is okay I want to support this video
I'll give you 50 cents so then now you
just get that now user just for that
video 50 cents all you could say hey I
subscribe to this user to this content
creator for a dollar a month or whatever
it's free everything is free but if
you're like you know your diehard fan of
the person you want to support the
channel you know it's better you know
you support you but okay I must
subscribe to your channel for one dollar
or almost as powerful zero dollars you
don't have to subscribe for anything
it's free you know but I think it's
better plus I always constantly hear
people saying like oh how can I support
you how can I do this in that some
people don't like patreon
you know what I mean so it doesn't like
patreon they could try with that mean
and which is actually better I don't
know I like the model that they have of
like you know utilizing the support long
video to say hey I like this video I
found it useful here's 50 cents
here's a dollar yes two dollars whatever
you want to get for that video so I
think that that's pretty cool plus is
also the fact that basically nobody else
is doing what I'm doing which is a
commentary on encoding or showing my
life you know
when I first created this channel I
created I was going to do like a vlog a
vlog about being a web developer thing
all of that right but then I realize
that I don't have the time to vlog every
single day so then I start you know
making the vlogs and then by the time
that I was going to come back to it then
Christian was around so he already had a
vlog and then I felt like I don't want
to copy his style which was you know him
coming into his life talking about
coding and also to at the same time just
sure what happens to him throughout the
day
which was something that I was going to
do which I should have done it before
because I opened the channel I've been
looking in November so go I didn't make
no videos on say like early December so
I was slack you know that's what happens
when this black guy chuckles like
somebody else is gonna have the same
ideas you you know out there so um I
don't know I'm the type of person that
I'd like to do whatever somebody else
already have so I try to do something
completely different even when I see
like Sarah knows about I don't know a
certain topic or something like that if
somebody already made it I don't make
the video about that no more
you know cuz I'm like okay that person
already made a video about it I like to
give original content you know
don't worry guys I'm going to buy a
little span that's going to go right
there like that but for now you gotta
stay on my lap no homo but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
