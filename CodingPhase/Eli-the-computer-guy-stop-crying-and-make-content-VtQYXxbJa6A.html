I'm not looking for your subscribers I
got my own subscribers I got my own
people
all right lower your subscribers lower
your people now let's break this down
the only reason why I've talked about
you is because you're crying about
YouTube and this this and that and then
I'm gonna share this with the people on
this this is the people talking this is
the subscribers talking this butyrin
says is he gonna go back on making
videos of our servers networking etc
like you know people are asking this
people are asking where is the content
why is he coming over here to YouTube do
live videos every day for no reason but
not even cool videos where I'm hanging
out with the people you know answering
questions it's like people ask him a
question and he's like well I would
answer it if I wanted to like why are
you here then go go in and go do
something else man like stop you talk
about me pissing on your your carpet man
no you pissing and on
everybody's carpet you're pissing on
everybody's face for no reason when
people have been loyal to you for years
there's people that you know people put
money in your pocket right you could
have been connecting network cards and
you could have been somewhere you know
on Best Buy working for the Geek Squad
you know these people put your nut
position to do for you to be good right
now don't just because now you just like
oh whatever I'm leaving I'm just
pissing in shell everybody don't leave
like that leave like a regular human
being you sound like you know when
somebody's about to get you know they
hate the job and about to get fired and
the person's like breaking things
breaking computers deleting files you
know it's like Elias that guy
Eli's the guy Eli's the reason why
people when they're about to fire
somebody that's all um hey make sure you
change all the passwords make sure you
are change the security code all the
stuff because there's people like that
they just get so mad they're about to
leave this job and they're like you know
what I'm gonna break everything down
before I leave all right my problem is I
think you have enough look this is it's
not just me that thinks this a lot of
people's like Mike Jones whereas it was
this game
commander King mental breakdown in
progress this is not from like me saying
it yesterday when you created this video
because for some reason it was on my
front page I'm gonna show you the video
so people could go check it out on dilly
dilly gaffe right which I'm Billy gasps
right when you created that video people
were talking about the same thing and I
was like looking at this video and I'm
like man I'm gonna make a video about
this guy and just to try to help him out
and just like uh this is like a cry for
help
right and then yesterday I made this
video yesterday at 5 p.m. you know it's
like a good 15 20 minutes and then I was
like yo it's cool II love the computer
guy has a mental breakdown live all
right
and I really think it's obvious now that
you either going through something
really big in your life like uh you know
a mental breakdown oh yes you know maybe
bipolar just hittin you know maybe
schizophrenia because you sound like you
it's like YouTube's against you and say
bro it's just algorithm
just a regular computer thing like it
happens like calm down it's like no but
youtubers aftering youtubers come down
you're not that special
bro you you just some dude in front of
the computer just like me just like
everybody here just in front of a
computer right going live that's it
right you was not uh you know Marcus
Brownlee you know you're not like what's
the other girl who does the cakes or the
other asian girl who does the makeup
that that you to go went all out and
promoted them put them you know
advertising and buses advertising on the
subways like you know you're you don't
have a youtube red special show you're
just a regular youtuber understand that
right like that was one of the main
reasons to why I saw another last video
where it was something about vid me
where you were just like talking so much
BS about vid me for because they for
whatever reason you felt like you needed
to get a special role now a special
treat me like you wanted to get like
partner in like hey if I bring people
and I won like 20% of your company or
something like that's what you was
expecting because you think like you're
such a big draw that you go to VIN me
and you're gonna bring a whole bunch of
people you want to VIN me and 50 people
saw you on VIN me right you have to
understand this I mean you're somebody
is somebody that's smart right you're
smart right you either going through a
mental breakdown where anybody here if
anybody here knows anybody from you know
for his family or or anybody out there a
video might be out somebody a little
cousin or a nephew a best friend sees
this video please get some help for Eli
the computer guy he's going through some
stuff right now it could be a mental
breakdown and we're seeing somebody
self-destruct and we're not talking
about just the YouTube
there is something wrong with him like
this is obvious this is not like
something it's like right now if you
guys start seeing me coming here and be
like my whole thing changing I'm like
man youtubers after me guys somebody I
hope somebody from out there that knows
me is gonna get me some help right you
know this this thing cool um let me see
what's the name
I think it's mandatory missing and
what's the name of a mandatory something
man I forgot it's like pretty I forgot I
looked it up yesterday but it's like a
impatient treatment like you know they
come into the house snatch him up take
him to a psychologist talk to him if he
if he's well enough they let him go if
not they bring him and they keep him in
for a couple of days until they figure
out what's wrong with I really think
that's where we we are at right now with
like the computer guy I really think
that he's at a point where it's obvious
this is not just me this is like
literally probably 40 50 percent of his
audience that keep seeing his channel is
like there's something wrong with him
this is not Eli this is not the Eli that
we subscribe for you know 40c tcp/ip
whatever how to connect a printer this
is not the same guy that we subscribe to
there's something wrong now if there's
nothing wrong with him mentally then
there's something else going on which is
it has to be something with his finances
let's be honest for somebody to be here
crying so much about YouTube like listen
I'm making probably I don't know from
YouTube oh no let's say five dollars six
dollars per 1,000 views right Eli makes
probably around the same thing or maybe
a little bit more right so let's
example Eli makes six dollars six
dollars per 1000 views let's say he gets
a hundred thousand so let's say eight
hundred times let's say six dollars
forty eight hundred dollars a month
that's from from YouTube that's just a
guess I'm not even doing like crazy man
this is just like a guess right let's
say he's making forty eight hundred
dollars
let's say five thousand dollars a mark
right that's around like oh no what I
fifty like that's a fifty sixty thousand
dollars a year just from YouTube just
from YouTube now just him like you know
pissing away his subscribers pissing
away his his livelihood on fifty sixty
thousand dollars bro you're at home stop
complaining you're chilling you're
hanging out with your wife you're going
out on trips you freaking going duck
hunting you're doing whatever you do
right why are you complaining for fifty
sixty thousand dollars a year to do
nothing you live in the middle of
America you live in in some place where
your rent your mortgage is probably $700
let's be honest you don't live in a
major city right stop complaining you
have it good stop complaining let's be
honest and just let's leave it out there
you're not like me you don't live in New
York City I live in New York all right
just for me to do anything here
automatically my my reign is like $2,500
right my car payment is $800 right like
I'm I'm good
right and I'm not crying and I got
10,000 subscribers and somehow I made
myself full-time youtuber with just
10,000 subscribers which is what you
were saying before you're like oh he
only gotten nine thousand subscribers
right I'm about to touch ten thousand
and somehow I made it work where I could
literally be doing this full-time and my
expenses are way more than you I know it
alright because you living in the middle
of nowhere you know what I mean like
well are you expenses Oh
in your head you lose thinking oh I'm
gonna be make a hundred two hundred
thousand three hundred thousand dollars
a year every year for whatever reason
then you got yourself in debt got
yourself a big house got yourself a big
trainer got yourself a whole bunch of
stuff that's on you homie
nice on you you did that to yourself you
know that this was gonna be here forever
this wasn't gonna be here forever the
only reason why you have that many
subscribers is because you was here from
the beginning there's a big difference
you need to stop get out of that state
of mind that you have were you like oh
you know I'm a superstar I'm I'm like
the computer guy I'm supposed to to you
know have hidden me you know kiss my boy
because I'm like the computer guy bro
you're Eli the computer guy you just
said it you're not freaking marques
Brownlee where it's like brands go after
him it's a great stories oh this kid
started at 14 years old and you know he
makes great tutorial whoa reviews on
lining and you know it's like hey let's
put him as the face of YouTube tech
companies and this and that
you're now unbox therapy who pretty much
knows how to game the system you're none
of these guys you just a regular dude
enjoy the life that you have continue
giving good servicing and good content
to you your subscribers and that's it
that's what you have to do you don't
have to do anything beyond this that's
saying just enjoy yourself stop flipping
out stop you know doing videos every
single day everybody keeps leaving on
the comments that I get well I see he
said he's retired why is he leaving
YouTube and isn't that and it's like you
come here just to talk ish for like two
hours for no reason I give the people
content man that's what they they're for
a man it's like people that don't even
know you is getting to know you or
people that had you subscribed this is
what was happening this is the main
reason why he's losing so many
subscribers right I'm talking about his
simple program what's talking about him
a lot of people the whole community the
tech community
talking about him right every time we
mention him we tell people oh man is
something wrong with this guy this is
Annette people go to their channel then
they realize oh my god I'm subscribed to
this guy I remember her from you know
2002 2002 2012 2013 it's like holy shoo
I'm subscribed to this guy so now that
we reminded them like oh you're
subscribed to this guy they go back they
see the content that you have like I
don't want this thing on my on my front
page unsubscribe so that's right now
it's just like uh you know it's like a
roller coaster Eli's like this ain't
goin down the roller coaster right now
just like he says that he don't care if
you didn't care you would just do your
content you know what I think it is I
really think uh you know he probably
went to YouTube the people from YouTube
sent them an email
hey guys I'm I'm Eli the computer guy I
started here in 2008 2007 and you know
my videos are getting demonetised
and they're like and your point is he's
like hey I'm like the computer guy I'm a
big deal in the tech community we don't
care about you if we didn't care about
Casey nice that what makes it they were
gonna care about you and then his head
almost exploded boom and then from there
he just wakes up he's like oh god this
is gonna be my middle finger to YouTube
I'm gonna come into YouTube and just do
live streams talking about how YouTube
is not paying me enough and how I don't
care about the content and all my
subscribers aren't pieces of that's
what I'm gonna do it
wait what you notice a people coming in
here I'm bringing back this comment this
is like this is a grilled comments from
the people it's like people is like
y'all like is he coming back in and
doing videos like what's going on it's
like bringing a
backing it is he gonna come back on
making videos about servers and
networking etc is he going to do that
if not then unsubscribe and that's
what's happening people ask you a
question and you like I don't need to
answer nobody's question I'm doesn't
that you idiot people put money in your
pocket or disease you acting like people
came in here and and was like you know
like he was giving Lourdes content and
he wasn't getting nothing back for it
you got money let's be honest you got
money like you got enough money to be
good now if you did some bad decisions
and you're like you seen yourself
finances up to here and you're like man
now things are going bad so I'm gonna
say f you - bro calm down you need to
calm down
for real bro like that's all I'm gonna
say about you man just calm down relax
um you know give content man create
content you know so yesterday somebody
asking asking hey Eli I want to
subscribe to your your your website but
is it going to be about just you
complaining in and this and that and
then he's just like I don't give up bro
that's not the way how to to act with
people like people are asking you a nice
question they're like hey are you going
to be creating like new content like you
know courses or networking or talking
about tech you know tech discussions and
cool stuff that people subscribe to you
I don't give up like that's not how you
act man that's not how you act with
people that's my problem with you let's
be honest that's the problem with you
that you have this grandiose thing and
saying bro you just do a little compute
calm down you're not a superstar you're
not an artist you're not doing nothing
that's changing the world
saddle down calm down bro treat people
dinies learn how to treat people nice I
know the world is messed up and how you
send me that email where it's like
you've gone through a lot of stuff and
you know with your wife and and with um
you know just life has been really
messed up
yeah but the world does you did because
you have a messed up doesn't mean that
you have to return that back to the
world I mean like you know what I have a
tough life I'm gonna just piss and
all over people don't do that those
people are innocent you know this people
are innocent they haven't done nothing
to you you know nobody's telling you
anything bad over here you know and when
I'm giving you an advice I'm giving you
an advice because for some reason for
somebody that only has nine thousand
eight hundred thousand subscribers I get
to do this full-time and I'll probably
make the same amount as you or maybe
even more somehow which 10,000 was less
than ten thousand subscribers right
because I'm not crying
I have a lot of expenses Allah I just
had a kid and somehow with less than ten
thousand subscribers I'm doing this
full-time
man paying a whole bunch of stuff take
care of like three people in a family
like and somehow I'm still here with a
smile just chilling Gavin you know
having fun enjoying my life but you for
some reason with you know nine hundred
thousand and a million subscribers
whatever you had before
you're crying it sounds ridiculous it
sounds like bro like like what are you
doing like yeah money is important boy
at the same time so what you lost two
thousand dollars from our income that
you used to make like you're acting like
you you freaking lost $10,000 in from
one day to another you know it's like
it's not that bad
you know that's all I'm saying you need
to step it up man do content well stop
worrying about you to stop worrying
about stuff do content that's all I'm
gonna say to you that's it and if
anybody that knows Eli is like a family
member or something get him some help
he's at a point where something bad
could happen to it
I'm scared that he might hurt himself
I'm scared that he might hurt somebody
else and that's being honest because
I've seen mental illness from people and
when something like this is like he's
hit a wall something happening he has a
grandiose thing I don't know
I forgot first bipolar that that that
pretty much you know they have really
highs and really lows but something is
wrong with him now that's about it
that's all I got to say about you right
like you know and you're thinking like
I'm gonna be here trying to catch I'm
over here with a big bucket I'm just
trying to catch every subscriber that
Eli the computer guy has which a reality
that's not even the crowd that I want
because those were like most of those
people there they're like IT and like
people who are interesting I see that's
your channel that's another thing that
you haven't noticed your channel is
about IT the people that signed up to
you your subscribers are there for IT
they're not there for tech there's
nobody there for tech all those people
that subscribe to you offering your
tcp/ip whatever video your control
connecting a prank earlier this isn't
that those are the people that subscribe
to your channel
there is no tech subscribers there there
is no people as they're taking like you
know that is like for coarsest or want
to do like web development that's like a
minority of the minority that's not even
the people that I want the people that I
want for my channel is just regular
normal people who are looking into
becoming web developers and programmers
that's it your channel will be the worst
place for me to be picking up people
because
then people will come to my channel
subscribe and they'll be like um this is
no the type of content that I want and
leave crazy disrespectful content
comments or under my videos that's what
they would do because they're not here
for that
right that's it you know what I mean so
yeah man it's just it is kind of sad man
it is kind of sad
for those of you guys that want to see
the video of Eli the computer guy so it
can be yes about me that's fine it's
called Jake Paul in title and go to like
the 50 minute 50 minute video around
there
it's like bro this is the thing then
where people get it wrong people that
understand this is a neat community this
is just tech these people trying to
learn stuff you're not a jig pole you're
not Logan Paul you're not rice gum
you're not none of these guys right
those guys who are here for
entertainment right it's very few people
that come to YouTube that wanna learn
very very few people all right now do
you think you could compare yourself to
those guys do you think you can compare
your channel and some guys start here
for entertainment no you can't you know
it's like I hate I hate with a passion
though is it boyfriend versus girlfriend
channel well I know a lot of people
wanna watch them right can I compare my
channel to them no I can't write like
that's the thing man I wish nothing but
the best for you man it's just there's
something wrong with you right now and
you know it now if you don't if you
can't tell that's a sign of a freaking
mental illness right now like there is
something wrong you had to depress you
either have bipolar you either have a
mental illness this is not for me saying
it this is from the people this is for
the people saying it a lot of people
mental breakdown in progress this is not
for me like these are the comments from
everybody at least 45% to 50% of the
people think this and then there's other
people who are still hopeful that like
nah man you know he has some some type
of issues once in a while but he'll come
back
listen man if I was having a mental
breakdown the last thing that I want to
do is show it to the world here on
YouTube if somebody loves this guy take
his computer away from him don't let him
embarrass himself like come on man like
eight nine years ten years in this
business and this YouTube thing and to
end it like looking crazy somebody take
the keyboard somebody take the camera
away from him somebody take something
away from me just lock him in the room
take the camera away like keep it away
from him he needs to fight his own
demons on his own time it's embarrassing
man cuz it's like if you've been here
for it you know seven eight nine years
it's like somebody told me today hey man
do you think like you know eight nine
years from now you're gonna be like Eli
the computer guy and it's like man that
is a good question cuz am I gonna turn
into that guy doing videos every single
day and then you go crazy online and
then you like I'm over here fighting
against shadows like oh there's a shadow
here oh my god you to save me ah oh my
god trolls like you know what I mean
like come on man I get some help for
real like this is not even funny I was
gonna make that video yesterday like is
literally right there
I recorded it it's right there Eli the
computer guy has a mental breakdown live
the video is made
the video is made guys the video is made
and I'm just like yo bro
like there's there's something wrong
with him and that's it this is my last
and final video on Eli the computer guy
because we don't want to kick somebody
one day down
we don't wanna you know we don't want to
make fun of our mental illness we don't
want to you know I'm just bringing some
light to it for now and this is my last
video I'm not I'm not gonna talk about
this guy ever again there's something
wrong with him
and yeah man and you know it's just
funny to me because I'm like I look at
him I'm like man I'm doing good and I
got less than 9000 well less than a $10
I got 9,000 how he's a 9800 subscribers
and I'm doing good like I got I got
money in my pocket I'm good I could take
care my wife my my son take care of my
mom
like and I'm good so how can at 900,000
on 1 million subscribers how can you be
doing bad that's my question to you Eli
you know what I mean like what where did
you go wrong what did you do that was
messed up you know what I mean like and
like I told you before invest into your
channel man you know I'm supposed to
look like this this is my first channel
this is my first year on here this is my
first you know little try a distinct I'm
doing pretty well I'm actually doing
pretty good and I still got the ghetto
the ghetto curtain I don't think I think
I'm gonna bring this wherever I go
wherever I go I'm taking this curtain
cuz this is like my pride and joy this
is like yay this is the ghetto curtain
you know what I mean like that's part of
the the facade that's part of the
experience man of coding phase calm it's
part of the experience when people come
in and to see me live you know how you
say go ahead between appointments doing
videos between appointments you know all
my lunch breaks you know is like people
like that that's the sauce man that the
swag you know what I mean but I'm trying
to help you out man
and you're thinking in your head like Oh
what does this guy know I 10,000
subscribers less than 10,000 subscriber
what does he know what do I know the
same thing that you know Apple and
Android knew compared to Nokia you're
like the Nokia off of youtube bro like
that's why I know it's like I'm new I
got new new ideas new fresh things new
things that even they at you you can't
even freaking lie man then you become a
full-time youtuber with less than ten
thousand subscribers I'm gonna let you
answer that so there's something that I
they write something down still doing
right but you have not hundred thousand
subscribers a million subscribers you're
doing something wrong and that's what
you're crying you're crying because you
thought that you was gonna go to youtube
and like hey guys something II like the
computer guy the smartest guy in there
the person that can connect the printer
the fastest in this world I can connect
five printers at the same time with one
finger and they looked at you like bro
you just some dude on the youtubes you
just here recording in front of your
camera you're not a superstar you're not
a star we're now focus on you you get
the same treatment as everybody and
you're like but I'm Eli the computer guy
I'm supposed to have somebody on the
line to say hey hey guys I'm being
demonetized
put me back up put me back up Charlie
bro you just some regular dude that's it
especially
you haven't invested into this look at
unbox therapy even if he was just a
regular dude they were given the you
know just I don't give him the attention
because he looks like a million bucks
right he looks like he invested money
into this invest money into this gay a
couple of people to work for you
creating your content creating stuff you
know I could give you a great idea right
now you could have a classroom right
because you look like a teacher you look
like you know a dude it was like a a
teacher in a community college you look
like a one of those guys right so you
could be one of those you know hey guys
welcome to Elias Community College
online do that right and then from there
you have a couple of students and then
from they have somebody like two cameras
one side one side going to on the wall
and be like hey guys this is how you
connect a printer this is how you
connect the hard drive this is how you
you know do this this and that this how
you change the screen you could do that
and your channel will be popular and
people will respect you more but when
you're just like hey you're not
investing into it what happens man you
think YouTube is gonna come up to you
and be like oh this guy he's a business
he's this guy got a brand you're just
some dude in front of a computer man
enjoy yourself enjoy your life and yeah
man and now we could just hang out all
my people in the YouTube channel the
chat room let's see what's up let's see
who's online right now under live event
sorry guys I wasted my my web developers

people with me yeah exactly Neil Floyd
says if he does not want to be on
YouTube why do a two-hour live stream
how does eating a bowl a bowl of mash
whatever how does that take two hours
man that's the magic right there that's
where you know what I mean let me see
Chris John yo he's like yo it's the
first time I've seen Cody face like this
I mean I'm not even pissed I'm I'm
pretty much just giving advice man it
kind of sucks you know it's the only
time that I'm gonna talk about this do
it and that's it we just gonna let him
you know self-destruct somewhere you
know cuz it's sad I just feel bad man
you know what I mean like there's
certain people that's supposed to be
good
you know it's like it's like you know
five years from now there's like a TMZ
video you know like somebody's like oh
man
do you know you know it's like have you
seen a light the computer guy is like
you like the computer guys just like
pushing a freaking a supermarket car of
like under bridge and just like some guy
with a long long beard and it's just
like homeless it's like you know it's
sad you know
but I feel like we're seeing
we're seeing this right now man yeah man
yeah man I like unbox therapy that's my
boy
I think he really he really is smart
like he's one of those people that look
up to him out here cuz he's doing a big
he knows what to do
here man yeah man I hate printers too
man I told you I went to school my first
degree when I first went to school was
to become NIT and then I was like man I
did it for six months I was like yo I
worked out Wall Street I was like I'm
never going to do this again yes I read
I read what my subscribers say thing is
that you know we got we got to tell Eli
what he wanted to hear and and that's it
we trying to get him some help man oh
like I don't need to talk about that
dude man like you know it's funny I
think it to me is funny because it's
just like my brain explodes like you
know what I mean like how can i with
less than ten thousand subscribers go
full-time make enough money the same way
I was making from before on my full-time
job which paid me pretty well pretty
good with benefits and everything in I'm
not crying
and then some dude with a million
subscribers is crying like where does
what part of the game is that you know
what I mean like where the he messed up
at that's my question
you know Barbara
nobody's over here with no drama I'm
gonna be honest I'm cool with you but
you're gonna get me to a point where
it's not gonna work because like you
could come in and give a comment on what
you want but it's like if you don't like
it you don't have to be here to be
honest with you if you don't like it
like I told people from before like my
content is about me how I feel when you
guys see me when I'm having a really
great day I come and show you a great
day like what do you want me to do be
here fake like I'm not I'm supposed to
be this what makes my channel special
I'm real I'm not gonna come in here and
show you a fake face what do you want me
to do it just be smiling all the time if
I see something that bothers me I'm
gonna speak on it and I'm gonna do
whatever the hell I want
so it's like if you don't like it you
don't have to be here that's the truth
because it's like now you're just like
you're really annoying me because it's
like you're telling me what to do when
this other kid was here baby whatever is
that he wants to give it your opinion
you're like put in person because I like
you but you like putting pressure on me
he's like Joe if you put him on I'm
unsubscribing I don't like that because
I don't like nobody telling me what to
do I like you Barbara but don't tell me
what to do that's the truth that's it I
don't tell nobody here like you like
change this change that like no you guys
will even talk crazy stuff on the
comments I just hate I'll let it slide
I'll let it do whatever but you when you
like put impression on me like oh if you
don't do this I'll subscribe if you
don't change this this and dad's like
don't tell me what to do like the the
channel is there it has a certain format
I come in I talk about code I come in I
talk about my life I talk about my job I
talk about you know when I'm having a
good day with tech I'm when I'm having a
bad day when I'm you know I bump into a
road with
by programming and I hate it I talk
about it so it's like the days that if
you like I only want to see happy Joe
and I just want to see freaking fake Joe
then when you start seeing me talk about
something that you don't like you close
the page you move on to your next and
then you come back for the next video
the next video might be something happy
next really might be a tutorial the next
video might be me joking around you know
what I mean like this is my channel how
can people want to be like controlling
what I do what I say go ahead go ahead
man
Krish I'll make that video I need I need
the the love man I need the love Krishan
man I always show love to you man I
don't even get a shout out no more
I'm always mentioning you here man I
don't even get a shout out no more man
times is hard
Chris Shawn don't rank Hollywood on us
man
he used to be a Vegas kid now he's
Hollywood Krishan is Hollywood he don't
even show us no love no more where man
we in here man we in here man PHP is
dying we're gonna make a video as PHP
really dying
[Laughter]
yeah now definitely it is the same thing
it's an extent but it's like I make all
type of videos you know what I mean
um what's your name David Pete I make
all type of videos man people know that
people know what I come in here come in
here drop the sauce hit him with a DAP
these days I have a really great days
this dazed I'm not today I'm having a
great day today I just I went to where
did I go oh yeah Gwen got my car
refinanced you know I was paying 800 now
I'm gonna pay like 600 so that's great
man cuz they when I bought it they
caught me with a crazy interest rate and
I was like super excited to just buy the
car real quick and then when I got home
I was like wait this interest rate is
retarded so then I was like how can we
adjust this oh yeah it's like we didn't
want to put you through this other
company because this and dad is like
wait no putting me through low the
company so then I got all that people
work done today so now we good we
brought it down to 600 something because
it's kind of ridiculous paying $100 for
the car I'm like go I did that what else
did I do
basically I started working on the fazer
Jas the course that I'm doing it's
coming out amazing it's pretty easy it's
easier than than you think it was cool
about it it's gonna teach the people who
are are looking to get into
object-oriented programming it's gonna
teach you that like really really well
cuz everything about it is it's all
about objects
need to get Chris on we need to get
Chris on out here man when it's a game
out here to New York man nah I'm not
saying it's just every time that I came
and talked about anything and you're
like always saying that oh you're
talking about this are you talking about
that it's like yeah I'm talking about it
like let me talk about it you know it's
like when okay lady go
I watched Chris Hawkes almost all his
videos whenever he talks about Python I
delete it I I closed the browser
automatically cuz I hate I hate Python I
mean I don't hate it but it's not a
thing that interests me right well he
talks about Python I'm like boring I'll
watch his next video
right when he talks about react
JavaScript and that's it but I don't be
like oh man one more video about Python
one more video but this is like come on
just it's a channel it's supposed to be
all type of videos and like for the
other person that said hey this is
similar to what ah you know the computer
guys said is now because Eli computer
guy is not dropping no content I'll drop
on content every single day you know
what I mean like I just have to say
certain things like this is part of the
community right this subject it is part
of the community if somebody if you guys
see me here and ya see me doing really
weird things where's like I'm talking to
a wall if you see me talking to a wall
like this hey guys if you see me ever
talking to a wall or doing something
crazy like that please try to get me
some help you know what I mean it's like
this do need some help that's what it is
you know what I mean like there's
something wrong with him so that was the
whole thing's bad I'm it's a Christian
where do a video man Christian I'm a yo
I'm doing a live video today coding face
is not a real full-time youtuber you
gotta be careful Chris I there's gotta
be more people that they're gonna be mad
at you it's gonna be like oh my god not
only are you not a software engineer
Joey's home all the time working he's
dropping videos everything you gotta see
some crazy comments I'm starting to see
a lot of I don't see I'm trying to see a
lot of no J's jobs out there though yeah
man anyone knows react native I do react
native is just like react man and just
using flex boxes that's about it you
know super simple you know that's all
the reasons why I love react because you
could come in and like you know reacting
you could use it for so many different
things like you could use it for VR you
could use it for games you could use it
for I seen people use react for
electronics like like the fridge
somebody I don't know if it's Samsung or
I don't know if it's Samsung or
whirlpool who has their new screen like
the UI of their fridge it's me with
react like that's crazy you know what I
mean like when you think about it's like
wait what react made that you know so
it's like if you know react react is
legit man
let me see what else word man we need to
link up with Chris Shawn man we got a
link up with the caveman yeah Python is
good I'm not saying python is like bad
it's just I've had really bad experience
with Python like the way how libraries
work and you know I just I don't know
I've never gotten into it because it's
like let's say for a part for Ruby Ruby
you have gems right so when you download
a gem you have in the same spot same
place when you have like no GS you
download anything from NPM and
everything is inside of NPM no modules
if you use crystal everything is inside
of this folder core shards right now for
some reason we're not used like Python
it's like things don't work how they're
supposed to work and it's like I don't
know it's like a big setup for me is
annoying I'm like I don't like big
setups I don't like dinner with this
stuff it's like oh so tool with PHP you
have Composer you you say hey composer
install this this and that and you're
fine when you're installing a Python
library you gotta install a find in a
folder putting another folder like it
sucks you know so that's why I don't
like Python like that like I can program
it like I know the syntax I know how to
how to create stuff on it
let me see okay Barbara Barr is like
don't make out cuz I never said
anything about what you're talking about
that's some BS it's like the last two
three videos Barbara come on let's just
be honest here it's like even the time
like from when the other kid David
Connelly think if you guys make it put a
political I'm unsubscribing it's like
why are you telling me what to do like
when I don't like a concept I just don't
watch it right these days there's gonna
be good videos that you're gonna love it
you're gonna oh man here there's the Joe
I love this the constant that I like
there's no those days these days that
you're gonna be like oh I don't like
tutorials people here don't watch the
tutorials when I do a tutorial people
here don't watch them right so the same
way as this videos where you go out is
this drama is it could be drama
but is drama that is just real-life
stuff it's like I'm talking about real
life things I'm not like making this
things up I'm talking about something
that's really happening you know what I
mean the whole Christian thing people
ask me I think I don't know if in tango
somebody else like telling me oh don't
hang out we don't promote Christian this
dis and echo or something like that
right and I'm like I'm gonna talk about
this because that's what I went back
into the thing cuz you're like oh you
guys should talk about this in the
discourse so then I go to the discord
and then nobody answers then later on
and the day somebody answered and
explained why people are talking about
krishana I'm like wait because he said
he's a software engineer like that's or
software developer that makes no sense
because it doesn't really matter if you
program if you
know how to program in JavaScript and
then you learn how to program in C sharp
that's a you're a software engineer
that's in your software developer you go
to a company I've been in companies
where they've called me UI engineer that
been company where they call me software
developer I've been in companies where
they call me IT like I've been in
companies where they just call me the
webmaster it's just a title that's it so
that's why I made the video I was like
you know this is ridiculous like why why
why the hell would anybody get mad about
that it's like that's like one of the
most craziest thing to get mad about I
mean I will get mad somebody be like oh
my god Krishan after being you know you
know one of Jesus people gets caught you
know what a prostitute
you know Christian on Hollywood
Boulevard got caught well you know a
process to getting had in the car
something like that be like oh man
Christian was fake he was all about
Jesus he was all about the squad you
know he was like throwing the geez the
DJ sign you know the Jesus sign and he
was such a good guy and but he's fake
he's only here with prostitutes then I
will get be like oh man you guys got a
point cuz then his faith well because of
a freaking title like dude is super cool
he's nice I like him if you look at his
Instagram his code looks clean
I don't know all his code that he has
but we does do it everything looks clean
looks good from what I've seen it looks
very well-structured code so that means
he knows how to code better than a lot
of people that that talk about you know
what I mean so that's what I'm saying
man Python is where is that I hate
seeing that commercial you guys don't
know man
baris died getting married my god
see you guys take things to the to the
you know to the heart man yeah I just
gotta chill man that's what I'm telling
you saying like you you telling me not
to do a Content that's do a video and
it's like we're just talking we're not
like you know it's not like I'm gonna
make my new channel guys coding drama
cause I go sign up for drama face like
this is not like what I want let me do
it like I got other videos that I gotta
make today you know what I mean but this
is a part of the day it's like I get a
message sent and I'm like okay cool I'm
gonna talk about it like what's the
point of me knowing about this video
about Eli the computer guy getting
pissed off because I'm telling him the
truth and then what I do is I hold it in
and be like oh I'm just not gonna
respond because I'm a bigger person
no I'm not a bigger person I'm just
gonna freaking be myself like if
somebody is like need some help I'm
gonna help them man like you know what I
mean so that's all I'm doing man
let me see how many jobs out there for
Python yeah I mean I think there's jobs
but it's just it's a bigger barrier for
entry for people who are self-taught you
know busy reign is like a soda Tyler
busy rails like I sort of tired it was
started laughing yeah I got a chilled is
a Family Channel drama face yeah man
there's a couple of videos which I mean
there's no videos yesterday we dropped a
video yesterday obviously supposed to
drop a video yesterday
let me see let me check let me see yeah
we did I got a big question live at 11
p.m. which counts to the next day too
because we started it we continued that
that live feed to like 1 o'clock 2
o'clock in the morning so that counts
for that date so that counts for
yesterday
go to my website man Shantanu Sharma
check my website check the coding face
on let me see coding face on udemy
exactly Michael Jordan is like yo you
know I was like the in the chassis you
know wasn't a chance in your channel
sucks that's what I'm saying like I'm
supposed to give him a little shout out
man you know he needs it right now he he
means the the help man yeah the video
counts man I did that that we started
that video 11 something we finished that
almost two o'clock in the morning know
we differentiate two o'clock in the
morning so that was three hours of
content so pretty much pretty much we we
we count that counts for yesterday man
plus I had to do a lot of stuff man I
had to do a whole bunch of videos for my
website man you know this days that I
only dropped one video on YouTube
because I'm also doing a whole bunch of
videos for a website you know it's like
people still waiting you know now we
finish the first part of nodejs
now we gotta do the second part which is
databases so I'm thinking about doing a
I don't know I was thinking about doing
at MongoDB but I'm still debating if
maybe I should do it in you know my C
cool I don't know I might just do it in
both like show people how to do it in
both my sequel and MongoDB
so that's what I'm working on right now
you know a lot of people are waiting on
that so that's why I'm like it might
take me a little a little time to build
everything and that's why I wasn't here
yesterday dropping a video word the
O'Neil Floyd is funny
Eli just need to rub one out yeah but
don't worry guys I ain't talking about
this guy no more I don't have time but
it's just funny man it's just to me it's

I'm glad you guys are enjoying this
channel you know trying to do this guy a
favor man it's just sad you know I was
like one of those days that side but
yeah man we're good out here we chillin
it's me myself the backdrop
the ghetto curtain the ghetto blue blue
mic which I hate I hate this mic I hate
the fact that people on YouTube say this
is the best microphone for every
youtuber and I fell into that trap I
bought this piece of fish microphone for
like I don't know like $150 I'm like yo
this is like one of the worst
microphones out there this thing picks
up every sound in the room this thing
picks up the sound from the street this
thing picks up every single sound
everywhere and it's literally the worst
microphone that anybody could have but
we're gonna give a little shout out you
know it's like it's like the end of the
night toast here you go here you go Eli
toast we here man we live once again
hopefully somebody tell tell Barbara to
stop taking things to the heart and to
just chill relax
when she don't like a Content don't
watch it I wanted to be here I love
Barbara but you know it's like guys this
is not every continent is for everybody
here like this times that I'm doing
tutorials about you know hyper fjs and I
know Philippe hates it okay so when he
why I should say if he hates the he just
don't watch it all right or vice versa
you know what I mean like you don't like
a certain content don't watch it you
know the next day the next video is
gonna be different you know I'm also
always to the next topic guys I'm always
jumping to other topics man
I see hey do you think you can get a job
with just doing logic part of jobs curve
like only doing job angular and not the
styling part yes when this company um
then I forgot what's the name of the
company well when this company will the
the parent company of BT MTV and all
those stuff when they wanted to hire me
like a year ago they wanted me to just
work on on the JavaScript side of like
of their videos like their video player
so I would never be working on the UI
like only what people see or anything
like that it would be just straight
programming like there's no user
interface it's just programming so their
whole the whole job was gonna be like
creating a system and maintaining a
system for the advertising that they
have on websites like MTV comm vh1.com
stuff like that
so in reality I was never gonna be doing
anything on the styling like the CSS
ever in my life
so yes there are jobs out there that all
you do is just just straight JavaScript
yeah Viacom exactly busy ryan reminded
me this call Viacom the company I got
bad memory
yeah no that's like guys this is the
last video I talked about this guy if
you guys see me talk about this guy no
matter what he says no matter what he
does no matter if he comes back and does
content again on YouTube I'm not gonna
talk about him because it's very clear
that he has a mental illness he's going
through a lot of stuff right now and
there's really no point that's like me
talking to somebody
the street who's like pissing and
 themselves on the bus and
you're like trying to have a smart
conversation with that person it's like
it's clearly this person has a mental
illness like why are you gonna be
talking about our governments and stuff
like that you know what it means like
somebody some guys from Vietnam veteran
so guys like I'm gonna Vietnam veteran
and this doesn't and he's like pissing
and himself and you're like I'm
gonna have a smart conversation with
this person like no so I'm not gonna go
into that whole pissing match or jewelry
talking about each other and going at
each other like there's no point yeah
you could put in self toy you could put
himself toy but the way I would I would
put it it's like I will say online
training or I will say training and then
you will list out the resources that you
you put in you know I mean like just put
it like online training putting like Oh
udemy courses you know what I I'm
thinking about doing that to myself I'm
about to put in how many hours I've put
in into online training so like let's
