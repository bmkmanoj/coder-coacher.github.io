right so we have a design we're going to
follow what this is I have but we're
going to use our own images what I want
you to do is follow my instructions
follow what I do trust me you will be
able to succeed in this this is going to
be such a cool project because it's
going to show you what it feels like to
be a full stack developer guys like I
said this page looks hideous
it's ugly so we need to put some sauce
on it put a little drip you know put a
log grip on that alright guys let's do
this man let's put that sauce into this
thing let's look at the design let's see
how it looks now let's put the you know
it's little sauce on it all right so
we're going to start with the logo we
def Amer we are continuing with this the
header so yeah we just built a bar the
whole page right let's see cool
so we just start with the sass here like
I told you guys we're going to say how
long give me a second I got a look at
this design so we got this that's I got
far away 700 so let's go for now let me
delete all of this stuff so let's say
global now we have ID which is header
them excited it you have to logo we have
the menu now let's do this
we'll say let's see the magic see how
this thing start shaping up the last
second screw this up
cool all right now we have header with
our logo okay let's do this
we want star far way 700 you know that's
to make it thick okay
you see it got thicker now now let's do
font size let's say 30 pixels now or we
could just finesse it and see how much
is that good 36 okay so let's say 36
pixels cool alright what else we got
Lulu that's fine for now
now let's do the menu but the menu here
is probably like size 14 size so 16 okay
cool
now I may see what else okay we're gonna
say a we're gonna say I'll I obviously
like that for now
font size 6 foot pixels and then found
way let's say 300 okay looking good now
now let's do this we're going to make
this until display:inline-block
and this yeah copy this I'm going to do
the same thing for the menu
display:inline-block you see now they're
both next
each other we put this right here okay
now we're going to say when you slow
right now it's floating right now we're
going to say you're going to do the same
thing for this we're going to say see
how these things are stacked up like
that is because they all display:block
we're going to make them into
display:inline-block right and that's
because of the allies so inside of this
we're going to come here we're going to
say Li display:inline-block now you guys
are probably if you don't know about SAS
what the hell is going on here what this
is doing is basically saying like this
in regular CSS the thing that menu a Li
and then put it in the style this is the
same thing as this so if I come with
that it should be the same you see
that's what it's doing but with SAS it
makes it easier because we know that
this things are inside of the menu and
inside of the action link right so then
we know that we have an ally inside of
it so it SAS we just put it right inside
of it we don't have to remember the
order array of saying oh man that menu a
link and then Li that's annoying
at least this you know exactly what's
going on that you can read it and say
okay we got a header and a side of it we
have a logo in the menu and then inside
of the many we have two anchor link and
then side of the anchor link we have the
Li you see and everything works
perfectly and then from there the SAS is
being compiled thanks to you know tell
me that I hooked you guys up and then
the CSS is being sent here you see it's
being compressed
and all your CSS is there all right now
you guys are good you guys can use this
thing for anything you know any project
that you guys might want to work on or
your own personal projects all right so
let's do this thing let's start setting
this up so just like a space from there
to there let's see
42 pixels okay so let's say 40 pixels
all right so let's do all the header
there is no padding which is the space
of inside all right padding 40 pixels on
top let's say let's go put anything else
for now until later on all right so see
now we got that space now you good
whoops
this thing's recording in the background
sorry sorry guys
okay close this up okay what else
now we got that I put this here sucker
always remember to click on it okay now
I'll hover and I'm active the fonts
supposed to be red so we want to say you
say hover the Li now however after the a
we're going to say and oops
hover background right now
oops it's not the background all we want
we want the text so it's on to make sure
that it worked so on that we're going to
say color red
now also too we need to give this thing
a space so we're going to do something
like this
you want to say padding 15 say 10 pixels
10 pixels and 15 pixels so 10 pixels on
top 15 pixels inside right now let's do
this thing
border box the reason why I'm searching
is for you guys to you know see that at
any moment you could just go to Google
and search these things and it's going
to show up but box-sizing border box
what this move is going to calculate the
padding and it's going to calculate the
border is going to calculate the margin
everything to have a set with so if I
say hey this thing is going to be 200
pixels no matter what padding I put in
no matter what margin I put inside of it
it should be 200 pixels gone you know
what I mean so okay let's do this so
we're gonna do this we're gonna say
where's the star I usually like to do
that with the star means on everything
at this style to it so let's see what
else cool
now you see this little underline is
annoying me we're going to take that out
so we are say sex
listen text transform uppercase because
we want it to be uppercase and then
text-decoration which right now has
underlined I hate that so we are saying
none I'm going to save so remember every
time you click command s like thinking
windows as ctrl s automatically the page
read renders itself so you have to save
guys it's not like automatically
automatically it's like you have to save
to the file whatever file you're working
on and then every freshers ok now let's
see what else we got this home lookbook
man's woman knows cool ok what else we
got
you got the image so let's concert' the
image which this is something I didn't
do on the last video so let's do this
now so we say slash which means the root
directory which means is whenever you
say image and then from there whatever
whatever it is so we're gonna live in
here
we got bait dot PNG so I made it pretty
simple for you guys so I am G slash tape
that PNG oh that's the girl I don't know
fall out the girl right now I want the
same big - I want that kid here cool so
now what we're going to do is we're
going to say we're going to go into
another section
we don't say here I think we created an
ID that says content area and like I say
guys I'm freestyling this thing this
thing is not pre-recorded this is not
like me like oh my god you know so this
might be mistakes it might be things I
go back to it but it's like you go
semicolon live does exactly what it
feels like to be a developer
right okay so confident area what else
you got model inside right and then we
have info cool now for the model for now
we're going to say with let's say was
the whiff little max with max with of
let's say 500 keep it simple not into
crazy
let's say 500 pixels so the max with
what I'm saying is the maximum width
that the image is going to become is 500
pixels now I kind of messed up because
what I'm doing every now is on on the
model well we have to say it's on the
image so we copy this we give it a max
width to the image so there you go cool
now let's see for the model area we're
gonna make this with 50% okay
just keep us on the school and we're
gonna say text-align:center so this is
going to do is set to the image of that
area so as you can see background
trouble like this
you will see that it's 50% of the side
of the whole wave all right you see that
right okay cool
all right now let's do this what else
change the background remove this we
might do it later okay
what else we got to do we have to style
this so this one we got to do some work
kids
I don't know way to put this okay the
blue put it here now so we have the FO
area so the that info we're going to say
with 50% now as you can see this thing
is not wrapping around it's not saying
it's not going here right next to it and
there's a reason for that is because
both of these are display:block when
it's just display:block whatever it is
is taking the whole area here the whole
space of the whole page right now when
you put it on display:inline-block what
it means is it's only taking the space
that you give it or the space that's
inside of it meaning if you have an
image or you have conflict inside of it
it only goes to that maximum width all
right so let's do it
let's see I'll display nine o'clock and
let's copy this for both of them okay
cool now let's see why it's not going
and it's now wrapping around okay sure
model content area okay sorry about that
guys
okay so let's look at the HTML we got
Content area which should be the model
and then info this should be good right
now let's see with the float:left okay
now let super see is 50 percent
obviously something cool that's first
its name so that's 50 percent okay all
right cool so now it should be good now
let's do the other parts let's say what
was it I think is h5 and h1 so inside of
info we're gonna put h5 I usually like
to keep things in order
so as you can see the h5 is here h1 is
there paragraph is here and then from
there the sizes and then the but the
button so I usually like to keep
everything in order so that I can know
how things are already laid out so let's
do this I'll say background read text
transform we want it to be upper case we
want font size let's say is that the
similar thing 14 pixels then we're gonna
do supreme shout ho dick okay let me see
background read uppercase what else oh
yeah we've got to make this thing to the
play inline-block you see one is by
default every death every element is
display:block except I think span but
every element is already displayed block
you see how it goes from there to the
end because it's automatically taking
all that space so what you want to do is
say display:inline-block cool now let's
do that we just gonna put a little
padding padding we're gonna say ten
pixels all around that's too big let's
see five pixels of our still it's not
that great
let's do font weight 700 because is bold
and it's dual color white now is exactly
like it not that much I think what we
have to do is is basically put in a
pattern of ten pixels on the side this
is 8 pixels all right starting to look
more like it now the fart way we gotta
make a little bit smaller yeah cool now
let's do this for the h1 now I'm going
to show you this if you go and make a
mistake and delete something like let's
say a bracket that it was supposed to be
there something's gonna happen
see it's gonna mess up now if I come
here and go like this it's still gonna
myself and it should give me an error
here you see
remember you always got to be running
yarn watch so top of this yarn what
that's what's going to run everything
for you all right
so okay let's fix this up because what
it was asked before it was the the
closing bracket of this it didn't have a
closing bracket so it was messing up
okay so I'm see everything's fine it's
running smooth okay let's do this
okay display:inline-block background
ready ah what else we got a duel okay
supreme shot Jackie which is the title
which is the h1 h1 supreme shot leather
jacket let's do it let's say font size
and you find outside 44 okay fart wait
so hungry now let's say color black
which is zero zero zero
now the missing jacket dripping sauce
now let's see what else okay we're
missing one more thing okay with the
full paragraphs let's go to the
paragraph
okay paragraph will not say font weight
it looks pretty light so let's put this
out let's put the 100 for now is to see
how it looks okay line height 4.5 line
height was going to do is give the space
between the words as you can see all
right okay now what else okay we got a
line height we also got a gift up on the
edge so I'm going to give this lot of
space so we're going to do line height
just in case a guest - too big let's put
at 1.2 or 1.3 and not the margins
margins is to space outside of the
element so let's say on top we're going
to give this how much feedback let's say
dirty 30 pixels and then left and right
to give it a zero see now that's too big
so we gotta bring it down a little bit
let's do it by
24 so you write this not about now what
else now let's do this sighs cool okay
Emma see we're doing the sizes all right
I think I'm gonna have to break down
this video into two parts because it's
crazy
we don't 24 minutes already I mean
that's how it is guys when we working it
might take longer you're actually seeing
this live so okay div classes sizes
title you will class okay so we have
sizes inside of the handful and then
inside of that you got other things
inside so sizes title and then size so
but in fact we got to rename this and
then we're going to name this to size
and digital sizes so it makes more sense
okay so we got side and then we have
title sizes title sizes title sizes okay
what else
now let's do this I'm going to say font
size let's say 14 pixels clocks wait
let's say 500 yeah that makes more sense
now we're going to meet each one of
these little circles okay
so sizes Li you now face border-radius
then let's say 50% we gonna say
display:inline-block alright to make it
in line and then we're going to say
water one pixel one pixel solid and then
we're gonna put it to black okay right
now it looks like but it's alright
it's all we got to do is fix this up
okay we're gonna make this height we're
going to make this a perfect square so
it could be perfect circles so let's do
it by 30 pixels with 30 pixels okay now
we're gonna do something crazy we took a
little bit something crazy we're gonna
add extra classes to these things and
we're going to say class circle class
circle class circle and then this is my
circle
this semi okay so what we do is we wanna
divide this and I fact let's delete this
one we don't have to put in a
semi-circle
so those are mainly lethal
so I remember guys I'm freestyling this
thing this is not like you know I
already have to stink land this is like
I'm looking at the design and you're
basically coating with me so there's
going to be mistakes and that's alright
okay now let's see
fun size 12 pixels display:inline-block
with to decide what else now we're going
to say the ones that have circle they're
going to be height 30 pixels with 30
pixels the rest are going to be the rest
are going to be semi circles right so
then say semi circle
we want to say height 30 pixel and now
we're going to do padding let's try this
I'm just trying to see how it comes out
now let's make this into fun no border
radius 5 pixels alright that's looking
better
ok now let me see what else can we do to
this then we got we just gotta fix the
padding on this thing and simple surface
we gotta say there alright now what else
can we do to this I think we could do a
lot a center of those those letters with
flex boxes sizer correctly I'm not a
huge fan of flex boxes but for this
we'll just use it
so let's say for now we will put it here
what second so what this is hang a line
of the slave flex so you going to put
this in two sizes well we're going to
put this into here and then inside of it
which ones on the center a line item
which is max with 50% let me see if that
work so far
okay see yes it's centered big now so
basically okay size is good now I want
everything lay Flex align items the
options for this data in line flex guys
so somehow I'm not even good with Flex
boxes guy as you can see I'm not but
somehow if i Google things but things I
don't know that things I don't use every
single day because there's a million
times of you know many types of
different situations that you that bump
it so when it comes to call it you just
need to know how to search and you're
going to be fine you're going to be able
to create anything do you already knows
your boy go back at it again man listen
make sure you subscribe and make sure
you like this video man by the way if
you want to know exactly what courses I
