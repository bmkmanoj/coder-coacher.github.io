basically with hyper rap I'm super
excited to start doing this series on
this great framework I've been playing
around with it all weekend and I think
it's time for you guys to get introduced
to this right so these are our
prerequisites automatically just Before
we jump into this number one you need to
have an idea of what programming
languages are okay
and I say that just to be funny but um
at the same time some people they just
don't know what the hell they doing so
this is their first time looking at a
framework or looking at JavaScript so if
you have any type of idea of programming
as far as JavaScript then this framework
is for you this is pretty simple pretty
easy all right now second thing that we
need is Adam a text editor it doesn't
matter if it's Visual Studio code it
doesn't matter if is brackets if is same
whatever floats your boat
okay it's that simple it's up to you
then the second thing that we want to do
is you want to come to github.com slash
coding face.com right and that's going
to bring you here see that boy right
there
there you go down okay now so we gotta
come here and click start a kids all
right this is my starter kid this how
start all my tutorials right I always
come here so you are like a download it
or you could clone this alright so for
me right now what we're going to do is
we're going to download it okay
yes it's that quick alright now I'm
gonna come here to my downloads folder I
already downloaded this like 30,000
times so it's ok I'll do it one more
time we're going to come to projects and
we're gonna say move that in there
that's my project I have a folder named
projects you couldn't put in the desktop
you can put it wherever you want
where were you host all your files
up to you okay then from there we're
going to have here starter kit 2018 I'm
gonna name this hyper hyper hyper app oh
yeah hyper app Styles I don't know hyper
I don't know what that means it's
because I already have a hyper app
folder hyper Cola let me name this
original alright for you guys just name
it hyper app alright make your life
easier
yeah what a - okay there you go okay so
we're going to come in here and what
we're going to do is we're going to come
with Adam and we're basically going to
come here open up a project go - hi / -
app alright cool then what we're going
to do is the first thing is pretty much
come here delete everything that's
inside of first Gump delete that because
all of that stuff is for react all right
delete that and here let's create let's
rename this let's say hyper alright I
just made my hyper regular Jas we can
delete this we don't need it either okay
we're going to come to what is a web
pack yeah what pack we're going to
comment this out alright for now and
then we're going to delete this here we
leave the comma you name this
hyper and then here we say index that J
yes okay we save that all right we're
good now we're going to follow the
instructions from here so what we're
going to do is we're going to make sure
we install all of these things here so
let's copy this one we're going to come
here to Adam if you guys don't have this
on on your Adam make sure you install a
package called terminal it's like ID
terminal so you can have the terminal
right here inside of Adam so here we're
gonna say NPM I was a - - save and then
we're just going to make sure we add all
of these I'm pretty sure some of them
are already there but it's okay it's not
going to hurt you - so basically install
it one more time
sorry I apologize and it's not these
right here
we need these okay so this one I think I
already have it July we start out over
NPM install - that save that one copy
this down one down 1.1 loaves goddammit
and web pack alright let's see what
happens click that and then technically
is going to install all of them and save
it to the package that JSON alright
and then all we really want to do after
eyes
we're just going to add this this
plugins and that's it then we're ready
to do some hyper app okay also too we
need to install hyper app by the way
okay
MPM install hyper a p-- there you go i
perhaps add it okay now we copy this
which says plugins copy this here and
then we go to the BARC paste this here
now we should be fine let's try this out
let's copy this into lower index that
jes ok hyper index is paste this let's
just set it up guys i know it takes a
little while but once we're set
we're good we're good to go okay we got
to edit this here oh let me see we could
actually come here and change the
vendors but we're gonna leave it like
that for now so on this what we're going
to do is name this is a hyper we have to
change this i keep forgetting this so we
got to name this whatever we want that
file to be named so hyper app from now
let's just leave it like that hyper app
or you know hyper
naima hyper okay and then here let's
remove this this comment and let's add
hyper to this one hyper app to the
vendor so what this is going to do is
going to take when we install hyper app
is going to put it into the hyper o file
the vendor file Oh God alright let's do
this
this is good okay let's do npm run watch
let's see if we get some errors if we
got some harris well of course we're
gonna get some errors yeah let me see
try running npm install gulp okay so we
don't have gulping this are you serious
now it should be there let me see what's
going on what's going on kids okay npm
install and that's because we didn't run
npm install at first so now this is
going to install every single thing that
we need you know from our package of
course i have a lot of stuff that you
don't need for this app so when you see
start like four react you could take it
out at some point you know it's up to
you guys I'm just setting you guys up
the easiest way the fastest way to do
this okay
although that's being installed although
that's running okay let's see what's
special here okay no a show I guess or
is there
Derick node ever since I installed the
latest node is we're giving me issues I
don't know why we see error handling
eval ok library size expand it's
installing a lot of stuff yeah I usually
just fast forward to this guy's but it's
alright you guys could you know take the
pain with me of doing this right now
this massive install of packages I know
come on come on this has never taken
this long I swear to God
where all this stuff comes from
ok building in
Wow I did not know this was gonna take
this long guys seriously it was to take
five minutes that's it
like god yeah I should have just used
yard I'm sorry
I apologized cool but it's fine we went
through that pain now let's run npm npm
run watts okay let's see hey everything
loaded fine that's fine okay now let's
see if there's an error console.log this
okay
components hyper not filed so let me see
if this got set components hyper is
there okay obviously first let me look
into this what is it
okay
GES components hyper gotta put the
extension come on son

so right now we're ready to go away
we're good to go kids
all right put this here put this here
move this up bring this down and now if
you just come here you know and play
around with this real quick so what
you're seeing here is like JSX right and
