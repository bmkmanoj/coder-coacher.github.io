knows your boy joke back at it again man
coding face.com listen guys so your boys
back and I don't did it again all right
but I just watched this video about
Facebook's youngest engineer ever
this kid was 13 years old who created I
think is four snaps or something like
that I saw app that became like in the
top 10 of iOS and you know it was like
very emotional I'll be yeah be honest
after watching the the video I was like
yeah this reminded me so much of me when
I was fourteen years old and I was
building websites and you know I'm just
thinking now I'm like man my son might
get the chance to like really create
some cool things in this world like if
if I tell him like not talking but show
him like the skills that I have and the
potential that he might have you know in
the future and because you know I didn't
get that I didn't have one I don't I
don't come
and tell you all you could be whatever
you want to be
probably this kid man like his parents
they had a lot of money you know
probably gave him a good education you
know right and then 2008 came in they
hit and basically they lost their house
they lost everything and basically the
kid took over you know he's only 13
years old he took over he started like
learning how to code on YouTube learning
how to code on udemy and this goes to
show to people like people come here and
they be like oh you know you guys is
always trying to
point is that you guys should be
learning you got
there is no excuse we live in 2017 this
is not like you know the 1980s 1970s
1990s we're in 2017 Brina
we're in 2017 do you understand like the
facilities that you have right now like
all the things that you have in your
hands and a lot of people are not are
not taking advantage you know a lot of
people are not taking advantage about
this you know like I'm learning how do I
become a developer like
and for 13 years old kid could do it why
can't you as an adult who's has
had so much experience in life and knows
what you need to do to be successful if
a little kid can do it why can't you
you know what I mean like really I want
you guys to go hard I really want you
guys to go hard
all you have to do is just work hard
you
listen to what I'm saying at least and
really just go hard guys
please you know like don't waste don't
waste your time you know like take
advantage of the cool things that you
have man you know thirteen years old man
you know he went to the summer
internship now he's actually working as
a full-time engineer on Facebook and a
reality
why would Facebook hire 13 years old
right they'll be like why should we hire
a little kid who probably doesn't know
that much about you know programming
yeah he made a cool app that became
popular that's fine but why did they
hire him it's very simple if you have
the determination and you have to hustle
and you have that time you like the
passion for it that's what they they
basically hire them not because he's
like a genius it's not about being a
genius is that how you know as a 13
years old how do you go about and start
looking on YouTube and searching for
things right how do you go and say hey I
want to learn how to become a u.s.
developer and go on udemy and buy a
course right how do you do that when you
13 his own right so I could imagine he
probably was like ohhhh telling his mom
mom please you know let me get your
credit card so I could buy a course
please or you know I need a new laptop
I need a Mac you know so he had
dissemination he knew what he wanted to
do he's like you know what I want to
create an app I know I have a good idea
so I want to do it he busted his ass
talking about like six months created a
cool on the course and it's another
course created the freaking
Oh app and now the kid is like
everywhere they freaking interview him
in every country he's travelling the
world like in his home country of Chile
I didn t know but one of those two he's
like a superstar like come on one more
do you do you want out of this you know
what I mean anything for you guys you
know sometimes it's luck you know what I
mean like it this always gonna be that
factor the factor of luck are you lucky
are you lucky enough to be in the right
place at the right time I release the
right application at what time do you
release it you know let a little
like that can help you but if you're not
determined to make something out of
yourself and basically become all that
you can be then you know what I mean
like this it's all up to you nobody can
make you a developer nobody can come
here and make you create you know
projects and I can't make you guys take
tutorials I can't do that all right I
can just only tell you guys the good
things that happens when you're doing
all right the good things that happens
when you come in and you bust the ass
everybody has to work hard in this world
some people are lucky where their
parents work hard but at some point
they're gonna have to work hard to
maintain that money right even the
people that are born with money they
have to work hard to maintain because
money is just like anything else you
could waste it and spend it you
know what I mean so yeah
let me see those holes online right now
I'm about to go and actually about to go
back to work but I wanted to just share
the kiss I was watching this video on my
lunch break today I didn't want to do a
lunch break what developers lunch break
