again coding fees.com your boy is back
and odd and did it again
dad listen guys we hear once again of
your boys driving to the gym about to
hit platinum fitness really hard right
now that's what I do my lunch breaks man
now back in the days I used to call eat
some soda eat some soda is some turkey
sandwich Wow
yeah so eat turkey sandwich with orange
soda those days are over now your boys
out here healthy trying to get help to
you I guess and yeah so I talked to you
guys about cold and what I'm doing on my
lunch break my lunch break consists of
me going to the gym after doing a whole
bunch of videos for my courses cuz as
you guys may know that's my new job and
your job is to make sure you guys get
jobs right my job is to make sure that
you guys get hired you gotta become
entrepreneurs yeah basically become
freelancers whatever you want to become
in the space of what development that's
my job all right any new framework any
new language any new thing that's coming
up in the world I'm supposed to let you
guys know about and that's my job so
when I take my breaks when my brain
hurts like I just finished doing like
a react course learn react by building a
Craigslist clone which to be honest with
you guys is pretty difficult it's a lot
of complex things in there because we're
using react router and at the same time
we're using no GS to make sure we're
filtering everything so it's not just a
simple single page app there's a lot of
different things that that it has it's
just pretty much like a lot of work it's
as if I was working for a company let's
just put it at that is as if I'm working
for a company the only difference is I'm
actually teaching it to you guys so yeah
because I wanted to make sure I gave you
guys like real life experience like real
life projects you guys don't need
somebody to come in here and tell you
hey here's a to do here's how to do a
little you know a raise how to filter
through an array like nobody needs that
man what people need is complicated
stuff things that you're gonna be doing
it at a real job and that's what I do
for you in this new course this cracks
this course that I've built
but yeah so it was pretty complex pretty
difficult so what I'm doing is I'm
taking a break from that yeah right now
we driving this little road right here
it's pretty dangerous when you come to
think about it like if you come here at
a certain speed you pretty much go crash
into somebody if you don't slow down so
yeah right that's what we get right now
somebody asked me Joe what happened to
your car what did you do trade it in
blue this and that I'm like nah we still
open here we still in the Benz mommy we
still up in here you know somebody I'm
saying is like just because I don't come
in here but I'm in no bands I'm
in business that doesn't mean you my car
got repossessed Bobby now man like high
seven hundred so let that go down
you know I mean it took me a long time
to get here I would never let my car get
everybody know like nothing happened as
long as I have strength to work I'm
always gonna pay my bills on time and
that's how everybody should be man
sometimes people be like oh they focus
so much and other things I will
definitely tell you guys check out this
channel called what's this guy's name
David Ramsey or something like that it's
this old man this old guy who is like a
financial adviser right and he has an
amazing YouTube channel he talks about
how people well people call him up
through the phone right and he answers
questions the same thing that I do here
in YouTube right he does know you - -
but it's about financial things and
people that don't know how to control
their life how to take over their
payments and how to you know be
responsible so they they hit him up
like those DUHS guy who's like oh man
it's like
I want to go to college but I'm poor and
you know I can't afford to go to a a Ivy
League school I got a set date and this
and that and then the guy is like listen
man if you don't come from money
like go ahead and just just freakin go
to a regular college you know college
in-state you don't have to go out of
state because they charge you double you
know to me so be smart and like I love
that channel because it just tells you
like a lot of good vices man you know
how to make sure to you know pay off
your debt how to always stay on top of
credit cards like all my credit cards I
only have one credit card that the
maximum that it goes to monthly is like
$1,500 and I have it on automatic
payment so as soon as it goes up any
amount it gets paid automatically right
and I think people don't like to do that
because people want to have their money
in their pocket me I rather not even
have that much money in my pocket I
rather just be like yo I'm freaking I'm
credit rich you know what I mean you
know I mean like your boy walking around
with a $100,000 credit card you know I
mean like I rather be that you know I
mean I'm trying to get that that
Centurion American Express the
blackboard Oh

there but they don't give it to
everybody you so technically you
supposed to spirit of Bali I was a year
on the car for you to be able to get get
the card I mean I'm not up to that level
but once I I start growing you know

that credit card so we trying to build
up we're trying to get that African
American Express that's what I'm trying
to get right now you know what I mean
that black card dough and I'm trying to
get that like you know I mean once you
made it to that then you good I'm up to
the Platinum in the gold level but once
I get to that African American Express
it's a rap you know what I mean we in
there man yeah man sometimes I want to
make videos like this but I don't know
if I should even put it out here you
know like because technically this
channel is just about cold just about
coding and stuff but sometimes I want to
like give advice to people to like just
like regular stuff like how to get your
credit up you know my credit was so bad
man oh my god you guys don't even know
my credit was so bad at one point it was
like a 542 or something like that like
that's bad that's like Queen when you go
to t-mobile and just to open up an
account they ask you for $300 they think
you know we don't trust you you ain't
opening no account with us if you want
to open an account you gotta pay $300

hundreds you know I mean I'm high up
there you know we tap into the backboard
of the 800 man but listen man we came a
long way man you know I mean I always
tell you guys man

somebody who coming in from wherever you
come from man it could come from money
you could come from the employee who
come from whatever you know you start
getting money you start getting like
$100,000 a year you start spending a lot
of money you started thinking like oh
I'm balling but you gotta understand
when you spend money
it's like know when you start earning
money you're gonna spend more money no
matter what

kinetic is beautiful look at that the
mountains you surrounded by the
mountains you know what I mean like it's
all mountains out here you know
Jaime rios asks me what you asked me it
says how old were you when you started
coding the very first time I even
started doing anything was 14 years old
I build a Dragonball Z website that
Dragon Ball Z website started getting
about half a million unique visitors per
month and then my mom said give me that
credit card back I'm shining that
down because they were charging back in
the days if you used to have a lot of
traffic like companies will don't let
you rock right they'll let you go in the
lecture rocking the wheel okay cool you
you can create your little website but
then if you start getting a lot of
traffic they start charging you more so
I remember one time the bill came back
and like they you know I don't know if
it was gold daddy who did I have wasn't
one-on-one or Go Daddy or something like
that and they charged my mom like 90
dollars you know how your mom's is
looking at you like boy that's a whole
day of work for me give me that credit
card back and she basically I don't even
think that she she got the credit card
back what she did was just she she
changed her credit card number she
called her company changed the credit
card number and next thing you know my
website shut down my mommy I need the
credit card anything critical next thing
you know that's a yeah boy got shut down
and then from there whatever my mom
didn't believe me she's at all you can't
do this is you you're gonna go blind in
front of a computer you know I mean you
know how people are pretty pretty
ignorant as I telling you like oh
there's like graphic designers they pay
only you know the only make $30,000 it's
like the same thing that I hear from you
know people nowadays when they say oh
and WordPress you can only make $60,000
like boy shut the hell up like you don't
know nothing you know I see this all the
time on on websites I people repeat the
same thing and that's how you know
people are dumb because they repeat
something that they don't know about
from some guy that doesn't know
either so it's like they hear it on like
a core like a core of blog posts or
whatever a core answer and then people
just continue repeating and repeating
and repeating it and it's like until
some idiot repeats it again and it's
like now you are the idiot because you
repeated it again you know what I mean
so it's like it doesn't make sense but
that's how the internet works
psych nobody needs like proof of
anything nobody needs to do research
nobody needs to look into things it's
like you know I was doing the research I
was gonna do a video I might do it later
on this week about you jes what's the
state of you jes for jobs currently
right now right and UJS is like
literally the most popular the most
popular framework that people talk about
on YouTube yes it's the most popular
thing that the people talk about on
blogs YouTube Cora you know so
constantly people always bring it up but
when you do the research like I was like
looking at things I was like you know
you go how you call this on indie calm
and you search title colon angular right
and you're gonna see about 600 jobs in
the United States for this month right
brand new postings you go into
indeed.com a search title calling view
and you're gonna find that there's
literally literally listen to this
there's about nine jobs in the whole
United States and it just doesn't make
sense when you think about it for the
amount of attention and promotion that
people give this framework it just
doesn't make sense
you know I mean is like nobody's looking
for this thing nobody's hiring for it
but yet again people are wasting the
time learning it people are constantly
creating blog creative YouTube post or
you know videos and this this and that
and then it's like does anybody do
research does anybody like look up
things like you know what I mean I don't
know you know so that's how the internet
is man but yeah man so that's all I'm
saying
and it's like we here man right now life
is a Snuggie you know I mean we we
chilling your boys out here in the
little gray hairs you know a little
something right there a little bit got
you know got your little Benghazi and
stuff in the face real quick guys you
gotta have fun in this world man so yeah
man we hear what a quarter water bottle
lots of work out listen your boys not
playing no games around it's the web
developer lunch breaks this is just me
hanging out this is just me talking ish
what you guys having fun
don't take nothing too serious you know
people be like oh my god Joe flexing out
here too much doing this and that guys I
do this cuz people love it not cuz I
love it you know I do it cuz people love
it it's not my fault
we gotta you know you gotta you know
when people try to flex on you you gotta
flex back man you gotta there's like
some some skinny ass dude coming up to
you is like trying to flex up
what's the damn like bro pull this out
man
I just pull this out man I just go like
this is like hey man pull this out
there's a little wallet looking hefty
you know how me this one is looking
hefty you know what I mean you gotta
have fun with it
and some people might say Amen money is
not everything it's not everything but
it's like it's like is it an award you
get what I'm saying I feel like it's an
award right it's a great now you could
be the smartest person in the world if
nobody knows that you're smart why why
does it even matter
you gotta say like you could create the
most amazing application if the
application does not bring you any type
of income what was the point of even
creating me you'd everyone say if you
are here working hard like I work hard
guys I'm being honest it's not just me
like talking BS our card I come in the
videos in the morning the videos in the
afternoon
I freaking answer emails I freaking
create applications then I have my own
applications that I have to maintain so
that's my real bread and butter you know
like what I do in YouTube dislike my fun
stuff right what I do on coding phase
calm that's not I know it's not
something that's gonna bring me any like
major income for at least another three
years right so in reality my bread and
butter is my websites you know the
websites that I have that pretty much
all right like you know CSS generators
or you know I have this other one that
is about music I'm also gonna do a video
about this too because I found this new
application this web application called
just watch comm it's the simplest thing
in the world but this person really knew
what the hell he was doing so what he
did was he connected to the api's of
every single service that's out there
everything from Google Android well the
Google Play Store the Apple picker was
an apple itunes store
Netflix Hulu he connected to every
single API out there and created this
website called just watch comm if you
guys want to check it out go check it
out
right just watch calm and all it does is
it filters through the data so like
let's say you wanted to watch a movie
from 1980s right currently in Netflix
you can't even filter through anything
in Houla you can't filter through
anything in the Apple Store you can't
really filter three right so this guy
created created the service that's
called just watch comm now all it does
is filtered through the data and shows
people I hate you wanted to see
transformers the first movie here's
where to watch it they have it on
Netflix they have it on the Apple Store
hey you wanted to watch rocks and the
original show they have it on Hulu they
have it on CBS comm etc all right this
do it is making money when I'm telling
you guys he's making money and this is
just one single developer that created
this website right and I tell people all
the time like oh people think that you
need a company you don't need a company
you know what I mean you come in you
have an idea so you you solve a problem
that people have you know what I mean
and then from there just come in you
build the application yeah it could be
very simple could be just filtering
through data if people need it then
you're gonna make money because of the
advertising so this guy he has
advertising on the website and I even
that much only on the top right and
currently I think he's getting like
millions of views because Netflix
doesn't have good filtering so people
need that that right so when you
search online how to filter through
Netflix his website pops up so imagine
how many people have spent like half an
hour looking through Netflix trying to
find a movie and can't figure out which
movie to watch right this guy just made
it simpler for them right made it super
simple super easy and now he's gonna be
gashing you know I mean not even making
cash making that Yosh and I tell you
guys all the time listen listen to your
boy I've been around this parts already
I've been doing this for a long time
guys
I know the mistakes that I made I wish I
was freaking making you know my own
websites like as far as like my own CSS
generators and stuff like that a long
time ago if I wouldn't know if I would
have known that you make so much money
from advertising like I would have just
been doing that a long time ago right
and I really wish that I would have
freaking just documented my whole
journey you know that's why I think what
Christian has done what now the dreaded
deaf is doing you know they basically
created YouTube channels very early on
in their careers like they just started
like croissant only has like what a year
and a half or the dreaded death has like
one year you know year year and a half
that they've been doing this and now
they created their own channel so now
they go people get to see the document
you know the documentation of their
history you know like I wish people
would have seen me in my little Saturn
Vue you never say looking extra crusty
looking extra bummy you know with like
two dollars in my pocket you know $5 for
the gas to get to work you know those
are the things that people really
appreciate you know it's like this guy
Gary Vee said like there's a video of
Gary Vee when he would just started his
his YouTube channel back in the days you
know he looked mad dirty he look mad
crusty no no good lighting no nothing
right so that's how it is man you come
in you document your your your story and
people get motivation out of that you
know cuz I'm pretty sure a lot of you
guys right now crusty you y'all looking
at this video like that
man Joe I know what you're talking about
I'm crusty right now I'm not saying that
you're looking bad boy I'm saying that's
how I call it crusty when you look
crusty when it's like you don't got no
money in your pocket you can't do
whatever the hell you want in this world
you're crusty you know what I mean so
right now a lot of you guys like us to
use like yo you see Joe you see somebody
else see Gary VC all his people they
good and it's like you're gonna get
there you're gonna get to that point
where you're gonna be good give yourself
the time it's just that's how it is some
people they're lucky some people they're
lucky that things happen for them like
that right some people they have to work
for it you know I was one of those
people the unlucky ones that I have to
work for everything everything that I
want to do I have to work for it you
know and it sucks
all right I wish I could just have
everything that that you know will be
like easy and got our cool I do
something in in it's Golding you know
but now I have to work for you I have to
make it work you know but that's how it
is man you know I'm gonna look a project
 surprised if I was like yo hella
crusty right now yeah but not for too
long
man listen trust me you're gonna blink
time goes by so fast that right now you
might think like oh man this course is
taking forever I'm learning this it's
taking me forever to find a job you want
a job as soon as possible right but what
you gotta understand it's a big but is
that it takes time and the beauty about
time is that time flies time goes slow
when you're having a really boring time
right and you're like all mended and
you're looking at the clock all right
never look at the clock never look at
what time it is
that's how I live my life I don't look
at the time I don't look at measurements
yeah I try to not look at anything you
know anything that has a specific order
to things like you look at the time you
the day I try not to look at those
things I just like to live my life and
let time go pass by because if you look
at the time you said oh man it's 9
o'clock
I got till 3 p.m. to get you know you
know 5 p.m. whatever to get out of work
work is gonna be super slow if you look
at the dating but I oh man I got a dual
you know freakin but 20 30 days more of
coding before I even get a job then
you're gonna be like this thing's taking
me forever what you gotta do is just
have tunnel vision keep your eyes closed
and just keep going man that's it so
yeah man
let me see Jonathan Moore you haven't
the moon says Stephen do what is it that
is a moral sense the people get paid to
promote in tree house everybody gets
paid man everybody gets paid you know I
mean that's 9 that you could do about it
like that's just how it is everybody
gets paid somehow some what if they
promote something right or even if you
don't promote something the companies
will come to you until you hate we want
you to because you're sending people to
our website we want to pay you
that's just how it is
here's a true algorithm questions show
up on web developer jobs it depends the
company that you're gonna work for they
all depends on the company if you're
going into Google yeah of course they're
gonna ask you many complicated questions
because that's how they weed out people
you know even if you're a talented
developer the way how they Excel the
millions and millions of applicants is
by making it as difficult as possible
for you to get in okay now can you
bypass that yeah
if you know somebody in there I'm pretty
sure that you could get right in you
know a lot of the good developers
getting in those companies without even
having to go take a test or anything
yeah man Pera doodly-doo Thank You Man
he says your information is valuable
even beyond web development
I don't even call it boy I enjoy
listening to your insight yeah man I try
to I try to give people like just a real
life advice man that's what I try to do
because even though we talk about code
like code doesn't have to be boring plus
one thing that I tell people too you
know when I hear like you know some guys
have been like oh they like 3040 years
old like man I don't know if I'm already
old enough you know too old to getting
or becoming a web developer is like bro
you come in in with so much life
experience that 19 20 year old who's a
good developer might not have you know
what I mean so even though you haven't
been coding that much you have life
experience like your brain works
differently there's things that you can
do that other people cannot do who's
younger you gonna say
Manny Cortez says hey Joe I took your
advice and looking for projects around
me to build portfolio I did one for a
friend's restaurant now they want a
mobile app to go with it thanks man
there's my first gig listen you know
Manny Cortez Congrats
that's what I do man I just kept coming
here like just give you stuff that I
wish somebody would have told me you
know I'm not I'm not the dude that you
know I'm not the best spoken dude I'm
the best-looking dude I'm you know I
don't even like to shave you know it's
like I come in here just give you life
experience things that I've I've gone
through it I just give you the real
that's it you know I mean like somebody
told me that they hate yo you should
edit your videos more I'm like how about
no I don't want to edit anything like
that's the beauty of this channel like I
I come in here and give you just the
real if I stutter if the word didn't
come out right if I do this and that
that's not the point the point is that
I'm actually giving you a good advice so
you know for the ones that do listen to
