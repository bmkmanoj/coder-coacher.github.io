back and I done did it again
kids what up how's everybody doing man
how you guys doing I hope you guys is
good I hope you guys had a good weekend
I bring a little bit sick I kind of went
out yesterday but I was still for the
sick and then I guess that didn't you
know made me even worse but you know I
had to come here live with you guys and
to celebrate you know 15,000 subscribers
it feels like just the other day we got
10,000 subscribers so a matter of fact
you know make sure let me look into it
like how long ago was it that we had
10,000 subscribers what was it that we
hit the mark thank you
named thanking me make sure while you
guys getting here I got to see this live
let me see how can i watch oh yeah man
let me see who's in here live with me
right now we got a few people in here
and once again I wouldn't be surprised
if a lot of you guys did not get to have
the notifications you know how Google is
go we'll be trying to play me but it's
alright yeah man we
10,000 man we got your boy Ramsay
joining we got Kelvin Davis we've got
Avenue Naveen sy yet Malay 3,000 John
this la who else is in here Mike
we got Donovan we got Jena Malone we got
echo Martinez we got Joseph Torres we
got Michael ondru Sir David Robert who
else logon David Robert yeah because I
already said that
let me see I'm trying to get this real
quick I want to find out um what Milo
was saying when trying to get this right
now see when was it that we went and we
got 10,000 subscribers I think it was
like somewhere around December I think I
think around December or November let me
try to figure it out what day I should
be writing this down and I should be
writing it down every single
accomplishment should write it down like
in the about page or something so we
could look back on it
I figure how exactly was it that that we
hit this you know because I know in
December 10 we got 1 million views but I
don't know when did we get 10,000 trying
to figure it out
alright
doesn't matter I'll figure it out later
I'll write it down somewhere yeah man
we've been here I know a few months we
already got 5,000 more subscribers you
know so lastly G you know we growing
steadily growing you know so it's like
we got like an average of I think what
maybe 1400 1400 subscribers per month I
mean that's fine
you know we growing and it was cool
about it too is like we have not
important all your subscribers in here
man you know so I'm really happy about
that
you know and then the people are not
that lawyer you you know they cut
themselves out you know what are people
that don't like the content they cut
themselves but we here man we live man
we we tell him I'm working on this
corner face.com
website the new site that we're about to
release man it's been a lot of work man
I want also you know give a big shout
out to your boy Jake it's a new member
of the team for coding fees.com
who has been helping me out with the
descriptions of what a course isn't just
helping the transition of going from the
older website to the new website he's
helping out a lot so Jake I think his
user name is jay qatar so yemen Jake
thank you
you already knows your boy Joe we in
here so thank you man so what's good man
let me see let me see
Joe hit me up
even though I'm not ready I'm just gonna
go through the car yeah man you show up
man show up man just go to the job
listen a lot of times you know we'd be
freaking nervous like oh man I don't
even know if I'm ready you're not gonna
know if you're ready until you're there
and you working you know what I mean and
then even when you're there working
you're gonna come out a float like
doesn't matter what they throw at you
you're gonna find the answers because
number one that's just how we are as
human beings like you know we get put
into situations and there at the end
somehow we strive and become better in
somehow we get it done that's what a
developer does all day you know I was
like all the things that you're gonna be
learning you know I think Oh defense
calm whatever website you want to go to
or you to freak okay or you didn't mean
I don't know wherever you you go to
write to learn pretty much everything
that you're gonna learn from there is
all the basics and all the things that
is gonna get you going as a developer
right but you got to understand this
every single job has their own ways of
doing things so no matter what you still
gonna have to learn things whenever you
go to a new job so you're gonna be good
you know everybody goes through that
first two three weeks of a new job is
always the hardest because number one
you don't even know nobody you're just
getting in there you're like oh man I'm
gonna make friends with people that I
don't even know you know I gotta be fake
with a lot of people that's just when I
go to a new job that's how I look at I'm
like man I gotta be freakin fake way a
lot of people I don't even know and
people that probably don't even like me
off the jump cause that's just how it is
you know some people are gonna like you
some people are just not gonna like you
you know that's how it is I don't know
if you guys remember like back in school
I always bring it back like work
anything about you know development
programming it's just like high school
you know what I mean it's like high
school think about it like that you're
gonna go into places where it's like hey
automatically you're gonna be
cool you know people's gonna like you
and then there's gonna be other rooms
that you're gonna go into and people's
like we don't like this person well
that's how it is man so unless you get
paid who cares right as long as you get
that bag to buy or not to buy let me see
the fakeness is the hardest part cuz I'm
too real for my own good
yeah man sometimes I think I'm I'm a
victim too to the same thing being too
real when you're too real like it
sometimes it could be bad you know what
I mean I think a lot of times the people
are mostly successful is the people that
know how to be the fakers
you know the fake smile people that have
horrible days and still have a fake
smile the people that they act like they
like everybody and everybody inside of
them like they hate a lot of people yeah
Bitcoin has crash man Bitcoin is done
guys I don't know man I'm so happy
though with Bitcoin because I went in
there I bought at $2,000 right
I bought at $2,000 and I bought like
five nah I bought I bought like five
bitcoins at that time right and then I
was like losing money whenever I did
like a major drop I will gain some and
then I will lose something now I was
just selling at the end I still had two
two coins when they were from when I
bought in my 2000 right I had two coins
I don't know if you guys remember a few
months ago whatever I started selling me
right I say you know once it went to 19
and then came down to 16 I say I hate
him with this facing right Bitcoin okay
time to step out real quick so right now
my coinbase wallet is like this zero so
everything that I did on Bitcoin last
year was just profit I mean also in
total we made money it had a Bitcoin now
I don't know where bitcoins gonna go at
all so you know that's just how it is
Jenna Jenna Malone says Jo of seeing a
lot of job descriptions that say require
being computer science should I apply
anyway yes apply anyways man you gotta
understand like a lot of times companies
put this out and be like a computer
science degree right but you come in
with a solid portfolio you have more
Skills than a college graduate you're
going to get hired and that happens a
lot of times people think like oh man it
was like you go to computer science and
you know and it's like you come out
prepared not really like a lot of those
guys they come out mediocre when it
comes to web development like okay they
know oh you know they know Java you know
they know programming they know data
structures they know a couple of
algorithms but when it comes to websites
a lot of guys don't even know HTML a lot
of guys don't even know CSS a lot of
guys don't even know JavaScript so it's
like a college graduate goes in there
and you and him could go at the same
time applying for the same position but
this person has no skills at all in any
of those web technologies or anything
that has to do with the web but you
already know the web right so who you
think is gonna get hired they're gonna
hire you because they'd rather say hey
we're gonna give Janna the job because
she's gonna come in here and be
productive right away a college graduate
you gotta give them at least a month
maybe two sometimes even three and you
know depending on exactly what you want
him to do sometimes that person might
not even be really really good until six
months because it's like they have no
knowledge of web
when you go to a computer science degree
right you go to university a lot of the
courses they give you as elective when
it comes to the web so they don't tell
people hey man you should take some
electives in in web no the web is like
an extra it's like guys to go in for
computer science a lot of times they
think like oh man I'm I'm gonna be
programming robots and doing all this
cool stuff same thing as guys to go for
engineering right oh I'm gonna go here
I'm gonna be you know building this
amazing you know this amazing system and
this and that and then when the real
world comes in smack some eye in the
face and it's like oh there's not that
many jobs in those fields but now I got
this piece of paper that's worthless
because if I can get hired in those
fields I'm useless so what's the next
step they say okay there's a lot of jobs
in the web I already know programming
but I don't know nothing about the web
because I never took an elective I never
took anything so what do I do I go to a
boot camp continue again my education
and this is what happens a lot of times
that's why you see so many computer
science graduates in boot camps like
it's flooding every boot camp knows it
they're flooded with like a whole bunch
of computer science graduates because
they have to they have the theory they
have the data structures they have the
algorithms they have the programming
side but the web they don't know
anything about it so it's like you're
starting from zero okay like yes you
know whatever for each you know you know
what a loop is you know what a variable
is but you don't know how to put it
together to make a website or a web
application so yeah
yeah man so I'm go ahead man go ahead
Jenna do what you gotta do is just go
apply man let me see who's in here any
questions anything you guys want to talk
about let me know man we here
celebrating 15,000 subscribers I'm a
little bit sick God you know a little
something that hurts my throat my throat
hurts my nose hurts I'm sick you know
but we had to do it man 15,000
subscribers is it's definitely really
good especially for this niche audience
like I've gotten a lot of subscribers in
other channels that I've had but not in
this small niche audience like this is a
really really small niche audience right
like most people that have let's say an
example like a hundred thousand
subscribers they've been here for like
four to five years you know or more
which tells you that the audience is is
really small because I for four to five
years with a very popular um you know
genre of of you know content here on
YouTube you could have 510 million
subscribers but for you to only have a
hundred thousand subscribers it shows
you like it's very neat very small
community and it's the same thing as
here you know fifteen thousand
subscribers for the first year is
actually pretty good
organically not paying for advertising
not paying full form how you call this
Facebook groups not paying for you know
none other marketing schemes like this
is just genuine freaking organic
subscribers the only people that stay
here are the people that love the
channel it's not like people subscribing
never come back people subscribe and are
active you know I was like that's why I
love my subscribers that's why you see
like yesterday I was like man I felt bad
cuz I was like man I was really sick I
wanted to do a video for you guys
and I was like man I have to do like I
feel I mean like indebted to to you guys
like I have to come in and show you guys
and I'll show you you know hit you guys
up with a video or you know a live video
I'll ease so I got to do a little
something for you guys because you guys
showed me so much love you guys support
me
yeah support the channel support the
website support everything that we do
here and it's like the least I can do is
give you content you know so that's what
we hear man but I I really appreciate
you guys man
John this Allah says Joe your courses on
JavaScript are helping me a lot boy came
back to it and realized I always forget
some of the concepts any tips to make
objects arrays loops syntax stick um I
don't know man but um yeah look I'm
gonna be honest like this which is is
very simple
think of or raise is when you want to
put something as a list right arrays are
just a list I love numbers objects any
type of other data right any type of
data so you can putting objects or rays
you could put a race within a raise and
I raise withing arrays like you know he
could go deep into it right but arrays
you use it when you want it to have as a
list something you can say okay this is
0 this is 1 this is 2 this is 3 this is
4 like that when you have objects
objects like let's say something like
let's say for example let me see if I
could share this the screen
okay cool so this is the data from
coding fees calm so pretty much how I
have everything is all the courses are
inside of an array right for every
single course there's an object okay so
each object inside of this main array is
actually a course okay so hold on let me
see
you see if I close it close all of these
so closer here closer here closer here
okay so currently there's five courses
alright so each one of these is a course
now inside of the course I have a lot of
different information that I'm me for
this for this course so you got the
title the title holds a string then you
got price which is an integer hours
integer category so because I'm gonna
have multiple categories in some
situations what I do is I say hey this
is gonna be in a rate because there's a
list of different categories okay if I
say hey I have a slug slug is like the
URL so the slug is just a regular string
URL of the course is a string the
description you see the description I
decided to use an object okay because I
wanted to basically say hey I want to
name this description and then inside of
the description there's multiple
different types of data so inside of
this then I say hey short description is
there short description there's another
string target which is a list of
different target audience is basically a
bunch of different strings together
inside of this array and then learn is
also an array which which holds a bunch
of different strings inside of it and
then requirements is the same thing as
another list so then I have strings
inside of it okay so that's pretty much
I mean that's like the basics of like
how you will use it
you know now as far as loops you can use
whatever loop you want you know don't
let nobody come in and tell you hey man
you have to use a map you have to use a
for-loop you have to use a for each you
have to use our that filter you you have
to use whatever no you use whatever you
want right you could come in and use a
while loop if you want right people
might be like oh you should you know you
could do this with a for loop like yeah
I know I could do it with a for loop but
I want to do it with a wire loop it's
looping over the same thing you know
what I mean so it's up to you which one
you want to choose so well yeah I hope
that answers like some of your question
like I couldn't go too deep into it cuz
we hanging out you know we're not really
teaching right now but I hope that makes
make some sense to you okay let me see
yeah
it's like a cold man man it's like is it
a disease there's just a cold I went
outside I want to throw out the garbage
without a jacket I thought I was sweet I
thought I was like I was good I'm like
I'm gonna be back I'm gonna go throw out
the garbage and it was in the night time
next thing I know the next day I'm dying
I'm having fevers I'm having a whole
bunch of stuff and I've been like that
for like the past two or three days so
yeah man definitely if you live in the
East Coast right now or you live
somewhere in the north of the United
States put on a jacket
don't be outside trying to be brave like
it's not worth it a had a junior
developer so many questions I've had
hard I'm saying winter says a had a
junior dev interview today so many
questions I've had over years our answer
by some devs on you
I've had over years okay winter this
year your paragraph makes no sense
you gotta put it in a way where it makes
sense like I'm reading it doesn't make
sense I can't understand what you're
trying to say let me see a figure
University universities who access to
learn Python because it's useful in math
physical sciences the girl hated and
dropped out yeah that's why they
teaching Python in school because it's
easy and you could use it for a whole
bunch of different things Joe which is
better for back end no jsr PHP listen
none of them are better than each other
they're both the same so be honest with
you they're both the same thing
you know somebody's gonna come in and
but no this one's a little bit faster
than the other one in sight listen for
the web for what we do for what we
working on they both do the same job you
know and that's it you choose whichever
one you want to do you know which
everyone has jobs around your area don't
choose something like as a hey man I'm
gonna freakin I'm gonna learn was a lisp
I think this is like Lisp or something
like that and like there's no jobs for
Lisp and you're you're freaking area or
something you know I mean like you're
wasting your time
I'm a mezuzah
the Swiss statements which statements
are super useful you gotta get used to
it because they're very useful unless
you planning on doing like a freaking
500 line if an else statement you know
else if else like that's gonna be
annoying and we'll have like a whole
bunch of else if if you find yourself
doing more than one else if you know
what I mean like if you're doing more
than that more than like one of those
that means you need to be doing a Swiss
daemon ASAP yo when can we get more of
those portfolio reviews I probably
release one ternary or something like
that it's just I'm trying to get this
website done guys I got I gotta get this
website down so I wanted to do it for
today the 15,000 subscribers but I don't
know if I'm gonna be able to finish it
the most I'm probably gonna have have it
ready by is tomorrow so yeah then from
there I gotta start working on other
courses and other stuff that we got out
of knockout like we gotta go over gulp
we got to go over sorry uh web pack we
got to go over
what else people want to learn how to
create applications will react native so
that's gonna be fun you know so we're
gonna knock those out and yeah man
that's what we get let me see
Congrats Joe your YouTube video 5
projects that'll definitely learn your
job helped me a lot I get to help me a
lot to get a proper way Thank You Man
I'm glad that I helped you man I mean
that's why I did it man I did it for you
guys so you know get your projects and
man because the worst thing is like you
fall into tutorial heaven it's doing
tutorials tutorial tutorial tutorials
and you can't build a page itself
that's the worst trust me I've been
there
so let me see Hector Bernard so far for
me right now javascript is more useful
than Python maybe that would change
someday yeah a Joe this your boy search
can I make music apps with react native
people doing music yes of course your
Joe Congrats on the 15k do you still
have two discord of course man go to
coding phase com you click on the top it
says chat I'm in there every single day
now do I answer every single message
that I get sent no I'm being honest no
because I have to ocean you know I got a
going order like I look at everybody's
messages if I have an answer yours is
because I still answering other people's
stuff but you know at the same time I
can't just stay the whole day like like
this answering answer answering you know
I got a lot of people that had me up
constantly
let me see what else what else nice eyes
looking proper yes sir man it's gonna be
legit oh winter s says yeah what you
meant was that well what he meant was
that a lot of my videos helped them out
answer a lot of those questions that
they ask them oh and the interview that
he did so that's pretty cool man like
you know all the things that I tell you
guys here on my channel is just like
real life things real things that you're
gonna bump into you know this days that
I'm gonna be nice as these I'm not gonna
be nice just because I want you guys to
also get that feel of how it is it's
like the world is not perfect you know
so it's like you can't have everything
be perfect because then you're not ready
for the real world you know what I mean
and as long as you have your portfolio
and you practice on the skills that you
want to perfect on you're gonna get a
job right now it's up to you how long is
gonna take you you know some people have
here Joe how long will it take me to
become a front-end developer that's
exactly why I did the new website
I basically redesigned the new timeline
for those of you guys that haven't seen
the the website yet I'm gonna share it
with you guys so we got a go over it a
little bit so this is a new website
coding phase comm so currently I'm on my
local server but this house is gonna be
the latest video of the latest live
videos gonna always show up here so any
moment you Cobras come to coding phase
com you will see the first video you're
gonna be able to click on it that will
take you to the YouTube video you're
gonna have here the latest courses or
any news that pops up like you know any
new frameworks and the new versions any
new things that you
should know about was gonna show up here
always says news I'm gonna have a
section gonna call the Johnny
scholarship in memory of my little
sister passed away in 2016
she passed away from diabetes and she
wanted to you know become a doctor and
you know she had a lot of dreams and you
know I want to keep her name and her
memory out there in the world so at the
same time I also want to give
opportunity to those that you know they
don't have opportunities so basically
whoever is below the age of 18 meaning
from the age of one if you're a baby
from the age of 1 to 17 you will get the
website completely free this is how we
give back right I'm pretty sure a lot of
you guys had times when you was young
like you wanted to do something nobody
really supported you I went through this
situation when I was you know 14 15
years old I wanted to build my websites
and this and that I wasn't getting no
support so I basically you know our
diverting to other things in things that
were not productive from me or you know
for my future so I wanna make sure that
if there's a kid out there that wants to
become a developer he says hey I want to
build websites hey I want to build phone
applications hey I want to build games
all right I want them to be able to come
to this website and basically join it
for free right of course it has to go
through a process you know a
verification process which is why I was
telling you guys that I need extra help
for people to join the coding phase or
you know code offense comm team because
we need two people to just basically
check the emails and and verify that you
know this people the
kids or the people who are applying for
a scholarship are actually holding yard
we don't want to give that out to people
who could work like you know I had
somebody hit me up the other day like
hey man you know I don't know tell me
something that you sound the if he is
like hey man it's like you know I'm just
here I don't know if I want to become a
developer can you give me access to the
website if I feel like I want to become
a developer I'm gonna sign up for it and
as I broke I don't even want you to be
on my website if you don't even know if
you want to become a developer I don't
even know what what you want to come to
my website and expect that I will give
it to you for free
especially when I come in I do so much
work you know what I mean plus in
reality when it comes down to it
everybody who's a member of coding
face.com
is really paying for the scholarship
right because you guys make it happen
for us to be able to pay for the hosting
to be able to pay for you know scaling
I'm pretty sure once I release this new
website and I put this on Reddit and I
put this on on my colas ready
product cons and a whole bunch of
websites out there once I release this
information that I'm gonna have this
Johnny scholarship out there we're gonna
get thousands and thousands of new kids
signing up globally right worldwide so
this is gonna be like I'm gonna have to
pay a lot of money for scaling right now
all of this is possible because people
like you guys who are member of the
website support the website and then
we're able to basically help out kids
who want to become developers you know
what I mean like some of us are you know
30 40 years old getting into this field
now right but I feel like me as a 30 oh
if I was getting into web development
right now as a 30 year old and I had the
opportunity to
hey I know this cake there's all you
know my nephew wants to get into it I
don't know my nephew his friends you
know they want to get into this I will
give them access but I hey man go to
coding phase Congo check this out and in
reality I'm paying for it because they
are getting it for free but the people
who are paying for the subscription
based are the ones that is maintaining
this whole website I'll tell you guys
we're not looking to become millionaires
we're here to actually give back to the
community and basically help as much
people as we can you know I think as an
adult if you can't pay for it you should
pay for it but at the same time we try
to help out as much you know as much
people as we can I'm not a millionaire I
wouldn't be able to maintain this
website to be honest with you by the
levels of scanning even right now is
like it's going crazy it's like we're
getting so many people coming to the
website especially now once we have this
whole new section for kids and it's
gonna be for kids and the top 50 poorest
countries in the world gonna get access
to this website completely for free once
that happens the traffic on this website
is gonna be ridiculous
so all of that is I wouldn't be able to
maintain right this is gonna be a
community thing this is something that
we all gonna have to maintain this all
right and that's up to you guys if you
guys want to become members of coding
Frieza comm whatever you decide to do
right I'm gonna try to maintain as as
far as I can you know what I mean if it
gets too crazy and I'll be like hey man
we can only have let's say twenty
thousand free members in there because
the the way how you know scaling works
and we wouldn't be able to maintain it
because there's not that many of paying
members to maintain for the free kids
and you know and the members that can't
afford it then I will limit it to like
10,000 20,000 people but let's see how
it goes you know what I mean like we're
trying to do something
great we want to be able to be
remembered by Sonny right you know this
website has got a grow financially this
next year like last year was okay I miss
out here and you talk about even know
what the hell I wanted to do in my life
was like no I I told you guys I wanted
to go to Thailand at some point I was
like kind of leave the US you know I now
have a K now I have a lot of
responsibilities but then I realized on
my weight I also want to give back I
also want to do something positive for
the world cuz tomorrow if I pass away
nobody's gonna remember Joe Santos
Garcia working at XYZ website right but
tomorrow I passed away I still somebody
could continue this the legacy of this
website coding fence calm
you got what I'm saying so or even 10
years from now 20 years from now one of
those kids that signed up to the website
might come up with the next amazing app
or anything like that in just somewhere
you know he's at the New York Times in
the accent hey man um you know like
where do you start and the kid goes like
yeah I started on this website called
coding phase comm just with that that's
enough
you got what I'm saying like that's
enough to continue the legacy unless
somebody else continuing it from there
you know so that's what we're trying to
do we try to do something great out here
we we're not trying to do small scale
we're not trying to do little things me
trying to make it a bigger than what it
is you know so that's where we at so
this is the website coder phase calm
you're gonna have the courses here okay
there's the new layout the courses
you're gonna be able to click on
categories you're gonna have to be able
to click on premium or free you know a
lot of people don't even know that have
a lot of courses on my website
completely free a lot of them bring a
lot is I think there's like five or six
courses right and I'm still gonna
continue doing even more free courses um
so yeah it's like you're gonna be able
to choose either you know premium or
free different there whatever you could
come here
from there this is the new layout for
the courses you know has a description
who is the target audience what will I
learn requirement here you're gonna be
able to get a trailer are you gonna be
able to either buy there's people that
don't want to sign up for the
subscription and to be honest with you
it doesn't make sense why but people
don't want to buy a subscription so
they'd rather buy the course by itself
that's completely fine personally I will
say guys just sign up for the monthly
subscription because with twenty dollars
or ten dollars if you catch the 50% off
or even if we do like a 65 percent off a
special occasion or you know holiday or
whatever type of sale you come in and in
reality you could do like three courses
in one month right so if each course is
$25 $30 or $40 for ten to twenty dollars
you got three of them right and at any
moment you could go in and cancel you
got on the same song if you smart you
know
save your money you know but yeah we got
the timeline we also have the timeline
so there's a lot of new cool stuff that
I'm bringing into the website I have
other people that want to join coding
phase comm where they have their own
courses for like mobile development
software development machine learning we
also gonna have some game development
some of it I'm gonna be doing it or some
of it other people are going to be doing
it we're gonna have front-end
development back in development that's
why I've been focusing on the past six
months since I opened the website the
next stage of the website is gonna be
game development mobile development
software development machine learning
okay but yeah so like let's say you
wanted to click on a front-end
development right automatically this is
for everybody's gonna ask how many hours
per week can you devote right if you
come in here
you put in 20 hours oops
20 hours he click on next from there's
gonna tell you exactly um how many hours
know how many days is gonna take you to
actually basically uh finish the full
running path so at the same time you're
gonna be able to come here and say hey
technically it's gonna start off with
everything saying incomplete and I don't
know if the wording is right you guys
tell me if I should have incomplete or
another word for this cuz this is pretty
much like a checklist is a personal
checklist where you can say hey I
already know this add text editor
already did that learn HTML CSS build a
responsive app advanced see it says
sounds like a pro bug template or you
might say I know this I did until the
jQuery I didn't build a restaurant web
app I did react so pretty much you know
exactly which was you are missing and
it's gonna tell you I'm gonna have the
number here show up how many days is
gonna take you to complete this then we
have this is gonna be removed from here
I'm gonna put something else here we
have to chat which brings you directly
to the discord which is our community
where we could pretty much chat with
each other directly so as you can see we
have a lot of members connected
currently right now so any moment you
could come here and you say hey what up
we in here I've done I mean
like any moment you come here there's
like the general conversation you have
different things like running back in
you know you got now spin so you got the
latest videos he got suggestions you got
all the cool stuff right now let's see
what else you got the link right here
you click on the channel they'll bring
you directly to the YouTube channel
ok and there you go and also you got the
whole old channel itself and yeah man
that's pretty much it you know I mean
like we doing a lot of cool stuff man
let's just say I'm about to change the
game let's just say that right I want to
I want to be able to show people how you
know with the skills that I have how we
could build an empire with it right and
at the same time not be assholes right
cuz you don't have to be an asshole to
build an empire or to you know build
something great something that people
care about you could just be a super
nice student you know take care of
everybody and you know still build
something great you got I'm saying so
that's what I want to do here and yeah
man
let me see the chat I haven't even seen
what you guys are saying see if you guys
like it like the idea see what you guys
think yeah
diabetes diabetes kills people my sister
passed away because it
she wasn't diagnosed properly and didn't
take care of her so I'm reading
everybody's comments so anyway let me
share this in the screen here so people
who actually see it while I'm reading it
sucks that OBS doesn't show doesn't work
properly anymore I don't know why so I
see this look at what people are saying
let me see
yeah man we that's the whole plan man we
gotta definitely give up give something
back to the people man I don't know why
people you know let's give him some
light I don't know why why were you
trying to you know like hey man go check
out my channel like you shouldn't do it
like that man
I've never done it like that like going
to somebody's chatroom hey guys go check
this out like no you create good content
and putting the right titles and you
will get a lot of subscribers that's it
let me see I'm 30
I'm so down bro just don't know now
listen
30 years old you could definitely make
it guys you could get in at any age like
this is not a thing where you know
depending on the age like that's when
you get in what I meant would by saying
you know I was like hey you could be 30
years old all right now and like
wouldn't it be nice to be able to say
hey you know I didn't have this
opportunities you know what I mean cause
uptown sometimes it's not always about
just us right I'm 30 years old right I
could be a developer right now and get
into the industry right now that's my
first time I could be 30 years old but
how wouldn't it be nice you know what I
mean like if we could say hey what
somebody would have helped me out when I
was like 14 15 years old 16 years old 17
years old you get what I'm saying
so that's what I'm trying to do it's not
saying like oh you're 30 years old
that's too old for you guys no it's like
hey I'm 30 years old I'm signing up to a
coding phase comm not only am i
subscriber for myself but I'm also
subscribing and I'm helping out other
kids get into the industry that's it
sometimes you know sometimes it's like
this is like a thing where you giving
yourself but at the same time without
having to do anything you also giving
back to other people let's say I think
it works perfectly you know what I mean
in general what it will really do as far
as like my profit margins what it will
do for me for Joe Santos Garcia it will
bring down my profit margins because
then I will have to pay in for higher
you know
expenses when it comes to scanning like
all of this stuff costs money guys like
the whole website cost money and the
hosting video costs money like other
stuff cost money
right why do you think that YouTube has
so many ads is because it cost money -
for hosting right YouTube would not be
well Google will not be freakin hosting
so many videos if it wasn't gonna make a
profit right especially because it just
costs so much money to host videos so
that's what we're doing here we just
basically say hey man with what we earn
we give back to the kids we give back to
the those people that don't have
opportunity you know what I mean like
people in Haiti there's people hating
somebody says something really ignorant
the other day on a chatroom was like
most of those countries because I say we
helping out the top 50 poorest countries
right somebody said something completely
ignorant say most of those countries
don't even know what a computer is
like you see that that's ignorant
you get what I'm saying like this people
in Haiti there's people in Ethiopia who
have access to the Internet have access
to the computer because I see it on my
map right I see it on my map
oh my Google Analytics I see it where
people come in and people from different
parts of Africa right you gotta
understand like this you can't
trickle-down be like money into people
and expect that to trickle down no you
know under them the only way to really
help a community is to empower some of
them so they could empower other people
below them right so if let's say out of
in those poorest poor countries right
poorest countries in the world right
there's a let's say a 20% of the people
have access to Internet have access to
technology whatever etc right probably
way higher than that but let's say an
example if those people become you know
freelancers online become you know
developers online that they could sell
the services online they can help out
their communities and start buying
things like that's one of the reasons
why Dominican Republic is such a great
country because you know what the
manikins do Dominicans work here in the
United States they send money back over
there and then the country develops and
buys new roads buys a whole bunch of new
things for the community because of the
money that people bring in so it's the
same thing if people work over there and
from home or they do freelancing or they
you know they create their own
communities in you know what I mean like
like sky's the limit for people just
because they're you know somebody lives
in Ethiopia doesn't mean that he has you
know less chances of becoming successful
that somebody who's out here
he might even become more successful but
a because he has less competition you
got when I say like if you are the best
developer right and in your whole city
doesn't matter what part of the world
people need websites
so now you open up your own office in
Ethiopia I don't know what's the capital
of Ethiopia let's say an example ok cool
so you're the best developer in Addis
Ababa Addis Ababa Addis Ababa the
capital of Ethiopia right you know best
develop in Addis Ababa you pretty much
come in and create your or digital
agency over there but all of that stuff
gets done because somebody else helps
you out if you was you know somebody who
didn't have the opportunities to get
free access to this website or people
from Nepal like you got the the list is
right there you know you got a look at
all this top 50 poorest countries in the
world
hey uh and this is the exact same thing
that I that was my issue with a clever
programmer if you guys want to link this
video to him and just be like yo bro
it's kumbaya you could do whatever you
want I hope you understand why I was
basically calling you out five hundred
dollars for one single course doesn't
make sense especially when your audience
is a bunch of Indians people from Nepal
people from being Bangladesh right most
of those people can have four four
hundred out of course so it's like your
audience is one thing but you're trying
to basically sell them or something that
they cannot afford
okay so this is the main reason why I
was having issues with that five hundred
out of core something like your bro like
you look at your audience everybody
there is from like India Bangladesh
Pakistan so pretty much this is the 50
50 years of poorest countries
so you got Afghanistan Angola Bangladesh
manin bhutan burkina faso
Varin de cambodia cape verde Central
African Republic Chad Comoros Democratic
Republic of Congo 0t Equatorial Guinea
our Guinean what is it every three are
Ethiopia Gambia Guinea guinea-bissau
Haiti
Kiribati Laos what else let's see we got
Lesotho Liberia Madagascar Malawi
Malthus Mali Mauritania Mozambique
Myanmar Nepal Niger Rwanda Samoa South
Tomi prints Senegal Sierra Leone Solomon
island Somalia Sudan timor-leste Togo
Tuvalu Uganda Tanzania Vanuatu Yemen
Zambia right so you pretty much you're
part of one of these countries right
Oh Cody freeze calm we're gonna welcome
you we're gonna say hey man we want to
help you out and to get the skills that
you might need to work out here or work
from your country so you know it's like
I don't know cooking you know I can't
come up with say cooking face.com I
can't come up with say hey medicine
face.com I can't do mechanic face.com I
can't do manufacturing calm I don't know
how to do those things what I know is
coding so I want to give back to the
people by showing them how to code in
and be able to you know learn from there
you know what I mean
and like I said we're not looking to
become millionaires like if you help
people out in the long run like I know
God is gonna throw a little blessing on
me you know what I mean so that's all
I'm doing out here
and that's what we're doing that's what
we're focusing on coding phase comm it's
gonna be an amazing experience this is
something that you know we got to look
back and you're gonna be like oh shoot I
remember when this thing was just a
YouTube channel and that's it you know
that's that's how things get done you
know I'm the type of person to have
goals I have every year have a different
goal you know and every single goal that
I've planned for myself I've done it
right and my goal right now is to make
sure that you guys and everybody that I
can help out really gets to you know get
100% of everything you know what I mean
so yeah
so let me see I'm reading everybody's
comments see what everybody's thinks see
what what is Joe using for the back end
I'm currently I'm just using nodejs
because there's such a simple site like
we're not gonna have user authentication
all the user authentication everything
is gonna be running through hey Cole is
teachable calm so no matter what its
gonna be like sorry it's gonna be like
API and connecting to an API so I'm not
really doing like a back-end it's just
more like setting up the routes and
that's it how will you be vetting the
people that we'll be teaching on here we
know how you do it BA how are you
picking this news instructors um it
depends like to be honest with you like
if I don't feel them I'm not having you
know there's a lot of people that I have
sent me messages I'm and I would love to
be part of coding fees.com
and it's like if I feel like they're
projects in the way that they teaching
it is like reading from the
documentation I don't want that my
website because people don't learn like
that um somebody was sending me like hey
they will provide me with the materials
and then I will teach it for them maybe
I will do that you know what I mean um
for stuff like machine learning you know
stuff that I don't have a lot of
experience on you know or even like this
other kid who wanted to do unity3d
I don't have that much experience with
unity3d I've done other game engines but
like I said
if the materials provided for me and I
go through it and I'm like okay I
learned it and if the way how I measure
everything
Hector is basically it's like did I
learn it you get what I'm saying like
did I learn those things because it's
like it's easy to say hello yeah this is
a great course that's a great course
great instructor he he speaks clearly
and everything is great now but if you
like fighting learning then I know a lot
of people are not gonna learn it you
know what I mean like so that's how I'm
gonna do it you know I'm bringing people
in only way is to actually if I learn in
myself right I'm gonna be putting a
random dudes hey man cuz you know how
many people you know how many people
been asking me I don't even want to put
the name but a lot of people have been
hitting me up i hey man can you promote
my course can you I'll put it on your
website or you know a couple of major
guys from you to me they're like hey can
you put it on your website in and we'll
share the revenue and isn't that I'm
right now your style doesn't go with
what I'm doing you don't seem like
you're popular and you to me because you
to me is you know you to me is you to me
like if you got there first and you
created something before everybody else
started creating it and now your course
is like 50 thousands our users then yeah
they say you're popular there but
doesn't mean that is really is gonna be
great for especially for my audience and
the the type of things that I want to do
let me see total design looks great yeah
man like I'm really happy with it why
are your let me see what am i using for
the backend I already said it's just no
J yes pretty simple
please sub cess say 100 why are you
putting it on your side up when are you
putting the new setup Oh
hopefully tomorrow you know hopefully
tomorrow let's see how it is I'm feeling
sick guys I'll be honest I got like a
headache I got my throat hurts my nose
hurts I don't know why like I feel like
like my head is like this I don't know
like how moving my head is how I feel
inside is like it's like I don't know
it's weird it feels like I'm getting
like vertical a vertical or something
like that it's like it's weird but I
feel like that I don't know maybe I need
to get some sleep
but I want to knock this out I don't
want this thing to pass you know one
state night like I want this thing to be
live as soon as possible
because it's gonna be great man let me
see glad to see a program moustache
engineer on YouTube that can I can
understand everybody else sounds like
robots compared to you real talk thank
you
yeah man that's why we're here man we
only we're here to just be regular
people you know what I mean it was like
the whole idea of this is just to come
in and say hey man if this guy knows it
this guy learned it this guy became a
developer he worked for companies how
can I do it right and why wouldn't I be
able to do it that's exactly why I
created this channel it's like you know
when people come in here a lot of times
there's a lot of time to developers out
there there's a lot of people who are
you could say they might know more than
me that you might say they might be more
successful than me or whatever you want
to put it right but a lot of people are
a-holes you get what I'm saying like a
lot of people are a holes they're
they're not there to teach or they don't
want to teach you or they don't want to
uh you know show you something there's
like a guy like let's bring this up
there's a very good coming and I'm sorry
I curse at this guy but
let me see um the you know I was bring
light to the comments and negative
comments was in a while but oh but let's
see let's show this real quick just to
show to the people because sometimes
it's got to show to the people so you
know the video of be careful with
falling in the freako camp trap is is
going a lot of high colas a lot of
promotion on YouTube right a lot of
people like it look to you know two
hundred thirty people have liked it and
seventy nine dislike okay now let's look
at the comet right so this guy called
get rekt get rekt that's how you know
he's like a gamer you know I was like
instead of focusing on making money his
life he's like a gamer he's like it was
cool to be a game everybody's like bro
like come on get your money up so he's
like you are an absolute moron the whole
point of free coke am is that you you
first learn the syntax and then go build
stuff if there are people coming to you
telling you they have been doing free
cooking for two mothers and still can't
do anything they're also morons just
like you I have a completely 220
challenges in four days and I learned a
lot their algorithm challenges were bit
basic but okay you represent this
massive people who don't know any proper
man they have no Ellen and the little
good thinking skills and then expect to
learn a program by learning syntax okay
this guy's idiot that's exactly what
freako cam is there to learn the syntax
and that's exactly what you was just
defending up here right ok so he goes
like anything expect to learn program by
learning syntax but hey you probably
know they they are morons and try to go
try to get them to fall into watching
shitty video courses that causes lots of
money I'm like bro like this is like the
type of people that you see online like
you know what I mean like this there's
people that are not there to help you
there's people that just be like hey I
got it I understood it this work for me
so you must be an idiot because it
didn't work for you it doesn't work like
that you gonna say like learning to code
from coming from a regular person
meaning just a person who wants to
become a developer you know it's just
what he was saying is like Oh any proper
math or analytical thinking like it
doesn't make sense
you know what I'm saying like if
somebody if I come in now say hey I got
two people right I got somebody who was
studying I don't know let's say biology
and got got into a decent amount of math
in it right he has gone through a lot of
different things that he could say hey I
could put one and one together it makes
sense right
you could go to freak okay and say okay
I'm gonna go freak okay try some some
syntax and I've done programming other
languages in other places yes Rico camp
will work for you if you have knowledge
of programming from other languages
yeah dummy but for somebody that has
never coded in his whole freakin life
never programmed never did anything
going to a frico camp it's a trap
because he's just following alone in 50
problems down then you tell all cool you
just weren't over the whole HTML track
all you just went through the whole CSS
track can you build this page here's a
design can you build it and they're
gonna be like you get what I'm saying
like so I was like people to understand
that it just doesn't work so what I'm
saying is there's people online that is
just complete idiots and that's all
you're gonna get you know like there's
people who are cool and there's people
who is like hey man I know how to do it
you must be done because you don't know
how to do it it's like now I don't treat
people like that because everybody
thinks different everybody it takes time
for people to learn things you can't
just expect somebody somebody to come in
and learn something that they've never
done before and they've never seen
before you're gonna say especially just
like following one thing at a time it
doesn't work like that it's like you got
to start building pages saying and
building applications so you can start
thinking like a developer that's how it
is when you're a self-taught developer
you don't know same but people don't
understand that but yeah man
is a human
what do you think about
I think Django is cool the jungle takes
a lot of stuff from Ruby on Rails but
yeah it's pretty cool
anyone uses a word space for hosting
never heard of it
I'm reading the comments do you plan on
getting help from sponsors or some kind
of brand deals I mean hopefully later on
we we could start getting net cuz I mean
currently I'll be getting like people
who are trying to get into this like
I'll put it out there like I've gotten
emails from deaf mountain of kind emails
from full-stack Academy ass guy and
emails from a whole bunch of boot camps
right because I feel like a lot of times
I've gotten hit up by every single boot
camp and they've put bread they've put
money in front of me like this like a
little carrot like a little carrot right
in front of me like hey do you want this
money all you have to do is tell people
to go to our boot camp and tell them
that they cannot learn on their own and
it's like I can't do that because then
even though the money will be good
promotion will be good the whole shebang
will be good and other youtubers doing
it maybe will make me look a little bit
more legit cuz now I got sponsors I
don't want to do it because it's like
then I'm lying to the people you gotta
say like I learned this by myself what's
the difference between you and me there
is no difference
you gotta say like I'm not smarter than
you I'm not I didn't have no programming
background and have nothing I came in
the same way as you guys did I tried
every single freaking service out there
freako camp now I'll try freako camp
later on I was already a developer when
I first went to freako camp I've done a
frico camera I've done teen treehouse
I've done Pluralsight I've done you to
me I've
what else cold school comm I've done was
the other one
Udacity have done Coursera I have done
what's the other one for Microsoft I
think as I add the X or something like
that I've done all of those right but a
lot of things is like there's some
places that they teach it just following
the documentation you don't learn like
that when you're self-taught developing
you have no background in programming
you don't learn like that me I could go
into a course like that and learn
because I already know programming right
but when you started from zero you don't
learn like that so I can't you know I
can't vouch for none of those services
or for anybody else you to me a vouch
for because it's the instructors right I
don't say you to me calm I don't just
send you hey guys go to you to me.com
is great now you're gonna find some
really shitty courses there and people
that don't even know what the hell
they're talking about
super outdated don't even know what they
doing yes but I specifically tell you
the guys that I know have legit courses
oh here's this guy max he is this guy
called steel he is this guy Steven
Grider you gotta say like like that's
how a P are sending you guys to those
guys but it's like I know what works and
I know what doesn't work you know I mean
for self to a developer for somebody who
hasn't had any background in programming
period okay so yeah let me see who's in
you in sing here
always seeing Heidi by a licensed
version today but then I see that this
gown before now
yeah man you could hit me up for
anything
Streicher dawn hi Joe Congrats
buffeting kay see ya and
- another thing - guys I'm putting this
out there I'm going to pretty much put
it out there the lifetime the lifetime
membership is not going to be available
for anymore of the discount all right
I'm actually taking that off I'm
actually taking it off because I was
doing the math and from like you know
especially with now with the type of
traffic that we are about to get it
wouldn't make sense for for me to do the
lifetime at a discounted price because
like let's say it wouldn't make sense if
somebody comes in and let's say pays
$100 on the yearly rate the same example
I don't know the exact amount but let's
say somebody pays $100 on a yearly and
then they've been here for five years
paying you know hundred dollars every
single year and then somebody comes in
and says hey I came in and I paid $150 a
freaking backing you know back in early
2018 like that doesn't sound right it
doesn't I don't think it is fair for the
people so what I'm pretty much doing is
all the discount is gonna be towards the
monthly and the yearly and for
individual courses the lifetime there's
not gonna be no no discounts on it so
for it the person that just says hey man
you know just so that there was a
discount on it
listen even if you try to put in the
discount it would have worked I woulda
just refund your money back if you want
to try to go the $150 because I'm taking
that off
he was supposed to take it off on the
weekend but since I was sick I couldn't
announce in and put it out there
properly because like I said for us to
be able to maintain this thing and it
just doesn't sound right for somebody
like you know as a as a subscriber if
I'm not subscribed without paying I'm
paying yearly a hundred dollars or
something like that right and I come in
and I somebody comes in and says hey I
got the lifestyle for $150 that sounds
crazy you get what I'm saying so it's
just not fair for those people that come
in and it's definitely not fair for
somebody who comes in and pays the $300
lifetime you know what I'm saying
so that's just me putting it out there
and land everybody knows so let me see
