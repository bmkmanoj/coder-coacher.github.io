the way I'm gonna do this you know do
better videos better promotion and you
know give out a couple of things to
subscribers you know every time that I
hit a new milestone so I was thinking of
giving our brand new laptop once I reach
you know 5,000 subscribers right so
that's what I'm gonna do that's
something new is gonna come out there so
make sure you subscribe and make sure
you like this video man because i'm
giving out you know a brand new macbook
or macbook pro no alright so that's one
thing get 20,000 subscribers to finish
my javascript tutorials right I want to
finish this this whole section just
pretty much everything that you need to
know just to be good you know as far as
a JavaScript developer front-end
developer you know what i mean so then i
have created no Jas tutorial well
basically a series using Adonis GS if
you haven't heard of this this is a
framework that it's like is brand new
you know it was really cool about them
it's like okay has a pretty cool ORM it
has authentication already built in plus
it uses es6 know yes 2015 and it has so
many features that you know it's
mind-blowing how this framework is not
as popular as it's supposed to be but
i'm pretty sure in 2017 there's one of
those frameworks that is gonna really
show
I so make sure you subscribe man all
right so I'm gonna be working on that
also too I want to create a MongoDB and
on my sequel series right so if you have
if you don't know what MongoDB is this
pretty much is a database it's like a
JavaScript database basically you know
it's no sequel pretty much all all the
websites that are bell with and express
their pretty much use MongoDB so I want
to give you guys like you know a starter
kit just to get your feet wet with my
will they be and also to my you know my
sequel everybody knows about my sequel
anybody come on if you ever use PHP of
you have a use Python if you ever use
rails if you ever use anything like
pretty much my seat was like an industry
standard so I want to create a series
about that right also I want to start
collaborating with other youtubers right
so pretty much I'm gonna hit up my boy
Eric and gonna see we're gonna come up
with something new man and you know if
you beautiful his channel man make sure
you subscribe to him man like do the
super cool and he has a couple of irelia
you know tutorials and amber and like a
whole bunch of tutorials that are
freaking super useful like trust me if
you mess with me you gotta mess with my
boy Eric do this pretty cool man alright
so I'm doing that also 2 i'm gonna do
you know 12 components in 12 days yes
i'm stealing the idea of my kisses child
you know he pretty much came up with
this idea of creating 12 apps in 12
weeks and actually that's how i actually
learned ruby-on-rails because of him so
i want to create something you know
where i'm creating 12 components in 12
days it doesn't matter if it's on in
view jsf facing react angular whatever I
decide to do with it I want to create
12 components in 12 days so I'm talking
about you know to do it to do list or I
don't know but notification Bell
something like this or you know creating
a slider creating you know something as
simple as this you know 12 components in
12 days something simple all right also
I'm gonna give it another try because
it's funny like you know a lot of people
have been hating on my video of you know
10 reason why you should not learn
Alexei reham but for some reason it's
one of the most popular videos that I
have so it means that a lot of people
actually like elixir so I'm gonna give
it another try just because I'm like hey
maybe the first time that I used it
adding you know I didn't care for it now
I'm gonna give it a try you know what I
mean so also i'm gonna stop making
videos with my laptop like I gotta I
gotta get rid of this thing you know
what I mean a half a brand new monster
ass computer pc wave you know 1080p I
was a 1080 nvidia 1080 graphics card 32
gigabytes of ram to was like two
terabytes of hard drive space a 500 gig
SSD like I have a monster computer
there's no need for me to be making
videos and you know dealing with render
time in this old ass computer like it's
not that bad like I haven't maxed out
you know I 5 16 gigabyte of ram the
decent graphics card it's not that bad
but I think it's time for me to you know
move on it take it to the next level

d um why because everybody that
I've seen that has this camera gets a
very good quality of videos and I want

game to the next level you know what I
mean so that's what I'm doing is you
