back at it again
coding fees.com your boy is backing out
and did it again alright guys for the
people that missed the first little
stream this is coding face.com and it
was basically the the whole section is
called dropping gems worth calling face
so pretty much is a Q&amp;amp;A we go back and
forth between me and the audience and we
talk about any topic that you guys want
to talk about you know I mean so yeah we
are here guys what's good with everybody
man how's life how's everything man hey
you guys is up to him
let me see who's in here make sure I
give my shoutouts make sure to show love
to the people that are actually here
because that's what we do
we definitely have a couple of people in
a chat room so let me see something live
event let's get in here let's see who's
here
yeah a couple of people
we got MIT Ramsey Jordan Adrian Jon
Benedict Canyon Smith late 3001 Lopez
once I ran gene Noah uh Nick poor
Ricardo port there des Silva straight

Brazil man straight from you know some
Paulo that's where the families from
shout out to the peoples out there let
me see what's in here yeah of course
Ramsey join it you already know your
boys out here showing love so yeah the
first topic guys that we're gonna get
into is how great Apple is okay so I
bought my MacBook a year ago and
literally had like a little black dot on
the screen for whatever reason I said
you know what I'm not gonna go to change
it because I don't want to change it I
was lazy and from that little line it
became across
a full-screen okay now this happens to
one laptop out of like a hundred
thousand laptops it's not like the norm
right I've had a whole bunch of MacBooks
over the years and never had any problem
and I usually buy them straight for
Craigslist I'm one of those guys that
just buys from Craigslist I don't even
go to the store right so this was
actually my very first time buying a
MacBook Pro and you guys seen the video
here the ones that been here since the
beginning I've seen when I went to the
store and I bought it I was excited I
opened it up I was super excited because
it's like hey man before I could never
own anything as far as like this
expensive you know I paid $2,000 for my
laptop like that's a lot of money you
never seen especially for a 13-inch I
was like that's a lot so yeah I went to
Apple and Apple is amazing they
literally looked at the screen and say
yeah this happens once in a blue moon
and you're getting a brand-new screen so
you don't have to pay for anything
you're under your one-year warranty if I
would have been I wouldn't have been
under the one-year warranty I would have
to pay $350 for the screen but because I
was under warranty completely free now
if you pay for Apple care they extend
that for like two three years even after
your warranty I don't even get out of
here I kept the hood I'll be honest with
you guys I'm not paying $300 extra which
I should buy the Apple you know Apple
cared thing but you know how it's like
when you go to gamestop man they tell
you hey man you sure you two want to put
insurance on your own your games inside
bro you ain't getting me what I found
out a charge man like I'm not I'm not
putting no father at Sheree's on a
freaking game like you could keep that
you know what I'm saying and then the
second topic is basically I was in there
an Apple store while I was waiting
basically this guy random guy just
showed up he was like man you look very
familiar
this isn't that and it was just crazy
cuz I was like okay cool
me
you know the way from Amara from YouTube
or something
and the guy goes like yeah man so you
have a coding to chat no one else like
yeah he's like oh yeah it's like you
know I watch his channel it's pretty
good you know keep doing what you're
doing is very motivational now mind you
there's like an older white guy like you
know maybe his 60s around there you know
looking nice and preppy you know with
the slags the shoes the little grandpa
sweater you know what I mean like I'm
not expecting for that dude to be
watching my channel so then on top of
that he tells me he's like yo here's a
gear I'm actually uh you know I work in
the computer science department as a
professor here yeah and I'm like wait
what like wait you you what what you
watch my channel so shout-out to him I
was just like you know it's great it
feels great because it's like man coming
from the hood coming from like from
nothing from not owning anything you
know just coming from the bottom like
literally my story is the story of
everybody who comes from the hood he'll
come from the bottom who comes from
another country who's that immigrant and
you would never think is this is not
like sudden it's like super special to
think oh yeah some guy knows me from you
know it means a lot to me because it is
like man that's a school that I drained
so even going there you know what I mean
and then to actually know that somebody
was a college professor is a university
professor somebody who's really up there
watches my channel a channel from a guy
who sells taught didn't go to school for
computer science I was like you know
people come in here my comments make fun
of me those this and that and you know
you don't know how to call you to know
this and that and it's like buddy I got
some do from you like watching my
channel you gotta go say like if he
respects me then who the hell is you you
gotta say so it felt great you know now
from here on man any questions you guys
might have go ahead at it also to guys
make sure you
you basically support the channel or
support the community with the super tax

of the things that bringing a new to the
live stream and yeah man I hope I hope
you enjoy this livestream man we just
here we hanging out we got a couple of
people in here man so go ahead and start
the questions man let's start this up
man and don't forget to support you boy
the super chance right there man that's
how we can bring it back
come on one second
hello Russell hello I'll see you later
they re TT no time for human today
follow it so for hunting and today you
can you dig I'm not gonna today you know
daughter being yeah I'm not worried that
but the army will be like people you do
pero la Morita yeah man so any question
wait so let me see what is it pero V
says what's up Joe burning question here
okay he got a bullet let me do what goes
down below saying which is Joe I'm
terrible coding slump I'm gonna terrible
terrible coding slump how do I survive a
burnout how do you survive a burnout the
only way to survive a burnout is to
build things are actually fun if you're
just like doing tutorials to do
tutorials it's like nothing right now
I'm
learn to code and I'm just building
something from a tutorial from you to me
where I'm like okay let's build a to-do
app let's build a financial application
that goes does the API call - I don't
know Nasdaq and guess the the stock you
know stack prices like if you're not
interested in that you're gonna be bored
you know what I'm saying so what you
gotta do is you gotta go take it take a
time off step away from the computer
think about ideas that you might say hey
man I might want to build an application
about this I might want to build an
application about sneakers or basketball
players a music site
I don't know commerce for freaking
puppies accessories you know saying like
like you have to actually build
something that you care about you know
you could forward to the burnout because
the burnout is really more like you're
dragging your feet you know learn this
stuff I gotta try to get a job I've got
a listen that yes you got to learn all
the things that that you need but at the
same time you gotta have fun worry you
know what I mean like practice by
building a application that you're
having fun with it right also of course
you're gonna have to do the things that
you got to drag your feet to do but at
the same time hey you gotta give
yourself something to it's not just
learning learning learning learning
without giving yourself something so say
sometime find a project that you really
want to build and then now that you're
excited about it going build it that's
the only way that I stop being like you
know my freakin break down like this
days I'm parked out and then what I do
is like I'll go find something that I've
never done and then that gets me
exciting like if me I come in and I
start doing like you know regular stuff
like oh I'm gonna do some JavaScript
stuff like that's not fun for me to be
for something fun for me will be hey
let's try to build the same application
that I didn't react it's trying to build
it with Elm which is functional
programming and it's a whole different
framework and it's now as a challenge
for me you guys are saying so now I'm
excited to build it to see if I could do
it or if like sometimes I'm in the mood
of doing something and I'm like man I
don't want to do a PHP I don't want to
do it with our JavaScript no Jes or Ruby
or rails let me challenge myself let me
do it with gold name because I'm not the
best goal and developer out there so
it's like now let me try to actually
solve the problem in the language or
framework that I've never used before
now I'm excited you get what I'm saying
so that's how I deal with it and when it
comes to other stuff like here creating
courses and this and that the only thing
that gets me motivated is when I read an
email where people come in and tell me
oh man I got a job thanks thanks to you
you know you show me love right those
are the things that make my day okay so
that's how I get away from the burnout
let me see what else what else what else
what else girls pervy says for some job
burning questions for you how do you
make a portfolio without having a design
skills assuming you know how to come a
very simple you go to dribble comm you
find designs from other different other
designers right if you go to dribble
comm B hence net I think are basically
you you're gonna find the best designers
in the world literally like the best
designers in the world are there or you
go to this website called a www.a RDS
it's like a Awards com
so you go to that website you're gonna
find the best digital agencies meaning
the best of the best
alright best developers best designers
they all post their work there so look
what they have right and they're from
there
take a couple of designs this is what I
do to this date and I learned them from
from design class I went to school for
communication design for a bachelor's
degree in City Tech so I have like the
background you know color theory user
experience so I have that right so what
I will say is you take my five six
designs and you say okay I like the
header of this one I like the color
schemes of this one I like the menu of
this one I like the body tag of this I
like the font size of this one so you
basically start picking the things that
you like and then you mix it together
every designer that's out there copies
from other people literally that's how
you create design most people don't even
create anything original like especially
now because almost everything has been
created already so what designers do is
they go into older magazines older
magazines they're going to older
websites or they find websites online
like a dribble or whatever they put all
those designs don't color theories and
my color scheme study that they find
that okay I like this ones I like this
and then they put it into a what we call
a lookbook so it's like you look at it
and you basically find your inspiration
from there so you don't have to be the
best design that you don't even have to
know about design it's just whatever you
think feels good for you and whatever
you you see that you like you literally
take that and start building your
portfolio okay or if not you can just
find a portfolio or dribble down dot-com
and just literally just build it and
just put it on your website like
nobody's suing nobody for having a
similar website then dollar you can't
copyright a website design what you
can't copyright is a you know a logo a
font a image you go trademark those
things but you can't train mark a
website like you can't do that like I
could go out and and literally take the
whole design of YouTube and create a
competitor to YouTube and our King gets
ooh
so long as the code is not the same
meaning like if my code looks exactly
like the other person like if you go to
a website and you copy you know
everything from like the CSS to the HTML
even the comments they can sue you but
if you go in there and you build it
yourself recreate it
nobody can sue you okay Ricardo portela
the silver how to get a remote junior
developer job but English could be an
issue it's hard I'll be honest it's hard
but not that hard
listen there's so many Indian workers
out there they're they could barely
speak English but they could type like
you don't have to speak it well if you
could type then give your gun so Google
is your friend Google Translate is your
friend most of the time most of your
work you're gonna be doing it through
Skype you're gonna do it to emails so if
you show that you have really good work
you could get hired at a company you
know is rare that people go in but I are
gonna be talking directly through Skype
you know what a person like people don't
really care about that if you say hey
man I'm a professional that's what I can
do I can save your money because I'm
remote this this and that and you could
basically sell yourself then you're
gonna be fine you know a lot of guys
that I know you know a lot of Indian
workers for the peano workers free game
you know guys in Columbia where else
guys in Italy like they sell their
services and they barely know English
like you don't have to be an expert but
if you know your your skills this it's
up to date and you're really good you
could get the job done that's all that
people care about I mean even Russian
guys this Russian guys down legit like
really really good developers but they
can't speak for shame so they still get
higher you gotta same
how can you tell if you're ready to be a
web developer very simple you have to be
able to build any website that I can
throw at you right in just the basics if
I say hey here's a design building yeah
I give you own assets meaning all the
images or the fonts if you know how to
build the website exactly how the design
is then you're ready to become a
developer that's it right now and to
become a front-end developer to be
honest now if you are like let's say a
guy who and this happens all the time to
like computer science majors or guys
will just graduate it like data they
don't have no idea about design they
don't know how to build anything where
HTML CSS but what they're good at is
sequel statements and they're good at
programming then you can get hired a lot
of times when you go to those companies
and they test you with a whole bunch of
algorithms and distance and that is
because they're used to having
developers who come in with a very
shitty portfolio but they come in with
from a good school right if your
portfolio's legit and people could tell
like oh man this guy's up to date this
guy knows how all the things like nobody
cares about the algorithms nobody cares
about that right so what I would say is
focus on your portfolio be able to build
a website from scratch and you gotta
know at least one framework either in
the front or in the back end you gotta
know either let's say the front end
react angular or I guess now if you
genius just to show that you know how to
do it also tool for the backend you need
to know
aisel Arabelle Express add honesty yes
what else is out there Ruby or rails or
Django right you got a show that you
know how to work with frameworks and
that's there
and they see what else what else what
else should I learn jQuery s lawyer what
should I learn jQuery or learn as much
as I can with JavaScript there's a thing
you should definitely learn jQuery if
you already know the basics of
JavaScript jump to jQuery so you can
understand how jQuery saves your time
and how productive you can become with
jQuery right
javascript is something that is gonna
take you time to master don't stay stuck
in vanilla JavaScript for like a long
time and be like oh man oh all I'm gonna
learn is vanilla JavaScript if you do
that you could be here for two or three
years in your house without making no
money
without doing nothing literally if you'd
be like oh I'm gonna master JavaScript
it's gonna take you a long time there's
so many things about JavaScript that it
just takes time you know nothing like
there's no way you're gonna be able to
learn everything within one year so what
can you do you can go in there learn the
basics jump into jQuery then jump to a
framework and then be productive and now
that you're productive you get hired and
once you get hired you learn JavaScript
that you know you go deeper into
javascript cuz you already know
JavaScript boy you go deeper into
JavaScript at the job not the other way
around like hey I'm trying to learn
JavaScript and master in my house don't
do that okay let me see what else what
else what
what else what else any other questions
guys let me know I'm here till 10:30
don't forget to show some love to little
super chat guys whatever we make we give
it back to the community half of it half
is for myself and for paying taxes and
then the other half is to give it right
back to the people here okay and I'm a
see Joe do you use the same code if the
websites Chinese Spanish or Persian or
do you have to code in another language
I mean this library's for that right for
it what what they call it
internationalization now you can look
that up pretty much is the same code
like you're not going to change
something that was in JavaScript so the
translated version like if you say for
before each you're not gonna translate
it into Persian it's gonna be for each
and then whatever string is on it like
the text that you want to print out to
the screen then that's what's gonna be
in person but it's not it's not the
other way around it's not like your code
is gonna be translated into another
language - not like if the language is
the programming language is is vary in a
certain way that's how it's gonna be
written in any language that your you're
working with um see how do you get
involved with open-source projects on
github as a beginner first of all the
best way would be to just like hey
you're using somebody's library and
you're having issues go write up a
report on or get up open an issue report
like hey this you know this application
this library is not working on my
Windows XP
whatever right whatever you're using so
you let them know like hey there's an
issue in Windows XP right from there now
now they know that okay there's an issue
there and now you get points as a
contributor now as to become a core
contributor then what you gotta do is
you gotta look at the issues that are
there there are still open and the best
way will be to find a solution to it
like let's say or even the simplest
things by fixing the grammar of a
website okay like messy let me see what
website they say the laravel website
right they have the the repo for the
laravel documentation in in github and
let's say somebody do a misspelling or
you know something right you could go in
there and fix it on your side and then
from there push your changes force the
changes and then now you will get points
as a contributor now from there now
people are seeing all this person
contributor you know 50 times on the
project now you want to fix another
thing with other projects on the core
code then now they trust you that are
okay this guy's been here for a while so
now you could push into it and if it
solves the problem whoever is actually
looking at the request the push request
then if they want to accept it they'll
septic because they'll be like okay he
created some clean code that solved the
problem
now let's accept it into the master repo
so that's how you do like contribution
to open-source well let me see
what time does your dropping gems start
on Sunday for people who don't know so
technically it starts at nine o'clock
today we had a little delay because I
don't have my my laptop here I'm
actually doing it to throw my wife's
laptop and I had to set up a couple of
things but it's supposed to start at
nine o'clock today I started I like at
9:15 from there we hand out for like a
few minutes then I restarted the
livestream here around 9:30 8:00
okay so even though it was a little bit
late we still hang out for a while and
then now we're actually doing the live
stream but next week is not gonna be
like that next week is that yeah 9
o'clock p.m. by next week I should have
my computer here my main computer
because I have this I have this Windows
computer here but you know as you can
see it not the Windows computer in the
back but that's really for editing and
whatever like I don't have a camera
that's connected to it ok the roaming is
there really a shortage in the US or do
companies lied to them more h-1b visas
for cheaper overseas worker is both ok
there is a shortage ok the shortage is
because a lot of times these developers
that come out of college or whatever
computer science majors that come out of
college and they're not prepared
know when you go to college they don't
really teach you stuff that you can use
at a job right they teach you the basics
hey here's how computers works
hexadecimals and auto BS introduction to
computer science algorithms but those
things are not practical they're not
practical to work so a lot of times
things happen like this
where hey um I'm a company is let's say
I'm like II right I have I have a new
project for Nike comm where we created
the new sneakers for I don't know for
Lil Wayne I don't know if no way so
Mikey but let's say I'm $90 we have a
project called little Wayne so the new
sneakers for little Wayne about to drop
we need the fellow first so we need
developers but there's really not that
many developers who are are free at the
moment and most of the other developers
are already hired wasn't the good
developers are already working in other
companies so a lot of times what they do
is they say okay cool let's look on
let's look on online and find like
really good developers guys who have
been here for a while either working in
Europe were working in India working in
the Philippines working in Japan China
and what they do is they bring those
guys because they need somebody who's
gonna hit the ground running which is
why I tell you guys who are here
learning on your own self-taught this
millions of jobs out there for you guys
the problem is that you gotta show you
that you're actually ready to get hired
you can't be out here in like lookin
half-ass you know I mean like I've seen
people with a clock a JavaScript clock
or on a portfolio anything do you think
me as the the head of IT for Nike comm I
see a JavaScript clock you think I'm
gonna look at you and but I owe this
person it's a serious developer that I
should hire know what they do is like
listen man let's go hire Benesh from
India from Delhi right Delhi Delhi I
really matter have a say from Delhi ray
so they bring him he has work on my 50
projects remotely right by the time he
works here he works here for maybe ten
thousand fifteen thousand dollars less
than the other developers so it's a
win-win situation
the guy's a damn good developer and at
the same time
they they basically come in and and do a
job some of them don't even know that
much English
you know this somebody was telling me
this that there's a a subsection of
Facebook developers that don't even know
no English
like they don't know no English there's
a lot of developers at Facebook that
don't know English but work at Facebook
you know there's guys that that have
like the worst the worst accidents you
could think of right and I have accent
myself but at least you can understand
it but there's people who have really
bad accents and they are working
full-time because their their skills in
in their projects are like Jay so it's
like those companies is gonna hire them
no matter what
nobody cares about how you speak it's
more about can you get the job done so
for you guys the best thing that you
guys could do is definitely make sure
that you come in and have a nice
portfolio so you can compete right
that's another thing too a lot of the
workers from overseas they don't even
have good good like projects that they
could show for a lot of times is more
like Oh like somebody who went to a
really good university in another
country but let's say a developer who
went to the MIT of India or a guy from
England who went to Oxford or a guy from
you know who went to the Philippines
collagen in the Philippines but the
college he went to in the Philippines is
really like the Harvard of Philippines
you know what I say like a lot of times
those guys come in and get hired because
they have that that background that
sounded background but they don't even
have the portfolio's to really show for
it so you with a great portfolio you can
literally outshine a lot of people even
if they come from better schools than
you because the first person the first
person that sees your your work is a HR
person
right so if you could impress the HR
person now you're good that person goes
in and passes it down to the technical
recruiter who could now see it and be
like oh he got a great portfolio he
could do the job he looked like he's
ready to work we need somebody that's he
in the US as soon as possible
hey he lives 20 minutes away from here
hire him
instead of that other person who works
in I don't know in Manila who we're
gonna have to deal with h-1b visas we're
gonna have to you know pay for it so fly
paid for his living expenses like you
know what I mean like you have better
opportunities than most of those guys so
take advantage I see a lot of people who
be like man they complain like oh man
there's a lot of guys were h-1b visas
guys those guys are here working a lot
of times those guys are are great
developers where it you know you can't
be mad at the fact that hey they dad
good that they have to bring him from
another country all right let me see
Ashley can T thank you for the super
chat I really appreciate it definitely
one of the supporters of the channel
like I said everything that comes in 50%
is literally like 40% I keep 40% I give
to everybody and other 20% I just put it
for it for the taxes cuz if you guys
don't know whatever you guys give me
gets taxed so at the end of the year I
got a ping on those taxes so yeah man I
really appreciate it so she says
definitely would like to break more
bread and give back once I land the
first job keep up the great content Joe
Thank You Ashley I really appreciate it
I'm here for you guys I'm here to just
you know show you guys love support you
guys give you guys my knowledge I want
to make sure that you guys don't make
the same mistakes that I did
there wasn't nobody like me out here
when I first started this and I made a
lot of mistakes everything that I tell
you guys is from my mistakes I'm 30
years old where I'm at right now I
should have been here by 22 23 years old
all right
the level that I'm a dancer
in this law so be you know I started at
24 I started to learn to go like
seriously at 24 I got hired by like 24
25 till now right so everything that I
did and everything that I've learned
over the years where I'm at right now it
has taken me some time
but if I had somebody like myself who
was here YouTube in it explaining how
things are really are and giving me
really good advice and just real advice
like I'm not an expert I'm not a guy
who's out here trying to sell your dream
I don't come in here that tells you guys
hey guys you're gonna become a developer
in a week no I'd be honest with you guys
I don't you be like hey we have 99%
success rate no that's not the reality
of things I have even on my website I
probably say we have like a good 30
percent success rate in the reason why
is that is because most people come in
they want to learn how to code they do
it for two three weeks they quit but
everybody who goes in and does their
work gets hired and everybody who
listens to me here on YouTube gets hired
this happens all the time people send me
emails hey man I just got hired I'm here
thanks to you it happens all the time
not the problem is just like everything
in life if you go into a gym you signed
up for the gym you didn't work out hey
you're still fat it's like me I signed
up for the gym I'm still fat right now
you're gonna say I got lost like a few
pounds I haven't gone to the gym in like
two weeks you know everything so that's
on me so it's the same thing that I tell
you guys coding is like going to the gym
it's like if you don't you go sign up to
something you could subscribe to
somebody subscribe to a channel but if
you don't work out yourself there's no
way that you're gonna become a developer
in this thing right and everything that
I tell you guys is from my mistakes it's
not me like I'm the most expert the most
knowledgeable guy is like nice like I'm
teaching people from mistakes from
mistakes that I did you know I tell
people hey
learn everything about Java Skerritt
they in the first year take your time
because that's what I try to do I try to
go in there and try to learn everything
one year and I didn't get hired until
almost the end of the year of me
starting to code I could have been like
just like every other youtuber that's
out there that be like oh yeah I got
hired in two months I don't have that
story
I took the lonely road I say man I will
not become a developer hello Nicole I'm
gonna be with a big boys that you know I
want to be able to say I'm a JavaScript
master out here you know back then
people who call themselves are my
JavaScript Rockstar imma you know CSS
Rockstar like people put down there on
the frickin resume and yeah so that was
like my mistake I'll teach you guys from
my mistake I'm like man man you don't
need that you don't need to become a
mess I've seen guys who know way less
than a lot of you guys and they're hired
they work in our companies and then
they're asking me like um how do I pull
help like poop from github missing
how are you happier here how are you
making $80,000 and you don't know this
huh
the wood was react you just came from
college I would hurt you higher here and
don't even know what react is you got on
sailing so it's like a lot of you guys
are more events that people who are
working in the industry and that's being
honest so yeah man thank you for the
love thank you for for the donation you
know everything that comes in he's not
gonna donation everything that you put
into the the super chat guys
I literally bring it right back to you
guys you know so anyways man oh let me
see yeah of course you get tax some tips
man not even that like on the super
chair I think from every super chat I
think YouTube takes like 40 percent or
missus super chat cut no super tech cut
YouTube will tell you exactly how
okay so YouTube takes 30% from each each
super check so that's how it works
exactly 30 percent okay so let me see
yeah so they take the take 30% man okay
so let me see what other questions you
guys might have what's your take on
front end versus back in the further is
easier to get into or maybe nah nah
nowadays it could be a little bit harder
it happens to be like there's a lot of
stuff you've got to jump into the front
end not only do you need to know HTML
CSS JavaScript you need to know a
framework you need to know how to work
with you know production tools like web
pack gulp like there's a lot of stuff
that you gotta learn or at least know
the basics okay to really start working
as a back-end developer all you really
got to know is like a couple of
algorithms to understand how to make
things faster and how to deal with like
you know sequel statements and to know
which way is actually better which which
way is more optimized what else knowing
a framework like laravel or Ruby on
Rails and just know how the web works
you know how to do REST API how to work
with databases like Mongo databases like
my sequel so yeah
this last one else what else what else
I'm reading already hold on
reading reading reading reading comments
trying to find a good good question
before you know cycle answer it okay go
Tar Heels what the hell we talking god
yeah I appreciate that
yes man shouting two more people from
Brazil man I love to boondock you know
what I mean like
listen man for those of you guys don't
know I got a loan for selling an Emmy
you know your boys out here you know I'm
Dominican
but we got a little for sitting in a
family you know what what else
question one move from JavaScript
console react in OGS the moment that you
know how to build I mean I even built
but just know how to use JavaScript
variable functions loops if statement
else statements now from there if you
know the the Dom right how to change
things in the Dom you know how to say
hey there's a element you know get
element by ID you know get the element
by the by the class freaking normal
stuff to the simple things right change
a class inside of an element you know
things like that right once you know how
to do that with another JavaScript there
from there you can jump into our Ajax in
Ajax you can do it with whatever you
like some people like to do it jQuery
some people like to use Axios so we
would like to use the fetch API that's
new people like to do whatever they want
right but once you understand how to do
a post request a get request to an API
then you're good you're ready to start
jumping into react oh and before you
even jump to react
you got a really understand objects how
objects are are made and and basically
how how to keep track of things okay so
nothing in there from a jump to react
and then after react you got to learn
how to work with a state management
library like redux or I think of UX of
UX they have something like that or mo
backs my for what else
vice for someone working in industry
like e-commerce already and wanting to
move into development within the same
company in the pants man sometimes the
best thing to do is really to jump to
another company they I always tell
people this because sometimes you're
like let's say for example let's say for
example don't know your situation let's
say you come in you work at a company
you work at you work at Amazon or let's
say FedEx Ryan sa FedEx for example you
work a FedEx and you will set truck
driver for FedEx let's say so now you're
a truck driver for FedEx right now
you're studying how to code you get to
learn how to code you're a really good
developer and now you apply to work
athletics on the main offices as a
developer right a lot of times you won't
get hired because people will still look
at you as if you are a truck driver they
don't look at you a speed developer you
know the best thing to do is to apply to
another company
maybe the competitor a lot of times is
even better to hire to get hired by the
competitor because they will pay you
more money because you coming in with
more knowledge of how they do it over
there are FedEx if you co apply to UPS
you apply to UPS cuz UPS will look at
you at all this guy's a developer he
knows stuff in or out so the company you
could be an asset you get what I'm
saying so that's my advice
I've worked in an e-commerce website you
know ecommerce company and a lot of
times I've noticed that the people that
work in other fields like I said you're
marketing you're a developer a not
developer you're like a guy that works
in in the warehouse or you got your guy
that works at customer service for you
to jump into the developer positioning
of the IT team they don't look at you
the same way for them you're still that
same worker so because they're gonna
look at you like that the best thing
that you can do is just apply somewhere
else and leave the company
that's it that's just being honest girls
goblin says I want to jump into PHP I'm
over JavaScript it's always like that
man you get you get tired things
Frankie fortune 30 percent yes sir they
take 30 percent man 30 percent of
anything that basically gets donated so
for every $10 so like I say for the $20
that this girl gave us six dollars goes
to to YouTube there were like six
dollars around there goes to YouTube and
day and then the rest goes to me and
then from there I basically split it up
I take 20% of whatever is left you know
put it for the taxes and then half of
the rest is for me and half of the rest
is for you guys to be able to give you
guys free stuff and free access to
either the website or just even maintain
in the website or even you know giving
out you guys like free shirts and a
couple of people nine people got nine
people got their free shirts and you
know some some stickers out soon
hopefully at the end of the month
depending if they gave me the super chat
from the you know the twenty thousand
subscriber livestream I'm gonna take
that and give all the shirts to all of
the guys that I said that we're gonna
get like Ramsay Jordan is one of them I
think it skeleton is another one no I
think Burke and Taylor is one of them
some few people let me see what else
Jeremy garner Joe I didn't know your
channel existed before I put the course
on udemy
what do you think Oh steals web
development okay I think it's a great
starter it's a great place to to start
with and know the basics there's like
that's like the basics of the basics you
know what I'm saying I guess really good
for that and it's only ten bucks it's
like 10 11 bucks on on udemy okay so
let's say for somebody who don't even
know that they want to become developers
like I had somebody who who signed up
for my website and send me this long
email so he sent me a long email he's
like oh can I please get refund it for
my money because I signed up for the
website and I kind of I stopped using
you know I stopped learning to code you
know a few days after because I realized
that it was harder than what I thought
and I'm like wait what so then I guess
he had left it for like three months
without ever using it hey yo can I get
refunded for all three months and I'm
like bro you're buggin you gotta say
like if you're one of those people that
they don't even know if they want to
learn to code the best thing is stuff
like that like cold steel's
what developer bootcamp because it's
like you spent $10 is that's like what
McDonald's money you gotta say so you
you go in there for McDonald's and you
realize if you want to learn to code or
not you know the good thing about my
website is literally like you build
things that you will build at your job
you know it's not like simple things
like what cold steel did or his course
is like so basic like nobody does that
the website I mean nobody's gonna tell
you hey man could you build us a little
camp like nobody's gonna tell you that
you're gonna say like that's a project
that is meaningless like you you can't
you could add it to your portfolio but
it's like like nobody's no one's gonna
give you props because you have the one
developer boot camps
freakin camp but it's a great way to
start thinking if you want to become a
developer you gotta say now if you want
to learn real projects you come to my
website and or if not you could just
build your own real projects like if you
know how to code and you're like oh man
and you got the motivation then build
your own projects man you know I also
have on my website the timeline so the
timeline is pretty much like a full
timeline of all the things that you
gonna need to become a developer and
like how long it really takes you to
finish it and you can actually calculate
how long it's gonna take you to learn
all these things let me see
panda buddy says was all of your
experience from udemy courses itself no
most of my experience has come from you
to me like the things that have gotten
me to the next level as a developer
having from you to me that's for sure
you know like learning react was from
you to me what else cuz I knew react
like the basics but I didn't know react
react until um I started doing like a
lot of you to me courses on or react
right and that just helped me level up
on my feet great because I was like
stuck at some point I was stuck at that
$70,000 like I couldn't pass that you
know like at first I came in got like
fifty dollars and then from there I was
like 65 then I made like 75 in the next
job and then I was stuck there I
couldn't do anything because angular
there's a lotta at the moment I knew a
lot of angular right at that time in New
York angular was like it was popular but
there were so many people doing angular
that companies were just like nah we
could get a whole bunch of angular
developers for less than what you you
know for less than what you're asking so
then I say you know what I'm gonna learn
technology that not a lot of people know
but I know that's really good so I
started learning react
and learning like more Ruby on Rails
like at the back end and laravel and
then when I started learning that that's
when your voice started going up that's
when we broke that $75,000 mark
we started getting down eighty thousand
eighty five thousand nine hundred
thousand you know $105,000 author it's
like that's why I really took it to the
next level because it's like for you to
really get the big bucks like you gotta
know those technologies the things that
are popular and the things that people
really want you to work on if all you
know is the basics you get paid a basic
ping you know a basic salary so yeah
definitely you to me was my main my main
thing but if I was to break it down like
this like I already know HTML right I
know the basics of CSS since I was like
the fort since I was 14 years old I
learned like really well CSS on team
treehouse right then after that I
couldn't I felt like I wasn't learning
JavaScript good there so then I jumped
to coach school calm
I tried cold school calm it was good I
tried our Pluralsight course I was like
it was like their work was like two
events for no reason like they
the way how they did they still do their
projects it's like they try to do it I
so technical like only like a computer
science master the type of dole could
really understand them like they don't
explain it to people like me and you you
gonna send like me and you are regular
people or just regular people who are
doing this this coding thing well
there's guys who are like you know
computer science degrees and this is not
like there's certain technical jargons
that we don't have because we don't have
that background so when you go to
Pluralsight they teach you as if you was
a computer science student and it's like
your brain doesn't work like that
because you
haven't been trained like that so all
the things that they try to teach you
call over your head is just like blah
blah blah blah blah blah plus all the
projects that they have is so boring
that you can't keep up like you can't
keep your eyes open that's how boring
they are what else I tried I did a coke
Adam E to play around like Academy was
just to play around and learn like Roby
you know what else Ruby on Rails I
really I I could say I really learned a
lot from my kissing child here on
YouTube
he had this video this series called 12
and 12 so I learned a lot from him Ruby
on Rails so I learned from a lot of
different places it's the same thing a
lot of people that is going to come to
my website or even to my YouTube then I
go I learned CSS from this person I
learned sass from this person
I learned JavaScript from the Jo I
learned how to work with react from Jo I
learned angular from traversing media I
learned whatever you know what I mean
like you always gonna have a whole bunch
of different resources you know
everybody has different things that I
feel like they teach that they're like
you know that's their thing you gotta
sing like everybody has their
specialties for me personally I think my
specialty that I could give to people is
giving them an insight of like building
projects that they won't be building at
their job you know most most of the
instructors I say 99% of instructors
online gives you the most basic things
things that you like oh yeah this is
basic and then when you go to a job you
get hired then you realize you know oh
my god I didn't know coding was this
hard I didn't know that to build a
website takes this long and it's like
yeah buddy because you've been doing
like crash courses on YouTube on like
freaking small little blocks like you
gotta say like people yeah somebody send
me a message to like tell me oh man I'm
so glad I found you because I thought
coding was so easy you know
was invariance and when I got hired I
was like oh my God thank God I did Joe's
course because if not I would have been
doing the you know I always thought that
coding websites was super easy and you
could do it in one day and I'm like bro
like go through one of my courses like
those courses like even right now I'm
doing the
nodejs course I've been working on that
on that project itself
like literally why like two three weeks
already like two weeks it's a
complicated project it's not like a
simple thing it's like we're building a
full social network right let's say the
PHP course you go in there like that's a
normal project you go to the react
project is a lowness project the learn
react with by building cracks of the
scroll it's a long-ass project it's like
literally building Craigslist it's not
like some simple little thing you know
people get I don't know it's like the
gay like icon is like we call it in
Spanish like putting a benda like put it
like a thing in front of their eyes and
like they think like oh this coding
thing is easy but that's because what
you don't see is that people who are
teaching you the most easiest thing and
then by the time you go to a job you
realize oh sure
I'm getting challenged this is hard
there's like yeah because you've only
followed the easiest that people
been teaching you but that's not how a
real job is you know like there's no way
you know when you come in and you do
like a tutorial or crash course are on
YouTube do you really think that you're
gonna get a hundred thousand dollars for
the things that you're learning on
YouTube like no like those things are
easy
those are like easy projects that they
pay in reality what you will get paid is
like forty-five thousand dollars to do
something like that when you're in a
real job you're doing complicated things
why do you think you're gonna get a
hundred thousand dollars like you're not
gonna get a hundred thousand dollars to
do easy jobs it's like it's like those
guys who I don't know who do like the
most dangerous jobs and you know like
a guy think about it like this it's like
a guy going to to fish at the beach by
his house and he's not gonna get paid
$100,000 to do that but a guy that goes
to Alaska
so go freakin get the big-ass crabs like
he's gonna get that $150,000 a year
because he's doing dangerous work he's
doing hard work no sleeve like this
difficult work it's the same thing that
you could bring into code like you're
now that I get paid well to do little
simple applications and little simple
websites you're only gonna get like 50
60 thousand dollars so for you to get
paid a lot of money it's difficult
projects things that they could be like
okay we're getting our money's worth but
you're you know even like let's say you
want to go to work our Facebook when you
go to work our Facebook you're not doing
like just regular landing pages but you
building like complicated you know
because there's like they gotta justify
the idea that they paying you that much
so for a reason you know it's not
because you just showed up with our
cooler let me get this you know yeah
Harold Ramis blindfolding yeah those
those be blindfolding dudes out here or
online and they like man look how easy
coding is look how easy it is to build
this project and it was like yeah you're
showing people like the most easiest
thing the thing that is so basic that
you wouldn't even get you know
twenty-five thirty dollars an hour to
build that right you know the things
that you see most of the time from other
instructors and people here on YouTube
is so easy that when you see a job like
that like a job description of the
things that they built here in YouTube
you see that on Elance and you see all
$12 an hour
hey we're looking for somebody for
12,000 hour to do this to do a simple
landing page like yeah simple landing
page is only gonna get you my $15 an
hour
to build complicated full full-stack
applications and like you know front in
the backend connect to this API connect
to this form api's connect to you know I
seen somebody who sent me one of my
friends seven he's like working on this
application for the new Samsung TVs
where they're basically they have all a
channel it's like a new website that's
coming up I don't think that's released
yet but it's basically they're gonna
have a whole bunch of movies and in all
school videos basically I got old school
videos it's like Nick and Knight type of
application right but they building it
on on the Samsung TVs so now he's
building the backend so I was like
you're dealing with building the backend
for this that's gonna be connecting to
TVs is like he gets paid a lot of money
it's not something super simple you go
on saying like you're not gonna see
those tutorials on YouTube like you know
what I mean like the even the the social
network website that we're building
you're not gonna see that on YouTube at
all like people let's build a social
network and the social network it has
like one feature it's like oh yeah you
can follow people and that's it now if a
client comes to you in but I hate we're
building a brand new social network and
this is a brand new startup dadada it's
like now what's the project that you
have them for my website now you could
be like yeah I actually built this
before and you could really take that
code that we build there and reuse it
for your new project I get job you gotta
say so it's like most people don't do
that here on YouTube and I think that's
that's one of the biggest problems cuz
it sells people a dream you know even
people that go to boot camps and go to
online schools and sign up for things
that they didn't even know it was that
hard that I know it was the heart is
like bro like wait what you didn't do
your research like when do you think
like people think like you're gonna get
paid a lot of money just to do like the
simple tastes nah
but still what up we got people from
Minnesota what up hey I like that man I
want to visit Minnesota one day man I've
never been in that that part of the
country I'm dying to go out there Joe
what do you think about this online
recruiting companies I triple bite I
think it's good you know I think it's
definitely good that there are more
opportunities out there you don't say so
that's cool
yeah when when you do like Android
development like it's not really that
good so you got a compile everything no
it's not that good and you see what else
what else we got in here man
now many teaches you how to deploy
actual framework with his backhand but
many teach you how to do the front and
back very separately yeah cuz the
problem is that if you build like a full
stack application from scratch from
building des you know building every
single thing in a project like it takes
a long time like look I'm doing the
social network it's been like two three
weeks I started this of course I can't
really do social network the course like
every single day so I do it probably out
of the week I do it three four days of
the week the other days I'm either doing
YouTube videos or I'm answering people's
questions and helping them how to find
the solutions and things but let's say
I've been on it for 12 days let's say
for 12 days working on application is
it's a pretty large application you know
everything from freaking user
authentication following users sending
messages working with react working with
WebSockets working with there's so many
 in that project like it's crazy
sometimes I'll be thinking to myself on
my grant I should just do the scheme's
how old is the instructors do it they
just teach you the most basic thing
teaches the same that's in the
documentation and then just get paid for
that but I feel like in the long term me
building this long projects in a real
life projects is gonna pay off even
though it takes me so long to do them
because pee
let's say people that finish my my
projects they get jobs and then they get
jobs and then they tell other people and
then its first two were like okay you
want to build real projects go to this
guy Joe right if you want to learn the
basics and this is and I and you want to
be unprepared for it you know before you
go to a job learn from everybody else if
you want to have like a solid place
that's gonna have you prepared go to
this guy Joe so long term is gonna pay
off
I mean I hope you know because like I
could be pumping out I could be pumping
out like you know a million projects I'm
willing small projects like how to do
how to use forms with you Jes you know
that people come in and they have like
the like the easiest projects you could
think of and as I think they sell that
online that I also sell it to you to me
the seller to a freaking stack
stack o is a stack flow it's like they
make their money like that they make the
money by selling you small little bites
I try to pretty much just offer
everything in one shot
yeah exactly
webapp course through a curse or let me
add the sass I'm still a bit lost with
it which one you're doing right now Time
Lord how was it trip visiting traversing
media Lindsay no I didn't go see
traversing media I was joking around I
was going to the casinos in Mohegan Sun
which I'm not going back over there man
I freaking lost money there I'm not I'm
not trying to go back with you like this
it's just not it's not good for me to be
going to this casinos man I'm pumping
too much money into that and I know
like where you could end up at and let's
say I don't want to do Lex you know try
Barry thank you man I really appreciate
it everybody who you know donates a
little super chat I really appreciate it
as you guys can see I'm out here
dropping gems man those comments on yo
learn to be a developer in two weeks you
know the thing to wear I hate to about
like a lot of people when people tell
you like oh man like you could do this
in 20 days you could do this in 30 days
as like bro it's like oh and they tell
you hey man I did it in two months I
didn't you know week and a half I became
a developer I got high early guy thing
there'd be so many people that we
bullshitting is not even funny man it's
so much like so much better to have like
a cool story like hey man I tripped over
a rock and I became a developer like it
sounds like a cool story you know and
for people they're very gullible man
like one thing that I I do like here
this channel is like tell you guys the
truth like I don't come here and tell
you a sad story like hey man you know
I'm freaking are you
to live under a rock you know for like
six months I lived on their bridge you
know I did you know I freaking I blinked
one day tripped over rocked in Tara
about developer it's like was that
really the story or is like you're just
trying to sell us a story you know is
like the you know sailing it just sounds
so much better it's like when Eli and
Nike like was the guy's name Tai Lopez
tries to sell something to people he
tells him was like hey man I used to I
used to live in a in a trailer park and
it's like did you really you know say
like people come up with the craziest
things to make themselves like feel like
oh man he came from all the way from the
bottom you know and because he came from
the bottom you know he succeeded I can
succeed is like bro it's like how about
you just tell people the truth and just
help them you know and get their money
up that's saying you don't have to I
mean you have to sell yourself but I
just wish people were just more more
honest and more realistic you know
because then it makes you feel like
right
like if a developer comes to you and you
see a youtuber and tells you man
listen I became a developer in a week
and a half and you could do it too in a
week and a half and then now the week
and a half passes by and you're in your
third week and you like man
little Johnny became a developer in a
week and a half
what am I doing wrong you gonna say well
what they don't tell you is like that's
not really what happened you know I wish
people would be more more honest you
know not for jÃ¡nos young tripped over
trip to Iraq no it's true
you know I mean like yo when I used to
be watching people right and even like
now that I don't watch other youtubers
that is in web development like now I'm
watching like other
designers a guys who like how you call
it's like they flip houses
it's kind of crazy like all the
that a lot of people that have been
coming into this what development niche
like they learn all those things from
all this other niches all right the in
what they do is like they come in like
you know it's a frequent somebody comes
and tells you a fake story they they
start with the first thing which is
catch the attention of the person tell
you my story I came from the bottom man
you know I used to live under a bridge
you know that's the first part that's a
story right then they tell you the most
amazing part which is how they became
the best seller for Shopify or whatever
and I was living under a bridge and
because I was living under bridges say I
can't live under a bridge no more you
know I'm tired of just newspapers I'm
tired if the bums asking me do you have
a needle I'm tired of the girl that's
next to me we're not even telling me hey
do you want me to do something with your
lollipop like I'll tire that so I was
tired of that and then I say you know
what thunder came down hit a rock I
tripped over a rock tah-dah I'm a
Shopify master I sell Shopify courses
now it's like how about you tell people
a real story how about you tell people
like hey man this I've been doing this
for my two years I've been failing and
failing I haven't done there's no money
and then now I finally getting some
money I could you know I could actually
show you guys how I you know I did this
right how I created this Shopify store
how about you do that instead of coming
in selling this fake story because the
thing is that there's here in America so
many people are so gullible I mean like
you go sell I go sell to people like the
fakest thing in the world and people
will eat it up if you give them too
the right story you give them the right
story where it's like man I was under
this bridge Thunder came down and you
don't even know what happened I tripped
over the rock that got hit by thunder
you know what I mean is like like people
are crazy they'll be like man this guy's
so legit

world unfortunately is like if you're
not a snake you're basically you gotta
work harder than most people you know

night now at least you you live a
happier life you know the people who are
snakes they never happy no matter how
much success comes to them you know

women like it's not it's not really the
question is not really telling me
anything cuz cloud development are you
talking about like you know cloud
servers like Heroku or are you talking
about like the jam stack are you talking
about
you know serverless several is our
applications are you talking about that
you're talking about firebase like what
exactly is the question like what
specifically you gotta be more a little
more specific so I could answer it
you know Nadia's the things I hate
garyvee now

second arable who was injured is crazy
hey I'm Ramsey I'm here at the dealer
buying my second Lambo he wants it low

yeah man signed up to my $999 a modern
mastermind course to learn how to make a
million dollars each month
listen this our this okay I forgot his
name
there's a kid who this is another person
that oh my god I cannot stand it's like
this kids like he's like 20 21
like people have put it out already like
this kid comes from money he got bumpy
and mommy you got I'm saying like you
got bumpy and mommy there and he's like
selling some like Shopify courses and
marketing courses and I'm like bro like
I can't even take you serious because
your whole process is about pumping in
money with like pumping in your products
with ads right yeah you can sell
anything if you have the money to pay
for the ads but now you're selling the
courses to people that came in I'm gonna
show you how to freaking so $15,000 a
month in in Shopify products and this
doesn't that and it's like yeah well how
about you tell people I hear you're
gonna need at least you know $7,000 in
your pocket to get started just on the
first month with ads like you know
people are freaking ridiculous you know
like that's one thing that I love about
what the family like and you know to
bring it back to the topics but like
this is the only field where you could
really change your life just from
working hard right there's very few
places where you could do that very few
places where you could say hey I just
work hard I do my job and I live good I
get to pay my bills I get to live
comfortably I get to save money for the
timing that money that's invested you
know I could build my own business
there's very few things that you can
actually do that is beneficial like that
right most of the things that
out there are schemes are things that
like get rich quick schemes like I don't
believe in none of those shits those
things is always like taking advantage
of somebody else like look at this
there's a documentary call then I forgot
the name of it but it's about herbal
life I don't know if you guys seen this
I'm gonna tell you right now so this
there's what you guys gonna watch
tonight before I leave from here normal
life
it's dogs no not stocks real life
documentary on that please it's called
betting on 0 yeah so betting on 0 right
so herbal life it has been around for
years I didn't even know this
I thought her life was like something
that was new because I started seeing
them popping up in in Queens after like
after 2008 2009 I started seeing them
popping up and I was like man this is
crazy there's a new company there
they're popping they're popping out here
cussing every hood there's like a new
Herbalife places like hey come get your
juice and this doesn't that and now
watching this documentary I find out
that this thing has been a big scheme
for years so what they do is they sell
you a dream first of all this is how
they start you off if you guys think
Herbalife I'm basically I'm gonna tell
you guys about this
so Herbalife does how they work
Herbalife they promote to you telling
you hey I want you guys to come in and
come watch this show you go to the show
you go see what what is about you start
seeing all the screens like hey my name
is Johnny and I got $100,000 from Herbal
and I lost weight and this this and that
so then they sell you that drink is that
that dream like yes in that company that
stupid stupid meme of the guy who was
like big connect you know the Filipino
guy so they do that with Herbalife I
didn't know that
that's how Herbalife starts right so
they target the in the freaking the
poorest communities meaning the
immigrants the black community the like
more some Asians but their big target is
really like the immigrants right because
you come in you save money and you're
thinking you're hanging man I wouldn't
open up a business so then somebody
comes in your best friend tells you hey
man you should you should look into
Herbalife man and what they do is they
sell you a whole bunch of boxes your own
best friend sells you a whole bunch of
boxes of Herbalife powder and this does
not powder that you could buy for in the
store right you can go to the store and
buy it for two dollars Herbalife sends
those to you sells it to you for $15
right now they give you all this product
for you to sell and then they tell you
hey sell all this products but in
reality you don't really want to sell
the products what you want to do is you
want to get other people to sign up to
Herbalife because you get paid off every
single person that signs up to Herbalife
so now everybody signs up to Herbalife
they don't even sell the powder they
come in and they freaking they sell the
they tell people the reference to Tsavo
the stupid Herbalife powder and then now
they getting that right so it's like you
keep getting people in debt you keep
getting people in debt you get a move
that in there and that and then now you
get paid from every single person that
they get in debt to sorry so you come in
you take out twenty thousand dollars to
open up your Herbalife business that
nobody shows up to
what you want to do is you want to start
signing up other people to Herbalife so
you can start making money every month
from them so it's kind of crazy so this
whole documentary breaks it down how
this company has been around since like
the 80s and they've been doing this for
years and it's pretty much a freakin
Ponzi scheme yeah so it's like a legal
Ponzi scheme a legal of a pyramid sorry
illegal pyramid that exists that is
actually being traded in stocks and it's
like really really really bad and it's
bad for like the poor communities in his
like men like you see people crying like
crying crying right
I had this money to buy a house my best
friend came told me to invest into
Herbalife and open up a Herbalife
business I opened up a Herbalife store
nobody went into the store cos there's a
million Herbalife stores nobody cares
about that yeah and do this crying
they're like you know it's like freaking
Mexican dudes who who barely cook could
survive in this world like man I
invested $10,000 there was a guy who was
in there like yo he invested like eighty
thousand dollars his whole life like his
whole life savings like literally he's
like yo this was what I was gonna leave
to Mexico to retire with right he's
bringing you're busting guys for 30 40
years and all he could say was 40 or was
$80,000 which is sad when you think
