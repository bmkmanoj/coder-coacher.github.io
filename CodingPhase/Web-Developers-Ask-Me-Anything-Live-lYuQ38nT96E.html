yeah
killing the game right now have a fine
man you know I enjoy my time with with
all my peoples man let me see get this
in there let's get this chat box working
get this in there man you know hopefully
you guys got the notification you know
sometimes people just don't get the
notifications man you know I already
have set it up I already set up the
event I was like man I'm gonna show up
at 6:30 6:30 around there you know what
I mean let me see who's in the live chat
right now it's barely anybody in here
today
you know when YouTube is not showing you
love and you're like the only one like
wait what when YouTube just don't like
you no more they don't want to show you
to nobody
oh god says Coolio - says ya Joe I found
a freelance client but they are pretty
much asking me to create a full web site
HTML CSS JavaScript and my sequel for
$477 this is my first client and was
wondering if I should take it if it's
your first client and you could actually
do the work I'll be honest
take it depends how many hours it's
gonna take you if it's gonna take you
days to to finish this you know then
fine you know you could go ahead and and
do it now if it's a project that's gonna
take you weeks I mean you got a ton of
my hey man I'm gonna give you four
hundred seventy five or whatever four
hundred seventy seven dollars worth of
development you know what I mean like
you can't go in there and do slavery for
nobody you know what I mean like you
can't just go in and be like hey I'm
gonna do like you know nine hundred
hours or some crazy number like that
right of work and then get paid four
hundred dollars because then when you
divide that you're like working for $1
an hour it's not even that you're
working for less than that right so you
know just make sure that you take care
of yourself you know what I mean like
don't I'm not gonna say hey don't work
it don't then try to work with the
client but try to see if you know if the
project is huge is a big project don't
do it because you're going to be getting
warned out all right you're gonna get
washed up before a little about a little
almost nothing amount of money like you
know what I mean so you just gotta be
careful here but I would definitely tell
people man try to guess many clients
can't you know but you know I don't know
it's a weird situation because they all
depends if it's a is something easy you
know it's gonna be easy is gonna be you
know no more than 10 20 hours that's
fine if you're looking at something
that's gonna take you to three weeks
then $400 is not worth it at all yeah
now that sounds ridiculous I mean I
don't know where you live I mean if you
lived if you lived in a third world
country then yeah that's good money for
you right cuz let's say you live in a
third world country that where you get
paid two hundred dollars per month five
hundred dollars for project it's not
that bad
alright but if you're going to be living
here in the United States and you're
getting you know something five hundred
dollars for two weeks of work then it
might not really be that good I mean
another that you could do is get your
money up front all right and tell them
hey I'm gonna try to get this done it
and you know in a week for you guys but
leave it open to like hey if this
project takes longer than what it's
supposed to then I have to get paid more
money you know that's what I would do I
would just be honest with them and be
like hey listen you know this is
something that might take me a week two
weeks if I'm doing more work than what
I'm really getting paid then at some
point I'm gonna stop and I'm gonna be
like hey I need to get paid more money
because this project is is getting
bigger than what it's supposed to be
okay Andy em sez got my first job in
what development but I'm working with
WordPress I want to actually code how
long should I stay at this job
for before jumping to a new one give
yourself three months man you've been
there how many days you know how many
days how many weeks give yourself three
months man I know sometimes it's hard we
want to be doing cool stuff but you got
to start somewhere
you know today I was actually looking at
at a a like an article from some girl I
forgot her name but she wrote about how
hard it was for her to find a job I mean
it wasn't that how hard it was for her
it was more of like how easy it was for
her to find a job in a month and a half
after graduating from a boot camp and
then she basically she went straight to
getting hired to the New York Times and
this and that and it's like I was like
thinking about doing a video about it
because now everybody is going to have
that road right now everybody's gonna go
from and you know from a boot camp or
being self-taught to working for a
really large company it's not gonna work
like that
all right and like when you look at her
stories she already had already worked
with IBM she was working in IBM all
right which is this one of those things
situations where people come in and be
like hey I went to a boot camp and I
graduated right away and you know I got
a fine I got to find a job in two
seconds and like her story is pretty
much the same thing like she before she
was even a student in the boot camp she
worked at IBM as a like project manager
and then decided to switch up to
actually learning how to code so she
went to a boot camp now when she went to
the boot camp she got to her skills that
that she needed but one thing that
people forget about it's like she
already had a pretty good degree right
and they also forget about the fact that
she was working at IBM right it's like
right now I could be like let's say a
manager at IBM I could be a freakin a
designer at IBM right if I go and apply
to another big company they're going to
give me the chance because hey you got
hired by IBM before you got hired by
Google you got hired by whatever company
you guys fill in the blank right so
that's already on your resume all right
so her story is completely different
than what everybody else here is going
to have you know what I mean like you
know I tell people's like it's a
different role for everybody
and the M is like yo I've been there
three days and I only make $12 an hour
okay I mean Andy I don't know you work
here in the US or you work in somewhere
else because that's not another factor
in so I mean if you live in the u.s. is
it's higher than that
but if you live in another country then
that's just how it is you know price is
definitely gonna be cheaper for you now
another thing that I will say to to you
is you gotta start somewhere man
this idea stop looking at the high
numbers stop looking at the high numbers
of like man
somebody is it's making 90,000 dollars
right now making $100,000 right now
sometimes like I said that's just not
your road when I started it wasn't my
road right I was making I think like how
much is how much is like when you
calculated missing thirty five thousand
a year
my first job how much is that 35,000 of
course I only stayed there three months
because I wanted more money by let's say
thirty five thousand divided by 52 673
okay divided by 40 so I was making 1682
an hour so you know what I mean so I
wasn't that far from where you at right
now
it's just a process you know it's a
process
it's definitely a process I wondering
why nobody got the notification man like
this is crazy
do you guys get any notification I don't
think nobody got any notifications that
we do in our live stream right now I
don't know why it's kind of ridiculous
let me see yeah that's what I was man
nobody got nobody got the notification
that's why I hate that about freaking
Google man like they want you to use
their their stuff man they want you to
use their stuff like because I'm not
using the Google hangout it's actually
you know the FME operator on the
livestream but like you know what we're
not gonna come in and we're not gonna
give them giving anything right now
let me see life dashboard trying to fix
this so you can see if we could get the
squad in here because I know nobody got
the notifications I don't know why at
all
but yeah man now so like I was saying
man you definitely need to just chill
man you just started there like I
understand WordPress could be annoying
inning you know could really suck but
you just gotta hang in there man it's
your first job you just got there man
you know what I mean like yeah you want
to make more money but at the same time
man number one you live in Pittsburgh
like I'm being honest
you live in Pittsburgh you're gonna make
less money than most areas all right
that's why number two you're going to
also like understand that it's your
first job right it's not the place where
you're going to live there your whole
life and work there for the rest of your
life where you gonna be like man forever
I'm gonna have to come in and do this
WordPress thing not just go in there get
your skills build your website at the
same time I don't know like how good are
you as a developer right now how long
you've been actually you know coding I
mean if you don't mind telling us how
long you've been coding you know I could
maybe help you out and give you more
advice but sometimes it's like you gotta
take what what you can write and you
gotta also just go in there and just try
to make the best out of it right think
about it like this you're working there
for 12 an hour right you can also come
in and be like hey while I'm coming to
this job I can also learn on my own time
so for the next two three months go hard
really build up a really good portfolio
and even while you're working there
start applying to other places that's
what I was doing my first three months I
was applying to other places
cuz I knew that wasn't the place where I
wanted to be yet it was the place where
I needed to start at all right like I
was telling you before like the other
girl
from from this thing from hacker noon
calm like let's look into this right
let's look into this page see you guys
could see this yeah so she says her name
is Sofia she oka all right
seems like a nice a very nice person
seems pretty legit you know she comes in
and explained all the things that she
did to find a job talk to recruiters and
all the things that she was using you
know while going to interviews and
things like that you know so it was
pretty cool it was good to find out you
know what she was actually working on
you know networking building out my
portfolio studying algorithms
you know whiteboarding you know
practicing all this stuff right now one
of the things that you know caught my
attention was when I went to her website
was I'm looking at her I heard portfolio
and from looking at her portfolio I
can't really see that she have any like
real life experience with working with
clients or working with projects as a
developer all of these projects here
seem more like small projects that you
will come up with inside of a bootcamp
or doing one of cold steel's courses you
know what I mean so then I I say you
know how can this girl get a job
a New York Times and I started looking
into it and I'm like wait hold on I
gotta do my research you know what I
mean like cuz I can't give an opinion on
it without actually looking into it so
then I'm like okay she goes like before
becoming a software developer I served
in the Peace Corp which is great I love
that right
and then it says I worked for IBM
management consulting for fortune
fortune 100 companies like this is not
just a regular person meaning like this
isn't a Johnny from Chicago this isn't
Dan from Pittsburgh like this is
somebody who was already working in
major companies and has that as their
resume all right we come into may be her
LinkedIn let's see if it's not privacy
if they let us in we come in and let's
come in here let's start looking at what
she's got
you know she already had guy work from
you know started working at IBM did the
Peace Corp disappear for six months
coding teaching the coding space for
months let's see what else
strategy consulting she's you know she's
worked before right so it's not like
somebody who who just came out of
nowhere it was like okay cool I'm gonna
now become a developer right it's like
hey here's a job for you right she has a
solid portfolio like not even started
before she has a solid resume you know
she has you know a pretty good degree
she also you know University of
Pennsylvania also has you know one you
know worked at IBM like no matter what
even though iBM is so old and outdated
when you say IBM to somebody doesn't
matter if his New York Times doesn't
matter if it's Facebook doesn't matter
if it's Google IBM it's a it's a catcher
it's one of those things there's at all
IBM it's like you know what I mean so
she's gotta find those jobs right all
she really needs is just to have the
skills all right she's going to get
hired but you know Johnny from Chicago
Johnny from Pittsburgh who doesn't have
this
who doesn't have this history is not
going to get that opportunity to get
hired all right so this one I tell you
guys like hey you might not get hired
for that big job at first all right but
you don't need it what you need to do is
pretty much come in work a job you know
even yourself you're working a wordpress
job for you know two to three months get
your skills while you're still working
there you're actually building a better
portfolio building real projects because
WordPress is easy where presents simple
things they'll have you create a plug-in
to have it create little themes or copy
a theme that's already created and then
just edit it little things like that
right you're not gonna expand your
knowledge as a developer there in that
job so the best advice that I could give
you is I take that and just start
building stuff on your own time you know
what I mean because you're not gonna get
this opportunity that Sofia CEO kaga you
know what I mean like everybody has
different different things in this world
right like you might come in and have
like a really good jumpstart and you
know even for people that go to boot
camps like for somebody like her going
to a boot camp works perfectly all right
it works perfectly because they already
have a career
they already worked in in major
companies before so because they worked
in major companies when they go to one
of those big companies as a developer
they look at their resume and they look
like oh this person actually worked you
know at this ISO and so you know
so-and-so company whatever right but you
that might be coming from hey I'm Johnny
the uber driver I'm freaking out
freaking you know Elena you know there
retail manager like you're not getting
the same opportunities because you you
have a different resume you have a
different background you get what I'm
saying so the best way for you to
actually get a really good job is just
build that portfolio man build real
projects build clients you know create
create websites for clients like you
know those websites that you're building
in WordPress in that company that you're
working on right now those could be part
of your portfolio you can now show to
people I hate we worked on on you know
on this websites on you know I did the
front-end for it I did the the backend I
connected you know all this multiple
domains to the same freaking server or
whatever etc there's so many things that
you could do with you know in the
position that you're in that you could
use later on for your portfolio you know
what I mean so and to get a way better
job like don't get discouraged and think
like oh man
I did is where I'm gonna be stuck at
like that's just the beginning man
yeah so we in here man
what source do you use for icons now I
just use font awesome that's it you know
most of the time when you work in a
company is gonna be a designer who who
builds the icons themselves which is
reading
so Andy says he's been coding for about
a year now I mean you're good man
trust me even though I seem like almost
nothing you're like man I'm only getting
you know 12 14 whatever dollars an hour
it's your first job man
like start applying you know start
applying to other places I bet you by
the end of the month you could get way
better jobs but the fact that somebody
hired you that makes you a better
candidate than somebody who hasn't ever
worked in a company period
you got what I'm saying so you actually
winning right now okay quick Maps yeah
word how long take you to understand
angular Maximilian started to confuse
the issue out of me I don't know man I
don't Maximilian he's he's a good a good
dude like but I don't know I don't you
guys have never seen me like really you
know sometimes it depends I don't know I
don't know how to explain it
sometimes people tell you about
something that make it more complicated
than what it needs to be that's why when
I create a course and I explain things
to people I explain it in regular terms
things that people are going to be able
to understand because the problem is a
lot of these guys that create courses
this they have a computer science
background they have you know they have
a more technical side you know somebody
where I come in and be like oh you know
I'm self-taught but then when you start
looking at their history and start
looking at and what they've studied
before they have a more technical
background like they might have a tech
degree it's not computer science but
they have a technical degree all right
they the way how their brain works in
the way how they learn is different then
how somebody who's self-taught learn
and you know sometimes that's what
happens but he's a good do man his
courses are good let me see what
happened so what happened so Louie's
quinones got banned from this Court
what happened man okay Ross Willis says
with these companies they weren't
reacting one of you they weren't expert
CSS JavaScript that's for a junior
developer there a lot of times people
tell you hey we want an expert but it's
just to weed out the people who are
nervous to go to the interviews man like
if you could do a job you could do the
job you know if they wanna see me a
developer that's the thing that I tell
you guys to if you start applying to
let's say $90,000 a year a hundred
thousand dollars a year
you better be expecting to know a lot
right but if you start at 60 70 $80,000
a year
it means like hey we looking for
somebody that knows how to do this but
it's you know we're not looking for the
expert we're not looking for a Google
employee like companies know that right
they're not looking for the Google
employee right they're not looking for
this guy creating the next operating
system for for Apple like they just
looking for somebody who is just a
regular developer they need an extra
hand to help out that's it you know what
I really like that's what they're really
looking for you know when they say the
expectations for junior developers are
high the problem also to comes in with
junior developers like what is a junior
developer right that's why it's very
rare that you see like even on
indeed.com when you say junior developer
right you look that up online is they
there's barely any jobs for that when
you search that title junior developer
right it's very rare that you find those
jobs because nobody wants to sit down
and train you
right as a developer when we're looking
for you out here right and somebody says
hey we have a company we have a lot of
work we need somebody to come in and
help out they don't want to have
somebody who's gonna have to go to the
training for the next three to four
months like they don't want to spend
time training you
all right so you want to come in prepare
so that's what happens you know a lot of
companies is like where we just right
now we have a lot of work we can't deal
with you know coming in and you know
investing the time to train somebody we
just don't have that time and that's
just how it is
let me see let me see
Joe why you straining for ATP man give
me that 1080p I don't know why it's not
is it streaming it's not streaming on on
a higher bitrate or something I don't
know I don't know let me see stream says
Barry 1800 where it should be fine
let me see so what else star reading
what people say man one of those guys
how that has a degree in work with a big
company now looking to get into web
development yeah exactly
so Kelvin Davis says he's one of those
guys that has a degree and worked for
big companies and now he's looking into
web development
yeah I think I think like you know for
those those people like that they have a
easier road because they already have
experience in the field right now as a
developer
as a developer but also they have
experience as working in corporate
America you know what I mean like
companies like that they're like okay oh
he's he came from you know he came from
Time Warner like you know what I mean
like even though you could have been
just a dude in the office just picking
up the phone all day sending out emails
not really doing anything technical but
because you came in from Time Warner
they look at you're different than I own
this guy he's he's actually worked in
some major companies you know what I
mean that it just it works better for
them right and I think boot camps are
good for those people that like I said
before boot camps is not for the people
that starting from zero right it's now
for Johnny the the truck driver is not
for a Danny the freaking uber driver is
not for you know a free game I don't
know sandy the the freaking the girl
that works at Macy's boot camps are not
for you right boot camps don't really
work the same for you right as it were
for somebody who who is coming in from
another career like a lot of people that
go to boot camps that I noticed that are
successful from boot camps they already
worked in major companies like it's not
like they were like oh I was like
struggling and I went to a boot camp and
now I'm good no I was like they were
good and then they went to a boot camp
and got some training put in some extra
work and then now they go to a stew the
interviews and be like hey you know give
the right smile to the right person you
know talk about those Yankees talk about
those Mets you know and next thing you
know they are hired right and then they
say in a boot camp like oh we have 95
percent of a people that come here they
get higher right away and it's like wait
was it because of your training or was
it because this person could have gotten
that job no matter what
you get what I'm saying so that's what
I'm saying man
but how Kelvin Davis said you gotta
start somewhere man if you started from
scratch it's a big difference from
people who already have careers and are
actually just switching careers like
that resume follows you all right if I
come in I'm like a high executive at
MSNBC and I'm in a high executive at a
freaking I don't know CBS and then I
decide hey I want to work for Google I'm
gonna go to a training my resume
continues to follow me
I could literally go and switch to
Google oh yeah I have a training from
this boot camp I noticed isn't that my
resume is solid enough that they're
going to say hey this person's gonna if
he's coming here he's gonna come in and
bring value to the company you know what
I mean so that's just how it is let's
say Ross Williamson says do you have to
apply for a job Joe or can you just go
freelancing yes you could go freelancing
you know but it's different man Matt
what happened what happened with Matt's
SEO Joe doing your react course loving
it man shame teachable sucks what
happened oh you're talking about the
quality of it damn that sucks I mean you
should be good I don't know why you're
not getting a higher quality quality of
the videos like let me see let's go to
coding phase comm I'm gonna go into the
react course react quick and easy to see
lay down style the filters
no I don't know I don't know what you're
talking about Matt I'm looking at the
video right now literally I could see
every letter every word everything is
pretty crispy you gotta check sometimes
you know sometimes you gotta check your
service man like I'm looking at this
even from here I could see every word
everything is pretty crisp so the
quality is good man I don't know why you
having issues right now but I'm glad
that you you liking the the chorus man
cuz you freaky I told you a while ago
man I look matte and Barbara were one of
the first people that I gave them a coat
to just go into the web site they good
automatically they're in there for free
100 lifetime like they good all right
they're good bigger for life right so I
told I'm like y'all go going there go
check it out till this day I guess this
is the first this the first time Matt is
going in there finally it has taken me
almost wild like two three months to get
Matt into the web site Matt don't go to
the website you don't do none other
tutorials now he probably gonna be like
oh I was doing the cold steel course and
it's fine man I understand you gotta
finish that tool
yeah man by a man so let me see was
girls good I'm just reading the comments
here from people and this whole
situation with Louise quinones we gotta
get your boy back back on this Court man
I don't think people should be getting
burned man for real
I don't even ban people from my my chat
room here or the comments because it's
like that's kind of why the only way I I
think I will ban somebody feels like
completely trolling like if it's like
this dude all he does is just come in
negative energy completely all the time
then I would do that but yeah
you know that's it I say man listen guys
I don't run the discord chat I don't run
it that's something that Matt and
Barbara you know they help the squad out
you know they set up the discord you
know if they got the rules in there man
that's some dumb man you know I think
people shouldn't shouldn't get banned
you know it's just like let them live
man but yeah let's see any other
questions man let me know man let me
know
let me see what I was what I was what I
was man any questions guys let me know
let me know we in here man and I say
we're just gonna leave this whole drama
thing you know is like it's always
something going on in coding phase calm
nah Joe is not the quality Kevin Davies
like yo matt has ie6 let me see what
else
I will see
you know Louise I got you man I can't do
anything man I can't bring you back
listen it sucks man it sucks getting
banned sucks especially for no reason

it's not a big deal anyways mint going
back to any questions and come on guys
throw something at me whatever you guys
want to know about yo all the people
that are actually on on my website guys
go check it out man dropping those you
know coding phase dot-com those PHP
tutorials mandala and that course is
looking pretty legit man
you know like we already got a lot of
content in there and that's a lot you
know I'm still knocking out more stuff
like I just came in here to to pretty
much hang out with you guys for a little
bit but you know somebody asks me hey
Joe should I jump directly to JavaScript
after HTML CSS and like I want to try
the PHP course but I don't know if I
should do it I would say man listen you
have two two routes right you can say
hey I took everything into HTML CSS I
could continue with JavaScript or you
can say hey I'm gonna continue with the
back end you know you could decide what
you like to do do you like to you know
create websites the front end of it or
do you want to create the back end like
you know deal more with the routing
there you know the database but yeah
it's up to you right so I will say right
now after you do future-proof JavaScript
like if you did your proof JavaScript if
you want to focus more on on you know
the front end on the JavaScript side
continue doing the the react course
during the hyper ab course doing the
restaurant app course like those are
gonna solidify your your friend skills
right if you want to do back in you got
the nodejs if you say hey I already know
JavaScript right I don't want to learn
something new another language - maybe
confuse me continue with no GS right now
if you say hey I need a job as soon as
possible I will say you know learn
future-proof JavaScript alright
learn a little bit of jQuery and jump to
PHP man you know to me that's what I
will advise you guys you know cuz then
you could just get a job and you're
actually getting paid as you learn so
you get what I'm saying it's the real
estate app back on the site now the real
estate app is there man it's inside of
the react course oops
let me see it's in here inside of the
react quick and easy you click in there
you have the introduction of react and
then from there you start getting the
real estate app it's a lot of videos
I'll tell you that each videos like 10
minutes alone that some videos are half
an hour long but it's like one two so
good seven hours of video inside of this
react quick and easy so I will say yeah
go check it out man
right now the one that I'm building I
put on hold the no J yes we got up to
writing the the post I'm gonna continue
it probably Friday I'm gonna continue it
just to finish it just to get it
completely done we're gonna do that
we're gonna also to add the projects
because there's like building your
portfolio with nodejs then I'm also
today I'm knocking out all this PHP
syntax I'm gonna create I don't know I'm
gonna create a project for PHP I don't
know which project you guys let me
which project you guys want for me to
building actual PHP where I got I got
you boy
84 in here man what up 84 was good son
it's been a minute let me see hey Matt
Owen do you complete the web developer
bootcamp course and you to me yep
84 music what I would out let's see
area P is like I like the longer videos
I listen to the mama Oh ask me hey let
me see what else James Bond's says what
would you say to someone who has a
development job that they did not they
do not like or even an internship they
don't like why would I say to someone
that well I will say hey you gotta look
for other places you know this you know
deal because it's web development
doesn't mean every single job is gonna
be good
unfortunately there's places where
you're dealing with idiots or management
you're dealing with people who don't
know what they're doing you know the one
of the worst things about you know
business itself is that you know most
people who own the business don't know
anything like they're good at one thing
like let's say an example somebody owns
a trucking company right that person
knows everything about trucks that
person knows where to sell them knows
where to get the parts for cheap but
when it comes to everything else in the
business they have no idea they don't
know anything right but then they have a
lot of ideas that they want to
push on other people's so they're gonna
say they might come up with a website or
a design or something and you're like
wait you're giving opinions or something
that you have no idea and that makes
your life miserable as a developer right
because you're like man I know what's
the right thing that we should do but
because like let's say your owner might
say hey I read on on x comm that maybe
we should use Python and you're like way
but we don't need Python here we already
have a a back-end in let's say no js'
right and they're like yes but you know
I read it online that we should go and
switch up every system in our company
now to be running with Python is like
wait what
whether you get this information like
you don't have the the background you
don't have the knowledge to really be
giving our opinions on certain things
like that that's why companies like
Google companies like Facebook like
they're really successful or even Amazon
they're really successful at basically
giving out roles so that people that you
know on whatever they're actually good
at like if you're a developer and you're
they are hired by Amazon it's because
you're a really good developer and they
trust your judgement they trust you to
come up with the best idea the guy who
is the CEO is now gonna come downstairs
to the developers about hey guys
last night I was you know taking a dump
and I decided you know what let's switch
up our whole system our whole you know
back in from one language to the other
like they don't do that but in a lot of
BS companies they do this stuff like
that like they don't do no research they
don't do any you know QA like don't test
things out big companies they have a lot
of money they have you know enough time
where they could say hey we're going to
trust this people if this person is a
designer we trust his design so we know
he's good he got hired because he's a
designer he's really good so we're gonna
trust his his skills in the design that
he comes in in smaller companies you
might go in there and then people who
have no knowledge and color theory
typography you know the whole spectrum
of design come in and give opinions on
things that they'd have no idea about
you know those things make your life
miserable as a developer so you know I
would tell somebody hey start looking
for other places that's what I will tell
them team spawns let me see which in our
no one can says I can appreciate the
hustle
so 84 says Chile now I'm here just
watching videos walk cold and that's why
that's what's up check out that PHP
codes man 84 men it's coming soon man
next week by next week the whole syntax
should be done completely and then the
week after that somewhere around there
we should be creating new projects
Kelvin Davis what up people that own
businesses no one no one thing business
yep how to make money how to save money
they are lawyer to the business and
making money even if it means paying
your crap yeah that happens to yo just
let it go Louise me like you're really
distracting the the whole chat bro
I'm being honest like people are
literally leaving and sending me
messages and other windows then I go I'm
out because this is ridiculous so I
don't want to bang you from here so just
let it go let let that thing go okay
okay if you don't like the the pay be
loyal to yourself get what you think
you're worth somewhere else don't be
afraid to jump from job to job know your
teen companies is gone for real yep stop
trying to be loyal to a company guys
like it's a company thank you stop
acting you know one of the things that I
tell people and there's like what I do
when I go to a company I'm not trying to
become friends with nobody I'm there to
do my job so I'm thinking that people
are there to take care of you or they're
gonna be your friends like it doesn't
work like that you know because at the
end of the day everybody's going to
think for themselves right if somebody's
gonna get a promotion they will bring
you down and bring your name down to
make sure that they get that promotion
if somebody comes in and tells you hey
I'm gonna make more money doing
something else they will leave and you
waiting what a big project like there is
no loyalty on it and you can
humanity because you will probably do
the same to them you know that's just
how it is you stop trying to think like
you you gotta be loyal to a company this
is not 1950s
let me see let me see
keep it up give it the of vote yep
elevated tech is like are you using OBS
for the live streaming how are you
liking it
I've been trying to set it up on my end
too but my internet speed is making a
struggle not as good it's cool I like it
I like you know if somebody comes in and
they wanted to subscribe when your
subscriber was short like a little
message they're dissing that like it's
pretty cool you know to be honest do I
think like I would really needed maybe
not because this channel is not that big
that you know like every 5 minutes we
get a new subscriber every 5 minutes we
get new likes or whatever right like we
don't get those things like we get us
sometimes let me see
it's the chat box is a chat box layout
we amen
word I think I think you're gonna become
like a back-end developer 84 cuz I feel
like you you've been doing like a lot of
back-end stuff even when I look at the
projects that you were building on your
Instagram I'm like alright I see your
boy 84 is over here grinding he's going
hard Joe will you ever go back to work
for a company I mean I don't know if I
go back to work for a company it's gonna
be a big company it's not gonna be like
anymore like working for smaller
businesses like I think I burnt that out
my system already like I'm not doing
that no more like if I'm going to work
somewhere it's gonna be like a huge
company that's the only way you know
what I mean like it has to be a huge
company it can't be like smaller
companies anymore because why I get
frustrated the most is because I'll
start seeing people like you know like
oh no I'm probably gonna make a video
about this like later on like working in
a smaller business like I've seen this
for the past two to three years like I'm
the type of person this there's the main
reason why I want to move from New York
City right because I feel like in New
York you gotta understand all the jobs
are in Mahane right I don't like going
to my hand because there's never parking
there's never you know transportation
sucks you got to bump into like 30,000
people it's super crowded I don't like
that environment right I like to be able
to have control of like what I'm doing
like well now I want to go to work I
just get to work on time do what I got
to do when I want to leave from work I
get to work I gave to my house at the
time that I want to get to my house you
get what I mean when you dinner with
public transportation you have to take
the trains you have to take the buses
you gotta take a whole bunch of stuff
that I just don't want to do so all the
major companies are actually inside of
Manhattan where you can't really take a
car it's so crowded in New York City
that you can't take a car to Manhattan
alright so unless you like one of the
big boys you know who's getting like 200
300 K cuz every single day you got to
pay $30 for parking right so it's like
you know I know
one of my friends who he pays like $700
a month for his parking spot which is
crazy when you think about it I'm like
several hundred dollars a month it's a
lot like I could rent the studio for
$700 a month okay so I'm not gonna do
that so my plan is to move to
Connecticut I want to move I wanted to
move somewhere else Austin Texas Dallas
Atlanta Arizona but now I'm just gonna
you know most likely gonna first move to
Connecticut so that's what I want to do
and then I'm looking into Priceline go
see big companies are in Connecticut if
I ever go back Missy and Connecticut
let's look it up
okay there's flex jobs but I don't care
about flex jobs so you got our Aetna
which is a health company health
insurance let me see kayak that's the
one that was saying Priceline I wouldn't
mind working for Priceline like they
have a lot of cool stuff is a pretty
legit company and they always got jobs
they're like I know all I have to do is
just go for the interview and I'll get
the job you know so that's if I decide
to go back you know but yeah those like
like really big companies those are not
like we're not talking about like little
BS websites you know like I'm not doing
that no more even if they pay me a lot
I'm just not doing it I'm working like
four major companies now before I used
to be like no I don't care about it you
know
you know after man because you know I
don't want to be working for it it's
corporate America this doesn't that but
now it's different man like god I feel
like I let go a lot of companies like
even I keep bringing it up like before
the company I was working for like I was
gonna work for title you know what I
mean like there's a big difference
between saying I work for title right
then saying hey I work for 39 dollar
glasses calm like like there's a big
difference right like people respect you
more like this more you get more money
better benefits you get you know how can
I say it's like it's a real company you
know it's not a mom-and-pop shop where
it's like people come in and give stupid
opinions about things that they don't
need to be given about everybody who's
there is a professional you don't have
to be like you know how I was used to be
over here super stressed out because I
will be the only developer there you
know with like creating a whole bunch of
stuff of
cause my other partner was the same
thing he had a lot of work there you
know and for bad decisions that the
owners day and then we had to come in
like people lied to us and told us like
oh it's gonna be an easy job this this
and that when we got there it was like
man work it was the most work I've had
to do in a long time like like in a very
long time and like constantly stressed
out and all the stuff you don't go
through that in like major companies all
right
you work at IBM you work at Priceline
you work at kayak.com you work at you
know Mercedes Benz calm you're not going
through those stresses because those
companies are already legit they're
already solidified like you're just a
little bleep right in the company
meaning like even if you was to mess up
or even if something breaks or even if
something happens it's like it's such a
small thing that it doesn't really
matter right because any moment you
could go in and fix it up and go back in
there in my last company it was a live
web site you know what I mean
like looking at the website now you know
I look at the site and I'm like man like
if I come to this Web site today
I wouldn't like I wouldn't shop from
here you know like it looks horrible it
looks like pretty pretty bad you know
what I mean
like it looks bad it looks like a really
bad web site and people would think like
man you know it's not something that I
would be proud of to be like oh I work
for this coming out so I don't even tell
you guys which company I was working for
you know because it's just it wasn't
like something I will be proud of it's
just a pretty shitty website you know
other than that because I was proud of
was this which is the try on tool right
I could literally come in like I built
this from scratch
I could come here and go like this right
take somebody's picture
be like let's see I could take
somebody's picture but a 60 click next
and then I could come here and place the
cursors on the person's eyes there from
there you will have the person's the
glasses on the person's face all right
that's it it's all done with react
that's the only thing I could say I was
proud of from there because the whole
website was a mess right so now being in
that in a company like that it was like
you feel like your energy is down you
guys saw me you guys saw me people who
saw my channel they know what the hell
was going through I was like man this is
demoralizing like I don't feel like
comfortable going in there I don't I'm
dragging myself to go to workers it's
just not a company that I was happy in
like don't work there was boring
freaking people they don't know what the
hell they were doing like I've never
been through something like that right
my whole thing turned gray of all the
stress because we had to somehow we were
rushed to build a website and launch it
in like a month and a half like 15 years
like 15 years of logic we had to build
it in like a month and a half I'm not
gonna give the details why but in 15
like 15 years we had to build all that
stuff in one month and a half and the
website still look like ish you know and
just like there was just so many bad
things I was like man I needed to get
the hell out of there as soon as
possible so do I see myself working
again in a business or anything like the
only way I'm working for businesses it
has to be a major company where every
developer there is talented you know
like I was in this other company and
things will break every single day and
it will be just me and this other K
in there handling this big company
because it is a big company it's a
pretty big company looks pretty shitty
but it's a pretty big company pretty
complex the website looks horrible right
but at the same time it's very complex
we have to do so much freaking working
every single day we'll break something
else will happen like we had freaking
people working remote that were writing
city code that I'm like man if it was up
to me I would just write it myself and
everything will work fine but it was
just too much I was like man I freaking
hate working here man you know what I
mean but that's just how it is man
that's right now I'm like I'm never
going back to like any regular web site
like me like any regular company like
the only reason I went in there was
because I had quit my job before Darwin
and then I was like you know what I'm
not going to work for like a good year
right and then a week after I had quit
my last job okay recruiter call me I was
like hey man we have a job for you that
super easy only HTML CSS and it's
literally less than 10 minutes away from
your house I was like whoa that's very
attracting the money was good too you
know it was pretty comfortable and I was
like okay cool it's ten minutes away
from work how bad can it be you know and
it's like it came back to bite me in the
ass at the end I was like yo man
I'm never going back to like one of
those BS jobs like it's just not gonna
happen
yes model companies are grateful when
you want to like come in and it's like I
went from working really shitty
companies to work in a really good
companies and then deciding to say hey I
don't mind a pay cut I'm working in a
you know smaller company because I
actually want to have certain type of
freed
like you know be able to drive to work
and this doesn't that so I took that
that that route so I actually took a pay
cut from like working bigger companies
and working with real teams to now work
in a smaller companies where you're
actually the lead of the company and
you're actually super hands-on with the
whole company right like there's a big
difference guys when you work in a big
team with you know twenty thirty
different developers there's a big
difference when you're working in a
company when it's just you and some
other guy and you're like wait what the
hell how the hell did I fall into this
trap you know what I mean so that's how
I felt am I going back to work to one of
those companies not again that's for
sure like for me to work at any company
it has to have a large team that's like
my requirement I don't even care about
the money to be honest with you guys
like my main requirement is there needs
to be a bigger team than twenty to
thirty developers in that company for me
to work there all right I'm not doing
like me being the only developer there
holding the front end holding the back
end holding you know customer service
holding freaking emails holding you know
the c-sharp because like guys I don't
know you guys could probably go back
into the history and yeah see my life
videos when I used to do the what
developer bootcamp you guys don't know
what we was going through it's like we
literally doing like six seven jobs and
then my other boy quit he's like yo I
was gonna quit I'll write like February
this year and he's like nah man just
chill it's gonna get easier this doesn't
that and then he quit he quit before me
he's just like y'all I'm out I'm out of
here right so then I'm stuck there doing
my work and then on top of that training
people and I'm like and then on top of
that got people hanging me up like oh
when is the new website coming out look
mind you there's a new website for that
company right there's a new website
that's gonna come out one of these days
I don't know when if I were to stay
there it would have probably been done
by now right
but you remember to you guys the other
kid was just learning and you know they
have you know they don't have a big team
to finish everything and most of the
people that is working there they're not
as experienced as me and the other kids
I used to work there with me so we would
have probably got it done by now but
till this day they still have that I'm
not freaking ugly disgusting design
that's on this website like this is
horrible I think this page looks bad it
just looks bad you know what I mean like
and you try to fix it and it's like now
don't don't change it because the
conversion rate is gonna go down and
it's like it looks horrible nobody's
gonna come in here and buy anything it
looks bad you know what I mean so but we
got kids like right now I make more
literally I make more than I was making
over there right now you know that's
like a big you know a few - everybody's
like man it's like I'll I'll make more
than I was doing when I was working full
time so you know what I mean so we good
yo hey yeah yeah this is me what what is
it oh yeah yeah I'm good I'm good all
right give me one second
yo yo yo guys can you yeah you guys are
hilarious man I mean look what this guy
says yeah this guy's good like yo
caddies like y'all rather buy glasses at
Walgreens in that whoops yeah you're
telling me you telling me like yo you
telling me is like it you know it's like
I got friends that never eat you work
your major companies and you know it's
like what are my boys like oh yeah I'm a
PayPal I'm a Capital One I like this
this and that and mind you these are
people that I pretty much trained like
when they have issues they hit me up
asking me questions hey Joe how do you
do this oh I'm stuck in this you know
and this problem I'm trying to figure
this out and no GS and they ask me
questions like those are my boys right
and and I would like it and then I can
what are you working at now Joe I'm like
nah don't worry about it it was like
that whole year I sort of got that whole
year if it wasn't because I like I
really loved working with the kid that
that worked with me um he was super cool
super good guy I still chill when you
know to this day you know I caught him
up check up on him see if he's good
how's life and stuff like that he's a
super good guy the only reason I stayed
in that company right but besides that
man trust me guys like those are like
one of the bad things where you know
it's good for a junior developer I think
for junior developer to go
to a company like that is good like that
because actually you can't go any worse
than that like all the bad things that
could happen to a company it happens
there right so pretty much for junior
developer is great because then they can
learn everything that they need to learn
and like nothing is gonna surprise them
after that
right but for me it's like I already
been through that stuff and it's like
going back to that I was like girl I
need to get the hell out of here this
isn't what the recruiter told me this
isn't what they freaking you know that a
you have a freakin a vacation policy
like it's kind of ridiculous man you
know it's like the last date you know
