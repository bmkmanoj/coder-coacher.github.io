saying like I'm trying to have a crib
and ER I'm trying to have a crib in the
Philippines
I'm trying to have a crib in Europe like

like to vent you don't sound like I'm
honest with it if I feel like people's
like pretty much running doing people
are doing the boom cat
you know what I mean people doing the
boot camp with with my sauce and what
I've been building out here okay cool
for the ones that act like they don't
notice it okay cool you get what I'm
saying like you know if I leave right
now from from YouTube is gonna be pretty
sad day because the originality is not
gonna be there you know dropping new
content and creating new stuff a lot of
people they're not coming up where
original stuff so okay what let's say
let's leave that at that you know I mean
like let's see what's gonna happen but
anyways guys I'm here I'm trying to get
some convo with you guys let's talk
about some some good stuff so the topic
for today is really goals right having
goals as a developer right and if you're
watching this right now I want you to
leave on a chatroom I want you to leave
what are your short-term girl on short
term goals
sorry tongue-twister short-term goals
that you have as a developer you know
that you can say hey man by the end of
this month what I really want to be able
to do is be able to just create a single
page app let's say for example if that's
your your short-term goal so I want to
know what exactly is it that you guys
want to do in the short term and what
you want to do in the long term where do
you see yourself five years from now all
right leave that on the comment leave
that on the chatroom
let me know I'm interested I want to
know well what are your goals for me
personally one of the things that I'm
most excited about is seeing with
crystal angles right like I've been
doing a lot of crystal lane coding on my
own I'm very excited where that language
is going I talk to somebody for every
close to the core team and told me hey
we're about to launch you know
Crystal version 1.0 and that's pretty
great and in the long term that might be
I might just be an expert on crystal
lang that's how how long I've been using
it so for the long term I'm like man I
really want to focus on that language I
might even if there was a company that
will tell me hey Joe we want you to come
in and work with crystal lang I will go
to work to be honest like I
love the language so much that I will
say yes I'll go in I'll go to work and
yeah well that's like I don't know if
that's like a short-term or long-term
it's one of the two because it's pretty
much something that I'm looking forward
to now aqus definitely say the long term
the very long term that I have man know
that I have as far as like let me see
the long term goals that I have as a
developer I will say I will really love
to have like my own startup right create
a service that a lot of people use
I would love to create something that
people use every day something that
would you say hey man you downloaded the
new application for XYZ app and hear
other people talking about it and me
like just being on the room with my
mouth shut
just like listening to them talk about
my my application or my software my
website that will be like a great
feeling you know that would be like one
of the best friends that we have as a
long-term goal right that's something
that I'm looking forward to so let's see
hopefully right I also have like you
know a lot of stuff that I want to take
as far as coding face.com that I want to
take to the next level which is I would
love to have you know fifty thousand a
hundred thousand subscribers to the
website you know have at least twenty
thousand kids on the website studying
every day for free and half like a at
least fifty thousand members you know
that are paying on the website that will
be
to be honest with you right cuz then at
the same time I would just give me the
income that I need to be able to help
out more people you know I was looking
at this on my taxes like last year I
spent about how much was that thing is
$2,600 $2,600 and buying udemy courses
now some of the courses were for me the
majority were for me buying courses to
other people you know you guys remember
while I was doing the the giveaways when
I was constantly putting things out
there and but I okay guys you you know
send me whatever put a number and then
we will go randomly and choose a person
and give him a freakin udemy course like
we did that a couple of times man plus
I'll be getting like a lot of people
that hit me up on emails like Joe man I
can't really pay for this at this this
and that
so then I will literally just buy it for
them and that's it right but there's
only so much that you can help rain
there's only so much that you can help
with the syrup certain income that you
have cuz you still got to pay your bills
and still take care your family and this
and that but if Cody phase con was to
get to like you know 50,000 members then
I'll be out here just like straight
giving out laptop saying straight up
giving out you know whatever people need
you know like that's one thing you're
not everybody likes to give not
everybody likes to give the majority of
people just don't like it it sometimes
people people are so crazy that be like
oh if you give something to somebody
then they didn't work for it so they
don't know how they don't know how to do
it themselves or how to gather
themselves which is kind of retarded
it's like hey why would you think that
you're gonna sound like if you help
somebody out you should feel good that
you help them out not that oh this
person that in our name because dating
Ernie
they shouldn't get something for free or
get something that they could you know
better their lives and stuff like that
but yeah man so that's definitely the
long terms that I have let me see what
else
let me see so who's in here man we got
Kevin Davis we got akamaru we got
Vanessa right we got a flat fresh meat

like that
Jenna underscore creates that's a very
good name and yeah man ajj got to change
my name to man so let me see let me see
what else what else people want to do so
ghost goblin has a long term working
with Python doing info security
something similar to being a white hat
I'll be done with my CS degree by then
nice man you'll be good five years to
have a successful small sites for extra
income I want to invest in a real estate
houses here in iron era cheap and you
can make great money renting them yes
that's something that I'm looking into
it myself I think everybody got a
diversified their income you know like
me myself I have multiple incomes I
never put my my all my eggs into one
basket okay like it's never good never
good to just put all your eggs into one
basket um you know thank God I was like
thinking about the sounds like yo man at
some point at some point I was like
thinking about selling a couple of my
websites that I have because they
generate money and I could sell them to
somebody else but now thinking about it
I was like yo you know thinking how I
was thinking last year right I say man
I'm gonna be doing this this and that
or a few tube is like y'all listening we
bout to be good that I I mean you guys
know about apocalypse like nobody makes
anything from the ads so thank God I
didn't I didn't think about that about
selling my my main websites that
generate money especially now with you
know how fickle
people are and like you know how people
are just like super fake here on YouTube
so thank God you know like we here but
at the same time as like if we wasn't
here we we could be good no matter what
thank god
but yeah man um so yeah so he's like
don't put all your eggs into one basket
at all like don't do it try to do all
the stuff even if you're a developer try
to do stuff like buying a house or
buying a condo or buying or a
multi-family home do what this guy did
was his name John summers John summons
he's bought a lot of real estate over
the years you know saying like over the
years he's had a lot of properties you
know so as a developer let's say right
now you have a good 5 to 10 years where
every year you earn above $100,000 right
let's say that right you come in you
earn more than $100,000 let's actually
put that money to work let's not say hey
we're gonna buy a crazy car let's not
say hey we gotta go in and spend my
money on clubs you know going out to
drinks going out to restaurant let's be
smart let's chill let's chill the first
three to five years
chill you got time you you can ball out
later on but for the moment I thought
the moment just like think about your
future start saving money you know and
investing to other things you know
that's what I'm doing right now like I
said I just literally just freakin pay
the money or the down payment for this
or this new condo that we're getting and
Dominican Republic is gonna be legit and
like it feels crazy because we left the
minica Republic a long time ago and then
now for me to go back and you know me
I'm renting that big boy that big boy
toy you know I mean so we touching down
in dr like
oh that Daffy season you gotta wanna say
you know I mean we're going in there big
bowl of style and then we got a crazy
condo and it's just gonna be good you
get what I'm saying so it's like is like
an achievement like going back to your
your home country with something that
you can show for and be like them this
person didn't go to America missing
opportunities there's people that live
here in the United States and never buy
anything these people that come in and
and never really do anything with
themselves and you know never invest
into anything never get to have the
opportunity to buy anything but then
people that come from other countries
they understand the struggle I
understand how important it is to invest
into yourself and invest into something
for your future they come in and they
make their money you don't seem like
they buy houses they buy businesses they
freaking open up their own business you
got are saying so I'm one of those
people man you know what I mean like I
didn't come here to just chill like I
chill I hang out but all my life I
always thought like you know if I go
back to the art I want to go back to the
are like a boss when I touch down it'll
be like dang don't Joel you know that
means I Irena don't joke that's the dawn
you get on saying like that's how I
wanna go back to I don't want to go back
to the are like oh yeah guys I'm a
Taurus like I don't even have no no land
here I can't afford anything is like I
work my whole life in in the United
States it's like come on man yeah what
I'm saying so I definitely do not want
to be one of those people so hope you
guys take that into consideration and
and be like hey man do that for yourself
even if you're born in the United States
whatever um go ahead and freakin invest
man you know soon as you get the
opportunity buy something you know even
if it's a lot I have a friend of mine
who like six years ago he bought a lot
right just a lot like I'm talking to
just the land not nothing in there
house no nothing he bought just a little
piece of land that was on this block in
New York City in Brooklyn right that
piece of land he bought it for somebody
for about $70,000 and the space on it
was so little that all you could really
fit is a car so he bought that piece of
land and say hey if one day I just want
to have a garage up you know I put my
car in the garage now somebody bought it
for him for $300,000
he spent seventy thousand I mean he'd
even spend seventy thousand because he
bought it he still had he didn't pay it
off yet right
he bought the land took along a matter
of fact took a loan paid paid off for
the land got like a little mortgage on
the little land freakin he had a day he
thought he was gonna build a garage
whatever the people that were next door
they sold their house somebody came in
and said hey we're gonna demolish this
whole house but we also want to buy that
little piece of land that's right there
so our house could be bigger he was like
I'm not selling it and then they were
like listen we'll give you $300,000 and
he said okay I'll sell it you're gonna
say so that you gotta be smart with it
and if you have opportunities out here
and you're a developer Amen why not why
wouldn't you go out of your way in and
buy something that you could say hey
that's money that I invested I kept it
there and now it's double with tripled
you know etc right so yeah man so yeah
man so
anyways man oh so was good yo
any other questions if you guys have any
questions go ahead and ask me man I'm
here
will you make a vlog of dominican
republic yes definitely I'll definitely
make a vlog when I'm in Dr now it's the
intern are gonna be good I don't know
like the engine is not good here in the
US with like cell phones so I'm pretty
sure I'm probably gonna have to record
it edit it and then from there upload it
you know upload it for you guys so you
guys could get the real HD quality you
got I'm saying
so yeah I'll definitely put it up let me
see what else let me see
see so I'm reading what people are
saying okay you know how can we get a
wordpress tutorial like for plugins or
themes I mean there's a lot of good
tutorials online your search WordPress
theme on YouTube less a lot of guys who
do that you know oh so let me see so
ricecake says how low you should I be to
a company that gives me my first job
slash opportunity I mean it depends how
low you are they to you you're gonna say
and so how low you are they to you are
do they show you they appreciate you to
to give you any bonuses they have they
given you you know like you know days
off you feel you got your benefits
everything that you need you see like
this a path for you to go up the ladder
in a company the do you see like they're
gonna be giving you you know more money
in the future you know cuz in the
beginning when you come into a company
and they give you that first opportunity
they give you that first opportunity but
in reality um they're not paying you
your full potential ain't giving you
everything that you can get they just
not doing it all right so now can't can
they give you something like that can
they give you something that you could
be excited about I don't know you go
what I'm saying that's what you gotta go
in there and figure it out yourself for
me I'll give you my examples like I said
even my previous company that I was in I
didn't feel like I was appreciated there
once I I don't feel appreciated out just
I say I like shut down I don't want to
do anything with you I don't want to
work with you what I'm gonna do anything
I wanted to get the hell out of there as
soon as possible
um because I was doing a lot of the work
and then I felt like I was never getting
any credit for it at the same time
it's like people it people give me the
most difficult work and then they will
look at me like as if I'm not doing any
work like I'm not the one doing all this
the most difficult work like they will
give me the most difficult things and
then I appreciate things that I did like
I just say you know what that's not for
me you got I'm saying but on top of that
one of the main reasons I took that job
was because it was close to my my house
and I said cool is gonna be close to my
house so I actually took a pay cut I was
earning $100,000 before I went to that
company and then I was earning less than
80 in there you get what I'm saying so
it's like in my mind I say I took the
pay cut because I was like right there
for my house it was literally six
minutes from my house I don't know if
you guys remember and I said I'm gonna
come here this this and that
so then when I got there I realized yo
this is math stressful this is more work
than I would have been doing in the city
like I was getting uh offers to go to
title you gotta say like they wanted me
to go to title so and I said no to for
this small business that wasn't an
island I was like wait what like that's
something that I definitely regret um
maybe I'll do that video about that this
week and and talk about that and you
know it's kind of crazy it's kind of
crazy it's like you sometimes you take
you do the wrong thing right everybody
you know you learn from your mistake me
but sometimes the mistakes cost you a
lot alright like for me literally I have
all of this right here
full of gray hairs just from that one
job the amount of stress that we had in
that company was ridiculous and then on
top but I wasn't making that much money
compared to how I was making in the city
so I was like yo I mean I know I wasn't
in the city so I couldn't complain but
it was a smaller company but it's like
I'm leaving way more money and then for
job that's more stressful and more work
and on top of that people do now
appreciate me as a developer so I'll say
why am I doing here
you gave us a song that's up to you and
as far as like your first company that
you go go to for me I don't know you
know when I went to my first company I
knew the work that I was doing a type of
level that I was on was way beyond what
they were trying to pay me you know like
they basically send me they say hey man
you you know you don't have a degree in
computer science you you know you you're
gonna just come in and do a couple of
you know edit some products and this
this and then it's like you know we're
gonna start you with $13 an hour
in my head I was thinking hmm this
sounds like BS I know I could get way
more than this but I need that stamp on
my resume so say hey I worked for a
company already okay and everybody else
was just giving me the runaround
okay so I said you know what I'm gonna
come here take this job that was like my
first job so I'll say i'ma go there I'm
gonna take that job in there from there
as soon as I got the next job the first
opportunity I'm leaving because dating
take they didn't take care of me they
didn't pay me what they were supposed to
pay me you know $13 an hour for somebody
that came pretty much built any type of
website that you throw at them like
that's like a slap to the face so when I
got another job I slapped them right
back now you say hey I'm not coming in
that's it never talk to them again so
that's what loyalty goes to as where
loyalty goes to four four companies you
know so it's up to you if you really
want to be like super annoying toy
company if they take care of you in what
kind of job opportunities are then
Dominican Republic I mean I know my
father knows a lot of people out there
like a lot of business owners so it
would be good for me to go out there and
like you know guess on your clients
probably I won't be making as much money
as here but it's clients that
you gonna have consistent work you know
there's a big difference when you say
hey oh I got somebody that could pay me
$100 an hour but that's a one-time
one-time deal now if you have somebody
that's paying you thirty five forty
dollars an hour fifty dollars an hour
sixty thousand our consistently for do
like little things like oh could you
change a menu could add this to the menu
could you change this number could you
make the fonts a little bit little you
know it's a little bit smaller you know
change the fonts here in there like I'll
more gladly and do that than anything
else you gotta say for like forty fifty
dollars an hour you know I did this
video where I was talking about this in
the WordPress video and I say hey man
three hundred dollars an hour per week
like that's how much I was making like
for a good four months and that was
because I was just like juggling
different clients and when you calculate
the amount of money that you made each
month you was making about three hundred
dollars an hour doing WordPress stuff
now some people don't like that some
people would be like oh I don't want to
have multiple clients multiple whatever
multiple projects me I love it because a
lot of times I find clients that all
they want is just hey could you change
this little thing here can you make the
font a little bit bigger you know it
takes me two minutes I'm charging the
full hour because it doesn't matter to
me if if it was just two minutes you
know two minutes you like when I'm
working on your project I'm working from
zero so 60 minutes okay if whatever your
task you gave me takes me 12 minutes hey
you pay for the whole hour of work it's
not my fault that you gave me a little
task you gotta pay me in my full fifty
sixty dollars an hour you get on saying
so then when you do that with multiple
clients and you have like six seven
clients and everybody per day wants you
to do this this and that
listen man that money stacks up
so India could probably do the same
thing and even at that I could probably
hire local developers from over there to
help me out with clients that I have
here and clients that I would have in BR
and then you know sky's the limit you
going on saying that was this guy this
this Indian guy who lived here in the
United States I remember we was working
we needed somebody like an extra hand of
developers to help help us out with
laravel because we had so much work that
we just needed somebody to help us out
this guy showed up and he look like he
was like the best developer like he knew
how to speak perfectly you know how to
answer every question but then when you
asked some hey can you come in he's like
now we work from well he said something
like I worked India hours and I'm like
what does that mean you live in the
United States and then I put two and two
together so he has a team in India of
developers and then he charged here full
price as if he was a developer working
on the project so he has multiple
companies that pay him to work on
different projects and then he has a
bunch of guys in India that he probably
pays the minimum wage over there and
then the rest he he keeps it to himself
and I was thinking about hey man maybe I
could do that but the only difference is
I'll give developers like real money I
wouldn't be like hey I'm gonna make I'm
charging $200 an hour and then I'm
paying two guys $10 an hour and then the
rest is profit for me like I wouldn't do
that but yeah that's what that guy was
doing in yeah there's a lot of agencies
out there digital agencies that do that
all the time and they come in and they
basically you know they they do that man
they sell your dream and they act as if
they doing the work there but reality
they got like an offshore team
cold hard

could get all the notifications it's
very important that's the best way to
support the channel best way to support
me is to literally just come through
come hang out you know let's talk about
Co let's talk about cool stuff you know
let me see what it says ricecake answer
our emails send me the email man
sometimes I have a lot of emails I gotta
go one by one
you don't know saying I can't answer you
know the one that's on top like let's
say you send me an email right now right
it wouldn't be fair for me to answer
your email right now and then I have
another 20 people that's like I know on
a waiting list you know what I'm saying
like I have to go to the one that is at
the bottom and then keep going up like
that it's just it's just fair you know
that's why I try to do I try to be fair
let me see
let me see let me see let me see
Joe how do I buy a stock check Robinhood
any tips I'm working with AWS to be
honest with you I suck with AWS like I'm
not a DevOps I'm not somebody that's
internet excuse me yeah so definitely I
wouldn't be given be able to give you
tips on that I find AWS to be like the
most boring the worst thing that could
happen to a developer it's like they're
not user friendly like it's just all
technical like it's not user friendly
like if you use something like
digitalocean it's easy if you use
something like Heroku it's easy if you
use Namecheap as easy GoDaddy is easy
you go to AWS it's like it's a lot of
stuff that you gotta go in there and I'm
just not into it every time that I've
gone in there I'm like I'd rather just
go to Elance and hire somebody like let
me worry about the code unless somebody
else who really knows about the servers
- to worry about that I know
about bitcoins before have you investing
any altcoins know I had the steam coin
was the steam coins I think I don't know
steam power I'm investing into that but
look what's happening with Bitcoin look
what's happening with everything I think
Bitcoin and all of the different
different types of of currencies
cryptocurrencies they were really gonna
go up but society is not ready for that
right the banks are not ready for that
they don't want you to win you know look
at that like Facebook started blocking
the ads Google started blacking the I
the ads it's like they don't want
cryptocurrencies to really blow up in in
part it's also at the things that people
do you know there's a lot of a-holes out
there like these guys using crypto
currency to to buy illegal things to do
illegal things there was like I think
that I've seen that they were talking
about some pornography or something like
that like child pornography or something
like that was crypto or with a
cryptocurrency or something I'm like yo
this is exactly why it's not gonna be
able to you know get to its full
potential because people are using it
for the wrong things it's like there's
bad people and everything so the media
and the people that have the power to
shut it down they hold on to those
things they say oh this is bad because
if we give them a cryptocurrency and
people are able to trade cryptocurrency
you back and forth and have that as a
money as something valuable then they
could do all this illegal things and we
can't track it so we might as well shut
it down you're gonna say so I got out of
the way quick I started buying when it
was about like I don't know like $1,800
one Bitcoin was like $89 2000 I bought
again I like 2300 so then when I went to
$19,000 I was height I was oh man
he's bout to go to 20 then people say
that they went to 20 I never saw it go
to 20 but whatever they say he went to
20 so it went to 20 then started
dropping you remember every single week
it started going down little by little
it got to $16,000 then it went down to
like 13 or almost 12,000 and I say hmm
time for me to get out if this thing
touches 16 again I'm taking all of my
money out and that's what I did I
probably invested I don't know like
maybe three four thousand dollars
between three to four thousand dollars
after the three four thousand dollars
that I got back I also made a profit of
like ten thousand dollars so it was a
good run it happened last year and
that's it I got my money I was out when
I go back to cryptocurrencies I don't
know I just don't know it's it's too
risky it's not really worth it unless I
see a situation like how was around
November December where zach is going up
so fast that I and people are excited
about it and all the news media is
talking good about it then I'll buy it
again but if I start seeing things
dropping like I feel like it's gonna
drop it's gonna continue to drop I think
like the average price for a Bitcoin
should be abolished $2,500 $3,000 the
price of $20,000 per Bitcoin that was
ridiculous I was dumb like it when
to fast malade 3000 says Wolfpack ten
toes down there's a man the Wolfpack is
here man we in here let's say tank happy
says can I get a job by 16 I'm 13 if I
bust my butt learning to code can I get
a dream my dream job as a youngster yes
he can but you got to start building
projects you got to start building
applications there's this kid who was 13
years old who got hired to Facebook and
at 13 right they I think he was born in
the United States parents were like from
Chile or something like that and he
started making an iOS app that that
basically was viral became very popular
guy you know he was making like $50,000
a day or something like that I don't
know the specifics of it but I know that
he got hired and he's the youngest
employee from Facebook he started
working at 13 years old like that's
crazy now some people might say hey that
he's a prodigy he's this and that do I
think he's a prodigy no does he have
good parents that supported him yes
you know kids when they make it you know
that big at that age is really the
parents if you have good parents that
take you to after-school programs
good parents I'll take you to to those
courses those online courses like you
know a parent could come in and you tell
hey daddy could you give me $10 so I
could buy a udemy course and he'd be
like now go do your homework
that's a parent that's not supportive
that's an ignorant parent right but if
your parent says hey go ahead son here's
the critical go buy you your course on
udemy or whatever you want to sign up
that's somebody that really supports
this kid so can you make it yes is it's
obvious that people have made it but
it's also too is it's like lottery right
you got to come up with the right the
right project you got to have something
that makes them say wow this kid is a
prodigy
if
he's doing this at 13 14 years old
without nobody really training him and
showing him the ropes what could happen
if we bring him into our company and we
nurture him here then yeah you can
definitely make it let me see what else
what else
skies ah let me see it was the chat room
we're shoutout to PR and BR man yes sir
Calvin aleut Kevin gene Magoo that's
yeah John Real Talk bro Jim they're
charged by the hour period exactly man
reading what everybody says man I'm just
going over going over things so ricecake
says yo I got paid an internship with a
digital marketing agency I only know
HTML CSS the basics okay just edit
WordPress things we buy themeforest for
the client and I plan to stay with the
company so what skills do you think I
should invest in to stay valuable for
the company learn how to make plug-ins
customize the themes I don't know
JavaScript but should I know PHP before
JavaScript when it comes to WordPress if
you're working a lot with WordPress
learn PHP you know the biggest problem
with of being a developer that's working
a WordPress and that I see the most is
that people don't know PHP they know how
to find things with word present and I
okay let me try to do it like this they
look at the documentation or they look
at a theme that was already created they
try to mimic what was there but not
understanding what really happened right
so because you don't know the language
so if you're gonna be focused on a lot
of WordPress at your company make sure
you know were pressed right and make
sure you know PHP before head so just
spend some time learning PHP it
shouldn't take you that long okay you
to be an expert at PHP just know know
the basics and know the things that you
need you know what I mean oh yeah thank
happy says that Santiago gonzÃ¡lez he
inspires me yeah this yeah you could
definitely do it man trust me
you know shout-out to ak-47 yeah man if
you're 47 here chillin with with the
people's I really appreciate it
let me see who else is in here we got
Stryker Don we got was else who else is
in here we got a couple of people man
yeah listen shout out to the real ones
man listen and just it's just hashtag
coding face just put it put it out there
man listen you know and I'm not saying
just put it out there to put it out
there but if you you get that feeling of
like wait like don't you do this isn't
this like Joe swag isn't this what Joe
does isn't like you just put hashtag
coding phase as test coding phase or
just put like just put a wolf pack man
like just put like the drip was here you
know what I mean
where is Matt he don't be here no more
listen man listen man where is Matt Matt
it's probably somewhere talking
behind my back like always listen
somebody sent me talking about Matt and
changing subject yeah any other
questions you guys have you know
definitely add it oh you know people
send me stuff constantly you know this
is the thing when you do like dirt I
never do that or nobody but it's like
Matt is known as a snake out here like
yeah unfortunately you know the kid the
kid is just like you know it's just a
snake
so somebody sent me this let me see
where is it it's hard to find I have
like a million downloads and freaking a
whole bunch of emails man it's hot so
hard to find things but I always like to
put things out there so you know people
they want to be famous so bad in the
water the one here boy to mention them
so bad and you know people that show
love and the real ones and just for any
youtuber out there be careful don't
trust nobody you know this is advice for
anybody that's out there you're gonna
say like just don't trust people you
know a lot of you now saying you guys or
somebody's watching this but you know a
lot of this subscribers are very fickle
very you know people come in here they
give your face like oh I'm I'm dis dis
and damn just a sweet little kid from
England you know I'm just a little kid
you know you know Joe help me out man
give me some pointers just isn't that
and it's like this you know and then
pretty much is like the community knows
K like you're gonna have to change your
name out here like don't you don't even
put Matt away no more like you're pretty
much a snake like so I guess this was
was happening
on the livestream and somebody
screenshot it for me is like hey Joe by
the way Matt and Casey and the rogue one
are back at it again like this dudes
they come to the channel all the time
and just give it a downfall right they
go to other chat rooms talk they
they do a whole bunch of behind
my back and it's like I just don't
understand what was the point of like
acting like you was cool with the
channel for almost a whole year and then
to constantly be talking behind my
back and then on top of that you sent me
a whole like a huge message like Joe
this it wasn't me does this and that and
you know with the whole thing of the the
chatroom we're pretty much created a
chat room where people will talk
about me but I guess this was from the
dreaded def livestream and like guys you
gotta understand people they're in the
same streams like people know you you
gotta change your name by now like use
another username use another image use
something else cuz it's like people know
you already like you're going from
channel to channel acting like you're a
fan you're going from channel to channel
to talk and like soon as anybody
mentions means or anything out there
it's like ha ha ha
coding phase it's like yeah man it's
like come on like shout out to Matt man
like one of the fakest dudes out here on
this YouTube like how fake can you be
you know what I'm saying like come on ok
but you gotta have some integrity in
this world you gotta say like you you
just you don't spend a whole year
sucking me off and then at the end of
the day you come
it's like hey man as soon as he turns
around soon as he's not watching so he's
not there it's like you talk behind
my back that's the problem
you gotta say like if it was like some
random account whatever it's like we
know you can't you gotta say thank you
how you suck me off for a whole year and
then you're like talking behind my
back or every single platform that's out
there like people is out here you know
it's like you gotta change your name you
gotta use another username like learn
how to troll learn how to be a a whole
all you get are things like you're
talking and then send me a message
like Joe I'm sorry it wasn't me
I hope that we're good and this doesn't
that and then yet again this is what you
do you get what I'm saying like once
again for the people this is what he
does hey hey like great it's like come
on man like have some integrity man but
shoutouts a Bitcoin foot for asking
about a Mac you know so there you go I'm
just saying you gonna say like you can't
be fake man like that's the problem I
just don't think I don't understand how
like how people are fake you gotta say
like I just don't understand it you know
I was like try to be
were people but then again I was like
soon as I'm not there talking
behind my back
it's like if it was somebody else okay
cool but it's like dams like come on man
like
you gotta learn how to troll you gotta
learn how to how to do online think
you gotta say where a man so anyways man
you know we're moving on from here man
and that's what I'm saying if you're
here say what up you know saying like
you're in the live stream you're the
live stream say what up
you got no saying it's like this is the
problem do this out here being ghosts
not even saying hi and I even say
nothing but they're still in the live
streams they still talking ish they
still freaking you know down voting I
wouldn't be surprised you're one of the
people that's just every single live
stream down votes it I wouldn't be
surprised like literally every single
live stream we could have the most
amazing live stream we got 28 likes
there's three people that's Phillipe
Matt and Casey you get what I'm saying
it's like now that was Matt's girlfriend
like now I'm joking man I'm joking but
that's what I'm saying I'm just like we
got a have integrity man like you gotta
saying
anyways my
any other questions man let's keep on
continuing with the show I just you know
Pete this is the thing they I have a lot
of haters and I have a lot of undercover
haters I have a lot of people I just
love me love my channel love what I do
understand what I've been doing here for
a whole year
I understand I'm the type of person that
I rant and whatever but that's what
people love they love to see just me
being honest and me being real you're
not gonna get that from anybody else
you're not gonna get that from any other
channel most of the people are either
sponsor hitting sponsors like you got
I'm saying like me I come in here and
just be 100% honest with people
but you know there's gonna be a lot of
haters it's gonna be three to four
haters you know in every stream no
matter what or hitting a count saying
this this and that but come on man well
anyways man so let's move on
shame is a year--what question there's
the new topic why do they hate me number
one um when I first came in here nobody
was like me everybody was like oh man
Joe you're cooking you together you do
to listen that uh you curse too much you
dissing that all right cool
I said all right whatever I'll take the
hit right there was no Spanish news out
here there was no uh no minority I'm
still waiting for one black dude I'm
still waiting I wanted the real Casa
Dara to be that guy I really be popping
out here just to have some more
diversity right but literally there
wasn't right I say imma be myself a
module this and that right people don't
like the fact that I give obvious I
don't even give you like the smart
answers the smart advice I give you
obvious advice right if there's more
jobs for PHP hey learn PHP if we say hey
this more jobs for angular and react hey
I'm not gonna tell you go learn view
because there's no jobs there I want you
to win I want you to get jobs right so
those are the things that people come in
and that's what the reason why they
hated hey they want to learn nodejs it's
like the same thing with math the moment
from the like he got pissed off because
I was like yo I'm not really into nodejs
and I'm not really into the whole arm
what was it the thing that everybody was
fast an hour about the internet they're
like oh oh my god you can't do this
like they gotta you know how you call
this what's the name of that thing I
forgot you know when they were talking
about the the Internet yeah I can't
even remember that's a stupid that thing
was right so he got pissed off because
of that because I say hey man I'm not
worried about if they you know they take
they take away the the freaking whatever
internet I forgot what was the name of
it somebody keep giving me the name was
was net neutrality right I was like yo I
don't care
net neutrality because you could put me
in a place where there's really no
internet anymore and all there is a
Wi-Fi there's only one single place to
get Wi-Fi I survive in that I'm still
gonna go to that place with this Wi-Fi
you gonna see like it doesn't matter
what people put in front of me like I'm
still gonna win that's my mentality so
his mind he got pissed off because I was
like I just don't care about this people
are worrying about hey they're gonna
charge you for Netflix they're gonna
charge you for this and that for every
single service and I was like I don't
care about that right so after that it's
like people hate you you get what I'm
saying
so you know what I'm saying so yeah man
so after I just people just hate you for
no reason and it's like okay cool
like get pissed off at one single thing
but yeah net neutrality yeah like hey
look at that everybody was having a fit
months ago right and I was like guys
stop worrying about this like your life
is gonna continue is the same thing when
Trump was coming out it was like oh my
god I know Trump is gonna be present
okay he could be President he's not
stopping me from getting money he's not
stopping me from being a developer he's
not stopping me from doing anything like
that
net neutrality wasn't gonna do anything
to me either you gotta say like like
people are still you know saying that
was the whole thing about the video so
yeah man
so that's all saying man we here we live
any other questions let's talk about
code man that's it we just leaving it at
that man we just leaving it at that and
listen like I said kumbaya died
yesterday this is wolf pack joke so we
just being here we just being honest and
listen for some reason people people
know that I'm a reactive things so it's
like when you get caught out here and
you're like constantly trying to BS
online it's like people are out here the
people that are hanging out around you
that people are talking to you right now
they're like yeah yeah you're right
they're gonna send me this they're gonna
send me to prove cuz I love to prove I
love everything that's concrete and say
oh this is what's happening you know
what I mean now same thing as people I'm
gonna make a video you know pretty soon
I'm not gonna do it now I'm gonna do it
a year from now I'm gonna do it a year
from now and I'ma put side by side the
things that I did the things that I do
and I don't put a couple of people side
by side do the same things that they do
that pretty much is like my swag my
sauce my style of making video stuff
everything that I've been doing here for
a while right and I'm just gonna give it
a whole year so look out for that 2019
where we gotta be like Oh remember when
I was telling you guys
people were copying me imma leave this
whole year to pass by I'm not gonna look
I know why these videos I'm not watching
nobody's watching I'm not going to know
what his thing I'm gonna give you a year
in a year we're gonna compare all the
things that people have taken from the
beginning to now it's gonna be a full a
full video whereas just gonna be
explaining how
from the beginning soon as I came into
YouTube and started doing videos here
how people copied and then from there
they kept on going with it and running
with it they say okay work for Joe and
what they don't understand is like when
you you take my ideas you take my sauce
you take the things that I do
it hurts me in my channel because now
you diluting the channels you diluting
what what I've been doing
you gotta say cuz then every time I
strive for doing things that's different
from everybody and you come in and you
take my whole sauce and you take what
I'm doing now it seems like oh we all
doing the same thing it's like nah we're
not all doing the same thing is that
I've been doing it and then now they
copy that's it so anyways moving on from
that oh yeah I don't I don't remember
the name of it's the net neutrality
thing it's like it's not such a big deal
for me I can't you know oh was the next
question guys let's move on uh purely
was a Pier Luigi Milo what keeps him
motivated what keeps me motivated
something that keeps me motivated is the
fact I mean there's different things
right I mean what keeps me motivated to
keep learning right when you're a
developer is like somebody that likes to
solve puzzles when I was young I used to
always love to have like Legos always
loves to have puzzles that I could come
in and I used to get like the 1,000
pieces type puzzles the ones that were
huge where it will take you days to
finish it those are the things that used
to make me happy when I was a little kid
as I kept on growing I was like man
school is boring math like math English
all that stuff is is boring by coding
and making websites and things like that
it's like you constantly bumping into
different problems so I used to enjoy
that so even to this day I love that I
love when I find like man the web
developer starter kit doesn't work there
problem.this we missed the comma
somewhere we missed something like
that's fun to me as far as YouTube what
keeps me motivated the fact that I see
people here like Kevin Davis I see
people here like on aa big coat because
the first person to actually support the
channel like big time seeing ak-47 he's
always here whatever video I dropped um
you know even Matt motivated me to be
coming in here before he went to the
dark side I don't know what happened to
him you know who else
there's a lot of people's like a lot of
subscribers that motivated me to keep
coming it's like I could be doing other
cool stuff right now to be honest with
you just like you guys can be doing
other stuff but the things that
motivated me is just like seeing you
guys and be like damn I wonder you know
if I do a live stream and one of the
reasons why I did so many live streams
over the year you know it's because it's
like I like the intact interactivity
like I'll be like them
I wonder what Matt's story right now
what are you up to what he working on
you know if I do a live stream we all
here we hang out we chat we talk about
different topics so it's like it's cool
if we come in here and Kelvin tells me
hey man I just got a job interview now
I'm keeping track of them like okay cool
I see Kevin doing his thing you know
it's like when cam used to be coming
around I used to do all show love to
camp I don't know what happened to him I
say he's gone like you know once those
get jobs the same thing that I said from
the beginning one students get jobs we
don't see him you know I was like and
it's cool to get jobs was like okay so
there's like you're here just for the
moment you got a saying but yeah so it's
like even bit cold when Bickle was
talking about you know the projects he
was doing I think he was telling me he
was gonna do like a website for his
barber shop or it was something like
that I can't remember but those little
things are the things that motivate me
to keep coming back you know I keep on
dropping more content and finding out
what you guys are doing you
of all the things that I do in my
channel is personal this is not like a
business this is not a thing of like oh
I'm here because of like hey I could get
sponsored by team tree house I could get
a sponsored by you to me hey I could get
that smell in bootcamp all those people
have reached out to me and I say I'm not
gonna do it because I don't want to be
in nobody's you know nobody's pocket I
don't want to be like oh I can't say
what I want to say because all on team
treehouse is gonna pull the plug you
know a lot of hitting sponsorships I
think you know Death Mountain is like
hey man I can't talk about boot camps
and how shitty they are because if I'm
in Death Mountain pocket you know so
it's like those are the things that
motivate me it's like I'm here this like
a personal thing I'm real but the same
Thomas you guys don't make me like that
you know you guys make me be this
amazing youtuber whatever you want to
call me your boy you know what I mean
you guys are the ones that make me like
that so it's like that's my motivation
going on saying so yeah let me see what
other questions you guys have let me
know
coding phase will you rate my web
application thing send it to me your big
colors like yeah what did I just started
not in man I was gonna talk about it at
the end of the stream so it's not your
fault pickle I was gonna talk about it
at the end of the stream cuz usually I
talk about things like that at the end
of the stream because not everybody gets
to be here for like you know after 1
hour 2 hours only the core members of
coding phase not comment the wolfpack
are here besides that you know
understand people gotta go do other
things gotta hang out with the family
this is net so yeah let me see so yeah I
was gonna talk about it at the end so
don't worry buddy let me see what else
do you ever build node apps ejs or
handlebars instead of foreigner
framework like react yes yes I actually
love using I actually love using high
coolest like template engines for the
the backend instead of using the the
front-end frameworks for for everything
like let's say a single page app I'd
rather do something it with the server
then doing it with the front-end because
in the front-end you gotta take care of
the state
you gotta track the state you get I mean
there's so many different things that
you gotta do when you do it straight
from the backend from the server is
completely different from the server is
like you know what's going on with the
front-end if you put all your logic in
the front-end there's usually a whole
bunch of bugs and a lot of things to
happen and it you know I rather do
things in the back end have server-side
rendering instead of doing it through
the front end like let's say if I have a
forum like things like a forum or you
have like notifications or things like
that
those things I I think are men
for the front-end frameworks like let's
say a gallery or a slider things like
that but I feel like sometimes nowadays
people just use front-end frameworks
just for no reason like you gonna say so
but anyways man
oh let me see let me see what else what
else
Oh any other any other
let me know hey man I'm glad listen I
feel like if you need a mentor holla at
me a mentor is somebody that's gonna
give you advice give you guidance you
know I feel like I am a mentor to a lot
of you guys here cuz I I answer your
emails I you know I talk to you in a
chat room I answer your questions like
that's what a mentor mentor is not
somebody that holds your hands and
teaches you how to code a mentor is
somebody who tells you hey man this is
the mistakes that I made
don't do this okay so yeah so as a
mentor I could say yeah I'm on I'm a
mentor to a lot of you guys and you know
I really appreciate that you guys trust
my judgment and it's just like I'm
coming from a world where I'm a
self-taught developer I'm just like you
guys it's not some random dude you got
what I'm saying like it's not some
random dude who was like behind the
scenes he got a computer science degree
in behind the scenes he got a major
sponsorship in behind the scenes he he
got this this and that and it's like no
it's just Joe so I'm dude I was like yo
listen he just got online one day on a
Blue Room like go watch my first video
Ryan go watch my first video man like
how awkward was that like it was like I
didn't even know if I wanted to do it is
I didn't know you know I was like this
is not a professional thing you know
even now like god I don't keep this
professional
like this is this is a one-to-one type
thing even though I have thousands and
thousands of subscribers this is a
personal channel this isn't something
that we have here and say oh yeah
whatever you know
okay does anyone have any legit so I
learned how to build WordPress plugins
from scratch I could probably find out
for you skeleton I can't remember what
was the course I I took one on udemy I'm
gonna show you right now I was pretty
legit cuz when I learned how to make
plugins with WordPress I actually
learned it I actually learned it by
following different youtubers like you
know how people you search how to build
a wordpress plugin like that's what
that's what I was doing
it's hard to find it it's hard to find
it cuz it's like now there's so many
people that do you know me courses like
before there was only a handful of
people that used to do it cuz udemy used
to be a place where people will talk
about ah you know self helping and going
in there talking about this is the food
that you gotta eat if you want to become
a vegetarian like that's what you used
to see you on on udemy and now it just
became like everything about programming
and coding cuz they know like that's
what makes the money there's so many
people trying to learn to code that in
reality they know that's their bread and
butter now but back then you could go in
there and you will find like two three
different courses and that's it now it's
like so many people Kevin low
offer a there you go that's what I'm
talking about man
don't forget about the channel don't
listen get you off or you start working
man and just show up once in a blue moon
once every two weeks man that's why we
do the live streams on Tuesdays and
Thursdays man
are you still uploading content for
today of course we got a web developer
or portfolio that we are reviewing so
yes que sube of course we got a new
content dropping today linux prodigy

dig deep you know I'm trying to do a you
know I'm trying to do something some
crazy stuff you know so somebody just
popped yeah yeah me yeah I would you
know think
what about what I went up what about the
guy how's life man
good good I I work on this week is my
fourth week in my internship so that's
pretty cool
dope okay I told stack look so we gonna
start it like this first of all we gonna
we know your name is Victor where
exactly you from like what state was
city I'm from Puerto Rico but I live in
Orlando Florida a Porto Rico that's
what's that yeah that's what's up yeah
it's probably house the scene over there
in Orlando so far it's cool I got a UCF
some bunch of college stuff to do okay
cool so you telling me you got an
internship now yeah I started teaching
myself in you to me and then like one
week I went on Google just to see what
the job market was out like and I saw
this like internship like position where
like I read through their thing and
mostly they were like looking for the
individual there I'm really looking for
like good knowledge so I was like they
were like I'll write a cover letter and
tell us about yourself and I was like I
can do that so like I did it and then I
went on the interview they offered me an
interview like a three hours after it's
been my cover letter and I was like well
I'll go see what it's like see what they
asked me and I'm not really expecting to
get it but I leave the interview we get
like a good opportunity and I went in
like two weeks later they were like yeah
you're right I was like oh I mean people
you hear that you know sometimes
sometimes people think like man is so
hard to get in the industry get that
first opportunity is like bro
that's because you never even try you
never even send that email you never
even gave his chance to even go out
there and say hey man I want to become a
developer right so if you don't take the
first step it's like nobody can hold
your hand and bring you into the
industry you know what I'm saying it's
like even like back in the days when
people will tell you hey man you know
there's no jobs out here it's like when
was the last time you applied you get
what I'm saying so I say you know I want
to point out I didn't lie on my resume
or anything I didn't say I was a pro
when I'm not
I told him like I think the end they
told me like up to after like two weeks
they told me what held me was that I
went on the interview I didn't lie to
them and I was like hey listen I'm very
passionate about this and I like brought
out like my notebook on like all the
notes I've been writing down for my
courses and I'd love to know where I was
at and they were like what really what
we liked about you was the potential we
saw in you because we see that your act
actually like working towards us so I
was like yeah and like the first few
like weeks has all been like straight
straight up like boostrap stuff so but
this week we're gonna start working with
MySQL PHP all that all that good stuff
yeah that's cool man
III think like you know like I said
people just got a go out there in the
opportunities a dear man if you want it
you're gonna get it you got a saying so
what exactly they do now I mean what
type of industry is it that your company
is in well it's a small startup company
but um well I wouldn't really call it
small cuz like our biggest clients like
the New England Patriots so we work with
a lot of sports and psychology stuff we
make we use psychology our CTOs are
really big on psychology so he use a lot
of psychology to develop the assessment
test that of the NFL players when they
go like and during the draft they all
take this stuff hold on give me one give
me one second stay right there oh
yo yo what's up you - I'm gonna take
Joe's place for here real quick yeah
whatever
what's up Victor I don't know again
hanging there all along dude yeah I
thought it I'm just chillin I I had my
last day working out of pizza place
today and I was like ah once I give
you my audio is on the wrong headset so
yeah I think there is a question in the
chat saying if you meet any projects
before you got your internship no not at
all so if while we fix my audio
everybody else is saying Congrats
thanks a lot guys appreciate it
you hear me
still can't hear anything I know yeah
should be good alright alright sorry
about that Victor that's all good
yeah me yeah you know what's so dude
yeah going back to your question no I I
don't I don't even have a portfolio like
I don't have projects I did I did
cold Steel's boot camp all the way up to
the node.js port and that's where I
stopped because that's when I got hired
with my job and then my job told me I
needed PHP and SQL so I like cold
steel's and had that is so I stopped
that and my my job pays for code school
calm and when I do that well I like the
UT udemy style and I'm like I like you
to me better and they actually paid for
like courses I want so that's kind of
cool
yeah that cold steel a web developer
camp if anybody's like struggling with
HTML or CSS or JavaScript that's
probably the best course like even I
knew a little bit of HTML before I took
that course but I took that course and
that's pretty much what got me like on
the road to web development that still
still hit of course yeah so definitely
wanna say like and the imposter syndrome
really is real like it hit hard like the
first two days and I was like what did I
get myself into but it also helps that
I'm not the only intern there's four
other guys and they're all going through
the same thing so like for the first
assignment no one really knew what we
were doing but if he--if like the one
guy found out just like what this little
code did and I realized I had the same
thing on my page I'm like oh thanks for
that and then like if I found out
something that hotel that and it's all
it's all teamwork it works the best
thing right for those go sounds like you
have a pretty good team they're both you
have a team of four how big is your team
size I like to to expect five interns in
total and there's four full-time web
developers well okay yeah so what Moff
for guys um I don't know
have a plane crash or look like some
crazy thing happened were the house
hooking and there was like a huge
explosion or like I don't know what the
hell happened I'll tell you guys
tomorrow when we find out in the news Oh
next time on Cody fries I'm out of here
you guys I'm sorry yeah it's cool man
I mean you was you already in here so
you know you say yeah I'm getting
in here um but yeah now that's good so I
mean what you guys were talking about
filming in so like that
I know exactly uh victory I just asked
him how big his team was at work just I
had a question you know how did you get
an internship like when you spoke to the
the employer of the team was it a
three-month contract was it six months
was a 12 months the duration right now
it's six months so my last date would be
August 31st if they don't decide to like
extend me but basically I just went on
Google like I said I found the post I
applied and funny enough like they
wanted a cool like cover letter
basically the company works with sports
so like I I'm really passionate about
sports as you can see like I'm all about
sports so like I broke my cover letter
sharing like experiences in the past
like for example like I told him I
related how I taught myself how to play
hockey ice hockey in like two months to
my ability to learn code the same way I
was like this is what I did when I
really wanted to play hockey and now I
play hockey every Sunday night and this
is how I could like bring the same kind
of focus and motivation to coding and do
the same for this job you know and then
but basically for the interview they
asked me three questions like three live
questions it wasn't any white boy stuff
it was on the online ID like shift at it
and so they asked me first thing was
like very
simple like I was really surprised I was
like scared I was like I'm not gonna get
any questions right and I went in there
and the first question is hey can you do
this table and format it and I was like
are you kidding me
like T had T body tre I was like my god
second question the second question I
know they had this bus loop question on
JavaScript which was like if print all
the numbers like 1 through 100 if it's
even print face if there's odd create
print buzz all that stuff it was pretty
easy then the third one was like PHP
stuff and I when I I didn't really do it
well cuz I hadn't even seen page before
I went to it but but then the whole
interview transition to like again me
showing them like all my notes on the
notebook they like that a lot and they
also you know I did not I brought the
notes of all the udemy courses stuff
that I was like taking so like if I saw
a video on like loops JavaScript I wrote
down every single example and like
everything like I had a bunch of like
core stuff now that someone that's
definitely smart and then what they also
liked was that I went on their website
and I drew mock-ups of things I would
change on their website
kind of like ideas cuz on my cover
letter I told him I was more like
front-end visual oriented kind of guy
like I like a whole bunch of like art
stuff so I actually like drop like
mock-ups of like how I would do the page
different and they all like laughed or
like they all smiled looked at each
other and they pulled up the website
they were actually like working on and
like what I drew up they were already
doing it so like nice they were like so
yeah you have good ideas in the meeting
and I was like you can yeah I lack
knowledge but I showed them how I could
overcome that so what exactly I mean you
going to school right now what exactly
is your all your background mean what
you what you study
right now I'm an IT I'm about to
graduate and the BA
associate's which one are just bachelors
yeah for you that's cool that's cool
and um so what makes you want to jump
into web development I mean there's a
lot of other fields that you could have
tried yeah I don't really I study I
teach is because like you know you can't
go wrong with a computer I kind of shied
away from computer science just because
I didn't want to do the math but it
sounds kind of dumb now that I think
about it I should have just done it but
basically saying my story I mean that's
the main reason why I didn't want to do
computer science I got to calculus too
and they'll say okay cool that's exactly
right
- I'll say ok that's good enough for me
I'll give myself clap in the back end I
don't need to be doing this so yeah but
even at that man the degree that you
already have you're good
you know nobody anything that's
technical ite is always gonna look good
on your resume and then on top of that
plus the online training and the fact
that you already have you know
determination to be in the industry like
you're gonna be fine you know so ya know
some some I did HTML CSS Facebook markup
one that one really helped with like all
the front-end stuff I understand with
Flex boxes all right now because I
encountered that problem like my job not
like oh this is what clear fixes like I
didn't even know what overflow was yeah
you know that's that's the thing where
is like I tell people all the time like
a man there's certain things that you
need to know from like just the core CSS
there's a lot of good things start
popping up nowadays in features that's
gonna see they're gonna come out in the
future you know like that's great flex
boxes but you still gotta master what
CSS is because you never know what
company you're gonna go to if you go in
and say I'm only studying the most
modern and the latest features and CSS
and
the day you go to a company where they
have some legacy code and they're not
using CSS grid or they're using
something like bootstrapping you don't
understand how regular CSS works then
you're gonna be like oh now I gotta go
on YouTube you gotta say it you should
have been prepared actually my job does
Aemon they try to use as classes like
custom CSS as possible they try to stick
with all the bootstrap stuff and if you
have to change like add a little bit of
padding or margin that you can do that
in line that's how do you want you to do
it like it like you said all the time
like each company does their own thing
you know exactly it everywhere you're
gonna go - right everybody has their own
workflow right there's people that were
there before you and they say head this
works for us we don't need to change it
you gotta say even though there's more
modern ways of doing things as scss it's
you know you could use less posts CSS
whatever people are using online and say
hey this is the latest thing is like you
go to the company they're gonna train
you on how they do it no matter what my
company doesn't even use framework oh
yeah use framework at all yeah a lot of
companies don't use frameworks is
something that's cool it's like okay
it's for your own knowledge of like okay
if I bump into a company that does use
this framework or the next job that I go
to they want me to use angular or react
then I know it but there's a lot of
companies that just don't need it even
at that like you might go to a company
that just uses WordPress and they don't
even want you to go and develop a
website from scratch they're like hey
man just use this theme that we already
have and just customize it a little bit
and that's it you know so definitely
every everybody has their own different
workflow now you say the majority of
jobs or like that or would you say
majority of bugs use frameworks in the
industry web development specifically oh
that what tell me again you to do most
of these jobs use frameworks nowadays or
do most of the jobs just use like
WordPress CMS type stuff well most of
the jobs depending on the company and
depending on the industry right
depending on the industry
you're in if you're in a company where
they doing e-commerce then they do
everything from scratch so they might
use something like laravel and they
might say hey we're gonna use reacting
angular as the frameworks or whatever
they want to use right now if you're in
a in a company where like let's say when
I used to work for creative circle right
we did some work for a Universal Music
Group right Universal Music Group all
their websites are done in WordPress you
would think like oh my god Taylor Swift
calm it's like they do that with a
wordpress you know it's like those
websites what they care about it's like
hey we want to release a website we want
to be able to show the tour dates and
this this and that like simple things
there's no real like logic behind it
it's more like the presentation and
being able to give access to people who
are not technical or access to the
website so that's why WordPress is so
popular for people that don't know how
to code it's like okay everything is
there for me all I have to do is just
add things in there like there's a title
there's a content area I could upload my
images and now the developer already set
up the theme that when I uploaded it
puts the images down here so a content
editor doesn't have to know anything
HTML
that's what I did my job actually has
one like that he's a sports journalist
he writes like articles for our page and
he does it all in WordPress but he
doesn't do what us like full yes that
people like he just he's in his own
little corner just like typing away its
articles for you
yeah content editors when you are
content editor you know for people who
was out there and looking at this video
if you're coming with a English English
major and you say man I want now I want
to become a wordpress developer or I
want to become a developer what I'm
called a very easy way to get into the
industry is to become a content editor
right and literally grow within that
company like you could work on companies
are a huge out there and you would be
like man how do I get a job at Nike is
that hey you got an English major right
and then from there you want to do web
development apply for content editor all
right you're gonna get in the industry
getting the company and then from there
you can switch up on the teams and say
hey I actually know how to code now you
switch up
you got what I'm saying you got to know
how to play the game but oh well yeah
WordPress is also good for situations
where let's say you have to make a
website for someone but you don't want
to always be there to change like you
know one word or change a picture so you
hook them up with a wordpress site and
then you say hey here's how you log into
it if you want to change things around
it's all good yeah I think that's more
WordPress okay exactly
so yeah going back to Victor pretty much
the format when a focus on more Victor
and I'm asking the questions so as far
as like now your career that you see
yourself focusing on front-end focusing
on the backend what do you wanna focus
on front anymore okay alright our first
assignment that they gave us like our
first real assignments were like the
first three assignments were they gave
us like old pages and they told us
convert it to the new bootstrap that was
pretty much it but the second assignment
that the real first assignment of the
game was was all we had to design this
email builder template that the admins
use so let's say they want to create I'm
sorry I'm just I'm making sure like my
house don't gonna fire some crazy skinny
oh good I might get here sorry yeah like
I was saying like our first assignment
was basically it's basically uh they
gave us this page that the admins used
to create the new emails that they want
to send out to like let's say someone
subscribed it'd be like welcome to the
right profile and inserts the name of
whoever subscribe you know like build a
template for emails also they want text
messaging in that too so they told each
of us interns like oh come in on Tuesday
we're like five to ten mock-ups of like
how would you like this sign the front
end like draw it out like come out what
ideas
we all pitched our ideas in the meetings
and I like at my five ideas they picked
at the top the one that everybody
considered the top one and they did the
same thing for each other in turn and
then they were like okay now you have a
week to go code the front end for it and
then we had that week and we presented
that and now we're waiting to see which
in-turn kind of like one there's no
winning it's just whoever has the best
front looking page that's the one we're
all gonna go in and start building the
back end stuff for that page so we're
actually building a like a real page
that's gonna be used later on but it's
that's pretty exciting but out of all
the interns they told me they were like
yeah you're definitely more like
front-end oriented cuz I know those
another guy that had all his buttons
were working because he knows JavaScript
just like that like it's easy for it
mine like mine looked like what I had
different everybody did the same
drop-down thing and I was like nah I did
like accordions and they had like
different animations and stuff and they
were like we like that so I don't know
if they're gonna pick mine I'll find out
tomorrow I think I hope so that's great
I think I think that's something great
that that company is doing because they
really like you know helping you guys
out and at the same time as like letting
you guys be yourself how many developers
are they as far as like senior mid-level
developers full time they have four but
our CTO in our header development also
code so there's like five developers
yeah and they don't really like they try
to like they don't go ahead and just
give you the answer they try to like
guide you towards where you can find the
answer you know so it's not like hey I
need to know this and then they just
give it to you no it's not like that but
you know but they don't leave you like
get lost anyways big idea it's nice now
that's cool and as far as like you see
yourself in that company long term do
you like the people you work in river I
think that's very important to see if
you
like working with the people there you
know yeah no I love it I had a pizza job
place up until today today was my last
day and I was like man I don't need does
anymore me over they they abused you so
much it's crazy there's a victor don't
forget to salami more like yeah like
like last night I was on the dish pit
like doing dishes I don't like man
this thank God is my last time I was
supposed to be like from 5 to 10 and
this other guy was supposed to come in
at 10 p.m. and take over to like 3 P 3
a.m. or something like that but then
that that guy never showed up so I got
stuck like another extra hour and a half
just like busting my ass cuz they were
like oh can you like leave this place a
little bit cleaner before you leave and
I was like man this I'm already
working overtime guy magical
place I bring something and it magically
gets watched and they're like come in
they're like you know can I get this on
the fly which basically means like doing
that's priority and I'm like bro don't
you see like all this other I have
to do well you can watch yourself it
takes like 5 seconds yeah they don't
help I mean that's how it is man like
I've done all type of jazz man like
that's why I was so grateful when I got
into this industry just because number
one I never got treated good like you
know compared to how you work like I say
I worked in a in a warehouse man in a
Jewish warehouse where they used to how
freakin nasty-ass kosher for like food
that just stinks I don't know what they
had on it but it was just horrible the
smell I used to come out of there we had
to put on a suit right and because it
was super cold it was just frozen me I
will come out of there every single day
like smelling like somebody killed the
animal on top of me and then people will
look at me like you're this guy think I
will have to cross the street like I
will see it was so bad that
I will see like a family coming and I
will cross the street I would like like
I feel like I'm getting out of the beach
every time but I'm not like I'm changing
my wet socks I'm like man this
I put in my two-weeks I actually
finished my two weeks and I was like I'm
out I mean you're nice enough man
because most people just be like listen
man you guys ain't no this ain't no
company like go up to the manager to
like the head manager there he's pardon
over the place and he's Puerto Rican and
he also like the internship that I have
now they called him to ask about me
because he's put in different work yeah
I was like I'm not gonna do him like
that okay so here he is weeks I'm like
okay you earned that I'm giving you this
two-week notice man you put in my
internships nice honestly like the pay
is only like ten hours and ten dollars
an hour yeah not listen I just wanted
the experience out and they could have
told me like minimum wage or for free
and I would've been like let's do it I
just said exactly sweet man once you get
that stamp you go from here and you
telling me like listen you tell any
company that you go to next right and
you say hey I work for these guys you
know they say psychology they prepared
the the test for the New England
Patriots right there their eyes opened
up as I okay cool so he's above the list
you get on saying like but you have the
skills like little things like that is
what really and this job is about five
minutes from my place so you can't beat
that
exactly so you and we work from home
whenever we want
oh nice so I like to be in the office
because you know like I don't know this
stuff so if I need like JavaScript help
or something it's better to be at the
office cuz he like you're right there
and you can get like help instead of
having to like type it on hangouts and
wait for someone to like reply wait all
Fridays no one goes into the to the
office I just stay at home no it's
actually good because you go going into
the office it shows like okay I'm really
dedicated so when they decide okay we're
gonna choose two people to stay here for
to work full-time
then you're one of those guys now the
guys have been like oh yeah we could
work from home Oh coming in once a week
like those guys didn't getting picked
yeah like they're not putting in that
work so you know so it's really good man
oh but yeah I mean any any of you guys
have any more questions for for Victor
that you guys might were favored chat
room got some questions for Victor on
his internship and you know his new
journey as a developer I mean I think
what you're doing right now is great man
and you know you're about to graduate
and you actually doing it the right way
a lot of people wait until they have
that paper in their hand and say now I'm
gonna look for a job and it's like okay
sandy go go get this job in a little
Billy is like great I'm kind of trying
to get a job it's like buddy you should
have been doing this like two years ago
a year ago like you know try to get into
the industry before you even graduate
you know just even internships or even
doing your personal little front of
these like it's all about just taking a
chance like what is the worst thing that
can happen they say no and then you're
stuck where you are like I mean it's not
gonna hurt you going to these interviews
they're trying just applying you never
know I'm a student and I'm always
looking for internships I speak to
recruiters a lot and as soon as I tell
them that I can't accept anything above
three months I just automatically get
hung up on pretty much cuz I feel like I
don't have six months to just dedicate
because I'm trying to graduate and by
next March I feel like I can only do
three months during the summer and I'm
just having trouble finding a
three-month internship okay that happens
I mean luckily you for you to graduate
you do you need an internship
no I don't I already have one but it's
not pure development I wouldn't like to
do something that's pure development as
an internship I just have been having a
lot of trouble finding one that's three
months okay so you don't like CS degree
or exactly you're doing
computer science you know just getting
it done but you know this what we gonna
do so now this is another section so we
do interviews in one okay so now we got
your boy without your boy Jason right
okay Jason you know Jason gotta flip the
hair to the side real quiz like hold on
I got this you know he's like I got this
real quick hold on let me get my swag in
you know so all let's talk about this so
your name is Jason right yes sir my name
is Jason so where you from Jason I'm
from Queens New York
hey you for modeling they you got me
high right now near Long Island City oh
okay or to the water I'm a self-taught
developer I don't know just I I just
like computers and stuff okay don't
really at the interview we going in so
what um how old are you let's start it
and then started with that I am 21 years
old how much longer you got so you
finish your bachelor's it's got two
semesters left dunsky
what school you went to you went to CUNY
you went to a private school which one
you went to right now I I just
transferred to a private I'm on a full
scholarship I should go to school in the
Bronx and we made it out there so
so five listen man survived the
stabbings to shootings booze on the
train slashing people's faces so it's
like no but the Bronx there's a lot of
horror over there I've met a lot of
programmers there you know they come
from they come from nothing but they got
a lot of heart and they always put 100%
into everything and you know you know
going over there and being around those
types of people it really really I think
made me a better person as well yeah
that's what's up
so I mean you do see us right so are you
focusing on what develop man or you
focus on our programming for software or
iOS game development what do you want to
go with I think I'm gonna go into the
web
cuz it's what I started with when I was
younger I kind of stumbled into PHP and
did some stuff in you know and yeah I
grew up a little bit and I tried
applications development it's cool and
so but I like I like the web the web is
you know that's where I'm from
stay there that's like that's like me
man um I mean what was your first
introduction to the web I mean you
saying you use this on PHP back then so
it's like you probably started what like
16 17 I think I was around eighth grade
I think but it wasn't it didn't have to
do with school or anything I used to
play this online game and I ended up
getting fished by a phishing website so
I learned how to do that kind of stuff
and that's really what brought me here
that's how I got here today so a lot of
banging my head against the desk and not
knowing how anything works but um I'll
let you guys know if you guys feel like
that just keep pushing man your
eventually it's gonna click and you know
you're gonna think back like how did I
not get the stuff yeah that's how I feel
with javis gonna bright now is just
don't yet meet you musically that's
canoeing am I like smart enough for this
like all these like logical stuff I mean
when did you start learning JavaScript
like two and a half weeks ago oh yeah
I knew html/css from like high school
but like Thomas gave I never really paid
attention to it cause it made me to like
see and like see programming Java but
other really other than like those nice
Oh
so yeah going back to Jason I mean so
you started with you know doing the
basics smaller pages you know MySpace
you know like hey let's fix something
background real quick you know let's try
to do some fishing out here you know so
chakra just I could I could see that
happening I mean young in the game and
then from there like what resources have
you been using because I know focusing
just on school school teaches you the
theory teaches you the basics but what
exactly have you been for the past few
years I mean I've been I've been using
Google and YouTube pretty much for
everything back when I first started
code Academy just just sprung up there
was like maybe three sections on code
Academy my first started so I didn't
really have this like team treehouse off
to learn so I just googled everything
and i YouTubed everything it all comes
down to like what are you trying to do
and how do you get there like so okay
nice um also what do you see yourself do
you like the front end a back end off I
think I think I like both I'm more I
like to connect things together so like
they connect the front end to the back
end but I do like design I've been
practicing design recently and I love it
so nice as far as design since you like
you are you focusing on like Photoshop
how you try to sketch a bootstrap I know
you don't like good chat but I use a
little bit of bootstrap and you know I
do my own CSS custom CSS designs - yeah
using bootstrap studio and I'm telling
you that has increased my workflow by a
thousand percent
it's not Bernadette talking about that I
was like I didn't even know about
bootstraps area it's brand-new man it's
like it's new technology and just being
able to like pump out like front end
like that just like so quickly and then
it just increases your club like
dramatically it's insane no that's cool
man I think I think bootstrap studio is
great especially like let's say if you
have an idea if you have like a
application that you want to prototyping
you're like okay I don't want to spend
you know two weeks doing the front-end
and then come up with the logic another
two weeks doing the back end is I hate
man you could just pump out something
quick we're front-end pull straps to do
something like what flow um so it's not
gonna it's not gonna hurt you some
people saying oh man is gonna handicap
you it handicaps you if you don't know
what you're doing like I say if you just
don't know how to code and you just say
hey I'm just gonna do bootstrap studio
then you're handicapping yourself but if
you're using as a tool to save you time
and to be able to prototype something
that you already know how to code then
you're gonna be good it's just like
you're able to put more more comfort I'm
more confident so like I got a question
yeah so for me yeah one of the projects
I want to do later on like in like a few
months is um so I have this thing I
don't know if you heard it it's called
like a movie tennis basically I paid
nine ninety five a month and I go to the
movies as many times as I want so yeah
so I want this I want to make this
website where I can use it to kind of
like every time I watch a new movie I
want to call in like some data from I
don't know like I am CD or something
like that and have like it's like a
little Dave kind of like a batch board
kind of look every time I see a new
movie I want to have like the picture of
the movie with my personal rating for
that movie and like when you click it
you can see like a small little like
review of what I thought and like at the
end kind of like at the end of the year
so you like my top ten or something like
that you know so I don't want to now
that I know about
to do I might just do the front end with
that that way I can practice all my
JavaScript with PHP and stuff with with
that so I don't know if that's a good
idea
yeah no it seems pretty cool or what I
would say is look into the movie
database that's an API so you could
actually go in there and like let's say
for example you create your your
front-end how you want your dashboard to
look right you're gonna have are you
planning on doing this like a service
for other people or just as a personal
thing I mean it could be both I mean I
have friends that I told him my idea and
they were like yeah if you make it I'll
use it like I'll like login my own
movies and I was like that's cool so
what you want to do is use have a user
authentication right so if you want to
do it with PHP Larry Bell
it'll be great because it will save you
time from actually going in there having
to code the authentication doing all
that stuff and even you know dealing
with database it'll save you so much
time use PHP Maribelle right or Ruby on
Rails all right just because you want to
focus on being able to build this fast
right you don't want to go and they have
to build everything from scratch
you have yeah sounds great now it's just
- executing and create it right so first
of all you have for user authentication
so every user has to log in and register
register and log in to their account and
then from there create the the front end
with a bootstrap studio if you want and
then from there what you would do is
basically have a section where you
search like you will say I'm gonna add a
new movie and then from there when you
add done the movie you put in the title
in the backend have the PHP go connect
to a movie database return it back to
you from there now that you found the
movie you choose which one's the right
one that sometimes there might be
situations where there's multiple movies
with the same name your right one and
now you say okay there's the movie that
I'm watching now you create another
another model which is gonna be for two
reviews
you say okay I'm reviewing this movie
and then you link that and connect it to
to the the movie that you just selected
okay so they're from there and I'm
saying it's pretty much talking about
that in selfless freaking
shameless plug like literally the PHP
course that I have on my website would
show you how to do that because that's
exactly what I did but in a different
way I actually went and found which
dribble and which dribble or Imaging's I
liked right and said hey I'm gonna add
this to my my section and you will see
the whole flow of how to add it from the
API like literally you can see and going
through that code yeah I'm going through
that cause I think I'm in the abstracts
one okay so you're in the
object-oriented yeah yeah yeah I'm
already in that part okay so once he
passed that part probably if you really
go hard you could in like two two days
you could finish the course and there
from the start building the project that
you have that's a really great idea that
you had do I need any kind of like
JavaScript like knowledge for this like
for the really to be honest with you you
could do everything through the backend
javascript is supposed to be something
that enhances right it's not really
something that is needed a lot of times
people use front-end frameworks for
every little thing that they could have
done with the backend
okay well in a situation like yours
because you want to get the logic out as
soon as possible and you already taking
PHP you don't want to go in there and
say okay now I gotta go and make sure I
understand everything about JavaScript
like you're already deep in PHP build it
with PHP and then from there you do
upgrades as the core another course as
the the project itself becomes more deep
and you say okay I finished on my logic
I have every different API I'm able to
create our users connect them to their
own movies and their reviews now you say
okay I'm gonna use the front-end
framework to enhance it so instead of me
having to refresh the page
and do another request you use something
like react or angular to be able to find
a movie at the movie to the database do
everything without even having to
refresh the page okay so does that make
sense yeah saw like a front-end
framework the front-end framework would
probably be really good for that project
there's make it way easier oh yeah I
would think so with that would me like
cuz in my internship we don't use any
frameworks at all so if I do this
personal project using frameworks would
that help like all right like do any
harm with me like not working with
framework like I'm I don't know I know
this is gonna be good for you like being
able to because I want to do a lot in
like not you know like do a lot to get
confused because I'm trying to do too
much at the same time yes exactly
what I will say look you've already deep
into PHP so you already got all the
basics you already got all the things
that you need now you're learning
object-oriented programming Nakao
everything that you have in the course
that's left create the project or even
at that you could literally just if you
don't want to create that the is called
design storm project if you don't want
to create it just skim through it just
watch what we did learn how to use
angular neural Arabelle and then start
building your project and you could
actually go into my project and see what
I did there and say oh this hot Joe
connected today bi let me go back to my
project and build it right so finish in
PHP because if I tell you right now hey
man go try to do this with a front-end
framework now you're doing two things at
once now you're trying to build the
logic connect to the API learn a new
language because you still haven't
gotten comfortable with JavaScript so
now is like what you could finish a
project in the next week two weeks from
now now you're looking at a month
because you trying to master JavaScript
no we got on saying like JavaScript time
to learn nobody here could tell you like
oh you're gonna go in there in two weeks
you're gonna just master JavaScript
those queries like
every time you think you're done you're
not done there's more to learn so it's
like just continues come I wouldn't say
that javascript is something I'm trying
to master or I would mainly say that
javascript is something I'm trying to
focus on like that's what I want to be
my main language there I'm always
working with yeah no I'm not saying like
for people the problem is like this okay
Tyler for you for example uh you already
know exactly what you want right no a
victor right now he's at a stage where
he just started he all this stuff is new
he's in his internship he's getting
already deep into PHP for him to just
say okay I'm gonna ultra clump into
JavaScript and also jump into a
framework you can't learn the the basics
that you need from JavaScript in a month
and then go to jump to something to like
react like that's where people mess up
at because if you don't understand the
process of web development when you try
to jump into a framework you'd think
like oh this is this is good
and this is saving time
sorry Brandon's got a mutually jecht you
so yeah so it's like when you jump from
different things without at least
getting comfortable with one then you're
not learning anything you get what I'm
saying like that's your mistakes that I
did
and this is like why I tell people as I
okay this is the path like for him the
path that he already started it's the
back anyway right even though he's
getting he's interested in the front end
finish what you already started before
you jump to the next thing oh yeah now
you're just confusing yourself you got
what I'm saying yeah well that's my
advice as far as that that project that
you want to build um anything else
anybody want to talk about cause I say
you said you want to focus on JavaScript
I was gonna say that that's a really
good idea because JavaScript doesn't
just run on the web anymore it runs
pretty much everywhere so like like
there's going to be technologies up in
common that might not even be related to
web but they use javascript and if you
know JavaScript you'll be able to you
know work with that kind of stuff you
know my plan on getting into making
desktop applications with a framer
car-ama with a framework card
I'm electron I feel like they'll be
pretty cool making desktop applications
with JavaScript you know yeah yeah now
electron-electron is pretty cool man
I've worked with a lob I started like
something in my last company we were
supposed to switch everything from
dotnet we had like a dotnet system for
inventory and I started working with
electron to change it to make it just
with JavaScript because they would have
saved to so much time and then I worked
on that but yeah it's cool it's
definitely something that is out there
you know and for people that's out there
is some people I swear to god people
think like yo Joe hate even like what
Jason humans like Joe Hayes bootstrap
Joey no what I do it guys is I give you
a general advice right everybody's in
different situations the advice that
give that goes for you take it the
advice that doesn't go for you don't
take it you don't say like I give a
general advice meaning like hey I tell
people no PHP learn all the basics of
HTML CSS and JavaScript if you want to
become a web developer if you want to be
doing web applications learn something
like laravel Ruby on Rails I focus on
the web right so those are the things
that I'm always gonna tell you guys so
like let's say like electron a react
native all this stuff are are like
pluses to being a web developer it's
like an extra skill an extra feature are
you coming with but for you to
get jobs and for you to be able to be
productive there's like literally like a
few things that you gotta learn HTML CSS
JavaScript PHP Ruby or rails and dotnet
if you want a job tomorrow those are the
things that could say you're gonna be
guaranteed a job no matter where you go
everything else is like by section by by
different situations you might go to a
company that you show up in like oh they
use elixir or you might show up to a
company and they use pearl but that's
not what the general purpose like you
know like the general population really
use out you know what I'm saying like
there's gonna be something out there
that's cool and you say oh I want to
learn this but that's not really that's
not the norm that's more like the
exception and it also depends on like
the company you're like interviewing
with the one I like got me for the
internship they basically talk to us and
they were like we were more focus on the
right fit for the team like they wanted
a good culture they were like the
knowledge will come after we just want
to make sure that the team we're
building is the right fit you know that
was cool yeah no definitely I feel like
that's a good company to work with like
it seems like they they know what they
want and they give value to you guys as
interns I've seen companies that they
treat the interns like they're extra or
like the other developers that's there
they they look at them as a something
that's gonna be dragging them down like
oh I gotta do my work and I gotta help
our oldest little kid you know so it's
like they one day they would hear all of
our like ideas opinions whatever so
that's hot
that's definitely hot man but yeah guys
um anybody else got any more topics
sorry are we got a sailor in here and we
got Harold in here say without people's
that was sad yeah you know I say what I
would I would I would up what's good job
listen man I want to do a little
interview
let's interview you now okay so we got
three new developers in here
so I say a way from me um I was actually
I'm your live show like a few months ago
you probably remember it was back in
July but now I remember in the air it's
been a I mean I was back then I was
telling you about a job I was about to
get in Philly or whatever and now I'm
actually now but yeah we're doing work
and I work for the big boys I'm a
Comcast now a delay like two months now
I found another job right after like
like soon as you get your foot in the
door you get another offer right away
listen man I don't know how to put it
off for people and make once you got
that look step are you good you could
work you up in like the companies that
you dreamed of companies that you wanted
to get to like all of this is gonna
happen just get that stamp first so dick
it could basically be like hey we
trusted this this person he's a
developer he's legit we we vouch for him
now feels good it feels good my my
LinkedIn said dishwasher and then now it
says full stack developer intern yeah it
feels good yeah now does that's hot man
so yeah going back so I say so let's go
back we didn't get to or one proper
interview on you last time man so I say
it I remember he was telling me he was
about to graduate I think it was an
engineering or yeah to engineer manners
and I didn't want to do engineering
basically it just just really wasn't for
me like I feel like engineering is like
they're they're more adorned like the
application and I really like figuring
things out you give them directions and
they just gotta follow it they say that
like sciences I don't ones that figure
it out in engineers implement it that's
basically the definition of engineering
so like that wasn't really for me I need
to do something that was like gonna
challenge me you know mmm so I start
getting into coding my friend was like
yeah like you got to mind for it so like
why not so like you know I'll get into
coding so I mean how old are you know
you like 21 22 I'm 28 right now ya know
my thing whatever I'm about just watched
my little business my little freelance
business already running into issues
let's say you yeah I'm just doing my
front end thing getting into back in a
little bit so um what you doing you're
doing front-end Comcast yeah I'm on you
why you works developer here I basically
do JavaScript are dang I'm always fixing
bugs all the time it's like a team with
three of us we just do this I just do it
for tomorrow all week so we bout to go
home you work pretty alright but you
know it is Comcast so ya know that's hot
that's hot man
I'm glad that you know things are going
good for you and I'm really glad that
you came through came back you know a
lot of people come in you know once they
get the job we never see him again
you know I hate to sauce thank you thank
you buddy
is a Goose's you know at least he came
back you know you updated us on what you
up to
and so you you're focusing on the front
end telling me that now you wanna focus
getting getting into freelancing and
starting your own business
yeah going so far I mean I got it I got
a website up or whatever let's say that
calm was the website let's let's build
your website account from scratch their
name like
be honest here so yeah I'm working with
like some people I try to only work with
professionals to be honest like I'd like
I'm doing something for a law firm right
now
don't sign for music industry it was
like a music label or whatever mm-hmm
and I'm about to meet up with like some
doctor like on Tuesday to do like a
doctor's office type of website I don't
know whatever they wanted me to get into
this is like yeah yeah it is on the side
yeah if you don't mind sure um it's
really through people I know to be
honest like I haven't even really done
too much advertising I got still gotta
get my business cards printed out I was
gonna go to meetups try to like pass
smile that kind of way but I already
tried I'm already looking at it like I'm
gonna be overwhelmed if if I do every
time yeah because like the people come
in so you know I'm not even sure if I
share it now look
because you're doing um you doing
full-time work and you're also gonna be
doing this the side I would say keeping
how you have it right now right
once your your workflow starts going
down then advertise sometimes you know
we get high be like man we we got this
like let's do this and that and you got
it seems like you you building up your
team I would definitely say give
yourself some time and then from there
once you finish the projects of the the
clients that you have then almost at the
end of the process start you know
telling other people were promoting it
just so like that you you don't get
overwhelmed this is like when you're
doing it full-time as a developer and
then come back home and put in another
3-4 hours yeah
side projects if he comes a lot so I'm
telling you how to experience like I've
got myself burnt out one like man I work
till like 1:00 o'clock in the morning on
a client's project and then now at 7:30
I gotta wake up to go to work and it's
like you know it's a little bit too much
so
I first take it easy you know my best
advice and I would tell people when
you're working like a company like
Comcast and you already got the bug for
entrepreneur or basically what I would
say is do the whole year through the
whole year chill work there full-time
all right get all your money save all
your money don't spend no money if you
really want to become an entrepreneur
don't spend no money whatever you're
getting paid
just pay your regular bills don't try to
splurge don't buy no cars don't do
nothing do this whole year of just
saving money right and then next year
you could take risk we say hey man maybe
I could make more money on my side side
business and now I could leave that's
exactly how you see me here all the time
on YouTube Abby you know is because I
was literally for like three years I
didn't spend no money
I just saved everything there so I
already had like you know mad bread
saved up in the bank so it's like now I
could literally say hey I could work on
anything that I want and if I fail I
have enough money to survive for two to
three years you get on saying so now I
have that space to actually go in there
either start a startup or do a side
business or do anything that I want
because I just saved money and then now
you're able to take those risk
I'm not saying so after you die be Chyna
yeah I gotta like try to pace myself and
like try to be patient because like I
really want to work for somebody else
it's coming it's coming for you man get
the experience you know do your work get
paid that money plus your side you know
and just don't spend no money this whole

it more opportunities for yourself okay
so I'm really glad I'm you know I'm
proud of you I'm proud of what you doing
and I'm really happy that you kind of
listening to the things that I was
telling people here like once your end
doesn't mean that you're a worker
forever you got to start using the
things that you've learned music ass
skills to make it work for you like
those guys that you see at the top like
those guys are just like you I mean not
all of them some of them are papi and
mami that the bread comes down down the
tree you gotta say like you can't do
nothing about that but a lot of those
guys they had ideas 5-10 years ago
they implemented it and then now they're
at the top they got their own companies
they got you know they driving that big
belly truck you know I'll say well it's
because they implemented something that
they had you you have a skill as a
developer don't come in and say hey I'm
just a worker you know what I mean like
a guy that works at mercedes-benz
he's a mechanic there he's just a
mechanic he's not the guy that owns the
dealership you got on saying you're
still a mechanic it's the same thing as
a web developer our engineer you work
for Google cool
well you still just a developer at
Google who other people are making money
the ones that are on top so you wanna at
some point create your yeah you're gonna
be fired
so we got somebody else in here we got
we got in here we got hey yeah what's up
guys my name's Alex hey we are
so I I see you Alex where you figure
what's up man
see what icon man just yeah I've a guy
don't have a webcam right now for this
computer my Linux my other machine my
work machine is a Linux laptop that my
microphone I'm having issues with like
the Linux Mike you know yeah I know
exactly what you mean yes it's for work
man is exactly I like using it because
that machine is really snappy never had
Linux on a really snappy machine and let
me tell you it makes all the difference
in the world
yeah I think that's like mark my
computer I have something here catching
dust I have a was a twenty five hundred
dollar computer like I bought a whole
bunch of parts I hated Windows I say
okay cool Linux so put Linux on it and
literally that thing boots like that
it's super fast is legit man and it's
good for work it's good for like
whenever I want to work on some web
development also programming and I'm
like I don't have my laptop or I left it
somewhere I just spin that up I'm
good
so definitely yeah it's good to work on
both environments - so you're like you
know as many environments as you can I
feel not as many but you know I mean
just a couple you know just so you can
kind of you know go back like when I'm
working on like you know my BPS server
