what's the definition of HTML right
we're going to use Google so basically
means hypertext markup language HTML is
everywhere every single page that you
see anything that you see on the web is
me with HTML right now let's say an
example we search Star Wars right we
must always calm place if you come to
this page
it's a beautiful page I love Star Wars
so if you are using Google Chrome you
can actually do this right now so see
what's the HTML this page how is this
page actually built you can do that with
any page you see right click and click
on inspect that's going to bring me this
page which is the console.log is going
to show you the developers tools I'm
going to show your sources network
performance memory application security
on it all of this stuff you don't need
to worry about for now all you need to
worry about is the elements so what this
is showing you is all the text that it
takes to create this page so you have an
HTML tag on the top here which is the
very first tag that you use then you
have a head where you keep certain
information for the browser and
basically the body tag in the body tag
it's where all the images all the text
all the links everything that you see on
the web page is located right on the
body tag all right now you're probably
looking at this and you're saying man
how am I going to remember all of this
text like you know what I want to build
a page how can I actually remember all
of this information it looks kind of
complicated when you look at it at first
right it's like then what the hell is
this thing
well basically there are 32 tags that
you use on most locations form when you
ever you actually creating a website you
know it could be a HTML email can be a
web page it could be anything going to
be even a video game right so all you
have to worry about this 32 tags and I
know it seem like a lot but everything
will make sense as we go but I want to
show you guys acts
the 32 tags that you're most likely
going to use at all times of course you
don't have to remember this this is not
something that you're going to say hey I
got to remember all 32 tags in one shot
trust me guys you don't need it
basically you got the HTML tag the head
tag the title body h1 to h6 so basically
h1 h2 h3 h4 h5 h6 which are all headings
right so as you can see here the P tags
is a paragraph this is a container span
as a container and basically it gives
you you know text emphases straw which
it just makes your text bold the a tag
which is to anchor link basically that's
when you click on a link that's the a
tag
oh well which is order list ul which is
unordered list Li which is the list
items right it could be a list item or
it could be on unordered list item so
basically that's a and then for making
other html5 semantic tags which are the
header nav main a side footer then you
have two empty tags which are breaks
images and then you have tables see this
right here that what we're looking at is
actually a table so you have tables you
know table row table headers and you
know table data cell so each one of
these is actually a table terror cell
right and then the whole thing is
actually a row okay so I know it seems
complicated but trust me as we go this
is something that the only way that
you're going to understand is by
actually building things and actually
building websites so that's where we're
going next
all right kids I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
