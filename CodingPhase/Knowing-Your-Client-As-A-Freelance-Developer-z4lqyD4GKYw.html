phase comm your boys back and out and
did it again
today's topic and this morning drive
going to the gym is basically knowing
your client when you're freelancer you
need to know who's a client you you need
to know who's actually here for serious
business you know there's a lot of
people that gonna waste your time
because a lot of people is gonna be like
oh how much does a website cost to do
this and that how about you build me on
Facebook how much would a Facebook will
cost me it's like those sample questions
it's like you don't want to be dealing
with those type of clients man but if
somebody comes to you unless you know
it's like a venture capitalist or
somebody who has some money you know
somebody who comes in and you say okay
this guy he has money you know he has a
at least $100,000 for you
then that's different right but if it's
like you know some guy you found on
Craigslist and he's asking you how much
I'm thinking about building on oh you
know I got a Facebook type website
bought before you know for guys who sell
auto parts like somebody come see you
with my crazy idea like that guys don't
even waste your time man
because first of all you know that it's
gonna take you a long time to build
there's gonna be a whole bunch of
features and if this guy is coming in
with a whole bunch of ideas and you're
like wait do you have the money for that
do you have the budget for that like
that's gonna be months and months of of
working you know just to build a website
and then from there you gotta test it
out and then from there you got a seeing
how to kill the bugs that you found like
it's work you know when people come in
and tell you can you build this for me
right away so you gotta you gotta ask
those people out man all right that's
one thing another thing is you know
somebody comes to you and says hey can
you build me a website and I'll pay you
later that's a no-no that's a no-go you
know what I mean like don't come to me
with that story that you know later on
you're gonna get this big budget you
know they don't sell me a dream you know
bills don't get paid with dreams you
know so make sure you get at least half
of the money upfront automatically that
that's a given because people do this
all the time they'll have you create a
website or even startup I've had that
happen to me plenty of times use
somebody to build my website and then I
stuff and then next thing you know next
thing you know you're like yo what the
hell man I already put it in a week I'm
trying to get paid for this they're gone
you know I mean they're the found
somebody else who did it for cheaper for
them or found somebody else who'll do it
for free decided hey you know what I
could do it on Wix like you know what I
mean like nobody's gonna give you that
time back and nobody's gonna pay you for
that so automatically before you start
working on anything set up basically you
know
a list of things a list of features that
this website is gonna have come up with
an estimate how many hours you think is
gonna take you to build it and then from
there you tell them okay this is the
first half that you need to pay up front
for me to start working and you explain
it to them bill I hate some people don't
understand why you mean half of the
money in front they're like what if I
don't like the website then you're
talking well what if I build a website
you halfway through you don't like it
and then now who's gonna pay me for my
my time that I actually put into this
you got what I'm saying so you have to
be honest with people and just break it
down to them be like hey listen the same
way how you expect to get paid at your
job or on your business that's the same
way I expect to get paid myself too I'm
not gonna do work for free so that's how
it is right now from there also to it if
you can if you have your your stuff in
order if you have like an LLC e or some
type of business set up already try to
get a contract all right try to get a
contract from this person signed that
says hey this person I mean like oh my
son broke is like listen man that has
nothing to do with me I did my job you
gotta pay if you don't pay cool I'll sue
you and then from there you're gonna
have to pay for my lawyers and
everything you're gonna have to pay the
money that you owe plus interest
so that's on you if you want to take it
there
okay so here's gotta be smart with it
I've been lucky I've never had to to
show nobody but I protect myself I come
in and be like listen if I know it's
something that is gonna take me a long
time and I'm already putting in you know
all my time into this project and on top
of that it's like it's a lot of money
let's say you you do an estimate to
somebody that and you tell them hey man
the estimate is gonna be $30,000 right
because they really want like a huge
website something that's gonna take a
long time it's gonna take you man months
to do right so they give you $10,000 or
$15,000 you want to make sure that you
have that in a contract where it says
hey ya both sign that this person gave
you ten fifteen thousand dollars up
front and that you expecting the other
half at the end so when you're building
this thing surprises don't come up you
know I mean it's like hey man it's on
the contract you know what I mean and
anything else that gets added to the
website we have to rewrite the contract
but we have to do it in you know add
another contract to it you know what I
mean
but yeah so let me see who's in here
right now once I stopped to come I'm
already by LA Fitness right now so I'll
talk to you guys in a little bit you
know but yeah so that's the topic man
you got to protect yourself as a
developer as a freelancer you got to do
things the right way because if you
expect people to do it for you they're
not gonna do it for you you know what
I'm saying
so yeah my fault goddamn cops but yeah
so yeah man so you just gotta protect
yourself you always got to think like
people or a hose no matter what if you
think like oh I know there's nice people
in the world know the only person that's
nice is you that's how you always gotta
think you know it's like it's always
gonna happen like that the only person
in this world that's nice is you and
when you're nice people take advantage
people come in they're like oh cool you
know little Johnny did my website great
I won't be picking up the phone from him
you know what I mean think they already
got their website they don't need you
after that they'll hire some some guy
from Elance you know for India for three
dollars an hour like I say they got the
whole website or the hard work from you
or order logic is there all they need is
just a little editing here and there and
that's it so now they disappear that
happens all the time you know and for
for you guys that live internationally
like let's say you're India you are in
Philippines and you are in different
parts of the world right you know if you
live in you know developing countries
and you see like online people trying to
take advantage of you the best thing to
do is to work for a company like Elance
right because in reality they protect
you like they have to pay you no matter
what like let's say somebody tells you
oh we want you to work 30 hours well
they have to pay that upfront before
they even you know before anything so in
reality you already know your money is
there but if you find somebody on
Craigslist and you live like in Zimbabwe
right wherever you live a lot of people
here in the United States they try to
take advantage of that right they'll be
like oh listen man you know I got some
guy in India that could pay you know he
does the website for $3 how about I hire
you for dollar fifty ladies so crazy
numbers like that right some people that
try to do that
of course you know sometimes you're
gonna find people are nice and this and
that but you're gonna find a lot of
people that try to just take advantage
so if you're an international developer
make sure you you know you have things
in order it's better to have like a
middleman for you guys then doing it
directly unless you've worked for let's
say your client on Elance right you've
worked with a client on Elance for a
long time and you already have a
relationship and the guy tells you you
know what man give me your paypal number
your people email whatever I must send
it directly to you in a situation like
that then you will say yeah okay let's
do it because you already have a
relationship with that person and that's
up to you if you trust them you don't
I'm saying but it doesn't guarantee you
that you're gonna get your money because
people will disappear on you people will
try to take advantage you know I mean so
yeah well let me see what's in here
right now
we got Ramsay Jordan silver blade Johnny
Lee JC Rodri baltasar Nunez Carter
Carter
we got 84 music who else
Vlad fresh meat hype the mo Ali Hussein
I met my Suzy Chris Sean is in here who
else is in here
Gustavo Delgado who else that's it we
got 23 people in here that's about it we
ma just don't trust anybody you gotta
you gotta protect yourself right as a
developer as a freelancer it doesn't
matter if it's just developers graphic
designers UI designers or pregame
I count things like like everybody gotta
protect themselves when you work in
freelancing because it's people people
just try to take advantage you know
everybody wants to save money nobody
cares about that you gotta feed your
family nobody cares about that you gotta
pay your rent nobody cares about that
you gotta put gas on your car
they don't care about that what they
care about is how can they get as much
money out of whatever project that they
they have right and to get the most
money the best thing to do is to
basically try to not pay anybody or pay
the least amount of money that you can
because then this when you do the math
at the end there's more profit for you
right so that's like the obvious you
know some you just gotta be one of those
people then you got to keep your eyes
open people will take advantage so you
don't stay up yours are frozen ninja
yeah now I'm planning on doing that at
least two to three times a week where
whenever you see me I'm live with you
know if the chat room right next to me
that means anybody cool kalach in you
know anybody can log in and actually see
and see the chat room and you know get
into the live chat you know like right
now I can't really bring anybody in here
because this is like straight through
the phone and it's not really set up
like that but definitely I'm planning on
doing that at least once or twice a week
because there's good it was cool to hang
out with people hopefully we we get to
you know get to have more developers you
know I want more of you guys to come in
like you don't have to show your face
you show your face if you want to a lot
of people that be like oh I don't want
to show my face I don't want to do this
it's fine just come in
and I say you know what I mean you're
gonna be fine
Nigerian princess no money in freelance
I think there's a lot of money in
freelance
I think there's a lot of money to be
made the problem is is that there's not
like a default price right it's like I
live in the United States so I will need
at least a minimum of forty to forty
five dollars an hour to work for anybody
minimum right for it to make sense all
right and that's like me being nice
there's jobs that are my charging more
because I know they got the money but if
Joe Schmo comes to me is I hate how much
cannot pay for your time it's gonna be
like listen minimum it's $40 right
that's just for me to you know just give
you an hour of work or whatever right
but you know there's guys who live in
third world countries where you know
they made $5 an hour they're good they
chillin you know what I mean like they
they but you know with $5 an hour
they're popping bottles in the club
let's just say that you know what I mean
so those guys they're good so that's the
problem about freelancing it's like you
know is it the free world the open
market it messes it up for the people
who actually need more money to survive
because there's people who will do it
for cheaper it's like the whole
situation with China you know and like
here in the United States a lot of
companies are here in the US but
everything gets done in China because
it's dirt cheap over there like
something that will cause like let's say
if you were to build a factory here
that's gonna build Nike sneakers right
each sneaker is gonna cost the company
about like $30 to make right you do it
in China it costs you 50 cents you got
what I'm saying like it's a big
difference if you want to build a
sneaker
here in the United States is gonna cost
you $30 to make it if you build it in
China it's gonna cost you 50 cents so
what happens American companies go over
there and they put order and the money
into over there for them to build it
because there's way more profit and I
think like that's one of the biggest
problems in society is that everybody
wants to be make a bigger profit and the
problem about that is that it reinforces
the idea of for people to be rich there
has to be poor people you know I mean
like there's not like a universal a
universal minimum wage right like okay
everybody needs let's say $20 an hour
worldwide right that's not that doesn't
exist so what happens is people take
advantages know that everybody wants to
make money everybody wants to make as
much money as possible so people take
advantage you know
oh sure and typically has higher skill
level developers versus freelancers
though I don't know about that
I don't know if there's better skill
developers offshore I don't think that's
true the only difference is is that
offshore like let's say in other
countries its reinforced that hey you
need math hey you need science hey you
need to study in school right like a guy
from India a guy from China
Gaea from you know Japan like they
reinforced that education is the way to
get out of where they are right here in
the United States that doesn't exist
people know like oh the caching is good
you know but only very few people pay
attention to that most people want to be
the next Kim Kardashian and you know
people want to be the next LeBron James
people want to be the next who was
whoever's famous right because that's
the easy route right it's like now
everybody's an Instagram model everybody
wants to be a youtuber everybody wants
to do this and that right have you you
know every kid that I know even my
nephew might know if he was like oh are
some what do you want to do when you
grow up and you know he's like oh I
wouldn't be a youtuber I want to be a
gamer why because everybody knows that
they make money right but the problem is
that that's the easy route nobody wants
to put in that work so what happens is
all of this skill workers you know well
educated workers are coming from
offshore in other countries they
basically they put emphasis into
education and learning and constantly
doing stuff like look at the amount of
you know let's say for example let's say
an example right look at the amount of
Indian Nepal Bangladesh Pakistanis they
are into development right
the number is it's crazy like you look
online you know even look at this guy
was this guy's name a clever programmer
his whole channel it's like a hundred
thousand subscribers of Indian in
Pakistanis and you know a whole bunch of
people that they live out there and they
know there's not that many opportunities
for them but they still trying to learn
how to code they still trying to learn
how to program because they know with
education you could take them out from
the class that they're in you know what
I mean like if they get the opportunity
to work at a company they're good
forever
you got what I'm saying like here in the
u.s. that doesn't exist everybody here
wants to be a star everybody wants to be
a rapper everybody wants to make money
quick everybody wants to say hey if I
why would I go to work and spend a whole
year to make a hundred thousand dollars
instead I could go and buy five bricks
of cocaine and sell it to somebody
you're gonna say you'd make a hundred
thousand dollars a week you know
everybody wants to find the easy route
you know but in other countries they
they put more emphasis into studying and
knowing that education is the only way
to get them out you know but here in the
US people bank on that you know people
Bank on the idea that hey man
everybody's a consumer everybody's here
they not a content creator they're not a
creator they're not a entrepreneur
everybody that's here is a consumer you
know nowadays that you know because of
guys like Gary Vee and and you know all
the other guys are popping up out of
nowhere be like oh man you gotta be
entrepreneur you gotta do listen that
right everybody who has the a dumb idea
everybody was a hey man I could I should
come up with a juicing bar and now I'm
an entrepreneur and it's like no no
you're not you heard a podcast and now
you call yourself an entrepreneur so
it's like everybody wants to be famous
everybody wants to be on top right quick
he wants to put in that work so that's
what America is all about right now but
you know people like us the guys that
are here like me and you right now we're
into this right went to developing
applications coming up with a new ideas
you know we actually out of the norm now
everybody's into this nobody is really
trying to put in the work why you think
a lot of people want to go to boot camps
constantly you know I bring them up
because people they Bank on the idea of
like hey man you could do this in three
months but nobody wants to put in that
work
you got what I'm saying nobody wants to
put in work where they could say hey man
I work hard and at the end I'm gonna get
every soul people is like nah man if I
go to a boot camp I'm gonna bypass
everything I'm it's like I'm getting
somebody to help me out to skip the line
and it's like nah bro
it still gotta weigh on line to get your
job you still gotta gotta go through the
process of learning to code learning to
to build applications you gotta know
things like some people they think like
it's easy it's not easy I'm saying yeah
man
so be an entrepreneur you gotta be
building something that number one is
making profit number two that people
want and need because there's a
difference you could create something
that everybody have but nobody needs it
and you create something that it's not
popular I mean look at this thing look
at this new social network that just
popped up call there oh right
vir o ver o ve are all I actually signed
up because I think is pretty cool but
even at that I you know you would think
like oh man social media is that you
know like who's gonna come up with a new
social media network and it's like yeah
there you go there's a new one coming up
so even if you throw that that ain't
nobody was gonna be able to create
another one to compete with Facebook and
Instagram
here comes another one you know so all
you have to do just creates a man you'd
be surprised man oh and by the way so
everybody who was in here go follow me
Joe Santos Garcia Faro download the app
download it now before supposedly it's
gonna be a paid service so the way how
it works is like you signed up now you
got it for free later on is gonna cost
about like twelve dollars ten dollars a
year so if you guys want to actually
save money cuz it's one of those
applications that right now you're doing
like um nobody's gonna be on that shade
that's Instagram does this and that but
it's already picked up enough attention
that is gonna be a contender if they do
the right things so next thing you know
what you should be popular like
Instagram Facebook and all that stuff
all those applications is gonna be like
MySpace you know they're gonna fall off
so if you want to be smart just sign up
now to Vairo sign up your account create
your account and then just keep it there
man
keep it there because right now you
could get it for free you know later on
is gonna cost you money yo whatup

going up going up on a Tuesday man Jo
hard job opportunities in CT it seems
like there's a lot of jobs out here
you know not as much as New York City
New York City is like you know there's
so many jobs but it seems like there's
jobs out here you know in Hartford this
jobs in new on New Haven I went to
Hartford yesterday and I was like in
downtown Hartford Connecticut and it was
beautiful out there man
it was nice like for a major city like
it was nice you know some people might
come out I'm gonna Oh Harford is bad
Waterbury is bad Bridgeport is bad and
you know and I kind of hate that you
know maybe I'll make a video about this
I really hate the fact that you know
certain towns certain cities got bad
names because they got urban areas like
I feel like that's like some I don't
know how to put it but is they is some
type of wait it's like some type of like
racism behind it like why in a area
where the majority is is white people
that's a good area but in an area where
majority might be of blacks or Hispanics
oh that's a bad area that's that's the
hood it's like why does it have to be
the hood you know what I'm saying like
what makes it the hood you know like it
doesn't make sense
you know but I was in Hartford and with
the wife and and the baby if you follow
me on Instagram
you could go to a coding phase instagram
/ coding phase follow your boy you will
see you know i post things of my family
postings on but i'm doing whatever right
me bugging out me diving diving all day
you know going all crazy but yeah so us
a hartford and it's pretty legit man I
could definitely see myself working out
of Hartford if I had to work you know
because it's pretty cool but yeah man I
really do hate that man I hate I hate
when people be like oh this is the heart
like what the hell is the hood you know
what I mean I got could show you the
hood like I'm from the I'm from New York
man like two blocks down you might get
shot you know like one block up you
living with you know all the hipsters or
the millionaire sort of trust fund
babies so in like New York City is full
of every every type of person that you
could imagine right here in Connecticut
there's like parts with there but I oh
this is the hood and then when you dig
down deep you're like wait what makes it
the hood like it's a whole bunch of
houses you know yeah people are not
making a hundred thousand two hundred
thousand especially here in New York in
Connecticut it seems like Connecticut
has so many people that that have money
it's not even funny like like I'm being
honest like it feels like every town
that I've seen like you know and it you
go to Middlebury or a Watertown you go
to was a sight of Barry damn Barry you
go to was the other ones there's a
couple of ones out there right
that it just seems like every house is
like $700,000 plus right so there's a
lot of people with money out here right
and then they look down upon the areas
where people earn less than $100,000 and
it's like what makes that the hood
you're gonna say like that's not the
hood you call it the hood because you're
you think that's the hood you know what
I mean like it's just kind of ridiculous
