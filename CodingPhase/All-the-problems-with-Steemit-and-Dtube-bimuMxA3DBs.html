coding face.com your boys backing out
and did it again all right listen guys
so today we're gonna talk about D tube
and we're gonna talk about steaming calm
yeah steaming calm what exactly are they
pretty much this well steam is a website
that basically pays creators money for
every time that they create something
they post something people give them
likes so you get like a little money a
little currency you know steam power
okay and now what is d2d tube is pretty
much is like another child of steaming I
believe the person who created it was an
independent developer and it's supposed
to compete with YouTube and all the
other websites that have video all right
but what's cool about it is the fact
that people can come in and share their
opinions and and just be honest and and
share whatever they want to share onto
the internet without having to worry
about all of YouTube is gonna you know
ban me YouTube is gonna delete my
channel YouTube is gonna do this and
that I think it's a great idea what they
have a fact that you can actually come
here and basically just post everything
that you want without thinking about oh
my god my advertisers is gonna pull out
on me because I said the wrong thing
it's like the people pretty much pay you
if somebody likes the content they give
you a vote you know it's like they paid
you from there so just fun alike which
is cool all right now the biggest
problem that I see with steam it and
also that I see in d2 is that
everybody's just there for the same
thing everybody's there trying to get
that money everybody's there trying to
just get a little like you know posting
so many things about cryptocurrencies
and that's all they really post about
it's very rare that people come in and
post other stuff you know and show up on
the trending pages you know like YouTube
you might see things like
entertainment or you know music video or
etc right you might see something that
most people will be like hey this is
funny I like it so the average user is
gonna go to the website now when you
come in here and you might see somebody
you know David Payne pac-man I love his
channel he's legit you know you have
let's say for example talk about
bitshares what else is in here
crypto green madness what else is in
here
join us now join us now live crypto
Bitcoin steam and chat talked EMF what
else is here man Stock Exchange what
else is here block trades like you know
mall sort of stuff that we see out here
you know thank God for Joseph's foot for
posting this video this is rare I'm
being honest this is rare this is not
every date thing where you might see
people just sharing ideas sharing news
that's happening out there that doesn't
have to do with Bitcoin or esteem like
let the platform just be the platform
right like one of the major problems in
this thing is just that everybody just
talking about Bitcoin Steam period
they're talking about the same thing so
it's like this website in reality is a
bubble of everybody who wants to be
inside of some how in crypto currencies
right so we are only targeting the same
people we're not bringing in nobody else
from the outside I think one of the best
things that happen to this website is
having David pac-man because now he's
gonna come in and share stuff from the
news right and just like have people
come in and share their opinions and and
it's cool you know it's definitely cool
to see that another thing that I see
that is completely wrong it's like you
know hot girls and sexy girls who just
come into the website and put in a
little thing like oh here's my lunch
here's how I made my coffee today here's
my travel pictures like I don't know I
find that sad you know what I mean like
like this girls are pretty much out here
just giving this guy you know giving
people like I don't know like it just
seems like shady to me it seems shady it
definitely seems shady yeah because it's
like like I don't know I feel like are
people that sad to be like oh my god
it's a hot girl she's in here come on
guys like this this is some stupid salad
or or some stupid Oh like hey she had a
coffee and it's a lot of times I'll be
seeing this a lot from like God you know
sexy hot asian girls who are you know
just traveling the worlds like hey I'm
traveling the world and it's like some
guy taking pictures of her I've seen a
girl - who is like pretty much I forgot
her name but she's I looked up just to
see but she's like pretty much like a
slave to this there's a guy like you
know how one of those situations like in
Thailand where the this American
Australian
European guy goes out there with his you
know how you call this with his
retirement money and for this girl who
doesn't have anything it's like that's
like a a come-up she's like this poor
guy who only making like $1500 a month
afraid for her that's a lot of money so
she's with this guy all the time and
this guy all he does is take pictures of
her pretty much exploits her alright I
don't even know her name
videos of her on xtube like porn type
things just exploiting this girl and
then it's like now after exploiting her
on you - not you - on xtube and all
those other freaking porn sites
now the dude got hurt on honesty me I
wish I would have saved her her name um
but she's here man she see I seen it
somebody sent me a video of it and I was
like this one girl from some porn video
and I looked at everything the thing it
just looks sad and then now the guy got
Oh steamy calm and it's like you get
what I'm saying like I don't know like I
love the idea of steamy I love the idea
of d2 but we gotta get real content
creators in here not just the same thing
of hey guys
cryptocurrency this hey guys a big coin
went up $11,000 today and that's all
we're gonna talk about or we're gonna
have this this young asian girls over
here is like hi guys today I got fed
some some food like we really don't want
to see that like the general public it's
not gonna come in here for that all
right thank God for David Pakman like
literally I saw this today I was like
whoa thank God for this dude I came in
here like two months I was like y'all
was kind of go really hard I really want
to bring my community to to you know to
see me calm and to D tubing I wanna I'm
gonna continue sharing it you know
people I want you guys whoever watches
this video understand
I love D to pile of steaming I love the
idea behind it I love the fact that you
could get pretty much you know some
cryptocurrencies from creating good
content and the people is the one that
decide which content are good at which
ones are bad but we need to get more
regular people in here we can't just
have you know a Johnny and his mom and
his brother-in-law who are into crypto
currencies in and that's all they're
here for now we need people just regular
people you know a little Billy from the
black who likes you know Call of Duty
games little Johnny from up the block
who likes to seek granted four or five
games we need to see Jenny a little
Jenny who likes to see her favorite
makeup artist whatever we need to see
Linus tech doing reviews here we need to
see regular people and I'm not saying
that everybody that's here for
cryptocurrencies is not regular people
and I don't mean that what I mean is we
just need just average people just here
creating content we can't have you know
just sexy girls like hi guys I'm a
in coffee hmm like we don't need that
like what is this you know what I mean
like what is this like we don't need to
be seen no Asian girls you see it oh
here's some I made coffee today
Oh like come on man like we need content
like that's the only way that this this
thing is gonna work you know what I mean
like Jerry Banfield showing up every day
and the top trending post and I love the
guy he's the one that actually put me on
to this but all he talks about is the
same thing how can we make money on
steaming and it's like wait what
like share content share stuff share
other stuff like we need to make other
people popular I know there's other
creators here who are creating cool
stuff right but nobody sees them all
right so we need to figure out how to
put those guys to the top how can we
come in and bring them up how can we
share that content how can they make
their content easier to find right
because this it's very easy to say hey
we're just gonna target the crypto
community it's like yeah duh everybody
that's here knows about crypto
currencies that's why they here can we
bring in just the regular people bring
in the kids bring in the grandmas bring
in the you know the wives that want to
see no you know makeup artists they want
to see DIYs like those are the things
that I want to be able to have on this
platform you know for some people they
might say man you're talking about
YouTube well it's the reason why YouTube
is successful because everybody's there
right we don't want this to become hey
I'm only the crypto guys are in here
like we're not getting nothing about
this with the hair you know what I mean
like we're not gonna get no prouds so
you're not gonna get no money we're not
gonna get anything this thing is not
gonna be worth anything having the same
2,000 people in here creating the same
type of content over and over again like
hey today Darian went up to it
and dollars guys everybody up votes it
in it's like you get what I'm saying I
hope you guys understand and I hope you
guys get used to this I'm I'm planning
on coming back to 2d to and creating
more content more regularly all right
but at the same time my channel is about
being honest and just sharing real
opinions if you like the fact that
somebody's saying something about this
make sure you subscribe make sure you
like my videos just share it my posts
whatever you want to do with it right
fine if nobody sees this I know a lot of
people's gonna see me on YouTube but if
nobody sees it on D tube it's fine you
know I don't mind I want to bring my
community here to YouTube I want
everybody who's watching me right now I
think this community is gonna grow but
we need to get more people like you guys
creating content right
you guys who are developers you guys who
are designers you guys who are gamers
you guys who are etc fill in the blank
all right you guys know what you are all
right you guys know what you like to do
what you do on your your free time and

sister-in-law fell down the stairs
