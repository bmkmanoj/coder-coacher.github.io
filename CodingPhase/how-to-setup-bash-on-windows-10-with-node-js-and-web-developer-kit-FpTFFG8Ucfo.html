you go to into our Windows computer this
is a Windows 10 I know a lot of people
be having issues so I'm gonna do it with
you guys
make sure that you have 64-bit windows
ok if you don't then this is not really
gonna work for you that well ok so the
next thing that we have to do is come
here
search for windows feature on and off
click there ok this is gonna open up
let's look for windows subsystem for
linux press ok applying changes is gonna
say we need to restart the computer
alright guys so basically the computer
restart it so now what we're gonna do
come here and we're basically going to
search a bone - ok now this is gonna
take us to the Windows Store and we're
gonna click get ok now the next thing
that we're gonna do we're gonna open
this up I'm gonna pin this to start ok
and this over here into taskbar so
saying installing this may take a few
minutes alright guys so now that
installed the first thing that's gonna
ask you for is a new username so you're
gonna put in here whatever you worked
I'm gonna put in coding face ok then I'm
gonna put in my password
password update it alright now the next
thing that we're gonna do we're gonna
copy this see what it says here I'm
gonna copy this we're gonna say curl - s
capital L HTTP colon slash slash the
beat that node source.com slash setup on
the score nine dot X and then I'm gonna
do pipe sudo - E
well capital e space bash - and then in
here we're gonna basically say like this
click enter okay okay so let that go
okay the next thing that we're gonna do
we're gonna say sudo apt - get install -
y node J yes okay it's telling me some
error here let's see what's going on no
it's official Marcos made me run apt-get
update your try wave pass - fix mixin so
I think this is one of the issues that
most people be getting which is
something with the Python Python 2.7
okay so give me a second alright guys so
what I did was basically all I did was
just come in and say sudo apt does get
installed that's why no J yes and
basically now it's running so it's
saying unpacking no J yes let's see how
it goes all right let's see hopefully
this thing
it's good I know now exactly what you
guys have been going through on Windows
this is a nightmare compared to some
acts like you literally go in there and
macro with like two commands and you
would have been set up already okay guys
so now basically what we're gonna do is
we want to check if everything is good
we're gonna say node dash V this is node
version 9 point 11 I'm gonna say NPM
that's V and we got NPM install sooo so
we are good to go
okay now the next thing that I want you
guys to do is go to my github so you're
gonna go to github.com slash coding face
the LTC om and then you're gonna go to
over here to this page he's gonna bring
you to all of my repos and you're gonna
click on the one that says start a kit
2018 okay if it says 2018 2019 2020
every year I change it okay so it's fine
so next thing that you're gonna do all
you have to basically do is just click
here click download zip and we'll
download the zip okay now the next thing
that we're going to do you're gonna open
this up we're gonna say extract all okay
there you go so we extracted everything
okay now go to your downloads folder and
you will see your starter kit folder
2018 now inside of it that's another
folder called starter kit 2018 - master
which is the same name but that's the
one that you really want okay so we're
gonna come here to our C Drive so let's
say this year your PC you click there
double click on your C Drive and now
you're gonna create a new folder call
projects ok click in there and then now
you're going to drag the starter kit
2018 - master all right
now next thing that you're gonna do
we're just gonna create a basic project
so it doesn't matter what project it is
whenever I tell you guys to use the
starter kit this is all the steps that
you have to do but the only difference
is that you just got to rename this to
whatever the project's name is so if
we're working on nodejs name it to know
GS if we're working on social media site
name it to social media site so for now
I'm just gonna call this react react
date okay so now the next thing that
we're gonna do we're gonna come to our
coda face a desktop right so this is our
bundle terminal so here what we have to
do is come here and say CD /mnt
slash and then we're gonna say C so C is
your C Drive okay now you're gonna say
LS and when you say LS you're pretty
much seeing all of the folders that are
inside of your C Drive okay so if I come
here double click here you will see you
got the Intel which is there you got
very program files from a files 86
projects Riot Games users windows etc
okay now we have this projects folder
this is where we have our starter kit
for this project called react date okay
don't focus on the name of react day it
could be anything
all right you're probably seeing this
because you're gonna start a project
with me so don't worry about the name
just name it whatever you want okay so
for me
I'm gonna go inside of the projects
folder I'm gonna say C the projects so
now I'm I'm inside of that folder now
I'm gonna say C the react - day now I'm
in there and then now that I'm in here
I'm gonna say npm install
whenever you see me say yarn run watch
or yarn ad is the same thing as I was
saying npm install or if I was to say
NPM run watch okay so I'm gonna show you
right now so we're gonna say NPM install
and then right here is going to get all
of the files I'm gonna post this alright
so I just finished downloading all of
the packages for this project and then
now we're gonna say NPM run watch it's
gonna run gulp okay now we're gonna come
here we're gonna open up localhost 3000
and there you go we have our starter kit
up and running and everything is good
okay now the next thing that we want to
do is make sure we have a text editor
you could use vs code if you use
whatever you want
me personally I prefer atom so I'm gonna
search for atom go to atom that IO I'm
gonna download this give me a little
second failed now whatever I don't know
what's going on with that okay it's
taking a low wow so there we go
close that up all the windows that you
have so there and then just click here
file open folder and then go to this PC
go to your C Drive go to your projects
go to your project that you working on
currently okay and click select folder
now the next thing that I want you guys
to do is pretty much come here our file
go to settings go to install I want you
guys to install a couple of packages
we're gonna say JSX
we're gonna click here terminal this one
wood platform your ID terminal and so
that would make sure that you are inside
of the platform your ID terminal
settings okay it looks like this scroll
down look for shell override this is the
default PowerShell we're gonna come here
and put in windows system32 - bash dot
exe and pretty much we do that we close
this and now when we open up this new
terminal we are now using Linux pass
right inside of our atom okay so we're
gonna come here and just click a less
and you're gonna see all of the files
that you have for this project and
what's cool about this is automatically
when you open this it opens you up
inside of your project so you don't have
to actually go inside of each folder
Mickey Mouse so nicely so that's
projects like reacting automatically it
starts you off right here okay now let
me see another cool package that I will
say I will say pretty pretty here yeah
prettier for atom and stole this cuz
this just saves you from you know some
code that looks ugly is just gonna be
able to have your code really nice and
pretty for you okay we're gonna test
this out I'm gonna close this terminal
that I have here okay click here press
control C and inside of here and we're
gonna do the NPM run watch
okay there you go
we open up a new window and and here we
are good to go okay any changes that we
do is gonna show up so if I come here
say localhost 3000 give it a second
local host 3000 it's gonna take us to
our project that we have running okay
and if we want we could come here and do
something like this sass let's say
background let's put in let's make it
purple
you know removed up the things there
save this linter and as you can see
automatically refreshes also one of the
coolest thing about atom is that it's
one of the most customizable text
editors out there period so let's say
you wanted to have something like autumn
highlighter syntax you click there let's
say this is the dark syntax city light
I'm gonna say city lights you I install
that go into your theme section and you
could just change it from here
say city lights okay this would change
the look of it and if you want let's say
for example where is a autumn
highlighter click there change the
syntax okay we can also come here and
click install and do some icons so now
we could see some file icons install
that
okay you can also install this one city
like icons if you want to have it very
similar to each other okay click there
see you can see there you go
so you're pretty much ready to go and
you can start any of my projects once
you do this so yeah I know it's a lot
but hey that's what happens when you're
on Windows and you know it's fine man
once you get through this whole part
this whole process you never have to do
this again so unless you get another
Windows computer but yeah guys I'll see
you guys later man
hope you guys enjoy the same yeah this
video brought to you by coding phase
comm all of its members make sure you go
visit a website is the only place where
you're gonna learn how to become a web
developer with real projects take it
from me it's your job back at it again
coding phase comm keep it real keep it
