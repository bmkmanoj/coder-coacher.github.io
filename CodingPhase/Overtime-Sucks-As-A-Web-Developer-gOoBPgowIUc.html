back at it again man coding face.com
listen your boys back I didn't did it
again yeah alright so we're going to
talk about overtime because somebody
left me a message asking hey do you guys
get paid overtime do you guys you know
do you guys stay late this and that and
yeah one of the bad things about being a
developer or a programmer is most of the
time well probably 90% of the time you
work salary meaning you know you're
basically saying hey I'm gonna work for
your company for you know 90,000 a year
80,000 a year 100,000 a year whatever it
is and you basically is an agreement
that it doesn't matter how long does it
take for the job to get done doesn't
matter if you know you got to work on
weekend so you got to work extra hours
it doesn't matter because as the only
thing that you're gonna get paid is just
a little 80 90 100 K so you could come
in and actually sometimes I hear stories
of people doing 70 80 hours a week and
I'm like I will not do that you know
I stay away from companies that try to
do that even right now my own company
were dealing with you know time
sensitive situations but we basically
like right now this whole week I'm gonna
have to stay in on an extra hour so what
I might do is I might just come in I
don't know extra early 8 o'clock so I'll
be from 8:00 to 5:00 so and then I'll
stay here to like 5:30 so that's I and I
would have extra on top of the hours I
already do so that's what I'm planning
on doing
you know but yeah when it comes to
overtime you don't get no overtime it's
not like a lot of companies not other
companies other jobs or careers where
you know like I say those guys that do
like construction or do whatever the
 they do you know if they do
overtime they get time and a half you
know so if they get and pay 45 with that
overtime they're getting paid a hundred
and something right that hour that extra
hour that you worked or that extra two
three hours that you work you made a
couple of hundred bucks for developer
you don't get that you just get a little
pat on the back like okay good job you
busted your ass you did all this work
and that's it that's what you really get
you know that's one of the bad things
about being a developer and also to most
of the time whenever you have to do
overtime and you got stale a unless and
that is usually not the developers flow
is always somebody else who who
up they either miscalculated a deadline
or your project manager didn't think
something was important and he left it
for last minute so now you realize that
the thing that they left for last minute
is actually gonna take longer than what
they thought it was because they're not
developers so now you as the developer
got a bossy ass for a week or two of you
know coming in early or you know leaving
late people who come in at the regular
time they end up leaving 2-3 hours late
you know so that's just how it is you
know so but yeah man one of those
situations where you know you can say
those are the kinds of being a developer
you know deadlines and when somebody
messes up and I'm telling you 99% of the
time whenever you have to do it that
line is really not the developers fault
it's somebody whoever's project managing
whoever's are the one that is making the
decisions in this it's the one that
 up and it sucks for the developers
because then we have to come in and
somehow make it happen you know there's
a deadline hey you got to finish
something by you know Friday Tuesday
whatever it is you know now you just got
to bust your ass and somehow make it
work make it happen you know are you
going to get a bonus for it probably not
are you gonna get anything that's worth
your time probably not because you
already agreed to a certain salary you
know but then again there's days that
you don't do anything those days that
you code and you're just working a
little HTML CSS so the easy things you
know so well yeah all right guys so let
me know what's good with you guys are
this little web developer lunch break is
gonna be super quick this live session
is gonna be super quick because I gotta
get back to work I gotta eat and then
get back to work unlike a lot of people
here on YouTube I'm actually a developer
that works I'm not just here making
tutorials and that's it like that's not
my job but yeah man was good with
everybody Orlando que lo que Cal okay
Orlando leave me away yo Johnny cake
cake and my boyfriend er straight
Dominican Talk Mon Sam on Sunita
it's slick where do let me see what else
what else
what's going on crying this what up Matt
what up millions what up Jason what up
high from the Ukraine I wish I could say
your name all I see is just a whole
bunch of weird letters not somehow my
little I don't know how to say it it's
hard finally made it was poppin Jerry
what up don't think I forgot about you I
know we got to do a session somewhere
this week we're gonna try send a guy
without my people from Africa without I
love Africa man people don't know yeah I
don't know that about me but I love
Africa man I love Sena god I love South
Africa I love Morocco like I get a lot
of love out there
yes you know you know I was really
thinking about you Matt like really like
Odie like yesterday because I was like
yo man I hope Matt's okay I hoped he
didn't go too you know
ariana grande's show you know I know
you're a big fan of Ariana and you know
and I was like now I was worried about
your son I was like man I know he loves
that girl you know he got posters of her
and man I hope that he's okay you know
but now it's really messed up I was
thinking about you Matt I was like yo
this is crazy like you know cuz
what the hell now you can't even go to a
concert you can't even go anywhere where
people going in with a gun or a
 machete or showing up with a
 bomb or whatever like come on
like it's so ridiculous man the
times that we're living on and then
they're gonna make it even worse because
you know how when you go on the airport
you gotta check your foot you gotta
check your bags check every
single little thing now they're gonna
make everywhere that's public like that
watch you gotta sing
now that's not propaganda man you're
walling out you're buggin out
you think that's propaganda you're crazy
that was definitely bombs people died on
that people die on that I'm just
sayin
man I don't play around when it comes to
 terrorists and all that
because they they're out there man these
people did the thing it's like the guy
who who killed all the gay people in in
Florida right this guy he had nothing to
do in his life literally had nothing to
do in his life so when you have nothing
to do it you don't have nothing to look
forward to you don't care to die you
don't care to kill other people and then
like it messes it up for us the regular
people who are here and have something
to live for like if you want to kill
yourself during your own time don't
think anybody else with you you know
what I mean do that share your own time
there's a tree there go and do what you
got to do on that tree you know what I
mean like leave us the alone you
know but anyways man yeah my fork
remick's it's true man we got to talk
about web development yo
who here has started the tutorial does
the need to target the big store
tutorial let me know I want everybody to
leave the number one right now
on your comment so like dr. know who
actually started leave the number one so
I could know who actually started the
based or tutorial ok neo I'll see you

Bob the bake store leave the number 1 so
I could know who actually here is taking
the tutorial
millions are see you
alright guys stop talking about
terrorists and all that that
is done that's it we know we all have
different opinions who cares
okay everybody thinks different that's
it
84 what about what I would up 84 do you
start the tutorial yet I'm watching you
you better stop start that now that
you got a Mac now that you got a Mac
this you know that's what I with
this kid this kid he's taking this
serious man my boy 84 say you know what
I got a Windows PC I got a couple of PCs
around but you know what I'm a ticket to
the next level I'm gonna get myself a
little MacBook a little MacBook Pro get
started because I want to become a web
developer I want to do this the
right way and I'm not saying that all of
you guys are using Windows and Linux and
all the stuff janna you know you're not
doing it the wrong way but I guarantee
you guys once you touch a Mac and you
learn how to basically do web
development in MacBook in a Mac iMac
MacBook pearl whatever it is I Mac Mini
like once you get to that trust me guys
I guarantee it
you're gonna understand why so many
people choose it you know so
come on man you slacking now go ahead if
you want to finish it finish the coke
course go ahead that's fine yeah trust
me man life is easier with Max people
just don't know because somebody tell me
something like oh where I work at
everybody uses Windows and there's like
bro do you understand that why people
white companies have Windows computers
it's not because they're better it's
because it's more cheaper so they could
go in like let's say right now for one
MacBook you get yourself like one
MacBook right you could buy literally
like six seven Windows computers for
developers all right
but it doesn't mean that's a a better
system it's not that is that they're
gonna be more efficient or how you gonna
efficient on it at all it just means
it's gonna be cheaper for the owners but
besides that like come on bro that's the
reason why they have it
the reason why every company has windows
is like this man and I know it because
I've seen it done I've seen it done and
other companies that I've been on when
somebody wants to like let's say a
business owner wants to buy 20 30
different PCs for their employees right
you know what they do the code down and
they say Delhi we need computers we need
20 computers for our company what does
they'll do they'll comes in and
basically does a contract with the
company since okay you know you're going
to buy all your computer systems and all
your parts from us for the next three
years and we're going to sell you those
pcs for $200 each all right so now we're
like three thousand five thousand
dollars they bought computers for
everybody
but it doesn't mean that they're
efficient doesn't mean that they're
better doesn't mean that the the person
is going to code better doesn't mean
that they're gonna get any advantage it
just means the owners save some money is
that simple
yeah I spent look I spent like about
$1,800 and probably more with tax on a
Windows PC where's that Windows PC
catching dust right now like I put Linux
on it and it was running cool but it got
me bored
it also I don't know just windows in
general I haven't had a good experience
with windows and look look what happened
just the other day massive hacks a
massive up that it happens
and that's only on Windows
that does not happen to Linux it
doesn't happen to to max it's
just on Windows yes sir you gotta hit
them with the sauce got a drip I'm
dripping right now bro
as it possible to earn money from web
development as a teenager of course you
can look online look on Craigslist
there's a whole bunch of gigs of people
that they want to create a website so
you was a teenager somebody comes in and
pays you 300 400 dollars for for a
website you already better often your
friends you know your friends that
working at McDonald's and working at
Wendy's they they basically get like
$250 after taxes a week while you was a
developer with five to ten hours you
could create a webpage for somebody in
charge of 400 now if you get multiple
clients now you're looking at some real
money you're looking at two thousand
three thousand dollars which teenagers
are not getting in at the regular job so
yes Orlando I know I definitely know how
it is in the arm and I know people of in
India they are living off 200-300
dollars a month you know like it's crazy

besides coding you know so after certain
amount of hours
