again coding face calm your boys back in
I didn't did it again guys today we have
something special for you
we're doing an application review yeah
hey I hope you guys enjoyed this video
that you're about to see now just make
sure that you subscribe and click on the
little bell because that's the only way
to get notifications ok so one of my
subscribers I actually sent me this
application say hey Joe can you please
go over it and just try it out tell me
what you think first of all the website
itself looks beautiful I love the design
of it I love that animations that it has
I love the you know even the little
shadows that it has like it's nice and
clean you know it's very modern okay so
we're gonna try this okay so it's type
floor so he says if you type adeptly
with 10 fingers you're typing faster
than your mind is working cool so I'm
guessing the application itself is to
test your skills as somebody who's gonna
be using a keyboard all the time ok so
it's just to improve your skills as you
type okay so let's try this out so we're
gonna log in with Google so it has Olaf
already which is pretty cool so we're
gonna come in here login and as you can
see this is how it looks soon as you log
in it's pretty nice nice and pretty I
love you I love the gradients I love
everything that I'm seeing it's pretty
legit so it says practice test ok cool
let's try it up
oh okay competitive is looking let's try
this oh wait oh man oh no no okay
oh my god okay I'm bad so I'm having
this my score Joe Santos Garcia it shows
my my icon my icon is my baby cause guys
my see it says 22 words per minute
that's bad I think people supposed to be
doing like 60 words per minute
competitiveness is really what it cost
you per man-hour to get you what you
want other words dancing allocation
level that place in the bags that so
this is what it is okay and then we
could come here and say okay cool I'm
gonna try this out with multiple I see
says hey so that reputation play search
attempt so this is cool so this is like
searching for other users to see if we
could play against them so let's see
somebody's out there way better than me
okay I'm done I'm done get me a tea I
suck oh man so this is cool you could
play is like custom reputation you can
play against the computer or I'm
guessing this is like like a ghost mode
from somebody else okay let's try this
play with friends click here okay I'm
gonna open this up in our new incognito
window let me see if I can take this
here okay I'm gonna log in with my other
account
see if I remember it okay
trying this out right click here okay
cool so we've gone head to head
okay so if I try this here
so as you guys can see we basically do
this multiplayer isalus real-time it's
pretty cool man I'm like really proud of
the student for creating this
application you know it seems pretty
simple and you might think like oh
there's a simple button no there's a lot
of work behind the scenes you know he
did this with no J yes he's using react
I'm pretty sure it's react let me make
sure yeah there's definitely reacting
here so like it's pretty legit man this
kid really went hard like you guys might
think oh this is easy it's just a little
game nah man there's a lot of stuff in
here man like there's a full application
that you can show somebody and say hey
man I really know react I really know
what the hell I'm doing on top of that
he has it on his own domain type Lord
calm it's like this looks like a
business this looks like something that
it's legit people can use it you could
share it this is something that you can
pass it on to your friends on Facebook
and be like hey check this out
now the only thing that I was saved for
him is hey man you need to put some
advertising in here to be honest with
you because there's a pretty cool
application that you got here but if
people use it and you're paying for the
hosting and you're paying for the domain
hey man make some money out of it okay
so this is pretty legit this one uh of
the subscribers that actually listened
to me when I told him hey man go out go
out and freakin learn react
isn't that like he wasn't hard man you
know I was checking his email you know
he was like y'all hey my longtime fan of
Kona face channel I've learned many
things moreover you the only person that
encouraged me to learn react yeah so
finally I've learned there
creating my own application hope you
review it basically his images and he's
just like yo man this is what his
learning face was so he learned react
and then nodejs and one to two months so
he did not sleep for weeks so pretty
much he really went hard right then from
that he built a web application his
stack is no js' react is Redis my sequel
AWS I've learned so many things what I'm
developing it again thank you for the
replay bro if you have any questions
should be an email so shout out to
Vanessa
shout out to vanish like this is like
something that you know this is
something that I'm proud of right
there's something that I could say hey
there's one of my subscribers this is
one of the people that have listened to
me this is one of the people that we can
see he went hard he did exactly what I
did when I first started I said hey I'm
gonna just go hard for the first month I
didn't go to sleep either man I was
doing like 16 hours a day of learning
how to code like I really went hard so I
want you guys to go check this out go to
type Lord calm go try it out go test his
product his application guys this is
super legit man like this is a very well
built application like if I was working
at a company I will hire if I had a
