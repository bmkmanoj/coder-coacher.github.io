again man coding face.com
I wanted to talk about this app in this
article tbh pretty much Facebook
acquired this company for a hundred
million dollars which is pretty crazy
and all this stuff happened
you know like in nine weeks you know
something like that right a few weeks
ago right so this is a very very simple
app all right but it's something that
people can relate to like you know it's
like tbh I'm guessing is to be honest
right and I know a lot of kids in high
schools definitely gonna use this like I
told you guys I did something similar to
this when I was like 14 years old I
almost got suspended
this isn't that because you know people
start using it for the wrong reasons you
know like you know a lot of people's
gonna use this for simple things like oh
who has the best smile in the classroom
who has you know you know whatever but
let's say you know who has the the the
biggest but in a in a you know eleventh
grade like little things like that it
gets popular that's the things that you
like when you're like in high school
Jeni high school this this and that etc
right now this thing can actually become
a nightmare for people who who get
bullied because this is gonna be pretty
crazy but was amazing about it is that
they launched this thing in one school
right they shipped it to one school in
Georgia they let it grow everybody
started downloading it sharing it to
their friends and then from there
basically you know they did a August 3rd
published date August 1st shared it to a
school in Georgia
they got it trending on August 7 people
started seeing it they're like okay cool
tbh right nobody has thought of this
right to be honest right it's super
simple right then August 8th is trending
it keeps going up they updated the
design they cleaned it up
they say okay we have something here
it's already
let's get the big boys right so they
came in they brought in better designers
they launched it again then an update
September 415 they hit number one
by October 16 Facebook bought a hundred
million dollars like it sounds like
something that's not real but it is real
kids you know people might be thinking
like oh man like why do I care about
this I'm looking to get into web
development I'm looking to get into
back-end development guys this is
important because when you think about
it is such a simple app that you could
have done this with react native right
it's one of the most simplest apps that
I've seen it's like hey who has the best
smile and then there's like four options
and people click on it and it's like
it's like voting right but you know for
little high school and junior high
school students whatever right now this
is pretty crazy you know what I mean
like to think that they're gonna get a
hundred I mean they probably got already
100 million dollars for something this
simple but what's important is the fact
that it's the bread people already know
it tv8 you know so this this semester
almost thing you know all the schools
are talking about my nephew who's he's
like 11 years old he told me about it
and I'm like for real they have an app
like that so it reached out from Georgia
to all over the country even here in New
York they have you know people are
talking about it you know and I'm like
man this is crazy and then now I'm
looking at this article I'm like man
they got a hundred million dollars in
like nine weeks for this simple app you
know this is very inspiring I'll be
honest guys you know this is why I tell
you guys learn programming learn the
skills that you need to learn and really
just go hard man like really really
really really go hard guys because sky's
the limit right now
I'm pretty sure the developers who
created this they've been doing this for
a while right there's not something to
happen from one day to another
where they could say hey we just started
yesterday creating apps and now our app
is trending no they probably have like
three to four or five years doing this
but at the end of the day that's not
what matters what matters is really when
you get that that trophy you know for us
developers with our trophies not to to
say hey I'm the smartest person here
yeah I'm the best developer I'm the best
programmer that's not our trophies guys
I will trophies this money let's be
honest you know people is gonna come in
here and be like all I care about is you
know programming this and that bro
nobody's gonna applaud for you you know
nobody's gonna give you applaud and no
one's gonna freaking you know give you a
trophy your trophy is how much money you
make in your career that's really your
trophy all right so this guy's in like
five years say they got their trophy at
the end of the day a hundred million
dollars is a lot probably didn't get a
hundred million dollar cash but most
likely like who knows twenty-five
thirty-five million dollars in cash and
then the rest they got in stocks all
right and then on top of that they still
keep their job because you know when you
get acquired by a company like Facebook
those guys that have been there they
still keep their job but now they work
for Facebook you're still working for
TVH but a section of Facebook now so not
only that you make mad money you also
working for Facebook and then you know
Facebook stock goes up every single day
you know and who knows if you're smart
you hold it for a long time you know
that's your retirement money you know
$1,000,000 can become you know six
million dollars by the time you retire
right you just leave it there and forget
about it all right
but to me is just amazing man
you know sky's the limit right this is
one of the many reasons why I've been
creating small games releasing them on
the Android and iOS market you know for
like the past year I'm the low you know
once I'm ready to tell you guys about
the games that I'm making I'll let you
guys know but like I told you guys from
the beginning I'm all about passive
income you know it doesn't bring me in a
million dollars but it brings me in a
pretty you know pretty stack so you know
and at the same time there's so many
different little ideas that I have for
phone applications and you know stuff
like this cuz in reality the people that
you want to target is teenagers the
people who are in the next generation
you know trying to target guys you know
from what I call the Facebook age those
guys you don't really care about those
guys those guys are not really on the
phone they're not really sharing your
apps who you really want to focus as
that junior high school in high school
that's a or you wanna target like a
business a business solution something
that's out there that nobody's doing or
if they've done it you could do it
better and more cleaner with a nicer UI
something simple I mean sky's the limit
guy like yo you better start working
hard man start programming I'm telling
you guys man I don't want it that it'll
be like man one of us right one of us
that's here on this video that's
watching this that's like commenting on
on on the video leaving a message
leaving a downvote because there's
people that leave down votes for no
reason right even if it's something
positive if you leave an upvote or
downvote
one of us out here there's gonna create
something that's gonna change the world
we're not gonna save the world when I
gotta stop hunger but at the end of the
day we gotta get that trophy one of us
has gotta get that trophy you get what
I'm saying
like and all of us could do it but we
have to work hard and also you know it's
like you got a prototype different
application prototype different websites
different ideas that you might have try
to build stuff that is simple and easy
to ship out and then later on you could
just you know say hey now once this
company is big
we start focusing on projects that is
gonna take us longer to me because I'm
pretty sure this I didn't take them more
than the maximum of six months to build
it right and then look at that after
they launch it so probably in nine
months
it made them a hundred million dollars
all right the guy who created flappy
bird he created that in two weeks after
two weeks he launched it there from
there he was making $50,000 a month I
mean there's so many so many stories
guys that you hear all the time and
people might be like oh man
programming is dead you know developers
are not making money there's no jobs
guys you make your your love you don't
wait for it you don't say hey huh I'm
gonna wait till I get hired and you know
this isn't that no man you take you take
luck by the neck and you'll be like yo
you're gonna get me this now
that's how you do it man don't leave it
to luck don't leave it to Lady Luck I
guess this thing is not about who's the
smartest who knows the most languages
who who knows the best algorithm out
there guys is not about that man
the reality of things is is a mixture of
a whole bunch of things
all right a mixture of marketing a
mixture of design I make sure of having
an idea and the most important one is do
you know how to use your brain right
pick simple things things that regular
people could you know could do and
they're gonna enjoy that's saying you're
gonna have a successful life as an
entrepreneur as a developer creating
cool applications cool websites for
people like that's all you really need
you know before you even learn how to
use a computer your requirements should
be hey do you know how to use your brain
all right guys I love you guys man check
out my website guys coding face.com I
got a couple of courses there and we're
killing them right now basically we have
like the best courses right now that is
just simple I'm making it simple for
people you know you get one course you
know get access to all of them
