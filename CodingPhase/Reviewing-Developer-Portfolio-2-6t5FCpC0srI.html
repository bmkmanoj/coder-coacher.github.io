it back we're reviewing junior
developers portfolios and helping people
out here on line coding face.com is your
boy Joe back at it again man
coding fees calm guys alright so your
boys magazine well you can do is start a
series where you review junior developer
portfolios I'm like yeah that's what I'm
doing that's why I put the video up
everyone's like yeah this is great hope
you do more there's like that's some
excellent advice keep going greetings
from Brazil but I was ill alright and
then you got your boy Jay Jarvis um
basically Greg Jarvis he sent me this
link he's a hey man check my portfolio
go ahead review it cool so we all here
on Greg Jarvis on github page which is
cool this is smart you know it's like I
tell people all the time hey man go
ahead put your portfolio up online you
know some people tell me hey I don't
have money this and that bro you could
go to github and you could create your
own page to get help so look for github
pages you don't have to pay for anything
now if you want to buy a domain then
that's different you can do that too
alright but don't let load things like
that stop you just create your portfolio
start putting it out there now first of
all I'm gonna say I love the colors that
I see here you know from the the
gradient from a little blue to a lower
red this in-between gradient right here
you know the main colors are like this
dark red and everything seems pretty
cool you know so far what I'm seeing now
I must point this out I hate seeing this
thing and not because it looks bad but
it's because it's sort of played out and
whenever you look online if you go to
team forest you go to other websites it
seems like everybody's putting this on
this page because it doesn't look cool
but then it it's like it opens the
discussion is this your page or a team
right I know you created this right but
somebody else like a recruiter you might
be like oh this might be a team because
I see this on every page everybody's
using it that's how people are that's
how dumb they are I know you built this
yourself and just use this library to do
there's no effect but that's how
recruited to work and regular people
work they don't know the things that we
know as developers so far I like the
fact that when you click on the button
it shows you the section also too it
keeps that there it's activated if we
come here to skills you see your
animations that as you scroll right we
also have current projects all right let
me see what else we're gonna go into
this stuff in a little bit I just want
to make sure I go through everything all
right there's like a little delay
between how things start animating you
should put the animation that animation
starts as this loads up when you scroll
up to here this is when the animations
supposed to start now when it's all the
way up here because the problem what
happens is that when it gets up here
there's a delay as you could see that's
what happened take a peek at my github
cool let's see what he's working on
let's see if he's busy see now this is
good this shows that he's active every
single day even if he was just to just
put in a little command of like hey I
had an extra comma hey I had a semicolon
but for somebody that comes in he's
gonna look at this he's gonna go okay
this person is active at least once a
day or three or four times a week on
github which means he's creating
projects constantly which shows me that
he's like you know really into this he's
really into the community he's into
coding for sure now let's go into
portfolio section all right only thing
that I will say I wish you would have
put this in a container because I
understand what you you were doing here
but if it was in a container it would
just look so much better you know that's
just my opinion
but I definitely see what you were doing
here it looks good though
so let's go into the projects I mean you
have a JSON viewer online let's look at
this project okay let me see what
exactly they're supposed to do okay so
if I come in take a JSON is going to
convert it okay so let me see let me see
how this goes okay so what exactly is it
supposed to do okay oh I like this hmm
hmm I mean first I like it I like it
humming press kids it shows you know
what the hell you doing all right so I
like it it's a pretty cool thing
probably it's like a little project you
you create it it's pretty dope let's
save you I colors you I color stop PW
let me see guess it's still loving
loving loving letting alright
still noting I don't know but that's
cool oh let me see what else you got in
here you live demo yes looks pretty
clean definitely typography is good
everything seems pretty legit animations
pretty good yeah it's pretty legit I
like it
now let's say github battle okay this I
guess this is made of react which is
pretty cool too
so let's see let me actually look at
this so it's basically saying the ones
that got the most stars we got free coal
camp
I'll Twitter bootstrap free programming
books Facebook reactors number four it
sends the flow of Heroes number 63
that's pretty cool and you could come
here and say hey show me by JavaScript
or show me by Ruby show me by Java show
me by CSS oh let me see show me by
Python cool I like it it is pretty cool
it shows that you know how to use react
you know how to use react router you
know how to work with Ajax and api's so
that's pretty good now my only concern
here it's and this is just a straight
honest honest opinion about this is I'm
not seeing that many like real projects
right you're showing you have a lot of
skills in programming right but at the
same time it tells me that you are a
beginner or like I don't know maybe a
year in maybe two years in or even less
than that right because you have a lot
of projects which are like single
projects meaning like okay you got cool
stuff here but at the same at the same
time it's not real projects meaning like
hey he doesn't have like a business that
he worked on he there's not a website
that he has created for you know for
freelancing like a client or anything
like that so it shows me by coming here
like yes this Kay he could program but
at the same time he's on a
a level I think with the skills that you
have you could be selling yourself for
well you know you know like mid-level
you know like you know what you're doing
you know you have the skills you know
how to how to build things you could
definitely build anything out of a
design like you know as far as HTML CSS
so I'm pretty sure if I give you a
design you could build that right away
so I know you you definitely know what
the hell you doing the only thing that I
will say is pretty much just create real
projects you know just because if
somebody's gonna come in and gonna hire
you automatically they're gonna be like
oh this person's like junior developer
he has no experience he hasn't gotten
hire anywhere right you want to show
people I hate have real projects so
automatically your skills are above what
a junior developer has right so what you
want to show is I hate I'm gonna mix
here like yes
you know you might go into a job
interview and be like yeah I haven't
worked directly with a company I haven't
worked with clients but this other
projects that I've built and like paying
me for my skills like I'm gonna you know
when I come in in here and I get hired
I'm gonna hit the ground running you're
not gonna have to do no training the
only training that you're gonna have to
do is just pretty much show me was the
deployment system here how you guys
deploy how you guys connect to the FTP
how you guys connect to the server where
SSH that's a and then give me a project
can now build it for you right so that's
what you want to show to people because
it's like if you come here and I found
if I'm a recruiter most of the time
they're gonna be okay cool he knows how
to program for them they're like all
this stuff is cool but then there were
like okay he knows how to program so
let's try to scheme it let's try to pay
him the least amount of money that we
can because he's a brand-new developer
but you have the skills that you could
compete with mid-level developers so
show them that you have those projects
so now even though you're a brand new
developer you don't get put in that box
of like oh he's a junior developer he's
still got like a year two years left
you know to really get comfortable it's
like nah I already have the skills pay
me my money and I'm here you know I mean
show me the project and I'll build it
for you all right so that's what you
really want to do and I will say focus
on and I'm gonna repeat it again go to
dribble comm find cool designs there
take ideas from there create your own
things like let's say right now you
could create create a Priceline clone
right come to Priceline calm look how
look at look at it and recreate it right
change things around recreate it add
some filtering at some data at dummy
data doesn't have to really connect to a
real API if you know the backend create
this on your own like you know there's
so many different projects that you can
do right but what's important is for you
to just come in and just show them like
you have real projects cuz you I could
tell like you have the skills you you're
already putting a lot of hours into this
alright so now to take it to the next
level let's start hitting them with real
projects you know start creating a
restaurant create a real estate create
you know create a music website for
somebody create stuff that is real life
situations like all of this stuff right
here like you know all of these things
are super cool but these are things that
you know the nerdy side of our cells is
gonna get excited for as developers like
oh you use on me I'm like oh man this is
cool I like it I like how it looks it
shows me what type it is if it's an
object if it's an array not a doubt
whatever right that's super cool but at
the same time our recruiter is not gonna
look at that and be like oh great he's
gonna be all cool another junior
developer just came out of boot camp and
probably you didn't go to a boot camp
right so that's what I would say
definitely um just go hard and create
real projects man the skills is there
let's say you got me like you got me
here like I don't even know you you not
even junior developer I don't even
why you sent me the portfolio like
you're not even a junior developer no
more nothing like you you're beyond that
you should be getting hired right now
you probably are hired all right now I'm
glad that you send it to me so I can
show it to people here and just show
people I get this are pretty clean
portfolio and it's just like you have
the skills this is the thing you have
the skills you know what you're doing I
could tell you putting a lot of hours
into the things that you're building so
it's like now let's start focusing on
building real life projects so when
people come and they look at your your
portfolio they'd be like this K he
already worked for companies we need to
snatch him up as soon as possible guys
