out of the game coding face.com man make
sure you subscribe and make sure you
like this video man alright so somebody
asks me hey I know HTML and CSS and a
little bit of JavaScript should I learn
video game programming like something
like C sharp or you know something like
unity and I basically said well homie
little homie no bro don't do it man
don't jump around different language
this man if if the language is not a
combined with something that you already
know don't don't learn it man because
now you're just basically doing a
mistake that everybody makes which is
just jumping around you know trying to
learn every new technology any new
language that's out there you know
people but oh I want to learn oh you
know Elm everybody's talking about Elm
now or we they talking about elixir oh
they talking about whatever you know
don't just keep jumping around until you
know the language very well so you know
at least one language very well so like
I say if you started with the front end
learn the front end very very well and
then jump into something else don't just
keep jumping around cuz then you're
gonna know every language out there but
you're not a master of anything you know
what I mean like you don't want to be
that guy you know what I mean like you
don't want to be that guys like oh yeah
I know I know skyline Oh job I know c++
I know G sharp I know HTML CSS sorry no
JavaScript I know pearl I know PHP I
know this dissing that and in reality he
 sucks all he does is be
basically all he knows how to do is just
for loops that's a that's all he
knows
in every language and he thinks he's an
expert you don't want to be that guy
it's that simple right because when you
go to a job and like you get hired
they're gonna expect you to know that
language that they hire you for so like
let's say they hired you to become a
JavaScript developer they expect you to
know javascript in and out you know what
I mean everything from prototypical
inheritance until you know the new es6
whatever it is that's out there as far
as javascript learn it learn everything
from the language not the frameworks the
language and then learn a framework and
stick to that one don't just keep
jumping to different frameworks because
just because something's hot today
doesn't mean it's gonna be hot tomorrow
you know what I mean like but if you
know the language you're always going to
have a job you know what I mean so make
sure you don't keep jumping around guys
like that's the only advice i'm going to
give you guys because yeah you could go
in and you know keep learning you like
oh no no Ruby I know Ruby for three
months and now I'm a jump to python and
learn Python in three months and then
jump to PHP another three months and a
year you learn four different languages
but reality when it comes down to it
you're not an expert you know what I
mean you still just a junior developer
in every language do you want to be a
junior developer working every single
language no so I would advise you guys
don't do it make sure you just you know
you you learn something first you you
become a master or something cuz you
can't be a master of every single
language it's that simple ok guys so
make sure you subscribe and make sure
you sign up the kid is back man I'm
outta here boy you dig coding face.com
man the schwag e is you know developer
in the internet man you did
holla at your boy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
