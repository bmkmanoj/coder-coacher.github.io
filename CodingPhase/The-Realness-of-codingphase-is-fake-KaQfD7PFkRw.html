so that's this video from this kid Titus
who basically he was talking about you
know the falseness of you know people
take the perception of being real and
what is real what's not real right and
there's some things that I agree with
him some things that I disagree with him
you know he was talking about how a lot
of you guys who are my subscribers that
guy come to my channel and I'll be like
oh man I'm Joe so real because he talks
a certain way then he says this this and
that you know what I mean so am i real
because of that or am i real because um
myself and I'm not worried about what
other people think you know what I mean
that's why I'm real that's how I feel
I'll you know I mean when people gonna
oh man Joe so real I am real because I'm
not fake you know what I mean like I
could come here and sound completely
different guys trust me right
I can sound completely different when I
first started this channel I study a lot
of people my favorite person was on at
that moment was Chris Hawkes I like duck
tips
I like Mackenzie's child I like a couple
of people there and they all have
talents they all have their own skills
their own swag and I was like man what
do I do I made a couple of videos even
my first video that you if you start
like going back to my original video you
will see like oh man I was like trying
to be something that I wasn't like I was
just like talking real slow you know
the planning out every word that I will
say and this this and that and then I
realize I'm like man that's not me you
know what I mean like I'm like how can I
say this I'm spontaneous I'm I'm one of
those people that you know you wake up
one day in a good movie like y'all we
going to the beach
yo we going to a party yo we going out
oh it's now just like laughing I'm lazy
today I'm chilling home and I mean like
I'm spontaneous that's why you know not
to bring it up that's what other girls
I've been with they always love that
 about me you know I mean like I'm
always I'm never the same person every
single day every day I'm a different
person and like I just get up and
however I feel that's how I react and
that's what I do throughout the day when
I come here to YouTube I come I
literally wake up and be like oh cool
something happened to me I'm not okay
cool let me talk about that something
happen at work I'm gonna I'll quit cool
I'm gonna make a video about that junior
developer ask me a questions about let's
say a programming languages and how long
it's gonna take him to be able to learn
everything I'm not all cool that's a
good topic so I'm gonna talk about that
all right
most of the youtubers and this is not
just in the web development game this is
everywhere there's a lot of false
positive 'ti there's you know like
people be having a horrible day but
they'll be smiling all day like yeah
like we're having a great day like now
that's not me
you know what I mean like I come in I
give you
exactly how are you you know when I
curse it sucks that I can't curse no on
youtube if now then I don't get no no
ads no nothing so I'm gonna start
cursing but on my website half ma you
know quote-unquote the realness the real
Joe is now that it's realness because
old man deserving kid and you know like
oh man how you were saying you said
something like like I'm like you know I
was like the little bird in the cage a
little monkey in a cage and you know oh
look at the monkey you make tricks and
you know that's great that's real no
it's not really like that man it's more
of like I get to express myself how I am
with my friends because that was the
whole idea of this thing man
everybody that comes to YouTube they
talk like robots man and I'm telling you
right now this people do not talk like
that when me and you or like let's say I
mean you talk to one of these guys they
don't talk like that
there's no way nobody talks like a robot
like hi this is nobody talks like that
you know what I mean so they can do that
I didn't want to do that I was like man
I'm just gonna come in be just who I I'm
not expecting for this channel to grow
this channel was not supposed to grow
man you know I mean like people like me
it's not supposed to be on camera and
you know doing everything that I do or
my little antics and you know handle
with the sauce and the head with the
little Aussie you know what I mean like
I'm not supposed to be on camera doing
web development doing all this stuff I'm
not you know what I mean like people
come here and they're like man who is
this kid like you don't worry you don't
understand like in the web development
community like I have a lot of respect a
lot of people that know me they have a
lot of respect for me because they know
what I do
you know like I'm not some beginning of
some guy that just started yesterday
I've been doing this for a while and
I'll keep my name out there because I
like people to know my name and remember
who I am because that's how you build up
a brand right now the same time there
are
a couple of people who just don't like
it they just hate it they're like we're
not supposed to be like that you're not
supposed to be developers who talk how
they talk to their friends we're
supposed to be to a higher standard and
and act a certain way and like now man
this is YouTube you know like this is
YouTube I do a whole different have
my job I'm a job I'm completely
different you know but this is YouTube
this is my personal space I do whatever
the hell I want you know what I mean
like I come here swag it out head on
with it you know like I just have fun
man you know what I mean so when people
come here man and they be like man I
love the realness from him it's not
because I cursed it's because I'm just
myself and I'm also talking to people
exactly how their friends will talk to
you know like even you said on a video
that pretty much you've had friends like
me right and that's the idea behind it
that I'm supposed to remind you of one
of your friends because I am one of your
friends you know what I mean like I am
it's like your buddy came through is
like your son I'm gonna become a web
developer you know what I mean like
that's exactly how your friend is gonna
talk to you he's not gonna come into
your life hi tightest of them yeah I
believe that I'm switching my career no
he's not gonna come to you like that
he's gonna be like yellow Sun I just
found my way and basically I didn't did
it again I found some you know I found
the cheat codes you know they're gonna
hit you with that right that's how your
friends is gonna talk to you you know I
mean some people's friends I gotta talk
to them like that because they're not
from the same place that I am you know
what I mean but that's fine but they
gotta talk to them in a way that it's
just fluent and just normal you know and
as far as like me coming in you know how
you saying like if I was to structure
more my content my videos yeah I could
do that I could actually come in even
edit the videos creative really really
good
I'm actually really good at this man I
could go and do that but then it
wouldn't be fun
then there'll be a job and that's the
thing I don't treat this as a job I
don't treat this as a business I don't
come here and be like oh man this I have
to treat this like a business in the
sense of I gotta be fake I gotta edit
everything now this times I study this
times that the words don't come out this
times that my accent is freaking me out
no it's like swag me the sauce is coming
out the post you know what I mean like
it happens
am I gonna edit it out no cuz then I'm
treating it like a job I don't wanna
treat this like a job I want to treat
this ass like yo I'm hanging out with my
friends making videos for my friends
that's at the moment that I'm doing it
like a job I'm not gonna be hearing good
you know because then I would be like oh
my god this is so boring
you know so when people say oh man they
love me because I'm real it's not just
because I curse it's not just because I
might come in it you know hit them with
a little dive it's not not like they
here to see hey let's see the monkey
move around we throw a banana at him
nah man you know they here because they
just identify themselves with me you
know that identify with somebody who
came from the bottom you know a lot of
those people you know if you hear their
stories they won't they won't even tell
you their stories man you know what I
mean like allows people they don't even
tell you those stories like I had a
friend of mine where he was telling me
he's like man he's really good you know
he's a good guy he think it's really
good that you know how Latinos and
African Americans are coming into the
you know the industry and you know it's
like no it shows that it's not a race
thing I'm like I don't think it's a mean
that cuz I don't think it's not it's not
a curse is not a race thing it's more of
like people have more opportunities you
know what I mean like if you grow up
with both your parents and both your
parents are both professionals and they
both went to college and you know like
how many people
you know I really hate when I see this
this is like a perfect example I hate
what I see like on TV and they'll be
like an african-american care of African
American girl or a young Mexican kid
who'd be like I'm the first kid and my
family graduating from high school you
know how crazy that sounds like it
really is really my stuff because in
reality what that tells me is like you
know their parents didn't have no
opportunities now this case barely
getting any opportunity and like he's
like supposed to be like a the trophy of
the the family you know me now while
other people's their parents is like you
know professionals teachers accountants
are doctors so it's like they got the
opportunity to go to good schools they
got the opportunity to do all this stuff
so it's like there's a lot of people out
here just like me who didn't have that
stuff right we didn't have no two
parents who didn't have no parents
helping us I wouldn't have no
opportunities to really go to college
now yeah you're gonna go to a four-year
school and we're gonna take care of your
tuition okay no we didn't have none of
that stuff all right so that's what
people find that my channel is real and
that's what they you know they connect
to it and it's not just black Latinos
and minorities that come to my channel
it's a lot of other races and a lot of
people that come here you know because
they go to the same thing a lot of times
is now about race it's more about
classism you know what I mean like
people come in they have no
opportunities and it passes down to
their kids and it continues on so I feel
like here and web development there's a
way to break the cycle like right now
let's say an example yeah and I don't
know your history but let's say your
father worked for I don't know he worked
for coca-cola all right
that's a truck driver right then now you
graduate and now you're working for UPS
that's the first job next thing you know
you're there whatever working there for
like two three years now a reality that
almost year your your future your job
that's what most likely people gonna get
stuck at but what if we broke that cycle
we say hey we're doing what the runner
hey we're doing technology where you
have an opportunity to break the cycle
of working those you know those BS jobs
out there right and then you say hey how
can we get this kid to start earning a
lot of money out here so then that can
trickle down to the community right
instead of us working those BS jobs how
about we just work on something that's
gonna make us a lot of money so then we
could send our kids to good or good
schools private schools and and the
whole nine you know what I mean like
that's what people like my channel
that's what my channel is real it's not
just because I come in and I hit them
with a dab or just a hit them with it
they identify with that because me you
and a lot of people from here we're from
a different generation we're not
supposed to come here and be robots just
because we're talking about technology
we're not because then that's that's
what makes it boring you know the kids
started coming up like one of my dreams
is to really make you know me like two
three nice videos legit videos and put
it on worldstar right now because I want
to be like a rapper or be famous it's
because I want to show to other kids
that coming up that can identify with me
and be like yeah I like this guy he
talks like me he he does like me he he's
young like me he likes the same music as
me
and he's making money on what I happen
to sell drugs without having to be a a
basketball player football player what I
haven't so do anything that's illegal in
this world they see this as a extra
Avenue for them to you know change their
lives you know that's why I'm here
that's why I'm real that's what makes me
real you know and that's why I'm just
here to doing that you know what I mean
like if you look at all my videos from
the beginning and I used to be given out
up to two hundred three hundred dollars
a month of free courses like udemy I
used to pay for it for people to come in
and it wasn't like a marketing scheme
almost friends so hungry every love and
more people are gonna come in no it was
more like hey I just want to help out
people because I know what it did for me
so I know what I can do for other people
I want everybody to be loving good man
that's the reality of things I don't
want nobody to be out he broke I don't
want nobody gone through the things that
I went through like I don't want younger
kids like 14 15 years old that they have
an idea of and actually to do or
something and they're like oh man I
can't do this because this is for only
XYZ people could do it nah anybody can
do it if I can do it you know one thing
that take pride of is like you know when
the could be me I like you know some a
lot of guys who were like college you
know guys super freaking gradually from
XYZ University and and whatever and
they're like oh man this guy this guy is
this like before this guys it's
everything that's not supposed to be
with computer science and what
development and programming boy are they
wrong like don't even know what the hell
they're talking about like you know what
I mean like I know they they get pissed
off will they see me but that's fine
because what I'm doing is I'm changing a
lot of stuff I'm bringing more girls
into this thing like there's no other
channel no other channel where as many
girls that come to this this channel as
as much as me no girls like they have no
girls girls are not even interested to
go over it right you know I have to
definitely the minorities that come to
my channel and at the same time I'm
bringing everybody in and and I have
like a whole bunch of other races and
tell me about that it's more about like
people just enjoy the channel man you
know what I mean like I'm here for a
reason
and like sometimes yeah I come in
yeah I'm supposed to talk about one
topic I talk about five different topics
in that video but that's because that's
how I am that's what you're gonna get
from me you know what I mean
like that is the realness that is the
realness that I don't edit those things
out like right now I just put in this
video out to the world I'm not gonna
edit it out here back you are you know
like you know what it is to living in a
one-bedroom apartment with you two
sisters your mom and I'm here I'm
chilling I'm like this you know what I
mean like what development distance for
me you know it's like I'm chilling and
I'm about to buy a new house but I'm
good
so it's like I feel like everybody
should be doing this if you have this
type of opportunities come on man like
my boy just the other day but boy drew
like bro what you doing like he he was
the first once we have like money out of
all of us but he used to hustle right
now he don't have nothing because I
don't know I guess his connect is drying
something
I broke you know first once since I 18
19 years old with a car it had a you
know had a nice would like a 19 that was
broke back then but somehow the tables
turned at the end right and I'm like bro
now he wants to do what I'm doing
you know saying like that's the realness
of this channel man now people identify
with this man so you know don't think
don't think like this is fake this is
I'm doing extra nah yo I want to hang
out with people I want people to hang
out with me like literally you know get
to know how I am like you coax anybody
that knows me but this exactly how I am
24/7 you know what I mean and I really

want to respond to everybody even its
positive negative this video that this
