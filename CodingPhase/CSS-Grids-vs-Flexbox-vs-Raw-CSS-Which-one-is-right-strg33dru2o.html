back out of the game man coding face.com
listen your boys backing out and did it
again alright guys today was all about a
topic that came up yesterday on the live
podcast right he came up yesterday and
it was about you know which one should I
use should I use CSS grids should I use
divs and sections to basics play out my
whole website or should I do it through
CSS grid and of course you use something
else I can strap foundation in our
whatever framework is out there to build
the whole page right now what I would
say is it really doesn't matter what
really matters is was it target audience
you know sometimes we we see things
online that are pretty cool like
sometimes I see CSS braids but I see
people do some cool stuff with Flex
boxes but the problem is it depends of
what companies you work
you know because sometimes if you need
to hike all is like if you need to be
creating websites for people that use
Internet Explorer right or it's an older
audience that might still have like
Windows 7 or Windows XP or something
right
there's a audience that's pretty old
audience and you're going to most likely
have to use you know the oscar way of
building layout which is what the divs
or sections or you know just setting up
your waves that's the old-school way
right now the most modern ways are flex
boxes and CSS grades right but my advice
to people is not to focus a lot on flex
boxes in the sense of like we're not
like people be like oh I want to only
build everything with flex box my
Spartans are really good for for the
right moment the right occasion
you can use it for heiresses there are
situations you know under the Sun you
know some people I've seen this data
where people don't know how to build
something with Dave's or they don't know
how to calculate you know how much is
five columns they don't know how to
calculate right I don't know how to
calculate 20 times a hive and also
basically you say all you know I'm just
going to use split boxes and I'm going
to build it but what happens when you
can't use like one okay
my advice will be learn how to do it the
whole story which is really the way of
knowing HTML CSS make sure you master
that they're from their jumps of
something like micron so whenever it is
possible that you could use it then you
use
you work for a company like super long
now I can't say enough works because I
don't think Netflix uses flex bonds
because their audiences so why you know
just responses but let's say an example
you're working for a digital agency that
you know their target audience is you
know people with brand-new computers the
latest Chrome the latest Safari delay
the latest Firefox right if you are in
that situation then yeah go ahead you
see insects with loose likes boxes lose
what I was alone you know but you always
got to know who is the target audience
is the worst part is when you fill
something and then somebody comes in
your blind
oh but this doesn't work in IE you
know I ate I eat nine or eleven
nice to have to go over it and actually
start redoing everything they can say
before or start looking for fullbacks
and a whole bunch of
that's like the worst feels like now you
do a double work
so that's my advice to you guys does
make sure you find out which was the
target audience and then choose nobody's
going to tell you all this to the right
or the wrong one because as long as it
looks like the design that somebody you
know gained you're going to be fine now
if it doesn't look like the design then
you have a problem
mm I'll see you guys later Rishi spear
all right kid</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
