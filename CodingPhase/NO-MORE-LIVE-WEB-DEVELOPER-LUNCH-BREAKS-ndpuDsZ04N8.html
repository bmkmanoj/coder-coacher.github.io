back at it again man : face calm
listening I'm not doing the web
developers lunch break today for a
reason because you know people been
complaining about hey the videos choppy
you throw in some very good points but
and your freakin videos is horrible
there's no service where you at where
the hell you live at Somalia like I'm
getting so many so many different
comments about it that you know what I
said you know what I'm gonna head in
with the camera now I'm gonna bring out
the camera there's a reason why I pay my
money for this camera you see that
little crispy a little crazy a little
swag him a little dab real quick handle
with a hit with the Losey real quick egg
like that don't you
but anyways man we out here man but I
just want to say for you guys are doing
the big store tutorial the next video
that I'm doing is going to basically
start teaching you guys about react and
redux and I know that people's gonna be
like oh man it feels like you're
skipping steps and there's a reason why
I am skipping steps because I'm not here
to teach you react and redux because
that takes a lot of time guys I'm being
honest I'm creating projects with you
and you be you basically following what
I'm doing and following the steps that
I'm I'm doing on this project but I'm
not going into the details of like let's
say the hours that it takes me to go and
set up react router and set up a whole
bunch of stuff not because I don't know
how to do it but because react router
has a new new version and a lot of stuff
that I've been using has been with the
old react route so what I'm doing is I'm
bringing in the new react router for you
guys and then from there what we gonna
do is what we learned in the last two
videos of component
and those two videos they're not gonna
match up exactly to what the next video
is going to be and when I say that is
we're going to actually delete some of
the stuff that we did on the last video
and then we're going to recreate them
with the new code that I'm giving you
guys and why am i doing that is because
I want to give you guys a fresh taste
the last video was just to give you a
little taste of what reactors and how to
break down components into HTML but
that's not how the project is going to
look at the end you know like cuz I
don't feel right now I'm in the air I
might use the react router to basically
change the pages or I might just use
laravel a routing system to basically
route the pages I got to see which one
would be the best for you guys but I
want to show it to you guys I'm going to
shoot so the react right away and I'm
going to show the laravel way right and
when I think that I are the way is you
know basically just showing you how to
render things with the server right as
again stuff showing things just with the
front end right routing the whole
components with the front end because
sometimes not every website is is better
off to have like a single page app you
know not every website is made to become
a single page app I think something like
Gmail something like Google Maps maybe
something like zillow.com on hot pads
calm those websites they work well being
a single page app but for a ecommerce
site to be completely as a single page
app I don't think that's the best way to
go right now
even air B&amp;amp;B does full single page apps
they what they do is basically is they
have their back-end rendering which is
done with Ruby on Rails and there from
there what they do is they have
different components throughout the
whole page that load up and I think
that's what I'm gonna do right so I was
just showing you guys how to basically
transfer your regular HTML into
JavaScript component but like I said
that might not be the only way that were
going to be seeing on this tutorial it's
just pretty much this whole Satori's
just to give you a little taste of
everything right of course if you want
to go more into a deeper tutorials and
like I always say man the courses is
right there those courses is the one
that taught me so if you want to go more
deeper into react listen nobody's better
than a seasoned rider I'm being honest
doesn't matter who's on YouTube who's
showing you whatever nobody breaks it
down as good as that guy alright so
that's what I want to tell you guys for
this what developers lunch break which
no longer is a web developer lunch break
I feel like because it's not live no
more man and I kind of missed it I kind
of miss uh you know talking to you guys
and seeing you guys out here live and
seeing your your comments and seeing
what you guys are saying cuz then I get
a feedback and then I get something back
you know we could go back and forth we
have to actually come up with new
content for you you know on the fly
freestyle a shit you know so you know
but people been complaining people would
be like hey man you need to get out
under that tree that you live on you
need to fucking join the city join 2017
you walking around with a Nokia phone
and like man I'm walking around with a
pretty expensive phone like it's a
galaxy boy you know like I'm good
Verizon got me all the thing is that for
whatever reason out here little island I
asked other people who have Verizon to
say yes sometimes the the hi question
the data is not like 1080p you know it's
not like 5g 4G
you know it's not like super fast speed
for whatever reason and I'm like man
what a fuck did they even sign me up for
this shit then you know I signed up for
this thing and specifically because I
wanted it to be fast right and I paid
the fucking premium for this shit
and you know I still didn't get the fast
speeds whatever you know I can't do
anything about it guys but you know
maybe I'll figure out a way so we could
actually do this together
of course should we see you guys live
through the get er messaging and like
like I always say guys make sure you you
know you you go on on gether
sign up register and join the community
man and yeah man I'll see you guys later
all right guys Wow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
