before the end of the fight I love
special guys take advantage take
advantage take advantage we're gonna let

that but somewhere in Europe basically
so let's find out exactly what courses
people are actually taking let's see
okay let me see what okay so there's the
HTML CSS HTML CSS all right let me see
what I saw the 1948 is definitely the
ones from HTML CSS I guess a lot of
people are I definitely taken that
course people are loving the HTML CSS
that's why people you know when you guys
were like flipping out you're like oh
man this courses are for beginners man
when you're gonna do the advanced and
it's like you gotta understand most of
the people are beginners you know it's
like I'm getting them you know it's like
I'm working them up to get them up there
you know what I mean
so people working on the list built
Instagram clone
what else people are working on let me
see this is the the people that live
right now right so we got 46 okay so let
me see this one
what else do you watching
okay people learning JavaScript they
learn in the JavaScript course that's
cool all right let me see what's the
other one what else people are watching
right now which one was this one 705 so
they're watching the JavaScript course
see which one is this one SAS you know
basically trying to learn some sass
right now that's what's up
you know I got a lot of people on the
website right now man this is like I
old-time like right now it's 11 o'clock
at night you know what I mean like
people are working or you know they're
working on my website so it's pretty
cool you know
now some numbers in there you know we
went up it's like we're going up in this
world you know it's not that much trust
me at all especially after you have to
pay taxes but we got a lot of people on
the website signing up man we killing
the game right now which it's the best
part just the fact that we have a lot of
people here coming onto the website you
know it's like think about it like this
guy's is the best deal out there you're
gonna get to learn everything that you
need and even if you wanted to keep this
like man this is like my extra resource
you know what I mean because I know a
lot of you guys are taking the web
developer boom camera are taking other
courses from from Stephen Grider and
that's great because when you you start
and you definitely need as much results
in and indifferent Reese
sources right you need definitely need
like a couple of different places you
know to get your fix that's how I call
it get your daily fix you know
let me see let's go to youtube live
events
let's check the chatroom see who's in
there we chose this lets check the live
control room let's see who's live right
now I know it takes a little a little
time to get everybody in here so that's
fine especially it's 11 o'clock on a
Tuesday I know a lot of you guys are
probably like sleeping and stuff my
buddy Joe snow bear what up Milo's what
up let me see who else is in here
aka 47 what up Freddy Martinez what up
let me see
Francisco come out yet Oh what up yeah
man like nice dreams man hopefully more
people come in and you know they
understand what I'm trying to do here
and enjoy it we got clay in here what up
clay FinTech what up how's my side
compared to something like team tree
house I mean it's in tree house the
whole thing about seeing tree houses
to me is like they have a great
community which is great I will say was
different it's just me you know because
in reality when you think about it if
you have
you know you take $100 right and you say
okay I'm gonna buy a bunch of courses
and you to me yeah you could get you
could get a lot of courses on udemy or
you could go to teen tree house and say
hey it's 20 25 dollars a month one team
treehouse and I'm gonna pay for three to
four months right with a hundred dollars
now right now you get an opportunity to
sign up to my website for five dollars
and what's the difference the difference
is that I'm the one teaching it you know
what I mean like this is not a big
company coming out of nowhere like all
guys we're gonna teach you HTML CSS you
know amazing animations and you know
great production no I'm here to just
pretty much get you guys up and running
as soon as possible without the BS I'm
not here to give you a history of who
created HTML and you know 1992 you don't
care about that what you care about is
building pages my goal here is to
basically get you to the point where
you're building websites you're ready to
start going to interviews you have stuff
on your projects on your portfolio and
you can say hey I built you know freakin
15 20 different projects I'm ready
hire me right and in the long term if
you think about it with $25 you pretty
much you paid what five months five
months of my website you good you know
45 hours will get you the whole year all
right the whole year for $45 and then
150 years lifetime right so it's all up
to you what you're gonna get from here
is real life experience real life
projects not just like hey let's do it
to do app in this really no reason to
make the tool and to do app you know
what I mean it's like my whole goal here
is not to be ting treehouse it's not to
be plural site it's not to be a you to
me my whole goal here is to come in
teaching my way of learning this stuff
because I was actually like you guys
there's a big difference between
somebody who's coming from a computer
science degree somebody who's coming
from a teaching degree somebody who's
coming from different places somebody
who learned on YouTube right somebody
who learned on YouTube might be able to
teach you how he learned on his own way
to finding things on YouTube and
searching online and searching Stack
Overflow doing this and that what I
bring to the table is pretty much I
teach you how I learned write these
things in web development that you don't
need to spend time on at all like I'm
telling you out of this five years that
I have in in this it's like this time
that you go take a course and they
teaching you so much stuff that you do
not need you're never going to use those
things so what do I do instead of me
coming in here and make you take a
course that's gonna be two hours of
introduction what I do is I say you know
what guys we're gonna go fast forward
through this as soon as we can and then
from there we're going to start working
on projects because you don't learn from
having somebody explain to you
hey why they build HTML you don't care
about that you don't care about who who
created it I mean of course if you care
about that you could Google that
yourself that information is out there
for free what you need is somebody to
guide you and learn how to build
websites and get a job as soon as
possible you know I mean like that's my
goal you know if you I would say like
this if your idea is to become like
let's say right now I'm creating an ojs
course if your idea is to say hey I know
every single thing under the Sun that is
about nodejs I would say my site is not
for you right and I will say that
because
I'm basically getting you to the point
where you're gonna be able to get hired
there's things that no matter what
you're only going to learn at the job at
the situation let's say somebody comes
in to you and tells you hey we need you
to build an API that connects to
basically an iOS app and then on top of
that we need you to connect that to NASA
right like you know to me like there's
so many different situations that in
reality I can't come in and create those
situations for you those things you're
gonna learn it on the job what I'm going
to teach you is everything that you need
to get that job right when you get a job
and you go to an interview and you're
there they're not looking for somebody
to say hey you're supposed to be a
master of everything know which you're
supposed to be is dangerous with every
type of technology that's out there
pretty much you know and when I say
danger is just pretty much being able to
come here and be able to say hey
somebody comes to you and tells you hey
Francisco Francisco come in we need you
to create a basically a back-end for our
invoice system with what I'm teaching
you you're gonna be able to do that
you're gonna be able to know the
databases you kind of definitely know
the front-end the more most of the
things on my website right now currently
are focused on the front end and that's
because I noticed that so many people
the people are finding me they're coming
from zero they're not coming from you
know guys who are already developers
guys who are working in companies know
the people that come to me my audience
about 85% are people who are coming from
zero meaning they don't know HTML they
don't know CSS they don't know anything
they don't know what's the the process
to get a job they don't know what it is
to go to an interview they're still
learning they just got the the urge of
like man I want to learn this but they
don't know what's the steps that they
got a door
what is the projects that they have to
take you know I'll get emails all the
time where people tell me hey Joe thank
you for the web developer bootcamp I
really appreciate it it's a great course
but what projects do I do now you know
it's like then that's when I come in and
I say you know what let's build those
projects let's build the projects that
are gonna get you that job you know cuz
you could take of course HTML CSS all
other stuff you can learn anywhere but
what I'm bringing to the table is the
fact that I did it by myself I became
successful I got into a lot of companies
I'm pretty much proficient on almost
anything that's on the web right now
like that's what I want to get you guys
to that point you know what I mean
and then save you the time of what I had
to go through I had to do the research I
had to find the right courses I had to
go through you know different BS jobs
there were things that I didn't even
know when I started that really slowed
down my my growth now because I
basically went through all of that it's
like there's a line where jay-z said
something where's that line i'ma tell
you right now I said something like yeah
let me see I will tell you right now
it's a very good line so very very good
line he say hole his back right I'm a
speaking I'm not gonna wrap him but
there's a very good line he said Havas
back life stories told to rap niggas
acting like I saw you crack like I told
you sell drugs no holes did that so
hopefully you won't have to go through
that you know what I mean like that's
the same thing that is
going on here like all the things that I
had to go through you shouldn't go
through it because I'm telling you what
to do and not to do you know what I mean
so that's what my website I feel like
it's valuable at like I'm not gonna tell
you hey man spend time learning a whole
bunch of stuff that you don't need like
you're a junior developer right there's
gonna be more advanced courses as we go
on because think about it like this once
I finish the the beginner course is
which 85% of you guys get to enjoy and
learn on those things then there's
intermediate courses right the course is
worse I okay now you're in your first
you know your first two third year all
right you're a dirt to fifth year in a
buff we're talking about advanced stuff
like this is something that people don't
understand when you are brand new
developer you're not gonna get those
advanced things at first I don't know
people are not gonna trust you you only
have a year you only have two years I
don't trust you you know what I mean so
it's like I saw this kid who was like
trying to learn everything about you
know like : golang is great but the same
time it's like man you're a junior
developer you're not getting hired as as
a : developer right at all that's the
truth you're not gonna get hired as a
goal end developer people want to see
that you have at least five years
working in companies where you proved
yourself before you even touch a golang
system right now I'm gonna create a
course on it which is gonna be for the
people who are advanced you know I have
a good 15 percent of the people here who
are on a level where they could they
could take a course like that but you
know for guys who are coming in is like
I just learned HTML CSS how the hell you
gotta jump into that you know what I
mean and it's like some people someone
asks me to like what do I think about
Ruby on Rails as a mine that's his first
back-end framework and I was like man
that's great because you're gonna learn
all the fundamentals there and it's
gonna be easier for you to understand
now another kid came to me it's like man
Joe what do you think I'm trying to get
into Scala and I'm trying to get into a
Hadoop and then I accent damn how long
you bring in the game he's like now I
just started wait what you're trying to
get into Scala you try to get into
Hadoop you just started so you're pretty
much saying hey I'm gonna skip all the
steps and go ahead and try to learn
something that's advanced and when you
try to learn something advanced and
you're not ready for it you shut down
you basically be like oh man this is so
hard what development so hard
programming so hard it's like nobody you
just basically skipped a whole bunch of
things you skipped a whole bunch of
years like this takes time
this is not something like you get up
one day but I okay cool you know I'm
gonna start flying around and in
airplanes it's like you're you're riding
in a simulator in your house and you're
like you know what guys I think I could
go and fly a plane no you need to have
like 10,000 hours before they give you
the license you know what let me see let
me find out how many hours the game fly
right license okay okay mom of 40 hours
right to get the license right now forty
hours in the air is a lot because it
says here the most that people get to do
is 20 minutes in the air so if you get
40 hours you're good and now 40 hours is
to get the license for yourself like if
they're like okay you want to go up
there you want to get yourself a plane
you want to go up there if you kill
yourself that's on you
right we're not responsible for you but
for you to go and try to you know
commercial pilot but let's come over to
me fits in hunt within a year or two so
that's a lot of kids
let me see 1500 1500 hours
alright times now 1500 hours /
our belief is / you need a minimum of 50
days in the air that math sounds crazy
you need to be have at least 50 50
flights that's kind of crazy
now let's say / let's say an example if
you drive flying from new york to dr how
many flights you need to find you need
to fly at least 500 times from New York
to Dominican Republic to be able to get
your your license for commercial
airlines meaning in reality is like it's
gonna take you forever you're gonna have
like 10 years to be able to to get that
right now this is the same thing is web
development of course it's not gonna
take you 10 years but is you gotta put
in the hours you can't just skip
everything man you know and that's why I
tell you guys like for my site right now
you take advantage take that that chance
man take the chance of signing up follow
follow the website the next 3-4 months
in 3-4 months you know maximum you could
probably do even less if you really like
myself you
working your you're not going to school
or something like that you could do it
full-time in a month you could go in and
become proficient and start applying to
jobs right now of course you gotta have
two projects which is where it comes in
until you have to also do other courses
which are gonna give you the projects or
create it on your own you know what I
mean so there from there you can start
applying to jobs after you get the job
learning doesn't stop there because
you're just a junior developer they just
trust you right so that moment when they
trust you in that I okay cool doesn't
mean that you're gonna be like okay cool
thank you Joe thank you coding face
never coming back no this is when the
ground time comes in and you be like
okay now they teach you and they want me
to start doing databases so you should
come back here and start doing the
database course you should come back and
start doing like something like laravel
because the easiest world for you is to
get hired as a junior front-end
developer basically creating small pages
if you take the learn HTML CSS by
building a Facebook clone course which
is like the social media call are you
pretty much good you could start doing
HTML CSS after that course now it's up
to you do you really just stop there or
say hey I just got hired but now I want
to continue take the other courses you
pay four dollars you know what I mean
like that's what I'm telling you guys
this countdown is good because this I
can remind us I got a good wake-up call
for everybody it's like okay everywhere
else you're gonna have to pay $25 and
that's it right then from there you go
anywhere else you want to take a course
on every single course you got a spread
I made them about twelve dollars right
but what if you get every course and
everything that's there everything that
you're gonna need in your career
as a developer of course you gotta do
some research there might be other stuff
because that isn't possible for me to
have everything under the Sun you know
but like every fundamental every single
thing that you might need is gonna be
here I thought I was you know what I
mean like it's a no-brainer doesn't it
doesn't make sense you know the people
from you to me telling me like yo it
this doesn't make sense
you're pretty much losing money but at
the same time this is my gift to you
guys because it doesn't really matter
you know what I mean like it doesn't
matter cuz I'm gonna do this courses
anyways I'm gonna get it out for you
guys anyways and you know what's cool
man um today man where is it let me see
where is it oh I was gonna do a video
about this but maybe I just talk about
it here oh let me see where is it okay
hold on
let me share this screen with you guys
which this is amazing to me right
remember I told you guys to start
learning hyper app right I told you guys
that I'm gonna make a video about this
but I'm gonna tell you guys see you in
the lab soon cuz most people don't get
to see the full nice livestream anyways
but basically let me share my screen now
hyper app is becoming very popular like
very popular right now I was so
surprised today I signed up for
different different websites that have
like you know news about certain things
that are happening in the industry and
then basically I come in and I see on
echo Jas that they have this article
about introduction to hyper half GS and
we're all cool man let me check it out
who who dis something so I'm reading
this thing and then I'm breathing I'm
reading and then
next thing I know I'm like oh this is
cool okay resources I'm like I myself
like to see some new stuff from from you
know from hyper app I want to see what
people are making and then I find myself
I'm like wait wait wait the first
information in for the first informative
video series by Joe Santos Garcia from
coding phase yo that is crazy
now mind you this is on the website that
a lot of people check out like a lot of
people in the industry so you know my
name is getting out there and I'm not
saying like oh I'm trying to be popular
I'm trying to be famous no it's just the
fact that I did this out of love because
I love this framework a lot of you guys
don't believe in it yet
but I'm telling you 2018 when you start
hearing this even more and more and more
remember who was the first that you
heard it from right now I don't know can
you guys see this cool I think yeah I
think you guys could see this so yeah so
you got your boy out here hyperope Jay
is getting started with hi perhaps yes
Wow so let's just read what it says this
is really good
while I what I will do plan on writing a
post with so various code snippets
demonstrating some some of the capital
capabilities capabilities of hyperope GS
I need glasses guys by the way when you
guys start seeing me like oh he carried
no it's I need glasses um I wanted to
show I wanted to share two very good
free learning resources that you can get
you can use to get yourself familiar
with it the first and informative video
series by Joe Santos Garcia from coding
phase right this is so dope got my video
there right and then there's a great
step-by-step course that includes
setting up your environment while also
teaching about state actions and
immutability now Joe also makes this
course quite accessible to a wide range
of developers with clear concise
breakdowns and explanations yes this guy
he
understands me because I was like
watching thus the the tutorial in the
series and I was like man as an
experienced developer I can explain this
even better right and I know I can
explain it better than that right but
what I did what I did for a how you call
it for Hyper AB GS is I broke it down in
a way where one of you guys that have
never done JavaScript I have never
understood JavaScript right you can come
in and learn hi perhaps yes just by
listening to what I'm showing you guys
like I give you an example of state I
show you how Zillow works how state
management works how immutability works
you know in simple terms now I will say
this to you guys if you want somebody
like super duper technical this is a
great channel called fun fun function
right but fun fun function is an amazing
channel but fun fun function to me is
for an experienced developer that's a
channel that I will go there myself to
check out stuff and he says things to me
that I'm amazed I'll be like damn that's
dope
but me in you know 2012 in June 2012
when I started this if I go to fun fun
function I'll be like wait what like
this guy's talking to me another
language like his you know talking about
theories and talking about how you know
how deep functions go how deep objects
go and it's like wait why like this is
too deep for me you know what I mean
like I'm not ready for that right and I
think that's what makes this website so
good because I make this for the people
that just are beginners people who are
are basically have no idea what's going
on with web development and even for the
people that do have an idea I just break
it down in a way where if you already
know
you know a lot of web development you
come in you take one of my choices you
like oh sure he just broke it down what
this other guy showed me in two hours
how the hell did he do it in five
minutes in a five-minute video you know
what I mean like it makes sense that's
what's different about my website sorry
I went into this whole big rant of it
but it's just I want to explain it to
you guys and show you with with details
you know what I mean like this is pretty
cool I think this is dope like you know
it's like people are referencing my
videos you know talking about hyper fgs
and you know this is just the beginning
guys like I'll tell you guys like this
is my thank you to you guys this website
because you guys believed in me you guys
really in your reality gave me the
motivation to do this like you know
who's gonna come in and be like hey
you're making $100,000 plus you know and
then you're like hey you know what go
quit your job in and take a you know a
leap of faith most people won't do that
but ya gave me the motivation to
basically say you know what there is a
niche out there for me there is a group
of people that can help out take them to
the next level you know it's like a year
two years from now you might be like man
I'm gonna an advanced level now it's
like Joe's Channel now I might be able
to be ready to move on to something you
know more events then that's on you you
know what I mean you know you there's
always gonna be growth and that's what
makes it beautiful you know it's like
the same thing for me the places that I
was looking for resources in the
beginning are no longer are good for me
because I've already outgrown those
people but the beauty of this website
for me is that I just want you guys to
be able to have all the courses or the
beginner courses that's gonna take you
to the next level and become a developer
so then I myself can start making
more advanced courses I can't jump into
advanced courses until I get you guys my
main audience to an advanced level you
know what I mean like I want to bring
you guys with him to the next level I
don't want to say hey man cuz I saw it
on my website on my channel I started
putting in more advanced things in there
and nobody watched it there's like a
hundred views forty views because
everybody's like man I'm not up to that
level so what can I do
create this platform for you guys make
sure you guys get jobs make sure that
you guys get get hired and take you to
the next level right so I myself can now
go and they start teaching you guys more
advanced stuff and now you guys can be
like okay cool I get it now cuz we
already went through the whole the whole
foundation you know so that's what we at
right now kids listen any messages any
comments you guys want to leave go ahead
put it there I'm about to start reading
in the comments right now yes man Finn
seconds I kill yo bring crystal link to
life man promote crystal I want to bro I
really do I really do I really wanna
look I even started this how much like
not power in me but power in you guys
that you guys have that we basically I
created the the rocky stack right in
reality that's more of an advanced topic
alright
but somehow we got it trending on github
you know I got a trending on github with
you guys you know it's like it's like
thanks to you guys we got it up there
you know what I mean
I stopped messing around with Crystal
Lake for a while until I get to grow the
audience and and grow you guys to the
next level take you guys to the next
level and be like okay now they ready
for Crystal Lake because nobody was
doing the tutorial
everybody's like there were people
sending you messages like yo I don't
even know how to use the terminal and
you showing me stuff
how can I do it I want to follow you Joe
but I can't you know what I mean so it's
like I think right now we're in in a
very special moment in the community of
development right we're in a very
special moment right now a special time
in history where I feel I myself and
bringing in more minorities I'm myself
bringing in more females into the game
and you know it's not even to sound
cocky or anything but it's true I'm
making it I have people that hit me up
and they're like y'all seeing him up
there seeing how he's done it motivated
me to do it you know that's what people
are telling me you know I was like now
me going to two different hair colors
there for meetups and different places
that I'm planning on going and next
month is gonna be even better because
then now I'm gonna be in a different
audience right not only do we have you
know the people who are just beginning
but also we're gonna get the all the
other audience of like you know mid
levels to see any level developers you
know the people that that come from I
say a lot of people who who watch Chris
Hawkes a lot of those guys are not
beginners a lot of those guys they
already experienced right that's not the
same audience that I have right so now
with all the things that I'm doing I'm
gonna merge both whereas I hate we have
two new developers we have this new
community that's coming in we have new
more minorities in in the industry and
just the fact that people are gonna be
able to say yo like he did it I could do
it you know what I mean like that's all
I want
so that's what we're doing man
let me see I gotta go back to the
beginning to see everybody's questions
and messages me see let me see let me
see what was in here
yeah man I hope that I keep motivating
you you know I keep motivating you no no
dad I hope that you you know you get in
the game man get that job and then you
know you have about other people's you
know what I mean let me see public
service announcement okay Joe put out
some view stuff I need to put put the
finishing touches of my knowledge yeah I
don't know man I don't think I'm gonna
do some view man am I like I said if
anything I'm gonna jump too straight
hyper app I'm gonna skip this one
okay I'll skipping this one guys I'm not
not doing no no view it's boring to me
let me see what else I see functional
programming is life if you love
functional programming man check out
hyper ABS yes man for sure
hey Jay I just borrowed my professors
MacBook so I could use a real terminal
yeah man
you gotta you gotta get on this man
doing no course yes I'm doing a note
course as you can see you can check it
out on my website is there I just
started this week until that genius
Harry Potter red Mile is is like yeah
that's guts man when you say you left
your job I was the one who got exciting
yeah man
listen I wasn't worried about it I was
like y'all I told you guys for months
man I wanted to leave in ma or March
around if it wasn't because my other
partner he's like oh man stay here stay
here this and that I would have left a
long time trust me guys I had a lot of
good opportunities of like different
companies hanging me up like yo we want
you to work here this isn't that you
know let's see what happens you know
still a lot of people that want me to
work in their company but I'm taking
this risk I'm taking this Rick's to
basically teach online help people out
I'm also gonna do a you know like a high
school is a tutoring program which is
pretty much people who are having issues
you pretty much came booked me for an
hour and I'll go in with you you know
for the full hour meaning you will knock
out a couple of things a couple of
projects together or or whatever you are
actually stuck at I mean I've been doing
this for a while I did it with
I think about seven people this another
youtuber as well
now youtuber subscriber his name is
Jerry he could attest to it I helped him
up a couple of times he's definitely you
know I feel like I helped him out take
them to the next level you know so he
could attest to to my skills to help him
out then I got a couple of other people
that I know that help them out and they
they basically got jobs now so they good
you know so it works I know you don't
talk about Python but do you know a good
channel for Python Chris hooks he's the
one that talks about Python like I think
his channel is it's all about Python so
you could check him out yeah man those
udemy courses man for Python they they
always there man yeah for sure man yeah
Derrick banners got bananas Derrick
bananas their bananas got a good Python
series so so he's doing pretty good so
but the problem with Python man Python
is so big and so large man like that's
like one of those languages that there's
really no ending to it like you could
create a course but in reality what what
is it that you're teaching you know what
I mean cuz there Python so big'uns and
it can be used for so many different
things it's like what what do you focus
on do you focus on machine learning do
you focus on big data do you focus on
image manipulation do you focus on man
there's so much things
a Python that you can do with it like
it's hard plus the fact that it's hard
for people to get jobs doing Python like
you know what I mean
Johan
for your our sessions I don't even know
I just I don't know how much I charge
I've charged people different prices
like depending on the person like if I
if you tell me like what's going on and
I know it's something super easy I might
just do it for super cheap a price that
you you will be surprised at you know
what I mean but I don't know it all
depends on what it is you know what I
mean like if it was like something super
complicated where we're gonna be there
going back and forth friend and try to
get this problem done then yeah you know
what I mean
might be a lot but it all depends on the
project whatever it is but I don't know
yet I might just set it a set price I
don't know I just throwing it in the air
because there's a big difference you
know it's like doing like tutoring like
a one-hour tutoring it has to be for a
specific thing like let's say you're
having issues with CSS then we just
focus on CSS the whole one hour you know
to get you good get you to understand
the thing start completely messing you
up now if it was like JavaScript then
JavaScript it has to be a specific
problem in JavaScript because you can
just go in in one hour of tutoring be
like hey guys I'm gonna make you a a
master in JavaScript in one hour like it
doesn't make sense it has to be like
something like listening you trying to
understand promises or are you trying to
understand you're trying to understand
like how to do you know like no Jes how
to do authentication with nodejs or
something that's you know kicking your
butt and you're like man I can't get
this topic I can't get this thing then
we spend a whole hour breaking it down
just on that topic you know like that
I don't know if I don't think he's doing
Python development I don't think so he's
doing like react because react is hot
right now kids you know what I mean so I
don't think that that he's actually
doing Python from what I'm from my
understanding Chris Hawkes has never
been hired as a Python developer but
it's because also to is like I said is
very hard to get hired as a Python
developer like you can't just be some
dude I just you you know you went to
team treehouse and learn Python like
that's the lie that people be telling
people like that's why I don't focus on
Python because I want you guys to get a
job if I tell you guys hey let's focus
on Python Python in school but Python is
like game development
I love game development but am I gonna
focus everything on it no I'm gonna
focus everything on it because my goal
is to get you guys working you know I
mean
we act we react create app it's the same
thing that I have for my react starter
kit
it's just hey focus on unlearning react
without having to focus on on building
you know like a task management you know
how you call this dealing with wet pack
like you don't have to deal with that
all you have to worry about is just cold
that's it
how much JavaScript are you putting up
in the course I mean look at my website
take a second to go look at my website
yeah
clever programmer clever programmer yeah
don't mess with that kid yeah don't
really mess with that kid at all but the
thing about his audience is different
though his audience is a lot of people
who are going to college you know a lot
of college students that goes to him but
it's like he's like a tutor but the
problem with it to me is it's this one
of my biggest problem very simple how
can you teach somebody something if
you've never worked in the industry
there's no company that has hired you as
a developer like you know Python as what
as Python from high colas like from
school learning it from school learning
on your own but you've never worked as a
Python developer and that's where to me
is like wait what like how can you teach
it if you've never taught it that
reminds me of like this teacher that I
had in college back in my college days I
was taking a once I was like graduating
from
communication design I was doing my
bachelor's there was a teacher who was
teaching me HTML one order and then I
look at her website and her website
looks like shit and now I'm like wait
how can this person teach me when I'm
teaching her like there will be
something like no lie I will be in court
in the class I would like you like do
you know you could do this do you know
about html5 you know that this came out
now like you don't have to
she had like so many different
old-school things in it and I was like
man nobody codes like this no more and
she's like well I'm the teacher and this
and Di's like yeah but you're not
teaching them listen James I'll be
honest with you if you want to look if
you want to get a job if you're doing it
for yourself that's a big difference I
don't know if you want to put your
business out there James but it's up to
you are you looking for a job for now
then Python is definitely not the place
because in Python number one the people
that are hiring for Python they really
want somebody would have computer
science degree right now if you don't
have a computer science degree what you
could do is basically say hey I have
three four years of experience of
back-end development in other languages
right and you show them the projects
that you've done in Python so now the
person be like oh this person actually
is a back-end developer and he's done
personal projects in Python then you
could get hired but as a junior
developer somebody who hasn't no
computer science degree you're not gonna
get hired or some math degree of some
sort just how FinTech said you're not
gonna get hired that's just how it is
man
that's the that's the sad part about it
because Python is amazing but you know
chit chit chit chit chit
let me see man I wanna check out see my
area I was supposed to go to a meet-up
this week but I got lazy let me check on
my area see I mean like in today's
meetups
