coding freeze calm your boy is backing
out and did it again somehow all right
so today topic is why do you have to be
so politically correct all the time that
should be a t-shirt but yeah
like sometimes people create this list
that catches your attention right click
be super click be right it's a go p--
versus grunt versus web pack tools and
task runners which technology is better
it's the fire of the century
sorry for the noise but yeah so you
thinking is gonna be like a deaf match
and you're like oh man I'm see blood out
here I'm gonna see people you know come
in go hard and be like grunts gotta you
know the freaking pig freakin go gotta
the freakin go poo soda you know and
webpack got the little rubik's cube and
they both well all three of them's gonna
fight each other to the death or
something I don't know
are you expecting something great but I
have to reading the whole article you're
like wait you're pretty much giving me
all the things that are inside of the
documentation which I already know all
right you giving me information about
three technologies that are pretty much
well known out there you're not sharing
your opinion um you're not giving me
anything new about them any new
perspective you're not sharing your own
opinion on it so why the hell did you
bring me to this website this is how
I'll be friendly sometimes right so
sometimes you fall into this loop of
checking blog through blog through blog
to blog through block and realized that
you haven't done any work but somehow
then you bump into articles like this
where it's like well here is that the
end after the whole thing so they say
well here's the moment
when we got to cut to the very end of
our web pack versus go versus grunt
comparison Here I am willing to explain
explain you I don't know how that goes I
want to explain you which framework and
want to use because to be honest we may
not be able to say that one of them is
the best and one of them is the worst
one due to this I am willing to
highlight that each framework has its
own special aspects which have been
taken into consideration but the
developers before they make their their
own choice ok so this whole article was
reviewing everything that we already
know about gulp grunt and webpack and
then at the end you don't even tell me
which one is the best one I want to know
your opinion buddy so I don't know why
this thing irritates me cuz this happens
all the time I happens on YouTube it
happens on already happens on a freakin
where's a freak oh camps freaking forums
and comments it happens on anywhere any
blog out there they come in putting a
whole bunch of different technologies
together and then at the end of your
like we don't know which was the best
one we just know that somehow is like
you figure it out it's like wait what
like what was the point of writing the
article you're not giving me no
information you're not telling me hey
man this is the best one for you because
of this situation excuse me this is the
best one for you in this situation or
this situation it's just more like hey
man we wasted like 10 15 minutes of your
life just you know reading and stuff and
and looking at pretty pictures of the
same logos but we're not going to give
you the answer which one is the best one
right and the reason why a lot of people
do this number ones for clickbait right
it's very great to say hey I'm going to
get a lot of use from all three of this
key
it's webpack gulp in grunt okay and then
at the end of the day I'm not
responsible for my opinion on this all
I'm going to say is I'm gonna give you
the same thing there's a little
documentation and then tell you hey you
figure it out right but for junior
developers I mean like how does that
help them you get what I'm saying like
not only even junior developers any
developer how does that help you it's
like hey here are three technologies but
we're going to give you the highlights
and you figure it out you know what I'm
saying like I don't know I find that to
be annoying I find that to be retarded I
find that to be like doesn't make sense
in this world and I don't know I just
wanted to talk about that in this video
because it's just kind of kind of stupid
to to create a blog and then not give
the person that's reading the article a
definitely point or a choice say hey I
personally go wave go or I personally go
with webpack or I personally go with
grunt is more like hey we're gonna waste
your time we're gonna wrap it up oh nice
and then at the end there is no
conclusion the conclusion is your job to
figure it out like yeah I know it's my
job to figure it out but why are you
telling me we're gonna do a triple death
match between all three of this
frameworks or this libraries right like
don't do that don't do that that
clickbait stuff man it's really annoying
man is really super annoying I just wish
people will understand that when you're
online you're looking for answers you're
not looking for somebody to come in and
be like hey man you know it's like
you're going to search online right
imagine this you come in to a website
and then you try to search I wanna buy a
Honda a Toyota or Honda which one of
those threes are actually the best ones
for me right
on 20:18 origin whatever whatever year
it is and then the guy goes like hey
Honda has four wheels the the freaking
Toyota has four wheels the Honda has
four wheels and just comes to you and
but I hate you know what you decide
which one you want to buy like wait what
like you supposed to persuade me into or
tell me which one is the best one either
by price either by speed either by
whatever categories you might think of
or attributes that this car might have
give me that information and this is
what I'm saying with a lot of this blogs
and and when I look online I'm like man
people don't understand that when you're
looking for things online it's for an
answer you're looking for somebody to
tell you there's the best ones or say
this ones are good because of this
situation or this one is good for this
situation or you say hey you can't use
this in this situation because it's
overkill right if you come in and you
break it down for people like that
people will appreciate the blog post but
when you just come in at the end and
you're like I wash my hands man that's
on you that's your job you came here but
that's your job to decide which one is
the best one I see that all the time
when you - - man you gotta say hey man
this is the best because of this this
this and this it's like god this week
somebody sent me a comment about Python
right and they're like man you know
Python is great Python is where is that
man because Python can do this distance
isn't this and it's like you know it's
not just for for for college graduates
and this and that's like if you come in
and you study your math way even I
myself is taking calculus on my own to
learn things and I'm like wait hold on
buddy
first of all these channels about web
development right my advice is for
people who are looking to get into web
development not looking to get into
datum or freaking data science
I'm not looking to you know come in and
become data management I don't want them
know those people because that's not my
expertise right I wouldn't come in and
start creating those videos if I don't
know anything about it right those are
the things that basically I would
recommend because if I'm a web developer
I want to talk about what development so
what does I don't have to do with
anything here you got a saying so it's
like the same thing as this it's like
well if you're gonna create a blog post
give value to the people when people
come to my channel I come in and I give
them value you get what I'm saying
so just be careful out there man I keep
repeating this all the time be careful
with you know information that's out
there on the Internet
be careful with blog polls and like
literally people come in and and try to
get money off the ads like they're not
even giving you any good advice they're
not showing you why things are good and
they just saying hey man it's on here
are the things that are in the
documentation on the front page of the
technology and then we're gonna rewrite
it and then resend it to you and show it
to you and say hey here's a brand new
blog post and at the end we're not gonna
tell you which one is the best because
we can't tell you that you don't know
say like I don't know man well anyways
guys I'll see you guys later
it's your boy Joe coding face.com your
boys backing out and did it again once
again we got a bump into this crazy
world that we call the Internet
okay and for those of you guys that they
wanted to sign up to the website go to
Coney face com currently if you go
through the description below you're
gonna get 65% off on the whole website
go take that Ruby course man if you've
never done programming right if you know
HTML CSS you're like you know what I
just want to try even before I even try
getting into building website let me try
to learn a little bit of programming if
you've never done it before try the Ruby
right Larry would be on Ruby let's see
how it goes and then from there commit
because some people
the thing okay I'm gonna build a webpage
but don't like really to programming and
come in and write logic and you know
write cool stuff like little programs
and stuff like that they're not internet
all right so if you're not in today
you're not gonna be into JavaScript it's
that simple
but at least you want to try it out you
know so the best way to really get into
programming is coming into Ruby and then
if you have a problem with JavaScript
later on you go back to your your Ruby
core so you go back to that time that
you did it in Ruby and you're like wait
this is easy this is this isn't hard you
get what I'm saying it's just
programming all right so it's a great
language to start with so yeah man check
it out coding freeze calm your boys back
I didn't did it again we out here all
right
see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
