know there's like a hybrid of vlogging
you know what I mean
it's like I see me here all the time so

mood
ya see me when I'm in a bad mood like
I'm not gonna come in here and sugarcoat
it

how it is
Aloha
yeah that's what I'm saying no time for
trolls and professional chat that's what
I say I don't go sit on my channel I
need to get more professional you know I
mean I know I need to step my game up
man
I need to set I've been trying and to be
honest with you guys I've been trying to
step my game up
I've been trying to psych
we tried to just like you know step my
game up man and just like
keep it more professional it's like
people take me out my element you know
what I mean like what am I supposed to
do you never say I turned all the cheek
all the time so it's like what am I
supposed to do just like stay quiet
which is because you are eight youtuber
and you're like some type of personality
online it's like now I'm not a
personality I'm Joe you know what I mean
like I'm Joe Santos Garcia my my do like
that's who I am
I'm not some character on the internet
you know I mean like if I feel a certain
way I'm gonna say something I treat
things like real life man I can't I
can't be fake you know that's just who I
am
unfortunately
I wish I could be fake you know
but it's like you can't
freaking Stevie
and I got to wake up by like 9:30 I had
a live stream and on a clock
and I should've left early
it's like I know I was gonna come out
here but
it's like I'm saying what IBS man
through my whole like not my whole day
but my whole schedule it's like all the
things that I wanted to talk about got
thrown off then I wanted to leave
earlier I got thrown off because I still
needed to do another video because they
you know don't just calling me asking me
questions you know
emailing me and sending me messages a
minute what happened isn't that so then
I gotta make it clear which took another
20-30 minutes then I was gonna go get a
haircut I can't even get a haircut like
that's one the same man it kind of sucks
it's like the Joe Rogan if web
development I like that that should be
like my motto
I'm the Joe Rogan of what the very what
development makes I actually like that
man
ya know that's the thing that's where
that's how I felt to like this a lot of
situations where it's like okay the
situation seemed such a shame
well you drop some song
some dumb common sense how much opinions
about everything make your own channel
you know what I mean like that's the
thing but all of you guys make your own
channels channels share your opinions
you know let's talk about it let's have
conversations but it's like if you don't
you don't like the channel everything
that the person says you're against it
it's like I don't understand why will
you be there
well
on my way to Hartford Connecticut
on my way to Torrington Connecticut
listen one of our people from
Connecticut
that's probably not even that many
people like I was looking online to see
like where are the developers like
where's the meetups in Connecticut and I
got completely fine anything so it's
like them and it's like Connecticut like
20 minutes 20 30 minutes away from New
York City man like how can there not be
that many meetups man I feel like they
snacking
no to me
Frigga sleeping
keep me up guys
hold me down
his org man in Florida right now
all on stay right there kids
where do we hear
I'm glad I'm good home man I'm trying to
find my way home
god
frickin flame blackjack for like oh no
hollowly
four or five hours man by six hours
straight playing blackjack
like blackjack is cool like casinos are
cool but you can't get get used to it
you can't get to the point where like
you coming back to this but you can't
come back to the stuff right you go to a
casino but it's not meant for you to
come back like every week every two
weeks now you come back every five six
months man
casinos destroy homes destroy families
I know about that trust me
you can't take gambling is definitely
something serious I mean you can't take
it lightly you can't just play around
with it but oh yeah I will try to double
up my money all the time it's like nah
that's not gonna happen son that's gonna
happen once in a blue moon
Oh
my daughter woke me up man I ranted with
the lives
in professor goes to Vegas every month
he got an issue and he got a problem
he can't be going to Vegas monthly that
do probably spend
Oh God
creaking sleepy about to close my eyes
let jesus take the wheel
yeah
and I for real man I really I don't know
man I might go back to school man I
might go finish that my computer science
degree you know like I might get it like
a master's in computer science just
because like I really really want to be
teaching you know you know like a
college somewhere like I wouldn't mind I
mean my father was a college professor
and my mom was a teacher I mean my mom
is a teacher still
but
it's crazy
Hey
but the only thing is that I will do a
college degree like you know our masters
get a master's in computer science if I
could do it from home like I'm not going
to to no school for that I'll be honest
with you guys I am going to school for
it like I'll do it at home but I'm never
going to like a university like
dude actually from the comfort of my
home watching Netflix
like the only reason I want to get it is
because not because they got to teach me
anything that I don't know already but
because it's gonna open up more doors
for me when it comes to like academia
like I really wanna you know teach my
narco go to Dominican Republic if I got
our masters in computer science I know I
could go to Dominican Republic and try
to teach you in the university you know
what I mean with all the experience that
I've had over the years I got no I could
be of some service to my home country
you know what I mean like I love the
United States the United States is my
home but at the same time I feel like my
country Dominican Republic like there's
so much that they can do cuz if you look
at countries like Japan you look at
countries like Malaysia like those
countries like they were mad poor back
in the days but now because of
Technology and because of Education like
they one of the richest countries in the
world
you know what I mean so I feel like we
could do the same thing with dominican
republic and a lot of countries in the
Caribbean like instead of focusing on on
high corners
what's the name on tourism there's a lot
of those countries they focus so much on
tourism that they forget about educating
their their people you know
then I oh no forget it we make enough
money from tourism so they don't even
put money into education they don't tell
people what to really study in school
like I know so many people that in
Dominican Republic that they study like
hai Kaun it's like accounting right
accounting of marketing and I'm like why
are you studying that like there's no
jobs for it
you know they there's no jobs in
Dominican Republic for it so that people
still study that no matter what because
the idea of studying marketing or
studying
how you call is accounting or whatever
like it seems the idea of it it seems
good it seems like oh yeah I'm gonna get
my degree I'm gonna be able to work at a
company and just isn't that but that's
not the reality because the American
Republic doesn't have that many small
businesses like it has small businesses
but it's like small businesses from poor
people you know what I mean is like as I
hate man I grow some Platanos and some
oranges and I try to set it to you know
a supermarket you know it's like that
type of business but there's not that
many like small companies that do like
e-commerce or stuff like that so if you
go in and you're starting marketing it's
like what the hell you're gonna study
marketing for most of the companies that
do marketing in dr are like big
companies that are in america it sounds
like you're studying something that
there's no jobs in the country you have
to go to another country to actually get
hired
good
Peter Navarro says do you have some sort
of tutoring mentorship program online I
mean I've done some tutoring to a couple
of people's but the problem is that
everybody wants you to help them right
they got answer the questions of
everybody who sends me emails right I
answer that questions unless it's
something that they want me to do their
homework or stuff like that like I'm not
in the mood to do your homework you know
what I mean but stuff like tutoring like
helping you out like I said you don't
know a certain subject like I could
definitely tutor it but at the same time
you have to take into account like
there's only a limited amount of hours
in a day that I can actually work
sorry
so yeah so there's like a limited amount
of hours that I can actually work and
most people don't understand that most
people they they think like hey man if
I'm gonna like if I'm gonna spend an
hour with somebody one-to-one helping
them out with something I have to you
know get something out of it too because
most likely in that hour that I'm given
to you or given to whoever it is right
like at that moment I could have been
making money I could have been trying to
make some money or working on a project
working on a course of working or
something online
or you know updating one of my websites
like that all of that stuff generates me
money so it's like if I'm gonna give an
hour of that like I need to get paid for
my my time and like some people don't
understand that they you know they they
really believe that you know that's a
youtuber or as somebody who's online
right they think like you have all the
time in the words I know you don't work
full-time man it's like you have all the
time in the world as I bro you don't
even know half of my day you know
I got so many things that I have to do
and a whole day says like if I'm gonna
give you an hour it's like I gotta get
paid in that hour but people don't
understand that you know
but yes so that's why I was like I
haven't really done I haven't even told
me what I hate man if you want me to
told you I'll help you out for an hour
out do it but I just I don't even tell
people that anymore because
everybody things like this that's like a
free thing it's like amen it's not free
you know I mean
have you taken Ruby on Rails or you to
be know the way holler you to me I'm
excited me then we have learned Ruby on
Rails I actually learned it by watching
hoses guys name I forgot his name
he was a guy that used to work at at
Cole school calm he had his own course I
don't even think that's on udemy he has
on his own website I can't remember his
name but he was like part of the owners
of cult school calm and he had his own
course back in the days before Cole
school became big
he had like his own website and that's
how I learned Ruby on Rails and then I
actually went to a job as a front-end
developer and the backend was in Ruby on
Rails so then from there on I just
learned it you know and it's cool cuz
it's like when that company there was
like literally me and two other
developers and it was a multi-million
dollar company like they used to make
about 50 60 million dollars in that
company a year and there was only three
developers that come and taint the whole
website and I was like man this is legit
Ruby or else is legit
because it's like all the other
companies that I've been to if they
making like a lot of money in the
company's huge like they need a big team
they need multiple people working on the
code but Ruby on Rails is like it's so
easy and like everything that's already
built building for you like you could
build so much stuff without having to
have a big team
you know it's good it's good to ask it's
always good to ask I think that's that's
the thing like sometimes people are
scared to ask certain things I think
everybody if you have a question you can
definitely ask
I also - I was like thinking about this
man because you know I was like
listening to like some messages that
somebody has sent me on my email and he
was talking to me about hey man nice why
don't you talk more about nodejs and I
was just like you know what like I don't
talk about no GS number one because no
GS is pretty much played out alright
meaning like everybody talks about no GS
all right I don't need to talk about the
same thing that everybody talks about
because it just makes it whack and you
know what I mean like if I come here now
gonna say an example today we talked
about react right and one of the reasons
to why I know react as popular but and I
love react well I don't talk about it
that much because everybody talks about
it every single person you know
emphasizes on on a freaking react now in
days so I was like I don't even freaking
focus that much on it because there's
like other channels already doing like a
whole bunch of series there's a whole
bunch of people talking about giving
tutorials giving explanations and how to
do this how to do forums how to do
whatever and it's like you know if you
want to learn react like it's right
there on my website I already went over
it
it's like I know from all the people
that's out there already sorted in the
easiest way that you possible but you
could think of but at the same time it's
like you know I don't I don't like to
talk about the same thing that
everybody's talking about I usually like
to talk about topics that just get your
money I feel like a lot of people focus
on on what school but don't focus on the
side of making money so that's what I
focus on you know I really like if I see
that there's an opening a very big
opening with Ruby on Rails
for junior developers I'm gonna talk
about Ruby on Rails you know
it's the same thing with react or any
other topic out there if there's jobs
out there I'm gonna talk about
Plus like the whole idea of this channel
is to make you guys independent like I
don't want you guys to go to a company
and stay in a company ten freaking years
fifteen years like I don't want you guys
staying in a company for that long I
want you guys to go in there get your
money stack up and then open up your own
company like you already have the skills
why you got to make somebody else rich
you got on say like you know $100,000
$120,000 that usually is the max of web
developers unless you do something like
go lame like that's cool but it's not
like it's not like you boiling it's not
like you're chilling you know what I
mean it's like it's like you're right
you're comfortable
well I feel like if you if you come in
and you start learning all the
technologies that is gonna make you our
independent developer somebody who come
in and become an entrepreneur and and
create your own projects and create your
startups like there's people that
freaking have worked at Google and have
quick google to open up their own
companies and become successful and make
way more money than developers that
still work at over you're gonna say like
and some people might be like oh man you
know like it's not all about the money
yeah it's not all about the money but at
the same time it's like if you're a
developer what Italian why are you
making somebody else rich while you're
just basically like
a man
if you feel like you got no energy man
just think about the positives man if
you feel like you got no energy to code
and to keep on learning think about the
positives think about all the negatives
where you at right now in your life and
think about the positives that becoming
a developer is gonna bring to your life
you know
Oh
yeah man also too if you feeling burnt
out you gotta take a break
got to go outside I got a chill
get some air No</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
