at it again man : freeze calm your boys
back nod and did it again
alright today we have another portfolio
that we're going to review we got Khalid
Abdul Kareem in here all right so this
is portfolio you got a big image here
nice little computer of course Mac you
got services marketing web design
desire2learn which is always good
portfolio below are some samples of
designs for businesses I've created or
replicated this is pretty cool he also
has the full page this is nice I like
this because it has real projects and
like for real businesses that you know
anybody that sees this could be like ok
cool I can work with this right
they seem pretty nice and pretty cool
and a CML my see as far as projects so
far I will say he got an A+ he got like
a lot of good projects and here things
that I could say hey this could work if
I'm a business I would say ok so yeah so
this is pretty cool
I like it I like that he has projects on
staying
let's see fast play that's cool I think
you've really listened to me I told him
like hey I have a restaurant half a
couple of businesses have your portfolio
so you actually listened and this is
great you know you got what design this
is cool I like it project wise man you
got a pretty solid portfolio alright
cool man
nice all right let's see so you got a
couple of lines about him graduated
Bachelor of Science degree in marketing
Josh Mason University pretty good work
well now got the contact page will the
contact me for all right now now is
where we come in and we criticize in and
just help you take it
the next level like this is pretty cool
you know first thing that I will say is
let's start with the header like the
header is fine this is legit you can
actually add something here that once it
goes over 100% of the viewport you can
actually put in a different background
here so this background can be white a
solid white and then this colors here
should be a black like let's say your
black for the menu or you could even put
this color of the links to be there
permanently because as you can see when
we go over white it disappears okay so
yeah you definitely need a background on
this thing here so that's what I was
saying you know so once you scroll down
here a new background should show up
right behind this element okay another
thing too is you see this welcome to my
my page and you see how this K is
disappearing to the background what you
need to do is put in like a black
background you could actually mix it
together with images and images and the
background image sorry background color
and the background image or even a
gradient you can mix them together all
right um I actually have an example I
did this on APA RP online this is
website I worked on a long time ago if
you want you can come to this website
take this code that I did here if you
wanted to do it and pretty much you can
take this put in the image that you have
having like let's say a linear gradient
or or anything like that and pretty much
just put in like black on it and just
put like a 1 1% or like 10% of it or
passing call like the Alpha right just
so you could have a little darkness on
on top of the image and we could read
the text a little bit better I like the
fact that you put in on the highlight
you change the color
of it which is good it matches to the
yellow that you already using here on
the team that you have let's see what
else and what else would I do to this
thing oh also to all say this when you
usually do it big images like that
usually the idea of it is to have a full
screen so for this element here what I
will do is I will say 100% of you if you
hide with a minimum of let's say 700
pixels something like that so let me see
this is the 500 okay let's say height
100 eh and as you can see here now it's
completely 100% full screen all right
but let's say if they have a cell phone
right if you have a cell phone what
happens is that your images or the size
of it's too small like let's say here we
toggle this to be for mobile phone let's
say iPhone 5 it will be too small so
what you will do is you will say
something like this you say header
height 100 eh and then it will say
minimum height 500 pixels all right and
that will cover everything for any size
out there but so even if you come down
here you will say you see that happens
there so even even for that you will say
something like instead of using 500
pixels use a minimum of let's say 700
pixels so
now it'll look like that right so the
minimum will be 700 pixels now at all
times
it's always going to be 100% of the view
screen all right now if that makes sense
oh of course you can go more crazy and
be like okay responsive size and fit on
this side for tablet make it this size
etc right so you can go crazy with that
but um as far as the projects is pretty
legit what I would say is just minor
things like the header on the top image
this paragraph here will look so much
nicer if there was like like it wouldn't
be this wide right so let's say let's
see max width plus a 400 or 600 pixels
okay since I'm 2 pixels so margin there
Auto all right something like that right
of course you gotta play around with it
and figure it out but I don't think the
paragraph itself should be running from
this side of the screen all the way to
this side screen especially on a big
screen like Mars you should definitely
try to fix that like just make it a
little bit smaller you know even like
650 650 it will look a little bit better
alright so that's fine maybe a little
space in between the header here we'll
say let's say for this element margin
bottom let's say a hundred pixels say 70
pixels you know just you play around
with it of course you put a part on
margin bottom of the paragraph space it
out a little bit better this image I
don't know this image looks kind of
crazy here for some reason
and also to even your images try to put
your image itself a little bit more
centered because it really just throws
it off alright because you have your
image here let's say if he was to crop
your image right and you crop it as a
perfect square it works better even
though this isn't a high quality image
but if you give it a perfect square it
will look fine and I will say put it
here right next to it instead of you
putting at the bottom alright if that
makes sense
thank you know what I'm saying and a
smaller whiff I mean you get what I'm
saying so yeah so this is a good
portfolio the project that you have here
are legit you know also to hear I will
say the same thing you know put in a
little a little darker background or a
different color background you know
something that you could read the text
so whenever you have sex on top of
images you've got a darky a little bit
or change the background color a little
bit because if not you can't read the
text as well but this is good I like the
typography you got here it's pretty
legit it's nice I mean there's really
not much stuff to talk about and this
portfolio is pretty good it seems like
you you know your stuff it's just about
tweaking it a little bit and just
perfecting it you know because if I'm
looking at this website and I'm working
for a company and I see that this menu
disappears soon as that comes over here
that kind of tells me like you know
you're good but you still need more
policy on your portfolio you want to be
top of the line and some people could
actually look at it and be like oh man
this dude is super ready we want him we
don't want nobody else we don't want to
see nobody else we want this guy all
right so yeah man you already know
simple jump back at it again : phrase
calm for those of you guys that want me
to look over your portfolios please send
it to me my emails is : trees that no
color face at gmail
yeah man we hear and for those of you
guys that want to learn about what
development and yeah I want to support
this channel listen I have my own
website : face comm where I have over 20
courses and pretty much is like you sign
up one time and you get access to all of
them alright so I'll see you guys later
