a string oK we've actually used strings
a couple of times already you know to
set up a name but now let's go a little
bit deeper okay so string is basically
anything that's inside of a single quote
or a double quote so single quote is
like this I just say my name is Joe okay
that's a single quote string and then i
could say double quote my name is Joe
alright okay so if we run this nothing
happens because we're not returning
anything okay
but if I was to say hey I want to put
this inside of a variable is very simple
I can say name I have to say like that
let's see if I wanted to change this to
age my age is 30 I could come here and
say H equals 30 and then now I could
just print that I'll say print name
alright we run that says my name is Joe
if we come here save print age okay
you'll see you says my name is Joe and
my age is 30 so that's pretty much how a
string looks like okay you can have
numbers inside of it can go ahead and
put characters inside of it so you could
come here like this you know so all of
that is inside of the string and as you
can see it brings it out for us all
right
okay so now let's say we wanted to have
quotes inside of the quotes how can we
do this let's say for example if you
have single quotes you can actually come
here in putting double quotes you could
say like this all right and putting
double quotes inside of the single quote
and you see it says my name is quotes
and then Joe all right but if I come
here and I say hey instead of double
quotes I want to use single quotes
inside all right this is gonna break
okay and that's because it basically as
soon as you put in one single quote and
you're putting another single quote it
basically closes to the string all right
so because it closes the string now
everything is breaking so how can we
escape this so we used two backslash
okay you can come here and say backslash
all right and then backslash right here
okay and then now you're able to use
single quotes inside of a single quote
string same thing with double quotes if
you wanted to use double quotes inside
of a string all right right there's
going to break
okay let's say my age C so that's one
string and then here that's another
string so to bypass this you actually
have to escape it so you have to come
here and say backslash all right and
then backslash and there you go now
let's say for whatever reason you want
to have this thing that says my age is
30 and you want this right here you want
it to be in a newline meaning under how
will you do this pretty simple you come
here you use the backslash and
say n so the backslash n means a new
line I run this as you can see it splits
the string into a new line so the first
line in the second line
alright now let's talk about indexing
okay so let's say for example we have
this sentence that says my name is Jo
what if I wanted to actually get the
letter J how would I do this very simple
I can just use indexing okay so I'm
gonna come down here I'm gonna leave
everything the same way how it is and
I'm gonna say print and then I'm gonna
say name and then I'm going to say
brackets square brackets as you can see
and then inside of it we use something
called the index okay so every single
letter inside of a string or every
single character inside of a string is
giving a number so you could say it
starts with zero so it's zero one two
three four five six seven eight nine ten
okay eleven and twelve okay so if I want
to get the letter J I have to come here
and put in the index of 12 so now when I
run this as you can see it says my name
is Jo my age is 30 and then it has the
characters here and then the letter J so
that's how you index all right
you can also do a couple of other ways
of indexing things like let's say for
example if I wanted to get the number
negative one right so the negative one
is going to give me the last character
so I could say negative one and as you
can see the last character is this the
single quote if I come here say I want
to get the letter e I can come here and
say let's say negative two and that
gives me the letter e if I still want
the letter J I could say one two three
four
starts negatively from the right side so
as you can see we get the letter J again
alright alright guys so now what we're
gonna do is we're basically gonna talk
about slicing alright so we're gonna say
print name and what I want to do is I
want to slice everything from let's say
0 1 2 so from 3 and up I want to get a
new string okay so I'm gonna say name
and then I'm going to put in 3 and then
: alright so as you can see it's a it's
name is Joe so basically it started from
here and up alright now the next thing
that I want to do is I want to slice it
but the opposite way I want to say I
want to start at this
well the s all the way down to here ok
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
copy this and I'm going to instead of
putting the colon to the right of the
number I'm gonna put it to the left so
let's say 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 all right so
let's say 7 and down
okay so we got my name all right so it's
zero one two three four five six seven
all right now next thing that we want to
do is basically try to get from here
from name so is so we could come here
and actually just say name and then put
the three and then to the seven so
you're saying from the third index to
the seventh index and as you can see you
get name so you got zero one two three
four five six seven
so from three to six
all right so you usually just say seven
because that's the where that's
basically where it stops okay so and
that's pretty much it guys I'm gonna see
you guys in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
