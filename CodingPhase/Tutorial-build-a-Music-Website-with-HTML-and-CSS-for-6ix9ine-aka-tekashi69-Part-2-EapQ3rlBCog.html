that we have our project folder here the
next thing that we want to do is we
basically want to open up bash of boom -
you could come here and do it like this
a CD /mnt form out and the C Drive now
we click allows now we're going to CD
into projects okay
so that's the location for my project
files now the next thing that I'm going
to do is I'm gonna go into CD takashi
6:9 okay and here I'm gonna say npm
install this will install all the
packages that we need from this project
to get started okay i'm gonna post a
video cuz this might take a little while
okay see you guys in a little bit
alright guys so we're good to go
everything has been downloaded as far as
the packages and now we're gonna say
over here MPM run watch okay there you
go
now we gotta come here go to localhost
3000 and here you go here's the starter
kit kids so we are good to go we're
ready to start building our website so
the first thing that we're gonna do is
we're going to basically do the
background okay so the top section okay
we're gonna do the header next but for
now let's just make sure we get
everything that we want out of this okay
so first of all let's go back into our
public folders
gonna come here into this index.html
okay
and here we're gonna remove this save
this oops okay how long save that here
we're gonna do something like this I'm
gonna create a section I'm gonna call
this class top section top section okay
oops okay now the next thing that I want
to do before I even continue with this I
want to make sure that we have a couple
of things here like Emmet just to save
us time certain things so we're gonna
click there everything and click this
alright alright cool so we're good to go
now the next thing that I want to do
here is I'm gonna save this I'm gonna
open up the assets go to sass go to main
that s CSS and here I'm going to delete
everything that's here okay
save that I'm gonna come here put in the
class let's say top section and you know
what to make it different every section
we're gonna do it with an ID which is
actually better for us so we just gonna
change this to an ID okay save that now
here we're gonna say background let's
say
background:url and then here we're gonna
say slash image slash what's the name of
the image
top top dot JPEG top that JPEG okay
I'm gonna save it like that okay we're
gonna come here put a semicolon and say
background size cover height 100% width
100% and you know what this week leave
indoor height 100 100 VH which means
100% of the view height okay now we're
gonna open this and as you can see this
is what we're getting
okay now I want to actually blur this
out so to do this let's do CSS blur okay
alright so we're gonna use filter and
we're gonna use blur okay so let's do
this
I say filter blur and was it pixels
let's say 20 pixels save that and now we
having a blur here let's do a little bit
more than that let's do 50 pixels okay
that's pretty good
now what we also want to do we want to
come here take this color which is was
in 19
twenty two eight and we're gonna make
the body to be that background so we're
gonna sing comment this out make this
like that
save that okay that's exactly what we
want now one thing about filter blur is
that it basically when once you blur
something it blurs every child of it
brain so if I say hey top section we use
a blur on it every single child below it
even though if I create a div here right
I could create a div and say yeah
something like this is this is Takashi
six six six six nine this is the kanji
six nine refresh this it's here but it's
being blurred so let's look into this
it's being blurred we don't even see it
because it's also being blur so blur
actually blurs everything inside of that
element and we actually want to have
more control with this than that so to
do this what we're gonna do is we're
gonna come here we're gonna say div
class equals two blurred background
okay save that so now we're gonna come
here let's take all of this and inside
of here we're gonna say blurred
background and put it there
okay now when we come here as you can
see now we've seen that this is Takashi
6-9 so now we actually seen that element
okay so the next thing that we want to
do is basically we're gonna come here
let me see look at the image okay we got
that this is the background we actually
want to do a gradient so like a gradient
coming up from here to there so to do
that we're gonna say CSS generator okay
not this one gradient okay cool so
double-click on this paste our color
here which was let's see what was the
color this one okay copy this paste is
there now we're gonna remove that and
we're gonna make this opacity zero okay
now we're gonna move this color to go
from the bottom going up okay we're
gonna come here where says background
background okay linear gradient we're
gonna copy this here copy that
okay and we're gonna go back to our code
here we're gonna basically see where it
says background we're gonna change this
to background image change that to a
background image then we're gonna pace
our linear gradient and then now we're
gonna have the linear gradient on top of
the image and remember it's gonna be one
color from the bottom going up and then
halfway through the opacity is gonna be
zero so we're gonna be able to see that
image in the background so let's save
this and as you can see there you go now
one thing that we want to do we want to
actually give this like another color so
let me see
okay so I'm gonna take this this linear
okay copy up to there paste it here
let's see how that looks okay that looks
a little bit better all right cool
now let me see something let me see if
we bring down this grade 12:40 looks a
little bit better let me see something
with this this opacity on this one zero
I'm gonna copy this and move it a little
bit more up oops
paste it there because the whole idea of
it is that we want to have a black of
color here okay see how we did that so
you got to learn how to play around with
the the gradients and see how how things
work so let's copy this from here and
let's paste this here
save that okay now this is more like it
now this is more like how we have it
here okay but it's a little bit too much
so we still got to bring this down a
little bit more okay
come take this from here you know this
old trial and error that's how you you
come out with something exactly how the
design is it's like you gotta try it out
see which one looks the most okay so I
decided to go with this one which is
linear gradient 45 degrees RGB 25 32 42
1 Pass City a 0% RGB 255 255 and the
same thing here 36 okay we got a little
bit of purple in there and we got the
URL image okay okay
and yeah so here we go that's what we
keeping okay the next thing that we want
to do we want to get this image right in
the middle so right here so this is what
we want to bring that image to
so the next thing that we're gonna do
we're gonna come here we're gonna put in
class maybe
yeah class Takashi
it image okay so here we're gonna say
image source image slice what was it
Takashi dot PNG okay
save that okay here's the image what
we're gonna do we're gonna say
this image whiff is 618 so close this so
it's like 618 okay just gonna say image
is gonna be 20% for now let's let's try
that out image is gonna be 20% let's say
with 20% save that I'm gonna say the
image inside of it with 100% okay now
what we're going to do we're basically
gonna come here we're gonna move this
thing so takashi image source
let's move this inside of another
element so dave floating image
keep floating image we're gonna say this
floating image is going to be floating
image with 100% weight for 100% height
100% we're gonna say display flex
justified content and aligned items
sensor okay this was at the end let me
see something inspect this element
all right now you're putting this 100%
and we're gonna actually make this
floating image to be let's say top
section let's do it
position:relative this one we're gonna
say position:absolute z-index one copy
this well put Z index to put in the what
the height 100% of eh or 100v H okay I
see I put flex this one's fine flexing
on that one flex in on this one okay so
there you go so there's at the bottom
now I'm also gonna do this instead of 20
percenters foot 30 30 % of the screen
all right cool that's fine we're not
doing responsive right now at this
moment now I wanna see why we have with
extra extra space here which we
shouldn't because it's 100 percent of
the view height let me look in the HTML
that's fine all right so we got the
first part done which is just doing the
background okay so in the background
putting the image here image of your boy
and that's fine it's completely fine let
me see something we could actually maybe
do a little filter little bit of more
filter to this let me see where is it
filter function opacity saturate so
we've actually used saturate ICU filter
gonna use the saturate for the
background so Missy saturates filter
blur though saturate twenty percent
that's not that good
you'll see fifty percent say 150% okay
that's a little bit better alright
150 percent let's say 130 percent yeah
one thirty percent is perfect now the
other thing that we want to do okay we
got saturate we got grayscale we might
use that later on let's see for contrast
so let's do this we're gonna do contrast
on on this and that's Akashi image so
I'm going to copy this put this here and
instead of this I'm gonna use contrast
let's say 120% okay we put this on the
side here just so we can see it a little
bit better
okay let me see but an 150 now let me
see how it looks without it see the
difference they don't so that's why I
like I like it better like that
so put some contrast on the image itself
now let's work on the header man let's
finish this off I was gonna leave it for
the next video but then I'm like you
know what let's just knock this out so
we could do one section per video what
do you guys think that would be nice
alright so let's do the 69 and then the
side menu here so we have 2 logo all
right so we're gonna come here we got
top section alright this little C header
and I still logo let's still say nav ok
and then this knife we're gonna do a was
5 which is basically just creates a
anchor links for us so let's do bio
let's do a tour still music let's do
videos let's do shop
okay now the next thing that we want to
do we're gonna come here and I start
work on this header right so and here
let's put in the image of the logo so
let's do an anchor link anchor link and
put in image source logo dot PNG I can't
close the tag alright
also it has to be slash image slash logo
there you go okay cool now the next
thing that we're gonna do we're gonna
basically come here and see this is the
top section I'm gonna come here put in
header and this header we're gonna say
display flex okay let's play flex okay
say wave 100%
I mean technically by default like that
but I usually like to do it
okay logo say image wave 100% okay so we
got the logo than the image okay logo
image with 100% we're on the logo is
gonna be say wave say 50 pixels
okay that's more like it on this we're
gonna say justify content space between
okay as you can see that sent them all
the way to over there and then on this
we're gonna say a lying self-centered
and that basically Center sit right in
the middle of this image okay now for
this we're gonna say this anchor links
we're gonna come in we're gonna say
color white we're gonna sing
text-decoration:none font size let's put
in one point to the rim save that okay
font weight let's say 300 okay alright
now we're basically going to give a
padding on left and right there on top
and bottom left or right we're gonna say
10 pixels okay that is fine we're also
going to create a padding around the
whole header itself so we're gonna say
padding let's say padding say 15 pixels
all around see how that looks okay and
as you can see we're not getting the
right sizes so are we gonna do up here
we're gonna come do a star and this is
very important guys whenever you see
that for some reason your boxes are not
fitting
the right way make sure you put in
border box for every single element and
as you can see now everything stays
inside within the space that they need
to be okay now the next thing that we
want to do for this thing because as you
can see we have two header like kind of
messing up so what we want to do we want
to move this header and we want to say
position:absolute okay position absolute
say your that we're gonna say z-index
we're gonna put in three and so far
we're done guys I'll see you guys in the
next video bye this video is brought to
you by coding phase comm all of its
members make sure you go visit a website
is the only place where you're gonna
learn how to become web developer with
real projects take it from me steel
going joke back at it again coding fees
