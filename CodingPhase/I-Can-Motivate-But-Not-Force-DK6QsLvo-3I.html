wrote out was go my peoples yo this
video is gonna be called I can motivate
but not force I can motivate you to
become a developer I can motivate you to
you know get your money out here I can
motivate you to do a lot of things get
your swagger up you know your
self-confidence up I can help you out
with those things all right well I can't
force you to do it all right I cannot
force you to do it so there's a lot of
people who signed up and I appreciated
the people that signed up me and signed
up to my website and are taking the
course but there's a very large group of
people who have signed up and haven't
even started any other videos you know
one of the most beautiful things about
me having this website it's the fact
that now I can go in there and look at
the stats look at what people are
working on I can see what people are
actually doing right and one thing that
I'm noticing is like there's a lot of
people who signed up they just
haven't even started meaning like they
they gone in signed up and it's like hey
man I'm just I'm gonna do it for next
week i'ma leave it for the weekend i'ma
leave it for a week from now I'm
believing for a month from now right and
then then they come back they get you
know they get charged again for five
bucks and then they'll be like oh man I
signed up for this thing and I never
even did it I never went into the course
I never took any of the courses so I'm
just gonna cancel it
guys you can go ahead and cancel at any
time like I would say but you have to go
in and do the work like you know it's
like this is not a scheme this is not
something of like me coming in to you
guys and telling you guys hey guys hey
you could get a house with zero down you
know and become a real estate agent and
become a you know entrepreneur you could
become the next Trump all right with
zero money down like you know that's a
scheme right what I'm doing for you guys
is giving you an option so instead of
you working on that BS job by FedEx
getting 16,000 hours $17 an hour you
could say hey in the next few months I'm
doing a change in my life and I'm coming
in and next year I want to be able to
have vacation I want to be able to have
money in my pocket I want to be able to
say hey I'm gonna buy myself a house all
right you want to be able to be part of
society you don't nothing that working
for FedEx is not being part of society
but there's so many things that you miss
out on
like don't you hate that when you you
watch TV and like let's say you watching
HGTV don't you hate that the fact that
you see people who have big-ass houses
you know brand-new cars and you're like
man how the hell they do that right 90%
of the time it's hard work
it could be passed down from a grandpa
could be passed down for a grandma or it
could be for whoever blast some point
somebody had to work for that right so
it's like this man
all right to be honest with you guys I
don't believe in racism racism is a way
to keep you down mentally I don't
believe in that no more exist
I don't believe in it I don't let it
affect it I don't let it affect me at
all right I don't believe in classism
which is when you're being you know
you're born poor most likely you gonna
stay poor but there are certain things
in this world and certain opportunities
that lets you get out of that class you
know this isn't India in 1600s whatever
right like where say hey this is your
class you're a peasant and that's it
you're a peasant for life no do you live
in America
you have opportunities right we have two
opportunities to jump from different
classes but if you don't go in and try
to get this done how the hell are you
gonna be able to to get out of that
class man you're not going to be able to
do that man I don't
so that's all I'm saying like you gotta
do your thing man you gotta put in that
work man life is not about saying hey
I'm gonna do it I'm gonna sign up and
I'm just out doing when I can't know
it's about hey I want something and I
want to get it done man you know how
many people signed up to the gym every
January first and they're like man New
Year's resolution is I'm losing 20
pounds they sign up they don't go that
first month they don't go the second
month they don't go the third month by
the third month they cancelled their
membership right but on the by the third
month they already pay for the initial
of the membership they paid for three
months so now for free they gave so like
I say somewhere LA Fitness platinum and
always at Planet Hollywood whatever one
of those places right now you just gave
it gave them money for free you didn't
lose not even one pound you didn't even
do anything right so it's the same thing
with coding guys if you don't do the
work it doesn't matter if you're buying
from me if you sign up to my courses
doesn't matter if you sign up to Steven
Grimes courses sign up to coach steel
courses nobody can come in and force you
to do the work you have to do it
yourself right I can come here and do
videos every single day motivate you
guys and like I always say guys I'm not
here telling you guys from the beginning
I said it like hey you have to take my
courses no go do it somewhere else go
try if you want to try a cold school.com
tri fluoro sidetrack you let me try you
want to try our tin treehouse try it but
the idea is for you guys to code and
learn something so you could get out
wherever you are at the moment and get
to the next level right some people are
privileged that they could say hey man
I'm good and I can leave my career
and go to a bootcamp and you know chill
for 3-4 months without have to worry
about paying anything but a lot of you
guys know you're in a situation where I
used to be wears like hey I'm coming
from the bottom if I don't work I don't
eat if I don't make money
nobody's gonna feed me nobody's
gonna come in and put money in my pocket
I don't so I had to do this the hard way
I had to come in and really you know
work hard and try to learn this stuff
you know and it's about 80% of the
people who are really going hard and on
the website I look at it all the time at
any given time there's twenty to thirty
people on the website live right now I
look at my analytics 20 to 30 people
live at the moment at any given moment
looking at courses doing the tutorials
getting everything done sending me
questions asking me things I'm helping
them out right but they say a good
twenty percent where I'm like man I
don't want to stand it 20% of the people
means one out of five or two out of ten
right basically sign up but then never
do it and then a month later they cancel
that count all right and I'm like wait
you signed up but you never didn't write
you know what I mean like some people
I'm like I don't know I don't get it you
know what I mean like just work hard
guys man this isn't a scheme this isn't
something be like hey man invest $200 to
my marketing course and I'll show you
how to sell Facebook guides guys this is
called work like this is called learning
something learning a skill so you can
really start doing something with your
life man like I'm being honest you know
what I mean like I'm doing like right
now somebody might be like yo Joe what
do you know you're at home you you're
chilling right now I'm like
yeah but this this is actually me taking
a risk right this is me taking a risk to
say hey I wanna help out people I'd do
this for a whole year I'm fine
next year if things doesn't go how
things are planned or for whatever
reason let's say an example this I gotta
know something happens I can't do videos
for you guys and everybody unsubscribe
or YouTube bans me or whatever and I
can't reach out to any of you guys right
you know what's gonna happen I'm
literally gonna be like this I'm gonna
send a few emails in less than a week
I'm gonna get on another job over
$100,000 that's it because I have those
skills at any moment right now I'm
contemplating to move into Connecticut
right some some of y'all can't can't
just say hey I'm moving to another state
and say hey I'm gonna find a job in a
week all right
but that's because I really work hard to
get to where I'm at you guys can
definitely do it I'm nowhere near like
super smart or somebody special I'm just
some regular dude just like you guys so
it's like you could definitely do it
so go hard man like Grilli
like why wouldn't you want the
opportunity to get out of the class that
you're in you know what I mean
I want to help you guys man Stanford I'm
looking into what's the name is by
Hartford to the west of Hartford
Torrington or something like that I was
looking into that area it's pretty cheap
pretty affordable and there's a lot of
jobs in Hartford Connecticut so it's
like a safe a safe bet was like hey I'm
basically leaving leaving New York but
still not that far
you still go to the family stuff like
that you know what I mean it's cool
Torrington torrenting or something like
that I'm looking into that area
okay Tyler Benson yeah definitely
understand some people they they have
other places that where they learning
too and they're like oh I'm gonna sign
up now get the five dollar special in
like I could lock in that damn money at
that time right so and that's fine I'm
not saying that you have to but I know
there's people out there guys there's
people out there who have signed up and
they just haven't done him and they
haven't done the videos and I'm like bro
like you're not gonna get anything out
of this the only person that's kind of
when something is me because I'm gonna
get your three dollars that you you
basically threw on my website right five
dollars for a sign up right
three dollars that I get to keep in my
pocket if you go in and you don't do
none of the courses you're not gonna get
anything I'm the one that's gonna be
winning all right I don't want to win
it's like I told people it's like even
though people that have sent me messages
and it's like I'm a I wanna donate
something to you're like don't donate
anything to me let me earn it
let me give you all the knowledge that I
have and help you out but you also have
to put in your part man it can be one
way where I'm giving you all this
content but then you don't want to do it
I don't know it's weird man I just feel
I feel bad I'm the type of person that
you know I'm looking at looking at this
as a you know as like just a regular
person I look at all of you guys as
friends to be honest with you guys right
so I feel bad to take even $3.00 from
you guys and then you guys don't get
nothing out of it I feel bad you know
what I mean if if I looked at this like
a business even like today earlier this
today I basically I splashed out right I
splashed out earlier and that's because
I'm looking at this like everybody who's
on my channel everybody
who contacts me I look at it like I'm
like you know it's like I look at you
guys like a friends alright so I'm
trying to help you guys out
I'm not looking at this as a business
and maybe I should look at it you know
after a while because so I could
disconnect myself from it right in the
sense of like hey I'm trying to help
people out but if people don't want to
get helped then I can't do nothing so I
shouldn't take your soul
so like personal like hey man I really
want you to do this like man if you
don't want to do it go ahead but at the
same time it's like man that's just the
type of person I am
you know it's like I'm super cool I'm
super nice I want to make sure everybody
succeeds everybody gets to do the right
thing that's all I really want you know
