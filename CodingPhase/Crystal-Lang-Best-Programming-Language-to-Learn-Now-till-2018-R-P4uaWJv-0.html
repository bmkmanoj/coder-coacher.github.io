joke back at it again man this encoding
face.com
listen make sure you subscribe make sure
you like this video man so today we're
going to talk about crystal Ling right
so there's a new programming language
that pretty much is just killing the
rest of the other languages out here now
I'm gonna go over this but I want to
tell you ahead of time a lot of people
are gonna be mad a lot of people is
gonna be upset a lot of people is gonna
hate on the video because you know
everybody's like oh my god
there is no blessed language I know that
but for 2017 2018 2019 this is the
language alright so check this out
latin america we got another one man you
already know mating argentina you know
the cool kids out there i'm really proud
of this because it's another language
that is coming out of latin america we
had a mixer we had new all we had a
couple of them but yeah man all right so
it compiles to native code pretty much
it goes beep beep beep beep right so
it's not like you know it's not know
diaz that's being compiled to see that's
you know like other languages that are
being compiled to another language to
another language like it's not that man
this is my elixir man this is not elixir
there's not being you know compiled to
Erlang there's pretty much being
compiled straight to crystal and then
from crystal straight to bytecode you
dick all right
syntax is almost identical to a ruby
this is why I fell in love with this
language man I'm sorry guys but elixir
is not actually just like ruby it's not
it just it's totally different is boring
I'm sorry that's my opinion but crystal
this guess my stamp alright
so this is the code right this how
actually looks very similar to Ruby if
you guys have actually done Ruby or
rails or have done something like
Sinatra you will know exactly what's
going on here which is amazing right so
aesthetically tight but it's optional
right so you could go in there and say
okay there's a strand as an integer or
maybe not if you use like I'm not gonna
do it right so it's all on you right now
concurrency all right
multiple types at the same time in other
words it's fast as hell that simple
crystal shards man package management
right like come on man you guys love NPM
and NPM is great I like you too but
package management or crystal play
shards come on man that's it I'm done
I'm done all right
they got a playground which is amazing
because you can actually come in and
like let's say I'll do something similar
to this all right play crystal and do
something like that something simple
it's pretty much like you know having
something like the terminal but which is
being on a browser I like it so how fast
are we talking about 1.2 times faster
than gold 2 times faster than mixing 8
times faster than no GS 30 times faster
than Python and 35 times faster than
Ruby that's what the I'm talking
about
man let's get it all right so what type
of frameworks we have right this world
is called camel which is it's pretty
cool I like it
similar to Sinatra pretty simple you
like okay required camel
do your route and pretty much from there
you can do sockets if you want to and
just click you know camel that run
that's it and it compiles it for you
that's simple
alright now let's see what else by the
way its conversion 0.21 okay which rooms
is still an alpha which means just like
the wild wild west man it's like where
the pilgrims right now man with the
pioneers of this thing ringa
why were you choose to learn this
language right and who is this language
for if you love Ruby forget likes and
this is the true successor to Ruby hate
the whole Alexis community hates me and
I do this for fun guys but you gotta be
honest with yourself man this language
is the best and I'm just gonna say like
this man if you love Ruby forget elixir
this is the true successor to Ruby
goddammit alright once we make a name
for yourself mr. plea to be at want to
be a pioneer just a place to be at meet
a programming language that is fast just
a place B it and you're tired of being
the little kid in the corner with no
friends man come here man come chill the
cool kid planner I'll give you a hug
bring you in you know bring you into the
the world of programming this is the
place to actually be at man if you want
to be part of the cool kids man
because 2018 is around the corner you
know this year let's leave it for
everybody else to you know kill
themselves trying to learn you know a
whole bunch of programming
languages man but next year man let's be
prepared man let's be pioneers of this
man I'm telling you guys this is where
is that trust me
all it needs is one company so people
could actually be like only god frickin
pinterest uses it oh my god thanks for
droppin see for crystal leg
then the hype is gonna start you know
how this thing is everybody start making
blocks everybody start talking
online everybody start hopping on each
other's balls right it's decimal right
so I'm sorry I had to laughs I wanted to
say happen with each other's dick but
like pretty much that's all it takes
right now all it really takes is just
one company to just be like hey guys we
build some API in the backend
made by a you know by crystal and next
thing you know the whole community is
all over it every blog is on me you're
going to start showing every single
person making tutorials about this
making videos about this well don't
forget that your boy Joe told you about
it it's that simple so make sure you
subscribe make sure you like this video
man and your boy is back man I'm about
to start doing tutorials on this
language man because I feel like we have
to be ready for next year not only just
for this year and you could start making
your projects for this because it's
actually ready to start making projects
on it and it's legit super fast I love
it but not only that but whatever you do
now you can create a package and
people's gonna notice it think about
this like imagine when nodejs came out a
lot of people hated me a lot of people
will say only goddess language is
JavaScript and is but remember
this where's no js' right now even
elixir everybody was hating on it and
look where is that right now even
goldang and look where is that right now
it takes just one company to
say hey you know hey I'm Netflix and I
basically created a signing you
know time management API using crystal
that's all they really mean
you know what I mean and then next year
is oh my god
mostly Swiss to crystal alright
guys you already knows your boy Joe back
at it again man make sure you subscribe
make sure you like this video man your
boy is back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
