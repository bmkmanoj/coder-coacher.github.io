much so much feedback from people that
you know it feels really good it shows
me that a lot of you guys are really
supporting me and I want to support you
guys too you know what I mean like then
you know I want to actually give
something back to you guys so my plan is
I'm going to be giving away about 25 to
30% of anything that I make on YouTube
right and of course I'm gonna put in for
my own money my own personal money you
know to give you guys free MacBook right
so free MacBook Pros and also give you
know a couple of you guys free udemy
courses courses that I believe that are
actually really good and that you guys
go actually mean so how is this gonna
work right this is not gonna be a
contest this is not gonna be hey whoever
keeps some pressing like whoever keeps
subscribing whoever keeps on sending
comments no this this is not about that
this is about you know the people who I
see that I feel that are really
passionate about this and I get a
certain feedback from
you know I'm going to give you guys you
know I'm definitely going to give you
guys you know a couple of MacBook Pros
I'm not rich I can't give out MacBook
Pros to every single person I can't give
out you know free udemy classes to every
single person but I'm going to spread it
out throughout this year pretty much all
right so I just want you guys to stick
with me you know support me keep
supporting me keep on showing me love
you know I see you Joseph su bollock my
boy constantly you're leaving comments I
see you out here I see you you know I
met like he's been here since the
beginning he's one of the very you know
very first subscribers and you know that
I've got I see all your ego or two I see
you know a lot of people who you know
definitely been here since the beginning
you know I see cam I see Stefan or was
it Stefan I see Daniel you know I see
you guys I see chip my boy chips been
around since the beginning constantly
you know always supporting so you know
to you guys I'm going to some you know
like I'm gonna give back to you guys you
know I don't want to be like one of this
youtuber so it's like hey they're
already making money and on top of that
then they make money on YouTube and not
give back alright so I'm actually going
to give back to you guys so I don't know
exactly what day I'm gonna you know give
out free MacBook I'm probably I'm gonna
try to see if I could buy at least three
or four and then give one out or give
them out you know to people who who
really passionate about this because at
the same time I don't even want you guys
using a Windows computer like to be
honest with you I don't use Windows I
use Mac books and I definitely you know
I want to support you guys the way how
you guys support me you know like this
whole year
I know we definitely gotta grow like
that's for sure
so as far as how much I'm gonna spend I
know that money's gonna come back no
matter what but at the same time my
program where I'm going to give people
free udemy classes that's not gonna stop
I'm going to give that to my subscribers
all year long you know so at the same
time you know leave a comment you know
share this you know show it to your
friends just let people know like you
know there's somebody who's out here who
really wants to help out anybody who
wants to be a web developer and it's not
about me trying to make money and until
this and that because I already have a
good job I already have something good
but I want you guys to be able to
actually you know grow as a person
growing your careers and you know get
the same opportunities that I got you
know and nobody you know nobody did that
for me so I kind of feel like I wanna
help out somebody else you know what I
mean like I didn't have no mentors I
didn't have no you know I didn't have
support from like you know family
support I didn't have no support from
nobody my fiance was supportive but
besides that nobody else was really
supporting me like Donna hey go ahead
and become a web developer and stop
everything that you're doing and now
start coding in you know spend two three
years of your life learning all this
stuff in one day is gonna pay off now
nobody was telling me that trust me so I
just want to support you guys and you
know give back you know what I mean so
anyways me make sure you like this video
make sure you subscribe I would tell you
when I will I will be given the you know
the the MacBook Pros I got a Bible first
I can't I don't have them in my hands
right now so I gotta first buy them and
you know I don't know if I should buy
like brand new MacBook Pros like you
know
the was right the 13 inch or 15 inch and
spent $1,500 and you know I'm able to
only give it to for five people you know
or actually maybe you know buys like you
know use MacBook Pros maybe 2013 2014
and be able to buy two or three you know
probably like double the amount of
MacBook Pros that I could actually buy
so I don't know I might do that because
at the same time is it's not about
getting hey get this brand new MacBook
Pro in your head it's not about that
it's more about like hey here's
something here's a tool for you to
continue learning and continue doing
your thing and you know I want you to do
the same thing for somebody else once
you you get into this game and you start
making money and you start living your
life and you know do it for somebody
else somebody has a dream to become a
web developer somebody has a dream to do
anything well I hate this guy from
YouTube a random guy from YouTube who's
not rich just came out of nowhere and
spent like you know a couple of thousand
dollars buying I don't you know MacBook
Pros for people just to help them you
know move forward and you know in life
in learning how to you know become a web
developer so anyways man take this share
as an inspiration and you already know
it's your boy job back at it again make
sure you subscribe and make sure you
