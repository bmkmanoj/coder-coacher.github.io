your boy we are alive okay
sorry guys there's the you know
technical difficulties man right this is
what we call a life's not perfect you
know what I mean like life is not
perfect and this is the things that we
got to bump into sometimes you know now
can you guys see me can y'all see me let
me know I can hear you could hear me
what you can't see can you hear me and
can't you see me you know what I mean
like that's the whole thing like I know
this works you know what I mean like I
know the the OBS be be acting up but I
know this for sure works I'm pretty sure
wanna go live
live right now Jesus Christ please
please Xfinity I'm paying you $130 a
month Xfinity hold me down Jesus Christ
like and I get to do my life live show
you know what I mean
okay now we should be good now we
connected to the 5g now we should be
good
Jesus Christ man this is crazy all right
so yeah man that's the thing but I enjoy
doing live videos you know John this and
I says man you might have to record Joe
and it's like man I don't want to record
I want to be live with my peoples you
know what I mean
all right that's that Connecticut wave
man yeah man so anyways what I wanted to
talk about why was about the website so
you know we we basically just stepping
it up as you guys may know for the past
few months basically the website has
been sending people directly to
teachable calm alright so what I'm going
to do is now we read revamping coding
freeze calm we changing a lot of stuff
we we building a whole new page
we're building a whole new page we're
building a lot of cool stuff so I wanted
to show it to you guys man and also you
know like once I finished doing the
final touches to the design what I'm
planning on doing is sorry about that
um it's actually coming in and putting
this like open source meaning now we're
not gonna have an open source 100% way
so hey man copy the code and take
everything that you know our car for but
like let's say any changes that you
might want to do to the website you can
submit a you know submitted through
github and you're gonna be able to
change the site like let's say we're
gonna have to website up and you say hey
Joe you misspell something right or hey
Joe there's actually a better way to you
know write down this description or hey
Joe there is a you know a couple of new
resources that I found online I want to
share it with the people whoever wants
to come in and and basically you know be
able to change the website you can do at
any moment I know a pull request I know
that for sure
but I'm saying it for the people that
don't know there's so many people that
just don't know get up in here like it's
never funny but I want to make sure to
have you guys more in the community and
be able to just pretty much is like it's
my site but at the same time it's not
really my site is like your site like
this is for the community you know what
I'm saying so that's what I'm trying to
do right now and
yeah man like I wanted to show you guys
in your site man I noticed this whole
thing where it's driving me crazy too
with the whole lagging of the video like
I don't understand why is it lagging
like it shouldn't be lagging at all on
the livestream like I'm in my house like
I'm not a sign out on the cell phone why
is it lagging but yeah man it's crazy
and what sucks is I'm just thinking
right now I'm gonna have to call X
Trinity and call up for them to put in
business Internet right which is gonna
cost four hundred dollars just to put it
up to be able to get like 25 megabytes
up and they charge like three hundred to
four hundred dollars for that and it's
ridiculous it's like y'all this is why
enough for nothing this is why you know
net neutrality can actually be good for
some people if they decide to start
fixing the infrastructure like I don't
mind paying more for my internet as long
as the infrastructure is fixed you get
what I'm saying like they were running
internet through like old-ass wires like
you know the only people that have like
that like the legit Internet is Verizon
FiOS then everybody else has like really
shitty internet but anyways right let's
go into it man let me see if I could
share share this screen man give you
guys a little preview of what the site
is going to look like
yo man my fault man I don't even know
what the hell's going on with this
Internet oh no what the hell is going on
right now yeah I'm so pissed off man I
wish you guys don't know how much uh um
how much I hate that things just don't
go the way how you wanted to go man I
hate that and she really fucking pisses
me off man like trying to do this live
video I came into my live video man if
it's not one thing is the other man
anyways can you guys see me right now or
not this is crazy
Jesus Christ man so now
routers like so fucking far from here
man I'm gonna have to connect like it's
crazy like I know Tech doesn't work man
but I get pissed off man like I'm paying
a lot of money to this company you gotta
say like it's a difference if if you
come in here and say hey man I got
freaking the MetroPCS of Internet then
that's on me
you get what I'm saying but 130 dollars
for Internet that don't even work like
that really pisses me off
like why is the internet so slow out
here man yeah man I anyways what I
wanted to show you guys was the new site
man maybe I probably just do a video
about it cuz it's just like there so
anyways let me see if I can share the
screen so here's the website man this
how things is gonna be looking I mean
this the this is the beginning stages of
it we got the front page done I already
have the designs for for the cloud the
courses pages pretty much is like when
you land on coding phase com this is
what you're gonna be greeted with on the
top you're gonna get the latest episode
from coding phase on YouTube you're
gonna be able to click there and watch
it directly you're also going to get you
know whatever is new whatever are the
latest courses they're gonna show up
according to whatever options you choose
so now we're going to to have a thing
where you're gonna be able to come in to
the website take a quiz right it's more
like a psyche test to see what type of
developer you should be all right you
could also skip it at any moment you can
skip it like let's say if you're more a
visual person or creative person you
know you're leaning more to the front
end if you're somebody that's trying to
improve your skills as a programmer as a
developer you're gonna be able to pretty
much see more back in and more
programming courses okay so it's gonna
be catered to you guys right depending
on on what you want
so I'm also in connect in connection
with a very good data scientist this
dude that I know from back in the back
in the days one one of the first
companies I used to work with
you know it's basically a stating
contact with this person right so he's a
data scientist we have a lot of data on
everybody right as far as how long you
bring on a course how long you've been
studying how long you lose interest do
you change to you scroll like there's
data on everybody which is exactly what
I wanted right because I want to be able
to cater to you guys I want you guys to
have the best experience on coding
face.com
not just like hey here's a website you
know what I mean because I've come I've
come to every single website out there
I've been to every single website that
it's out there like you know team
treehouse Cole all sincerity treehouse
Pluralsight you to me coke atom II free
coke amp solo learn all those websites
all right and I've I've seen the good
the bad the ugly in every single website
so what I want to do with this site you
know we have a great community here all
right we have more than enough to
actually be successful at what we're
doing right and the whole idea behind
this is I want you guys to have the best
experience and everybody else who comes
after you guys you know the next two
three months a lot of you guys is pretty
much like graduating you guys are
already good right a lot of you guys is
gonna be getting jobs and you're gonna
move on you know just like everybody
else does you know it's fine
you know people come in they use the
website for what it is they use the
channel for what it is
once they get jobs they disappear you
know what I mean but that's fine
I'm not mad at that right but what I
want to do is I want to make sure that
people stay here all right not just okay
we mess with Joe we like Joe's channel
we'll see him on YouTube once in a while
but we want to be able to give you guys
reasons to stay on the website how can
we make you know ray now I think like
average subscriber to the website stays
in about an hour and a half to two hours
birthday alright so how can we make it
to four hours all right
now you probably think that's like oh
man Joe was like that's my time we're
gonna be spending on the website no it's
not just about that because at the same
time I want you guys to have
interactions right you know we're gonna
have to chat room we're gonna have
different sections for you guys to come
in and and practice your coding same way
how solo learning same way house a frico
camp they all have these sections okay
they have all the sections for you guys
to practice and it's great it's like I
told you guys
free coke and solo learning all those
websites are great for practice but it's
not the the end of all right it's not
like okay I go to freako camp and I say
that's all I need right I want to make
this website everything that you need
right meaning a place where you could
practice a place where you're gonna be
able to have a great community a place
where you're gonna have great courses a
place where you're gonna get people
coming in and dropping and releasing new
courses constantly it's not just like oh
somebody created a course and it's
outdated no I want this to be constantly
being updating you know a new content
being created for you guys alright like
I told you guys I see this as as not
just as YouTube channel this YouTube
channel is going to help right it helps
to promote it it helps to show you guys
I hate I'm the creator of this I'm the
one that started this thing out of
nowhere you know I didn't want to do a
YouTube I didn't want to do a website
and want to do anomalous stuff but I
found out that basically it's hard to
become a developer I went through the
whole process everything that I I know
now take me five years right does it
have to take five years no I think you
could learn everything that I know in a
year and a half
everything that took me five years I
know it can be broken down to a year and
a half
all right so that's what I want to do
with you guys and be able to just you
know whatever you decide to do hate you
want to become a data scientist I'm
gonna have a couple of people's that
they're really good with that right you
want to become a Don net developer we're
gonna have that dotnet courses you want
to become a Python developer become a
Python developer if you wanna become a
you know or you know JavaScript nodejs
whatever you want to do is gonna be here
but the whole idea of the website is how
can we make it easier for you on your
journey right without you having to jump
to you know you could be a frico camp
trying things out you could go to solo
learn to go ahead and practice things
you can go to code dodging for
algorithms you can go to you to me to go
learn a new course on react you can go
to youtube to find out what's the latest
crash course that um you know traversing
media just released you can have all of
those things right well how can we
create a platform in a place for you
guys to just say hey we have all of
those things in one single place and
that's what coding face.com is gonna be
in the next few months I mean you guys
gonna start seeing the things you know
as far as the courses the courses are
still going to be hosting on teachable
comm but we're connecting teachable calm
to our website as an API so we're
basically using their platform to host
all our videos but the whole community
and everything that I'm telling you guys
about is gonna be on coding phase com
so it's like once you say hey I want to
take the let's say the Python course you
click on the link that takes you
directly to your course on coding phase
comm it's gonna be courses that coding
phase calm so automatically it takes you
there
once you say hey man I want to see my
you know I wanna see my you know my
favorite videos or I want to see hey I
want to find out my favorite youtubers
whatever I'm gonna integrate all of that
into this one website so pretty much
instead of you going to youtube.com and
finding you know some BS video there and
taking you forever to find new content
and new videos all of that is gonna be
there for you on the feed so you could
have all your favorite youtubers you
could have all your favorite content on
one single place okay as you learn as
you continue your career as a developer
so it's all coming in full circle and
it's all going to be coding face.com you
know what I mean like your boy got a DAB
on it you know what I mean like somehow
you know give me a year man give me a
year we're gonna be out here like this
you know dabbing and we're gonna be like
yo we out in you're late man we out here
with the squad yo yo Chris Shawn come
outside listen man we got a lot of this
stuff man and then on top of that this
is something that I was talking to wifey
and I want to do um basically ask the
website progress and more people come in
and you know we want to give back right
we want to give back in the way to give
back is to help people who are less
fortunate than us I remember whoever's
being here from the beginning you you
guys remember that first livestream I
did I say man all I want to do is be
able to give out free laptops be able to
help out people and you know get I was
already giving free courses you know
back in what like January February of
2017 right out of my own pocket not me
getting a cold from Crone you know from
cold steel I wasn't gonna go from Steven
Grider that was me going into my credit
card paying it for somebody to like hey
man you need this go ahead take your
course
so now I want to bring that back but
with coating face.com
so what I want to do is I don't know
exactly what would be the best way
because I know people will try to game
the system but I want to give like
coding phase scholarship where we pretty
much give access to people that really
need this like you know people are like
developing countries you know
third-world countries you you're in
Ethiopia and you want to become a
developer you want to get your skills up
how can we facilitate you that and be
able to you know help you out on your
journey
all right you are in you know in
Zimbabwe you are in freaking in Chile
you are in you know El Salvador you are
in you know Ukraine you are in I don't
even if Ukraine even exists I love
saying Ukraine oh I was the other one
that I love to say Czechoslovakia all
right I love saying checks on walkie I
don't know why um you are in Greece
right you're you're not in a perfect
world right now you're Liberia right
you're in Libya I don't know all right I
get people from all over the world I'm
constantly helping people out which is
what you guys don't see you know a lot
of you guys don't see this I'm
constantly helping people out so what I
do is when you guys subscribe to my my
website you subscribe to my channel what
I do with that is I come in and I take
most of the you know the income that I
get from here from YouTube from the
website and I give out free courses I
don't promote this I don't be the okay
yeah I'm just giving out free courses
but I do it alright so now what I want
to do is I'm gonna say hey we're gonna
have like a scholarship type thing where
it's like people who come in from let's
say the top 50 poorest countries in the
world right
we give them free access right well
people from Haiti people from you know I
don't know the medical Republic we give
them free access and I know some people
might be like well why they gotta get it
for free is because they don't have the
same opportunities that we we don't have
you know like that we have actually you
know what I mean so it's like that's the
only way to help the world out you know
what I mean is like if I have a piece of
bread right and I could eat for that day
even though I pay for that bread I could
eat half of it and you don't have no
money I could give you that bread and
say hey here you go here's bread you eat
for the day all right
even though tomorrow I don't know if I'm
gonna be able to eat but that's the type
of person that I I am you know what I
mean I hope that makes sense yes so
that's what I want to do I'm setting all
of this stuff up you know a lot of
people been hitting me up they want to
become part of you know the coding phase
team you know we making this official
man you know we get in the whole LLC we
getting you know everything copy writing
the copy writing our logo has already
sent the copyrights for it it's already
sent it's on the way I already got my
email back like yeah they do the
paperwork so coding phase comm is
already copyright there's a lot of stuff
going on man it's like business stuff
and things going on you know I was doing
the numbers the way how we are growing
and the way how the channel is growing
and how we are helping people out
there's people that came in like today
right there was this kid who I helped
out I helped out um you know six months
ago right
he came in there's a true story he came
in and he was like hey man you know I
was a refugee from how you called it
from I forgot one of those countries
from from Africa right he was a refugee
he he was living in in in Germany and
then basically I helped him out gave him
a free course whatever he got a job now
he's working now as a developer over
there in Germany he put in the work that
was around like March now in January he
caught a job on his first paycheck he
came back he said Joe I made $1500 on my
first paycheck
from that $1500 I'm paying $300 for the
lifetime membership right now did he
need to do that no he did that because I
helped him out when he didn't have
nothing right he came in does he need
the lifetime membership probably not
because he already learned so much right
so what does that mean that $300 that he
paid for in reality is all I'm gonna do
is go in and start giving out free
courses to other people that really need
it so it's just like it's a cycle you
know what I mean and I feel like when I
do good things good things come to me
you know and all I want is blessings I
want blessings for my family I want
blessings for everybody that I know so
that's what we're doing we have to do
good things for others so good things to
come to us so that's what I'm doing
Reena you know what I mean so let me see
in the chatroom what you guys think do
you guys like like the idea you know we
definitely you know we we try to help
each other out man like that's the only
way to do this man to be honest with you
guys man like that's the only way so
yeah man the website is gonna be legit
we have a lot of cool stuff basically
right now I still don't know where I'm
gonna do the stack which stack I'm gonna
do the backend I'm finishing up the
front end which is gonna be all done in
HTML CSS are basically JSX cuz
everything is done in react all right so
it's gonna be a single page app is gonna
have nice animations everything is done
as a single page app but it's gonna be
legit you know what I mean like plus as
you guys can see I want it to be that
when you look at it it doesn't look like
a website alright I want it to be like I
don't know like when you look at it
through a TV when you look at it through
our phone when you look at it through a
tablet a laptop I wanted to feel the
same way in every single device and I
wanted to feel like this is a user
interface is not a website right there's
a user interface so that's what we're
doing right now it's pretty legit man
everything that I'm coming out with
right now it's coming out pretty dope
man like this is just the beginning
so and then probably by the end of the
week I should be done with the front end
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put
out the front end side of the website
the back end is going to take like a
week or two to get it done it's not
really that deep you know some part of
the site is going to be done
most likely with Python because we wanna
take all the data that we already have
on everybody and it's not like we're
like Big Brother checking through
everybody's cookies not it's more like
we want to be able to give you the best
courses and best content that you will
really like you know I mean so some part
of it is gonna be done in Python
still if he if I I want to be
adventurous I'm like I want to be you I
want to be adventurous and put some gold
laying on it but at the same time I'm
like should i do golang you know what I
mean like like I want to be adventurous
I want to be adventurism like man I
haven't done a website to this magnitude
goal a you get what I'm saying like I've
done a lot of projects that are personal
projects I've done a lot of online
projects I'm going but this is like a
pretty big site that we're building this
is not gonna be like oh yeah there's
like you know you you have a little blog
like a blogs like the beginning stages
a sign you know of any type of website
you know it's just a simple crud no but
this thing is gonna have a lot of things
so I don't know I want to do it in
golang I want to challenge myself to
doing golang but am I kind of doing
goaling I don't know yet I might just
keep it safe and be like okay man I've
already done like a million in one sites
with laravel or Ruby on Rails so I don't
know you know what I mean I'm still in
the air what am I gonna do live back in
or you know but the site so far man I
feel like showing you guys done like
somewhat of designs man but the thing is
like I don't wanna I want to show you
guys the designs but at the same time I
don't want to show it because if I show
you guys everything right now is like
the day I released the web site is gonna
be like yeah we saw it Joe whoop-dee-doo
you know what I mean
I wanted that you guys come into the
same like whoa coding face.com came in
with the with the buckets you know what
I mean like I want you guys to come in
there and be surprised I mean I show you
guys just the front end just the front
homepage but you know it's a lot of
stuff man it's a lot of cool things man
you're gonna be like whoa yeah man so
what do you guys think man let me see
I'm reading the comments right now man
should make a mobile app yes that's the
next thing man that's the next thing
like once I finish the site which it's
it should take no more than two three
weeks for me to finish this whole
website right once I finish the site
then from there I'm gonna do everything
with react native and half everything on
on the site you know yeah I'm just
reading everybody's comments man music
storm is like
from Argentina the internet connection
that I can afford is 0.6 megabytes
damn that sucks man yeah man yeah no
it's a good thing man this kid he didn't
have to do it you know what I mean he
came in he said yo you helped me out you
you pay for my my udemy courses and it's
like here's 300 bucks
right they he have to do it no but it
just showed me like you never know you
know what I mean like let's say you know
there's a lot of people here who are
very talented right who are very very
talented right you know a lot of people
are very talented out here and people
that don't even know that they're
talented right but all they need is that
little push if I can be that little bit
of push a little motivation in their
lives then I'm good plus you never know
when that thing is gonna pay off you
know I was like hey who knows 10 years
from now right 10 years from now I'm
like somewhere in the world I don't know
I mean let's say Texas right for example
I go into a company and I'm about to get
hired and one other person one of the
people that's there that's interviewing
me it's like hey hey Joe I was just I
was a subscriber to coding phase comment
I love what you're doing man I love what
what you did out there that are not and
now I got the job because I helped that
person out you know the world you know
it's like it does a full circle you know
one moment you're here and another
moment you're down here and that's just
how it works
so it's like when you do good things for
other people somehow that always pays me
back you know what I mean like I'll be
bumping into people that helped out like
five years ago and I see
like y'all you know that show love you
know so that's what I'm saying you know
so it's like we just got to help each
other out man
really say yo can you grow your hair out
listen man if I grow my hair all you're
gonna see is just hair back here man
that's gone man
let it go I'll let it go a long time ago
man it's gone man
I'm out here okay well you used to react
your current website uses angular but
you told me that you use react yes my
website and this is a thing that's not
my website teachable calm is not my my
website guys you know if you look it up
how much hosting videos cost and the
type of traffic that we get on the
website if I was to start hosting my own
videos my own servers and doing
everything myself it will probably cost
me I don't know like 800 dollars a month
right to do everything or even more
because sometimes it spikes sometimes we
might get like you know like 400 users
at one time or we might get like you
know I don't know like 20,000 people in
one single day it happens right so then
I will have to be worried about scaling
and doing all this stuff so I don't
worry about that what I do is I hire
teachable teachers you as a teachable
calm we come in I sign up for the
website I pay $100 $100 and then
everything else after that is on them
you know it's like I get unlimited
hosting for videos unlimited bandwidth
so it makes sense
you know if you try to do it yourself
maybe later on if we get to a certain
point where the website is completely
paying for everything and I don't have
to come out out of my own pocket then
yeah you will see all the whole sting
being done on my website and everything
will be reacted but teachable use this
angular so I can't do anything about it
let me see what else I'm
everybody the way will be to get it up
and change you over to : yeah yeah no
that's what I'm probably gonna do man
listen man you Joe where's the pop
filter guys I can't do everything in
this world like I can't go get a
microphone find out how to connect this
Internet be good like there's a lot of
stuff man I start complaining
John dislike come on man like I'm doing
a website I'm doing courses online I got
my own other websites where they
generate Maya you know the money that I
I survive on all this YouTube stuff is
like extra you know so it's like
I couldn't go to freakin Guitar Center
today man for you so let me see ya man I
will not
when you do good things good things come
from you yeah will you use Vimeo Vimeo
is bad man Vimeo sucks to be honest with
you some of the smartest and most
powerful people have no hair look at
Jeff Jeff Bezos yeah man that's how it
is man
so we grinding right now man we got a
lot of good ideas man good things that
are coming and don't think I forgot
about you know the the courses that I
told you guys that I'm gonna build this
week I'm also doing that so you know
let's matter of fact let's talk about
the results right let's look at the
results on this let me see what a Google
Forms so the results I haven't even
looked at it
maybe it changed by now
okay so Oh things changed up huh
let me see
so things changed up kids
so I'm guessing people want to see some
react native ah so look number one came
out react native number two Craigslist
clone with react react and redux the
complete course third one was that the
fourth one came out million web dev
started kid go what pack let's see was
the other one react router complete
course let me see what else another HTML
CSS responsive site face it yes game and
then we got a whole bunch other stuff in
here that got added but doesn't seem
like anybody else you know so seems like
react native one kids alright but I
still have to do this one no even though
react native one this is the one that
I'm gonna do where I after tomorrow
morning I gotta knock this out I've been
telling people for a long time I'm gonna
teach him how to do they don't start a
cake it's better because a lot of people
is gonna be able to understand what's
going on in the starter kit people think
like it's something out of this world
all it is is just go p-- and web pack
and then a whole bunch of other packages
but I'm gonna knock this out and then
from there we do react native that'll be
fun because react native is pretty easy
now let me show my cameraman because I'm
gonna put it out there I'm gonna put it
out there man
listen I'm gonna put this out there I
guess areas and stuff guys listen when I
do this react native course I don't want
to hear nobody crying and bleh
oh my god it doesn't work on my Windows
PC young you gotta go out of your way to
learn how to debug your own computer
guys you know these people out here that
I'm trying to help you guys but you have
to do something else too you have to put
in a little bit of yourself into this
man I can't hold your hand I can't teach
you every single thing I can't be like
this is the power button this is where
you turn on the computer guys like the
minimum things you need to learn you
need to learn on your own and figure out
how to work with your Windows computer
you know and also too you cannot make a
I mean you can make it but I know a lot
of people are not gonna go through the
ups and downs and and in the headaches
of windows so the iOS app that if we
build a react native app the iOS app is
not going to work perfectly in your
Windows computer so I'm putting it out
there because people somehow is like man
is like hey Cho how can I make this you
know iOS app work on my windows is like
bro you need Xcode so to build anything
you're gonna have to lie to get a
MacBook or you know what I mean like I
can't do everything for you man like
even the best developers out there are
using Mac books for a reason it's like
or even get an older Mac Pro man you
could get a Mac Pro for 600 bucks man
this what I'm saying sometimes I get
tight I get tight because it's like you
know it's like some guy to send me a
comment it's like yeah that was like a
video that I did like a year ago it's
like oh the top five
udemy courses rights on fire udemy
courses and this guy leaves a comment oh
that sucks
I thought that we're gonna be free like
burro think do people understand like
people have to eat you get what I sound
like do you go to a pizzeria and be like
ah man just came to the pizzeria man I
thought all the pieces here was free do
you go to the store and be like oh man I
came here I watched this whole video I
thought I thought uh you know Macy's was
free auto close i Macy was was free
think like really like sometimes III
just be thinking in my head I'm like yo
man like where do like where do people
get this idea like these soaps you know
entitled to things man like I think the
internet you know as far as like when
the internet came out and like having
mp3s and having BitTorrent sand and you
know Pirate Bay and all that stuff that
kind of corrupted the world man because
people actually feel like everything
should be free you know when I was a
little kid I'm not gonna lie I used to
download Dragon Ball Z movies but you
know what I used to have all all of the
VHS in my house I used to have all 13
other movies in my house in a big rack
of VHS and all the Dragon Ball Z
episodes you know the ones that showed
the whole image of like freakin the
dragon and all of that stuff like I used
to have the whole stack VHS right so I
used to download it I used to have two
VHS which mean I already bought it you
know what I mean so it's like sometimes
I'll be like man how do you go by in
this world of like thinking man like
everything you're entitled to it and
like you can't
anything of back
yes I mean I would do the backboard
backbone.js easy that's one of the first
frameworks that I started with but the
problem is like if I do backbone GS is
like who's gonna watch it you got what
I'm saying like nobody's gonna watch it
you gotta say so so that's it and that's
the thing man let me see
Vimeo sucks sucks man
Vimeo unfortunately the quality is
really good but their business model
sucks is like they try to charge you
like I don't know like a hundred dollars
or something like that for like 15
gigabyte 15 gigabytes per month or
something like that of like that's how
much you can upload to their website and
as I burn like 15 gigabytes I eat that
in one day you know what I mean like in
15 videos that's a 15 gigabytes is done
you know so that's why I teach it was is
legit
let me see co new truth so silver blaze
I go since the truth
okay then add as insights our bread and
butter
yeah man
that's not Democratic enough I mean
that's the thing that's like you know if
you don't go to vote you can't be mad
who becomes the president
you get what I'm saying there's like
15,000 people here out of those 15,000
people only a hundred forty-four voting
so I guess that's you know those are the
people that matter because they care to
actually vote all for you know 14,000
people they didn't care so you know
there wasn't they they wouldn't care
what course goes up anyways you know
what I mean
let me see coÃ±o says can I run it on my
Mac or iPhone yes you can run it on your
Mac in your iPhone is it gonna become
parable with Android or only for iOS um
I don't know once I start building it I
will see which one if we do both of them
or not because the problem with it is
it's like this the problem we're
building for both of them is like then
we have to go into the Android API we
have to go in there and work with your
Windows PC and do a whole bunch of stuff
and like it's not as easy as hey I'm
building from a Mac and I'm building for
iOS like you know what I mean if not I
might use like like an online service
for react native so I believe react
native online ID thing rippled a'ight e
has it so maybe I'll just use ripple to
I T to teach react native so like that
nobody could be crying cuz nobody can
cry about this and be like okay you know
and they could use their export client
to use it so like you could scan this
right and if you have Android you have
iOS Apple phone right you can scan this
and automatically with the expo app you
can see the application that you're
building on your phone okay so you could
just run this phone now connected please
scan so
basically you have to do this whole
thing scanning and there from there you
could run it directly on on your phone
okay so instead of you watching it on
your computer you would actually watch
it here
so it's pretty cool alright and that's
for the people that's gonna be crying
like I can't get it working on my
windows is like listen man I'm teaching
it to you but you have to go out of your
way and figure out how why your computer
is not working you know that's I can't
do that for you from my house
you know Graham Izzy Jordan I don't know
what Ramsay jointing is talking about he
says I'm you're saying her $600 was
readily available people wouldn't be
asking for free courses Joe I don't know
let me see world says I ain't gonna buy
a Mac just go for an iPhone nah man is
up it's all what you wanna do man
you know if your windows this is the
thing guys the people that I'm talking
about are the people that they're not
experts they're just like you know like
imagine this there's people on the
website think of your mom right you know
how your mom comes in and be like hey
could you come in and and freakin change
my profile picture on facebook you as a
person who have been using the internet
and using your computer for over 10 20
years you know how to do that shit right
away but there's users here there's
people who are here who are trying to
get into web development who don't know
a lot of those things they they don't
know how to go into their command line
and and go in there and set up you know
Python and set up a whole bunch of
things that node need to be working with
or set up or you know an environment
like
a lot of people don't know those things
right now as a user you come in and you
say oh man this thing is super hard it's
super difficult so that turns you off
from actually learning to coding and
getting into it all right so what I do
is I come in and say you know what
before people even quit I'm gonna create
a web developer starter kit so here you
go he's a web developer starter kit so
you don't have to go through the hurdles
in in the headache of building all this
stuff right so all you have to do is hit
the ground running start coding right if
you find that you love coding you will
learn all of this other stuff right but
to hit people as soon as they come in
with the most difficult things to do
like it's not good it's not good for
them cuz they get turned off you know
it's like I don't want to learn how to
code it's hard you know what I mean it's
the same thing with uh you know with
Windows computer like people get turned
off they were not oh man I gotta go
through hell just to install nodejs for
some reason it doesn't work on my
computer for whatever reason is is
giving me an error so what I do is like
hey man I want them to start coding
right away I don't want them to focus on
the setup instead I want us to start
coding cuz once you find that passion
for coding you're gonna go out of your
way to figure out how to install
everything on your computer you get what
I'm saying
but yeah man yeah I've done the
in taja it's not really good yeah man
people be complaining about everything
man let me see recently just started
using typescript overreact at work I
think you changed things up a lot have
you used that combo uh I tried it I
didn't like it because the thing is that
most of the setups for typescript is
already built right somebody else
already built that for you but building
a setup with typescript from the ground
up it's a headache it's like going
through hell and then coming back and
say oh yeah guys I'm a 70 year old man
now and it's like everybody's oh sure
what the hell you want Joe was like 9
man I was just trying to set up this
typescript like that's the thing I don't
like about typescript plus they
constantly bringing out new new versions
and adding new stuff to typescript and
it's like I don't know I rather just
stick to es6 and I'm good but yeah nummy
see running
later yeah well that's the thing people
can burn an emulator but there's people
that don't know how to run the emulator
that's the thing what's the surprise man
you guys gotta go watch it again man
rewind the video man rewind the video I
already talked about it basically it's
like sorry are we bringing in a whole
bunch of stuff to coating face.com we're
gonna have machine learning so make sure
to serve you guys with the best courses
we're gonna have some quizzes online
that's gonna help you out like a lot of
stuff man I don't even know how to
explain it I don't want to explain it I
already explained it like why like 40
minutes ago 30 minutes ago after we went
through the headache of like hey man
this internet sucks but yeah man
let me let me clear this up man cuz I
got a I got a delete those streams that
that trying to do in the beginning we
got a delete that some people don't see
that tomorrow morning
oh sure what happened here all right
cool
yeah man
trying to get this
have to work refresh this real quick
yeah man so rebel dye IT has react
native from the ID so we probably use
that but yeah man hey business like
yours I saw some nice beats you got man
somebody always got to say something
else
yeah man this half
on smelling his headphones man like even
when back in the days I mean I bought
the first beats that came out but those
things sounded trash compared to this
Bose headphones that I used to have they
sounded trash it was just all about like
the marketing you know you see LeBron
James with the beats you see freaking
Drake with the beats you see all these
people with the beats and it's like when
you listen to it and you compare it to
another company cell phones you like you
know those headphones are trash
but let me see
yeah I was like looking and going over
like angular 5 I was doing a project
right so one thing that people don't
know
I recorded a angular 5 course right and
then I deleted it I scraped it I was
like yeah I don't even want to I don't
even want to put this out because it was
it wasn't bad it was just like annoying
I was like man I'm not focusing on
angular like I know angular I know
angular 1 like the back of my hand
I know angular 2 a pretty you know
pretty good angular 4 or 5 is the same
thing but the amount of like stuff that
you have to do just to get one
application up and running is ridiculous
like the amount of things that you got
to learn is freaking ridiculous and it's
like that's what I said um when I was
doing the review about angular 5 I was
like yo I can understand why people want
to jump to view right because I think
the big calling for view it's the fact
that if you can pick up the people that
like angular right angular 2 and up is
it's annoying the whole typescript
process is annoying the whole or
decorators are annoying every jogging is
annoying you look into the documentation
of angular let's look at the
documentation of angular just to prove a
point now that we talking about it I'll
be want to make a video about this so
let me see let's go to the documentation
like oh man you're the
stuff if you look at the documentation
of angular the amount of stuff that you
have to to learn the amount of ng this
ng that ng your mom's whatever right the
amount of things that you have to go
through is beyond ridiculous and just to
create a very simple component you gotta
do like a you know connect this to
bootstrap connect this to the app
component connect this to this and that
and it's like bro all I wanted to do was
just create a form that says hi Jo right
that's all I wanted to do you gotta go
in there and do a full process man like
angular is horrible so think about I
mean the new angular and in the way that
they're doing things I don't think is
it's the right place of gold man burkay
is AI
you know I'm catching up to you guys
three times speed yeah man but I know
angular has so many jobs out there man
but you know
yeah go ahead know what man I'm about to
get out of here - I'm about to start
coding - men we hang down for a wife for
like an hour so we good that's enough
yeah let me see what else man peace be a
but yeah so going back to the viewing
angler thing like I think if you can
definitely pick up the angular
developers because I don't understand
why a lot of the angular developers and
people who their brain works like that
right in their head they think that HTML
should not be mixed with JavaScript like
a JavaScript file needs to be in a
JavaScript file right uh HTML should be
in a HTML file that's it
but to me that'll make sense because
it's like hey if you are rendering
something from a JavaScript file and
you're rendering into an element like
let's say a div with the idea of app why
should you have a template file instead
of just putting it inside of the
JavaScript file I don't know why so a
lot of people they choose view GS
because they're like oh man I'm just not
gonna do that and this and this and that
but if you wanna get it also - you don't
have to use webpack or anything like
that so you could just use view without
webpack or nothing just with a script
tag and those things are appealing they
seem pretty cool but to me I'm like wait
I think about him lay hold on if you
really want to get the full power of you
you still have to use webpack
like if you want to use SAS if you want
to use how you call this what's the name
of the file they have their own file I
forgot the name of the file I forgot the
name of the file for game for view I
don't know if you X of view or something
like that I forgot the name of it but
yeah man
it's like I don't know it's like it
doesn't make sense it's like if I'm
working on JavaScript I want to be in a
JavaScript file I don't want my thing
separated by a template like I don't
need to have it's already hard enough to
have a full like a full application and
you see like there's a million folders
now you gotta have two million folders
because you have one folder from the
JavaScript and then the you know the
other folder which is gonna be just for
the template is ridiculous
if you are PHP developer are you then
technically a back-end developer yes PHP
is the backend but yeah guys I'm out of
here man
hopefully you guys get to enjoy
everything now I'm bringing you guys
this week in this next few weeks and
we're gonna be in here
you already know Superboy joke coding
freeze comm go to the website go sign up
there's a lot of free courses in there
take advantage of the free courses also
to take advantage of the chat room go
into the chat is connected through this
cord you download the app you get all
the notifications of what's going on in
the community alright guys I'm out of
here
