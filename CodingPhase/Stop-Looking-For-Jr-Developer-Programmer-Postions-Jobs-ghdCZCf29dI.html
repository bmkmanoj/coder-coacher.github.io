again : face calm your boys backing out
and did it again alright guys so today's
topic now we hear we move to Connecticut
is basically hey stop looking for junior
developer jobs period you guys this
video is brought to you by viewers like
you and people that support our website
coding phase comm go check it out over
20 courses in there that's gonna guide
you to become a developer from the
beginning to become an approach
alright so so start talking about this
what I'm gonna say is you're limiting
yourself as a developer so just say hey
I'm looking just for junior developer
positions you will be surprised how many
jobs are out there willing to hire you
just because you apply right good
because you got the skills you know it's
very rare to find online try to search
yourself look along with as junior
developer position or junior front and
guy junior back-end guy guys that's like
a unicorn that's like finding a unicorn
out here you know I mean so it's like
what are you going to do are you just
gonna stand still wait until the day
that somebody decides to be like hey
we're gonna add a junior position to
this job
no just start applying stop worrying
about if you're going to be able to do
the job stop worrying about are they
gonna hire you know you will find out
when you go to the interview right
you're gonna be surprised
usually when a company puts out we're
looking for a junior developer it means
they already try to search for senior
they're already try to search for a
mid-level they already try to search for
any type of developer out there right
and then there are you know what man we
can't find nobody so give us an extra
hand so let's just put in junior
position junior developer to see what we
find
that's one case another case is hey they
don't want to pay a mid-level to a
senior level developer but you will come
in and you apply to it you might get a
chance to get hired you know what I mean
so just apply man stop little meeting
yourself to just showing up to this
Junior position you don't need it you
know to be honest with you that's why I
tell you guys bill your portfolio so you
don't have to rely so much on stuff like
that like hey does it say junior can I
get the job now don't worry about that
you know what I mean like if you could
do the job you got the portfolio you got
the right you know applications you've
done everything from you know from HTML
CSS JavaScript you've dealt with the
backend you went in and nodejs you tried
node you tried a PHP you try Ruby you
know my sequel you know MongoDB you
don't have to be an expert in all of
them but you have to you know if you
have the idea of just like getting your
feet wet in it like most likely you're
going to get hired right you gotta
understand this one thing that you're
gonna notice a lot of times no matter
how much you know when you go to a job
you don't know anything I'll be honest
you just don't know because number one
you don't know how they setup is number
two you don't know how the deployment
system is number three you don't know
what framework they're using sometimes
they tell you hey we use react but they
use react completely different so no
matter what you still gonna have to go
through the process of getting trained
you know what I mean now as far as
training is really good to go into a
company hit the ground running and when
I say hit the ground running is you
understand all the concepts you
understand what's going on you never
want to be in a company where they're
like oh man you know we're gonna have to
train this guy for three months because
you don't know anything
that means they messed up in the hiring
process and that means you oversold
yourself okay you never want to be in a
company that you basically come in and
swindle your way in because at some
point they're gonna fire you you know
what I mean like usually when somebody
comes in as a junior developer or just a
regular developer let's say let's take
away that tie to junior developer just a
developer right somebody who comes in
and got hired we are expecting for that
person to know the basics know other
concepts be able to pick up on
technologies like this we don't want to
come in there but hey man down we're
gonna have to teach this person you know
let's say for example if they use
functional programming
you don't need to be an expert in
functional programming for understand
the concepts because everything else
they're going to show it to you how they
do it in their process but if you don't
understand the concepts of it now they
have to go in there and teach you the
concepts teach you the training teach
you how to do the deployment teach you
how to do everything you know so it's
like stop worrying so much about hey man
is this a junior level position stop
worrying about that if let's say for
example you went through my website
right you already did
HTML CSS you knock that out you cool I
could give you a design and you could
build that right cool
you're perfect already right you could
definitely get a front-end position
nowadays they need more a little bit
more of JavaScript because you know
that's where the world that we live in
so if they come in and tell you hey man
do you understand angular you've never
touched angular well you've done react
so you understand how front-end
frameworks work so you already got the
concepts however they do angular they're
going to teach it to you over there and
it takes like a week a week or two maybe
that's it most likely all the components
are already there so you could look
exactly how other developers already did
it you follow their boiler code you know
is that you literally could go in there
and just copy and paste it and then
change it house accordingly how you need
it right so you have to actually go in
there take your time and don't worry
about getting a junior position just
apply to it stop worrying about it's
this job like a junior level position
like no don't worry about that that's a
way to limit yourself and that's the way
to actually cut people out you know have
you noticed that that there's barely any
jobs that same journey your level
position a lot of times people just
don't want to deal with that so they cut
that out that okay we don't want to deal
with training somebody three months
right even though you might not have
experience at a job but you have
projects that you've built you have
things that you can show for a be like
amen
anything that you could throw at me I
can come in there and learn it you give
me a week however is the process I can
come in and build it people unless they
looking specifically like let's say
in a situation where they're looking for
a you know react expert right they're
looking for somebody that is expert in
that field right what if they say hey
we're looking for a front-end developer
like they're not looking for the expert
they're looking for somebody who comes
in and could pick up what they have and
you know become productive that's about
it so that's what this video is all
about guys stop worrying about is this a
junior position stop worrying about can
I do this can I not do this can I get
higher should I even apply just apply
let's see how they call you I see how it
they react to your your projects I see
how they like your resume and another
thing to know somebody sent me an email
like worried about man I don't know how
to write my cover letter guys your cover
letter is your projects your cover
letter is your portfolio so be honest
with you when people used to send me you
know cover letters and stuff like that
like I don't even look at that I look at
their website the person's website is
like okay John Smith net right I go to
John Smith net if their website looks
horrible if the the type of what's that
he's worked on looks super outdated
that's it I throw that that resume out
the window you know what I mean and
that's just how it is
but if the person comes in and you know
had to have the right projects
everything looks good the design looks
good the type of projects that they're
building is something useful something
that we could put in you know and say
hey this guy did an e-commerce site so
now on this Web site which is our
business our ecommerce store right he
could come in and pick up what we
already have here we don't want to come
in and train this person on how products
work how the cart system works like you
know what I mean like those things you
should know so yeah man it's your boy
