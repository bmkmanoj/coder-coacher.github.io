like man I went to Australia and I got
stuck in Australia and I was fucking
working in the farm like I don't know it

US to go living in Thailand for cheap
right and he ended up being broken
fucking toilet and like he ended up just
like fighting in fucking and was it more
Thai fucking fighting championships and
shit like that and I'm like and for

right guys let me check what's good with
me let's go with you guys right I'm
sorry that the connection is not good
man it really sucks man cuz you know I'm
doing this shit live but you gotta
understand i'm in long island i'm not in
new york city i live in the outskirts of
Long Island for whatever reason out here
dislike barely any service I don't know
why you know just like there's no Wi-Fi
around here where I could just connect
to you know I'm trying to do is live
videos for you guys just to hang out
with you guys you know what I mean but
I'm sorry is not great quality your boy
Chris Sean up in here without whatever I
what up shit is crazy man every time
that I try to get into a Christian live
video man
I never get to find it because it's like
we're on different time zones and I'm
like fuck man I want to see one of
Christians videos when I never get none
of the notifications for the live videos
or nothing man but you know I gotta
support my boy yeah okay hello Joe can
you please make a video about people who
want to study web development in the USA
and work in a company please people who
want to study what the madam in the USA
and work okay but do you mean people who
live outside of the United States and
they want to work in the united states
or do you mean people who live in the
USA and want to find a job in the USA I
don't know hi I'm gonna sound like this
if you live outside of the US man you
gotta figure it out you gotta try to see
what type of visa you could get right
because it's not easy you know to get
get higher from a company here and be
like okay we're gonna get you a visa to
come to the u.s. it's already hard
enough for people who are here to get a
visa or get somebody to sponsored a visa
so imagine for you guys who are in
another country that's gonna be twice as
hard so you gotta look it up man you
know I don't work with immigration I
don't work with you know with the
embassy so I wouldn't even know how to
get you out here you know but what I can
tell you is that you can get a job
remotely like to be honest guys like I
wish I lived in another country like
let's say if I was to move to somewhere
else and I could work remotely here in
the US I will do that shit what I don't
fucking thought like you know you know
cuz you could work from your house do
your own shit you know work your hours
worked hours that are here in the US and
from then just be good you know what I
mean like your hours is gonna be weird
it's going to be like from twelve
o'clock
core one o'clock to eight o'clock at
night but man is fine man you're gonna
get big-time money here in the US but
you're living in your country you know
so you can't put a price to that
is it working what's going on what's
going on in my life can you guys see me
yeah man that sucks that really sucks
you guys can't see me
what I would I what up any questions man
you know that's definitely one thing to
a lot of companies take advantage they
be like okay you know what we're going
to hire somebody from another country
and you know pay them almost next to
nothing nine dollars ten dollars an hour
because they know that in that country
is it could be a lot of money you know
it could be some money maybe not a lot
but it would be some money for somebody
but look look at my cat my company my
company I'm pretty sure they paying we
got a couple of remote workers and I
think they're making like thirty
thirty-five dollars an hour I think I'm
almost sure that's that's the case and I
think man if you live outside of the US
and you're gonna pay thirty-five dollars
an hour you're good like if you're
living India and you get them paid that
much you live it like a king you got
three four wives you know what I mean
like you live in Brazil you get them pay
thirty-five dollars an hour man there's
a lot of bundle for you man you dig it's
gonna be a lot of chop chop okay you
know what I mean yeah when I love you
know that's one thing too I love that
I'm like multicultural like you see like
if you look at me if somebody looks at
me I want to work where they think I'm
from ok so if I come in and I'll be like

wherever the hell you from you got
appreciate what you from there might be
a lot of poverty there might be not
enough opportunities but you have a
culture you know what I mean sometimes
that shit is very important in this
world like you know you could go

Dominican I'm Brazilian I'm Filipino um
you know whatever whatever you know I'm
American and it's like you gotta be
proud of that you gotta you know your
country not might not be doing the best
at the moment but you gotta be proud of
that you gotta be like you know what
these things that are here that it's
nowhere else you know in the world so
you gotta appreciate those things
yeah man I gotta check I gotta check
Christians videos man I've been trying
to you know catch up on everybody's
videos whoa I've been trying to catch up
on everybody's videos but it's kind of
hard guys for me especially I barely got
time to do anything it kind of sucks man
it really does because number one I want
to be doing YouTube like full-time man
you know if I was to be able to do
YouTube full time man I would do so many
cool tutorials I would do so much shit
cuz then i will have at least eight
hours of me working on youtube but i
only have like two or three hours to
work on youtube which kind of sucks
there is some program who do you tube
full time yeah I'm pretty sure I was
this guy's name traversing media he does
YouTube full time well he does videos
and courses full time he gotta make a
lot of money cuz on you and me alone he
got thousands upon thousands of sales on
you to me and then he makes money from
YouTube so his game is up there guys
like he's making he gotta make at least
three hundred thousand dollars a year at
least that's a minimum I mean that's why
I want to get to I'll be honest that's
why I want to get to I want to be able
to just teach and help about one hundred
percent full-time it's just freaking
hard especially like you know like this
month i know i'm taking a hit i'm taking
a hit on subscriber count but what I'm
gonna do is because you know some people
did not play in fear here on YouTube a
couple of people not playing fair they
over here paying for you know Google
advertising fucking facebook advertising
you know bigging up there they're
fucking YouTube channels getting more
views than you know what they will get
regularly so you know what you know what
I'm like I got a little couple of change
in the bank you know what let's throw a
little you know a thousand dollars let's
see what that gets us or on YouTube
right let's see if we invest a thousand
dollars into YouTube promotion a month
right how much that gets us at the end
of the year from what my calculation I
think five hungry we'll get you thirty
thousand no I think like 30,000 40,000
legit new subscribers you know well now
new subscribers probably use of like
legit viewers right so i might do that
you know i might go all out cuz the the
goal here is to do
you to full time so it's like if I have
to invest into this and I'm seeing a
couple of people who are pretty shitty
and they just they gaming the system you
know what I will game the system to you
know I mean let's take it up a notch
let's see what happens
don't learn that shit bro weird 300k a
year man you're talking about millions
in Brazil bra yeah guys let me let me go
get this this little sandwich man here
but I want to you know the point is not
for me if I was to do it right the point
is not to buy views the point is to
reach out to more people because i know
i have a legit content I know I have a
pretty cool you know channel that people
love like the problem is that now
youtube did a change in the algorithm
right this past week we can have a lot
of if you go through a lot of youtubers
right a lot of youtubers have been
complaining about it right because they
did a change we're basically if you're a
brand new channel what they do is they
show you a lot on they put you on top of
other people's content even if you don't
have great content which I know that I
know a couple of people are coming into
the game I'm not gonna name the names
you guys should know that if you search
like what development they just showing
up out of nowhere and pretty much day
catching all those views which is great
is good for them it shows new new
channels it gives them a chance to grow
a little bit but what that does is if
you already have good content it brings
your good content down so even if they
drop shitty counting it brings it up no
matter what so that's where you know
what I'm gonna come in and but ok let's
let's put some money into this shit is
let's invest into this because the goal
is to do you to full time so let's put
some money behind it and let's just show
it to people let's show people a very
legit video
like the book on you know the boot camp
video which everybody loves let's show
people maybe the you know the video
where I basically talk how I went from
being broke 295 k a year let's see let's
show that you know let's promote that
you know let's get it out there and
let's see how many people like it no cuz
you could show it to people you could
show people on the advertising of video
but if they don't like you they just not
gonna subscribe to you you know what i
mean so you know what i mean so yeah man
yeah and that's the plan
that's definitely the plan guys and uh
yeah man if you guys want to check out
somebody check out Stephen grider man
Stephen grad is the best literally right
now all the projects that I'm doing it's
thanks to him yeah I would I would you
know do more collaborations with other
people but the thing is that these
people are fucking snakes guys this
guy's they're not here for YouTube right
a lot of those guys they come to youtube
and they don't look at it as hey I'm a
youtuber know they're here to make money
and that shit burns my fucking blood
because like me i'm actually a youtuber
i do tutorials i do help people out and
and everything but I'm not a fucking
when I'm here I'm I don't consider
myself a developer I'm not here to be
like hey I'm a guru I'm a developer guru
guys I'm like the smartest person in the
world that's how they try to sell
themselves and I don't do that what I'm
in here is just to share the things that
have worked for me and at the same time
have fun and make your life a little bit
easier yeah you said it Dennis for sure
that dude is literally here just to
fucking you know milk people you know
there's very few youtubers here who are
like me krishan milk star Aaron on beta
like I consider ourselves like we're
actually youtubers and then there's
people who are here to fucking to pay
for the SEO pay for for the views to
basically get a whole bunch of
subscribers to just make money I'm not
here for that like I'm here to make a
cool community and get to know people
and and whenever like I go back to the
city like it was cool the other day I'm
in the city i'm walking on the street
and somebody goes eh yo coding face I
was like oh shoot what upset you know it
was cool
people recognize me I'm not trying to be
famous but it's cool to other people
other developers who are like they like
the content and they they know what I'm
doing here they know I'm just here
trying to have fun and just have this
shit i could youtuber you know i'm just
a youtuber guys I'm not a guru I'm not
trying to sell myself as that that's why
you see when I tell you guys go buy a
course I don't promote my own courses
because I'm not the fucking best in the
world I'm not a fucking professional
fucking instructor but i would tell you
hey man this is the shit that work for
me and go check it out that's it you
know I mean song but all this there's a
couple of guys here man they like
fucking professional fucking
professional wanna be instructed on
YouTube who who are just here trying to
cash in you know so it kind of sucks
that YouTube is doing this new algorithm
and bringing them up when a reality is
ok if you're if you're gonna fucking pay
for the views man and you're gonna pay
for the subscribers come on man so it's
like I got money MA my fucking pocket
you know what I know my content is good
so let's put some money behind this shit
let's see how much we do in a month you
know what I mean Dennis you're you're
pretty much on point Reina you're like
beyond on point like you know you know
who's real who's now the people that
don't have a personality the people who
are just not themselves and they come in
front of camera back hi guys today's
topic is da da da da and by the way

talking shit oh that you know what
30 I got a friend that I was at that
monkey from you want to get into quoting
yeah good teachers yeah time to check my
channel why donÃ­t on Tommy ah coding
face
there you go sounds check that out and
then I give him the courses that he
needs it he'll be good your boys out
here I use want to become like I don't
want to be the smart guy like that knows
how to code I want to be that guy that
you know like whenever they have a
conference you know they invite me in
they invite me like hey man we having a
conflict that I facebook today can you
something just make the crowd live real
quick make the make the developers feel
at home like that's what I want man
that's all I really want I don't want to
be known as hey this guy knows
everything in the world because i don't
i just know that I can learn everything
in the world that's for sure there's
nothing in this world of technology that
I cannot learn it's all about putting
the time in guys like you know when you
you know like for me when I started
learning react I was like oh my god this
shit so fucking difficult why do I have
to do this thing this is boring
especially when I could do it with
jquery and then I realized as I work on
bigger and bigger apps a reactor just
works perfectly like I wouldn't be able
to do everything that I'm doing today
I'm doing I'm doing a web app right that
is so fucking complex guys that I'm
telling you
if I was to do it in jQuery I don't know
what I would do so what I was learning
react I was like I don't even know how I
was gonna learn that shit cuz it just
looked difficult they look complicated
especially when I started learning Redux
I thought I have react was difficult I
was like okay cool i got i understand
react now and then i started learning
Redux and i was like what the hell what
the hell is this state management and
all of this stuff and I was like man
it's too freaking difficult but then I
got it and then your boy started making
a big bucks that's easy guys as well
tell you guys you guys gotta listen to
me go get this in the courses man this
five courses man with you know you go to
milk moment they're gonna milk you for
20,000 right that's a car that's a
pretty legit you know a little nice
little honda brand new now instead of
you getting in debt for 20,000 how about
you just going spend you know twenty
dollars and then put in the time you
know
you're gonna be good be smart
yeah maybe trying to you know promote
super hard through youtubers and it's
fine you know I think everybody who
wants to get their money so you know
milk my own like go ahead for nothing
it's a come give me five hundred dollars
what do I need five hundred others for
and then I gotta say your name on every
video that I do I don't want to do that
shit that's it costs more money than
there because those videos is gonna be
there forever like what if tomorrow oh
no the owner of broke poison I broke
mouth whatever you know that mountain
whatever milk mounting freakin I don't
know the owner comes on is like oh he's
a pedophile something I'm not saying
that he is but what is like 10 years
from now that shit happens right now I'm
connected to it because I've been
promoting that she and I never even went
to that school so I don't know that's
how I feel about things that's like me
I'm not gonna show up to a coca-cola
commercial like your day pay me here can
you come in and make a coca-cola
commercial I'm like I don't drink
coca-cola drink Pepsi why am I gonna
fucking make her a coke commercial when
I like Pepsi I don't know I'm a strong
believer in that now you guys over here
what you guys are saying I'm missing
let me see what I what I would up
what do I think about Facebook f8 it was
kind of who it was cool to see what they
could do with the camera and that was
cool but it's like man they fucking copy
snapchat all right they copy snapchat
and then I don't know I was more excited
about react on react off the rear
conference 2017 that was pretty cool
yeah for sure
conan face the real roadmap to becoming
a deaf I feel like you the only guy who
uses 100 well I don't keep it a hundred
this and at the same time there's a
million ways for you guys to do this but
my way is the way of I really want to
become a developer there's people who
say hey oh this is jobs there's jobs and
development I want to get into that
right but they don't want to put in that
work so they need somebody like if you
know damn well like you're now gonna sit
down in front of a computer and learn on
your own go ahead go to a boot camp
because you pretty much you need to be
babysitting you need somebody to babysit
you for three months and that
babysitting cost twenty thousand dollars
that's how I look at it because none of
us on boot camps they teaching you
anything that you can learn on your own
and now if you know damn well you're not
going to sit here and do the work it's
like you know people who have given
projects to they know them well they not
gonna do the projects then what they
need it so who can you can't do the shit
on your own you need somebody to babysit
you and that's what it is my way is for
the people that really want this shit
this is not about to you know be nice to
people there's not about kissing ass
this is about hey you want to learn this
shit do the work I'm not gonna go to a
boot camp and like I could go and be a
fucking boot camp instructor but i don't
even think i will fit in because I will
fucking be pissed off if I come into the
course and I'll take this thing serious
and then people don't fucking do the
work and that's what happens in boot
camps they don't care about that shit
that I hate you pay twenty thousand
dollars not me so I'm already making
money off you so if you do your projects
and you cool you get to learn how to
become a developer cool that's on you if
by the end of the boot camp you fucking
waste of time and you didn't know what
the hell you was doing great that's on
you you didn't put in time so that's how
they look at it but my way
it's like hey I'm somebody who was at
home I'm working a bullshit job I want
to get better my life I want to do
something cool for the next 10 20 years
the best way to do is follow my way take
the courses that I'm giving you once you
learn those things once you learn the
concept of just one stack you can learn
any stack out there and then everything
else is going to come with time you can
go against time guys time is the one
that's gonna make you a developer not
all instructor nah-uh a course i use my
take on you to me not a a youtube video
not me motivating you every day here was
gonna make your developer is you will
actually put it in time you put in a
year of becoming a developer encoding
every single day by the end of the year
you're gonna be legit all right now if
you do it one hour a day and then you
watching videos on YouTube just to fuck
around then don't expect to become a
brain development do ice pack for
companies to come and spend money on you
