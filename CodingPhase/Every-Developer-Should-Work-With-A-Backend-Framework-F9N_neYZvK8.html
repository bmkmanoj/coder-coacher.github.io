coding face.com your voice back and I
done did it again alright we in here
live man your boys looking peel man no
beer no nothing we out here you know
what I mean I apologize about the
service I know I'm in an area with this
definitely no service out here right now
where I'm at right at the moment there's
definitely like one bar I'm holding on
to one bar right now so I definitely
understand if you guys be like man the
video looks like shit it's fine man was
important it's the audio important ways
what I'm I'm trying to you know trying
to say to you guys right so anyways man
I just wanted to talk about the
developers man yeah just get any boys
retarded yo yo 84 you retarded son you
please can't say yo what's up with this
bendición deal clean shape maybe
sometimes you gotta switch it up man
sometimes you gotta shave the whole shit
up I was looking like you're wolf man
yeah yeah 84 you retarded man you know
and easy on deal
I gotta man this is gonna be tight
yo son you fucked up my day now I can't
stop laughing
[Laughter]
I can't I'm out too
monster take out the message I can't cuz
the shit's still right there man keep
reading it nice to keep making me laugh
man but yeah yo nah I'm in here man we
ain't just chillin man
well yeah anyways going back to the
topic so every developer that's gonna
work in the back end or working any
company should work with a back-end
framework I don't care for is you know
laravel I don't care face Jango I don't
care if it's Ruby on Rails I don't care
if it's what's the other one sales right
and I'm not talking about Express this
one thing that people get me wrong when
I say a back-end framework I'm not
talking about Express Express Sinatra
what's another one like even camo for
crystal Ling those are frameworks that
they let you do whatever you want and I
feel when you're working in the backend
there should be a certain structure you
know especially when you work with
multiple developers a lot of times
people come in and they have this bad
habits of coding shit their way or
coding their shit you know like raw PHP
or like hey I could do this we fucking
straight JavaScript and then it's like
it's a fucking mess alright so my advice
to everybody today for this web
developers lunch break is make sure you
guys really look for a framework like
MVC framework a framework that's like
you know full stack that just has
everything because you know working on a
major website
and you're trying to coach it from
scratch is retarded in 2017 if you think
you're gonna do this shit like that
don't do it don't do it you know what I
mean so you know microframeworks I don't
like them I like them if you're gonna do
something quick like let's say you have
our API and you're like okay all I want
to do is serve JSON data through this
API and whatever something simple you
know let's say you you have something
like the Star Wars API or the Pokemon
API whatever that's something simple you
could do that shit in a micro framework
but if you building a major website guys
don't do it to yourself
all right trust me if you're going in
and you're like oh I'm gonna code
everything from scratch you're gonna
basically fuck yourself over like I'm
being honest like you guys is gonna mess
up so just like you might as well just
use the framework that everybody has
agreed upon I'm gonna hate we're gonna
use Django we're gonna use Marvell
whatever it is that you guys decide but
don't try to make a major website from
scratch like there's so many moving
pieces to a website that a web
application at that you know like so
much shit can without without what up
why are y'all this freaking kick
breaking 84 music he got me today man
with the bendición do yo
what do I recommend between Arab and
Ruby on Rails it's the one that you
command starting out with for a newbie I
would say I don't know if you wanna get
like the original you would go with Ruby
on Rails right cuz Ruby on Rails
everybody else copies from Ruby on Rails
right but laravel has become something
pretty cool because they keep doing
updates constantly and add a new shit
that you might need as a developer right
Ruby on Rails takes longer to do updates
like they don't do updates like every
six months like right now movie was a
lair about Kim came out with five point
five five point five five point four
came out I don't know like maybe October
or November of last year and now five
point five just came out so you know
it's constantly new things always every
time that they create something new is
like they they give you a whole bunch of
shit that you might need like you know
social media authentication what else
they have they have they did a couple of
cool shit I can't think of it right now
at the moment but every time they do a
new update is something completely new
something that every developer does on
the daily basis right so I will say
laravel for sure plus I think there's
more jobs for novel than then Ruby on
Rails because Ruby on Rails that the
companies that use Ruby on Rails they're
not looking for like junior developers
guys I'm being honest guys who you know
they're looking for fucking Ruby on
Rails they want mid-level to senior
level guys who have been in the industry
for a long time because they know the
people that do Ruby on Rails are very
passionate and like they've really
entered in the community they're really
fucking take it to the next level right
so when they choose Ruby on Rails they
know that they're gonna get
experts so if you just like a brand-new
developer you know oh yeah I'm gonna
jump it to Ruby on Rails it's like I
don't know if that's the best best place
for you you know but Larry Moe Larry
bells good cuz you can find jobs right
away ya know there's definitely there's
jobs for Ruby on Rails is just this is
different it's different you know I mean
like for a brand new developer to jump
into Ruby on Rails or PHP larva I will
say take Clara because you're gonna be
able to to actually get higher quicker
Ruby on Rails they want experts they
want people who really know the backend
and they really know Ruby it's not just
like oh yeah you know larva you could
get higher know when you you talk about
Ruby on Rails they gotta fucking test
you on Ruby the language like crazy
yeah man we in here man
should I learn known as a first back in
technology yeah why not I mean you
already doing it in the front end I mean
you're doing JavaScript right so you
want to sort just mess of where I
wouldn't note it's not gonna hurt you
what is the best framework for nodejs to
me I will say Adonis jeaious because
it's like a full framework where they
have everything organized and it's a
real MVC framework now Express is not I
don't even consider expressing a
framework Express is like a library to
me you know but that's it and then you
have was another one like happy J yes
there's a there's a couple of other ones
there there's not there's one coop thing
notable or something like that which it
looks pretty good but they force you to
use Postgres I'm not a big fan of pulse
grass I I use them when I have to but
I'd rather not you know of course Harry
Potter Jes I don't know if you've ever
heard of them Harry Potter Jas is it's
pretty legit too you know it does the
front end and the back end that's
everything so check it out google it
Hey Joe is not a good choice to learn
after getting the hang of JavaScript
yeah you could play around I think
notice got to play around with you know
what I mean like you want to understand
how back-end works and you want to post
things and you want to return a JSON
like nodejs is simple you go in there
and play around with it
crosses to the Krusty tolls library oh
yeah it's actually cold today arraigned
in it's a little bit cold out here today
camp
I could imagine though over there
Oklahoma right now is fucking hot how
important is learning networking for
what developers is not important at all
now you got to know at least some type
of Linux at least minimum right but
networking you don't need to know us
it's not mandatory
listen that's what they've been saying
for years they've been saying that
MongoDB is stronger than sequel listen
it all depends on the company because
it's like right now you could go and say
hey I wanna use MongoDB for e-commerce
website it don't make no sense to use it
for e-commerce website but I don't know
it's weird you to me I think it's the
same shit because even people they don't
use asking people that don't use MongoDB
like how they supposed to use MongoDB
right they use MongoDB as if it was
sequel where they'd be like Oh fine fine
document by ID or fine by user ID which
is almost the same shit a sequel you're
almost doing the same shit the only
difference is that in sequel it's
expecting certain things so like let's
say each row is expecting the say
first-name lastname a age a date for a
user right now in MongoDB you can say
first name last name and then that's
saying you don't have to enter any other
information so it gives you that freedom
but I just I don't think that is it's
really important like that I don't think
that it really makes a difference at all
yeah you don't need to know routers and
packets and stuff like what less you do
an IT work you don't know fashion
Linux is the bus yeah like Linux
I like Linux if I have it connected to
directly to a how you call this to eat
the net cable because almost none of the
fucking networking carts work with Linux
so that's the problem
well guys also to me myself my first job
was just HTML CSS people are worrying so
much about JavaScript it's because you
guys looking at jobs and positions that
in reality as a brand new developer
that's not the positions that you need
to be looking for I always tell this to
people they looking at in the wrong
places they they start looking like oh
how can I get a $80,000 job but that
shouldn't be your goal that's your first
job your first job should be how can I
get into a company and work with HTML
and CSS and then work myself up and then
start working on something more deeper
like JavaScript you know cuz it's like
let's say an example this is just an
example let's say it takes you a whole
year to get really good with JavaScript
right are you gonna stay at home the
whole year still practicing learning
courses online doing fucking little shit
on YouTube are you gonna stay home or
will you rather say hey I'm going h TM
on CSS in my first month alright let me
start looking for a job and then I'll
learn you know JavaScript while I'm
working there that's what I did that's
what I will fucking do you know me
personally when I went to a job
interview it was almost a year because I
was like nervous I was like man I don't
know if what they're gonna hire me I
don't know if they're gonna ask me like
questions from computer science I'm not
a computer science major I was like
scared right but I was still doing like
networking and this and that as an IT
but then I was like you know what
fucking i'ma just apply and I applied to
a bullshit job of bullshit eBay
wholesaler and they hired me you know I
got hired from there and then I got
hired from another company because I was
hired to that first company because if
you go to a legit company they're not
gonna hire you if you have zero
experience as a
right any legit company is not gonna
take that risk right so you have to
either say hey I've been doing this in
freelancing I have this clients I have
you know that's why I tell people do the
projects that I tell you do those
projects which are real businesses right
real businesses you could say oh this
was a business I did for a friend
they'll be like oh what's the website he
didn't pay his domain something you come
up with something at least right the
idea is that you gotta come when you go
to a job interview you want to show that
you already worked for other companies
you don't wanna go in there and be like
I've never done a website all I've done
is fucking freako camp
you're not getting hired all free
Coquette all right you're not gonna hire
off even you know cold steel's course
they're not gonna hire you because you
have a little thing where you know at
the end of the the chorus you you got to
create a little back-end none nobody
cares about that they're gonna actually
what companies that you build websites
work that you have any clients that you
make website for your friends like shit
like that is what matters because that
means you build it for somebody else or
you build it for yourself but modeling
as if it was for a client nobody cares
about what little calls what algorithms
what little bullshit you could do like
you know somebody send me a email the
other day like oh I have my whole
portfolio on copán I'm like wait what
what the fuck are you talking about
copan is not to be used as a place to
put your portfolio and then give people
your link no you supposed to give
somebody a domain be like hey hey Johnny
banks doc Heroku app calm or Johnny
bangs all right fucking there was a
double old web host or some shit like
that for free whatever right something
something that people could look at him
you know oh yeah he did this website he
did that
website you know and real legit websites
I'm not talking about fucking algorithms
don't fucking send me
don't send me anything with algorithms
nobody gives a fuck about that shit I'm
being honest guys take that shit off
your brain I know I sing some some
youtubers out here they are fucking
doing algorithms and this and that guys
you have to have you probably probably
already straight what exactly is it that
you want to do you want to get hired to
become a web developer or you want to do
fucking software engineering or you want
to do machine learning or you want to do
fucking something else right that's when
you need to focus about algorithms and
bullshit like that nobody cares about
that if you're a web developer nobody's
gonna come in and but I can we test you
for algorithm if they fucking tells you
for algorithm that's not the place that
you wanna be it right I'm being honest
that's not the place that you want to be
at because you're a junior developer
you're not there to fucking create a
fucking how you call it shit create some
shit that's gonna fucking optimize an
array that's not what you're gonna be
working on what you're gonna be working
on is can you build this page can you
make this slider can you fucking change
this menu can you make sure that the
filtering on this page works can you
debug this javascript those are the
things that you're gonna be working on
so when you spend so much time on
fucking bullshit channels and you can
tell them I said so tell them I said so
if they fucking wasting your time with a
bunch of algorithms they don't even
fucking have another enough experience
to be talking about algorithms right
they look at some shit a frico Campton
look at some shit online on a tutorial
then tell you oh you gotta learn
algorithms and this and that guys you
don't gotta fucking learn that shit
don't waste your time with that I'm
telling you right now spend your time
wisely because a lot of you guys just
like me yeah I don't have enough time in
a day to you know
waste we're not 14 years old no more
we're now 17 years old or we're not in
college where we could just stay home or
in our dorms and code all day we are
fucking working people we are fucking
people who are trying to better
themselves people with families people
who have barely fucking three hours to
code a day right so if you're gonna take
that time how about you start building
real websites right I'm talking about
businesses I'm talking about e-commerce
website make a real estate make a
restaurant make a fucking a fake
seamless or GrubHub you know shit like
that that people could be like oh yeah
he could work here he has experience he
built the backend for this he built the
front-end for that that's what you want
to show to people so whenever somebody
comes in it's like wasting your time is
like hey guys let's there's working this
algorithm guys I'm being honest get the
hell out of there those people are just
fucking creating creating content which
is easy you know it's easy to create a
content of something that's already
created for you but it's hard to create
content for people to give the real life
advice especially when you you don't
have the experience like me I have the
experience I have the experience of
somebody who started from zero right had
nothing was broke I was so broke I
couldn't even get home one time like
that's how broke I was right
fucking I did this shit online
self-taught so if you're gonna listen to
somebody you gotta listen to me because
I'm being honest with you guys
there's the way that you're gonna get
that job don't waste your fucking time
with people man cuz a lot of you guys
don't have that time man it's like this
kid Zak Zak told me he's always in here
is that nothing Zachary he told me he's
like yeah I can only have like four or
five hours in the weekend to code so if
he comes
he spends an hour two hours on on free
coke am doing some bullshit algorithms
do you think he's gonna be able to to
fucking you know build websites nah it's
gonna be like you know he's gonna spend
so much time and said that he don't need
you know so that's what I'm just saying
for you guys man don't waste your time
man like please focus on on building
websites man I told you guys where to go
go to dribble comm you could take those
designs build those websites and then
show it to a client show it to somebody
who's gonna hire you an employer and it
just looks better it looks like you're
actually your developer you don't want
to look like oh you're just some fucking
random dude fucking trying to get into
the industry they don't have time for
that cuz they need somebody is gonna go
in and hit the ground running you know
what I mean so but that's why I advise
that's for the people that's a big
difference
guys let's a huge big difference between
people who want to get a job right if
you want to get a job you gotta listen
to me if you want to just like you just
want to become somebody who just gets to
learn a lot and know a bunch of
programming languages and you just have
a lot of passion for this then you can
also listen to me but this channels to
get the people to get a job man
you know what I mean like I'm not going
to give you guys shit that I know is
gonna make your life harder to start
working as soon as possible
dribble comm DRI
be be be le so it's three three B's guys
I'm out of here I already gave you my
lunch break
banana now I gotta go to my office eat
my food like 5-10 minutes
that's how you know I'll be telling
people I'm dedicated to this shit man
like I'll take my whole lunch break
chill with you guys and then from there
I gotta go back to work not even with no
rest no nothing start working all I have
is five ten minutes of just relax and
chill and then I gotta get back to work
but that's what I'm saying for you guys
man you guys you know I tell people at a
time man you're either here for a job or
you're here to fucking expand your
knowledge of fucking being a developer
right if you're here to expand your
knowledge of being a developer there's a
channel called fun fun function right he
talks about every fucking deep concept
that there is when it comes to
JavaScript or any programming language
so if you want to just expand your mind
and that's what you're looking for
check him out if you're looking to find
a job and get working and you appreciate
money in this world and you want money
as soon as possible you listen to your
boy you know if you want cool free
tutorials check out traversing media you
got some fire if you want positive
energy good motivation you know then
check out Chris Sean that's what I tell
people
but if y'all are here looking for that
money and you're looking to get higher
as soon as possible then you listen to
me and you start building websites stop
wasting your time over here fucking
trying to learn a million algorithms on
free cocaine or on coke caddy me and
you're like just fucking wasting your
time guys come on we don't have time for
that no more most of you guys are
grown-ass men grown-ass women and y'all
be here yeah I think yeah you have the
luxury to waste time you don't have the
luxury to waste time no more you know
somebody like cool 16 17 years old finds
this channel he has the luxury to mess
up and play around oh yeah cool I want
to learn something cool to me you know
you guys don't have that luxury you have
the luxury of getting money putting
money in your pocket thank you
training yourself to become a great
putting money in your pocket
