people are more interested into you know
like web development so I'm really happy
about that where we have 173 in the get
er that's what's up man we doin our
thing man like that's another thing guys
I've been working on Conan face comm and
it's coming it's really coming now I've
been saying this for months I'm like
okay guys website is coming up but
literally it's really coming things like
so hard man I got freaking work
full-time and then for some reason my
girlfriend wants to do like 30,000
activities on the weekends which is
weekend's is where I get to coding where
I get to make videos so it's like all
these activities are really stopping
what I need to do but you know it's
alright
sometimes we got to pay the price
word you know I mean I'm definitely
looking forward to the kid I just can't
wait to see him you know just to have
him here and like I look back up but I
yell Bobby you're good you'll just be
there chilling you like cheat cheat
cheat papi joke
oh no he'll say thank you you know how
kids are
but yeah man over here you're like some
 some Ally I'm scared to be in
this alley there's some that you
know like if you ever seen the movie the
wire like you know there's like one of
those scenes where it's like the guys
just chilling in the car and somebody
comes from behind them and just shoot
them in the head like this like you
super quiet here like this like one of
those scenes man
okay dear Joe I'm thinking about
learning Ruby
I've got JavaScript node blah blah blah
down it's Ruby or C++ or Java I don't
know yet I mean give Ruby a chance Ruby
is very fun like you know okay I don't
know if I can guarantee you that there's
gonna be a job for you
um by learning Ruby but what I can tell
you is that once you know Ruby like
there's so many things that you
understand about programming right
especially object-oriented programming
and Ruby just makes things easier and
it's more beautiful to look at you know
smooth is better programming better
syntax so in that sentence is way better
now I don't know if depending on the
other area that you live on Ruby might
be big sometimes it might not be you
know what I mean so but like I say if
you're building a project for your own
clients like you could definitely build
in Ruby like most of the people that I
know that work with Ruby a lot of times
what they do is whenever they have a new
client or you know somebody doing some
freelance working that IO can you build
me this website in this what they do is
they build a ruby because they'll have
fun while building it you know it's like
you're getting paid to have fun now when
you're using something like I don't know
like Java or C sharpest it's not as fun
you know so it feels like work you know
so it's up to you what up Joe can you
give me some interview questions you
have been asked you know a lot of dumb
questions like oh let's say for a
javascript interview right then we're
actually what's a method right okay
that's one they might ask you do you
know about prototypical inheritance
and what's another one do you know how
to basically create a class with
JavaScript right or something like what
tools do you use do you use grunt go p--
or web pack do you have you tried nodejs
how do you get packages for nodejs what
else um missy what else have you tried
angular you know they always going to
throw angular out there because angular
is like one of basically the leading a
front-end framework you know depending
on numbers you know it has the most
companies that have used on angular over
react over everything else
angular still number one now is it the
best No so if you're building a brand
new web application you should do it
with react or something else I don't
know you decide but I will definitely
recommend react now if you're going to
work in a company where you're going to
do a lot of maintainer
most likely is gonna be in angular like
it or not angular it's still a big boy
out here you know I'm talking about
angular one a lot of people might want
to switch over to angular 2 angular 4
but the reality of things is that
there's too many web applications that
are made in angular 1 so it's difficult
for people to just be like ok cool I'm
just gonna switch over so that's how it
is
nine is my boy 84 jumping on that rocky
step I'm gonna make a video tonight man
I'm gonna put up a video another video
on the rocky stack connecting to
basically databases so that's the next
thing I know obviously I had that I'm
supposed to put it up but it's just
having being able to edit the video I
did the video already all I got to do is
just you know put it up
here you could definitely a before you
could even and for whatever reason if
Mac OSX is slow on the windows through
like a virtual computer you could
definitely do it through Linux so you
could have like an extra hard drive on
your computer you know like I don't know
60 gigabytes or whatever and just make
it just like a Linux computer and you
could also do the rocky stack through
Linux or even Windows search of Windows
Ubuntu um
search crystal Ling write search crystal
Ling and search Andre because Andre made
a tutorial about this on how to
basically run crystal Lang on on Windows
so you should just do that Shane Murphy
whatever I would up kick greatness yeah
we got a lot of new people in here man
we got Benny Hills we got a lot of cool
new people in here man I'm really happy
for that and you know already long
because it's what developer lunch break
we got we got this big-ass sandwich
right here
turkey hero lettuce tomato matter fact
honey Turkey hero lettuce tomato no mayo
and what else and that's it and a ginger
oh because that's what I eat I think I'm
a right at the moment my one little
machine has 16 gigabytes so I can
allocate 4 megabytes oliviere Plus
running an i7 I'm 84 let me see I'll see
you
you maxing out the computers
yeah trust me son once you play up once
you get a MacBook Pro son you won't be
able to go back I guarantee it
some people they said for some reason
they think that is difficult but Mac is
literally the easiest thing in the world
everything is already built for you
no mayo unsub yeah man oh man oh man I
don't like no man I don't like I can't
 with milk I can't with eggs I
can't with none of that
can somebody ask me Joe who your
favorite rapper right now who's my
favorite rapper
man right now who I listen to and you
know I'm sorry to a lot of people that
be like old man you know Joe's
into all that trendy I am I'm into
all that trendy all that a or that
shoulder
or that hey yo that you know what I mean
I'm definitely with lo sievert
I'm with you boy are rich the kid
head on with the rich the kid I love
that kid yo not only do I love him
because his music is hot but he's from
Queens so I definitely with you
know he reminds me of me and my friends
when we was young we was like 19 20
years old be out here like a wild it up
but yeah man he's doing his thing
I love rich decay I like famous decks
are they famous decks are his energy I
don't like his music but I like his
energy I like him live you know cuz his
shows are legit but his music is
kind of trash but rich the kid is nice
who else
I like a from Houston if you
guys didn't know at one time I used to
live at Houston definitely with
Houston artists is so you know the sauce
twins you know
Ferragamo my skin you know what I mean
like like I loved the sauce twins man
sauce walka big Sanchi like that's why
mess with when it comes to rap music man
I look at Mac versus window like you
explained learning that languages they
do the same thing you just need to learn
their own syntax exactly
I like Meek Mill I just I feel like he
kind of he kind of messed up his own
career man he was going up bro like he
was doing his thing he was like one of
the last street rappers out here like
you know her rappers and that's a he
kind of messed it up for himself you
can't go against Drake when somebody
look i'ma put it like this Drake has so
many fans that even if you're better
than him all they have to do is say oh
no Drake is better there's too many
people that like him that's one number
two drink at the best of both worlds
he's half white which means every
freaking white person out there is gonna
you know bring them to his side oh we
have one you know what I mean it's like
Eminem Eminem to me was trash and then
everybody was like we have one we have
one of our own in here you know what I
mean and that's why they like them but
then Drake at the same time he's half
black so then it's like he got the
little swag even though he's kind of
corny but he still got got a little swag
you know what I mean so I expected some
New York Garrison's man man New York I'm
from New York and New York is dead you
know what I mean like New York is done
because everybody here wants to do music
of like oh you know like back in the 90s
that era is gone you got to create music
from now we're in 2017 about to be 2018
in a few more months so it's like why is
you still making music like it was 1990s
you know what I mean so that's my point
on it lay okay with the times man when
you know what rappers started rapping
differently you know people wasn't
coming around like
DMC is like I've got nothing like
nobody's rapping like that bro
like it's the manganese nobody's rapping
like it in the 80s so it's like in the
2000 nobody was rapping like the 90s so
why in the 2000 intense right why are we
still trying to rap like we're in 90s
bro like nobody's going back it's like
there's nobody going back and then on
top of that the last real person from
here from New York Troy Ave which I like
his music he has some good people
are like him because they just hate on
him you know what I mean so it's like
his music is pretty cool he don't have
major hits but for being a New York dude
like he could rap
okay do I need to know back-end in order
to build a small website for clients it
depends if they or they want is just a
page then build them a page all you need
to know is HTML CSS that's it now if
they want interactivity like you know
they want to email something they want
to you know like say they want to save
the person's emails they want to put in
Google Maps or something else or
whatever whatever it has to do with
saving something mean saving data you
need a backing
okay what else I'm missing
yeah meat no he he's he has so much
issues he has way too much issues that
cake one of the minimum requirements to
get a junior web developer job minimum
requirement is being able to build the
page out of a design and somebody gives
you a design and you could build them if
you could build it on then you're good
you're golden but till then you can't
get hired because it's like you know if
you can't build a page what exactly is
it that you're gonna do it the job you
know what I mean so I mean I'm sorry
guys but Eminem men he has a couple of a
good songs like you know I like Stan I
like a couple of cool but I'm not
into comedy rap man I'm not into that
 and then I'm used to make a lot of
comedy and to me that is corny
he had no swag he had no style he had
like no personality like you know like
my all-time favorite rapper of all time
is camera right and why do I like camera
on so much is because camera had a
personality camera on is when you go
into a room and you better oh
that's camera on right there like he's
doing some funny he's on
somebody he's over here with all the
jewelry before or everybody started you
know rocking all this shake all this
 crazy he came out with pink
everybody started rocking pink he came
out with purple everybody started
rocking purple like whatever he did was
just legit man plus I was in high school
at that time like that was my favorite
rapper at that time I was like yo camera
is killing them right now you know what
I mean so but em I just never liked them
like I know what he was selling numbers
because he was the only white rapper out
here it's like
things like if there's only one
Dominican rapper I'm gonna support my
dominican rapper you know what I mean
but it doesn't mean that the guy is the
best it just happened that people
 support him but he's not
good like that man that dude is trash
what's poppin : face watching firehouse
22 without without whatever what up ah
let me see who else
Benny Hills thanks for the advice I'm
looking for full-time sure should I
learn at least one back-end language
before running around calling myself a
web developer exactly yes
Thank You Ramon you actually understand
you know people have to understand this
you cannot call yourself a web developer
if you don't know one backing language
if you don't know how to deal with
databases if you don't know how to deal
with user authentication sessions
cookies if you don't know that you're
not a web developer if you just know how
to build the page you're only a
front-end developer now if you're a
back-end developer all you know how to
do is deal with the backend and the
databases now if you're a full stack
full stack in being a web developer it's
pretty much the same thing thing is that
full stack is the new word of the town
that's what everybody wants to use now
but it's the same thing as saying hey
web developer or back in the days people
used to call them web master you know
before there was even front end oh you
know front-end developers they used to
call themselves um CSS ninja or you know
a CSS Rockstar like look it up that was
the name of people back then or just a
designer
eighty-four I agree with you he
definitely sound he he took a lot from
50 cent he needs to find his own way but
I feel like he's finding his own thing
now
i'ma see I see Joe can deny my questions
be considered just JavaScript HTML or
CSS oh yeah
sort of like when I think of that Undine
amic website I think of I don't know
this it's hard to say this it could have
a back-end it could also not have a
back-end it could be connecting to
something like firebase or something
like that like a remote back in you know
y'all hating on em I'm about to cry I'm
sorry it's not that I'm hating on and
man but he just he don't have no swag
man I'm all about the swag I'm all about
the personality I'm all about who is the
person because let's be honest man um
rap is like WWE you know what I mean
there's the good guys there's the bad
guys it's the guys who you know that's
the railroad Ray Ramon is the
Shawn Michaels the pretty boy is this
too you know Undertaker the badass
there's the Stone Cold Steve Austin the
the dog the gangster you know what I
mean like there's a whole bunch of
different characters when it comes to
music but you know it's like if you
don't have a character I don't care
about your music because your music it
could be okay but you got to be the full
package to be a star and to be honest
with you like to me em was never a start
em with just some comedian kid
that's it
like a weirdo I'm sorry but to me it was
just like a weirdo like I just never
liked them eight miles was legit I do
agree with that a bounce was legit but
like I told you guys man
pagers I hope is legit I don't think so
I think tile Oba sells courses sells
 courses for people who
are desperate
you know everybody's out here that's
where that want money you know so it's
very easy and not only that I'm starting
to see this on YouTube commercials
 guys coming around it's like hey
hey guys I'm like hey guys I'm in a
Ferrari and then you see the tag it says
rented I'm like like come on this is
like right now you guys you guys if I
come over here I'll be like hey guys hey
guys is your board coding phase calm and
and you see me in a Lamborghini some of
you is gonna be like oh man Joe's on
that you know what I mean
now if somebody that doesn't know my
channel don't be like oh god this guy's
making money I want to do what he's
doing and then I start selling them like
 courses like a man if I
can buy my course for you know $50 like
I'm not gonna be selling courses to
people unless I really put in at least
six months of time building our legit
course because it doesn't make sense if
there's better people out there with
better courses why would I tell you
about my own course which is
you know what I mean like I'm not here
to make money I'm here to pretty much
help you bow and just like give them the
best resources I just I don't want to be
known as the guy that knows everything I
don't want to be known as the guy that
uh is super smart cuz I'm not I just
want to be the guy known for giving user
resources like hey you want to learn PHP
here is the best course you want to
learn nodejs this is the best course you
wanna know go to the best meetup groups
here's the website to go to the best
meetup groups like like that
cool like that that's what I want
to do you know what I mean so
CSS rock stars for it look it up
CSS rock stars and CSS ninjas
that was the name of people back back a
few years ago like in 2008-2009
I'm about to join milk Mountain
hell yeah bro people are on freakin
milking everybody out here you know like
this is my thing man it's like I will
feel like I don't know like a piece of
 if I was to tell somebody hey man
listen to me and I'm not even a a
developer you know what I mean like I
don't even work that like you guys know
when I leave from here right now where
I'm heading to right now it's to work
and I work as a full-time developer like
and y'all see what I do you know what I
mean like you see me doing tutorials you
see me doing frameworks you'd see me
doing a whole bunch of I'm active
you know what I mean so a lot of these
people they just do YouTube because
they're professional speakers like I
can't speak I know it I can't
even speak
but people with me because they're
not here for me to give them a sermon
and give them like a big ass you know
thing over hey guys my name is Josh
Smith and I you know I have the best
courses I have to the best training da
da da da if you're looking to get hired
listen to me no man I'm not even trying
to do that I'm just like hey I'm just a
regular guy i frickin figure it out and
here's my resources there's the things
that I go there's the websites that I
look for news
there's the websites where I check out
new this is where I get my my how
you call it my github what I call
it my gills my you know repos from like
cool projects that people are building
this is where I listen to my podcasts

was new in the industry like that's all
I want to do just just be the resource
guy you know give you guys good
resources and then if you appreciate it
you appreciate it if not then cool you
know and sometimes I might put in my
opinion like I created a video about
elixir which I don't like elixir at all
I don't think it's a good freakin
language
some people like it some people like it
and neither because they think that they
need it they like it because it's
something different they want to get
challenged they want to get challenged
with functional programming and a life
functional programming if I'm going to
choose functional programming I'm gonna
go ahead I'm not gonna go with elixir
you know because the elixir is a piece
of but the point is that I make
sure you you share this video or just
tell I'll tell your friend man tell your
boy be like hey man I found this kid
online is on YouTube this youtuber
called Joe it can eat your boy Joe check
