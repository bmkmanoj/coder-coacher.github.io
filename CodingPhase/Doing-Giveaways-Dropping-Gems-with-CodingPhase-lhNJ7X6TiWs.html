case you guys don't know
here you go here you go you got the vlog
that's the vlog view for those of you
guys that don't don't get to see your
boy a lot yeah we here we live ok so I
apologize for the people that didn't get
to see me today I 3 p.m. there was a lot
of stuff to happen and a lot of things
that I had to do and yeah so I actually
had to handle this business and there
from there basically everything is in
the vlog you guys see that later on I
hope people enjoy the vlogs man I hope
you are enjoying it let me set up my
second screen for some reason it's not
showing up let me know if you could
actually hear me good let me know if if
it's crappy if it is you know whatever
if you can't see me I wanna know how's
the audio the audio is good let me know
alright so let me see something
let me see something tonight we might
have a giveaway you know how I do it
tonight and the reason why I want to put
on my headphones even though this
nothing else I I I'm supposed to hear
right now but I like putting my
headphones out it you know clears
everything from outside and well TVs and
all that stuff so yeah the coding phase
keychains people are waiting for the
coding phase keychains word that's a
good idea man that's a very good idea to
start getting coding phase keychains man
let me see so I want to go to my YouTube
I want to see who's live who who
actually see me here right now doing
giveaways all right so um basically the
giveaway for tonight is I'm gonna give
five people a free course of nodejs
which is the course that I'm basically
currently building so you're getting at
first before anybody if you are a member
of coding phase comm already you already
got it okay you already have access to
it but there's a lot of people that have
never tried my website that's a lot of
people that have never seen my website
they don't even know what's the website
about they probably think like man this
guy just comes in here dives and this
this and that
listen we got legit courses too we got
stuff that you're gonna learn everything
that you need to get a job right we got
courses that is just that's the main
focus our focus is not for us to be like
hey man we got the cool framework we got
this this and that now you could do it
on your own you could go to YouTube you
could go to you to me you could go to
wherever you want to go medium free
cocaine wherever you want to go to now
if you're looking to get a job looking
to get the skills that you need to get
hired then you go to my website that's
the truth that's just being honest it's
not me coming in here promoting
something that's fake come on you know
telling you something that's like a lie
is something now it's just being honest
a lot of people don't focus on getting
jobs a lot of people don't focus on the
skills that you need to get that first
you know that first step in the door you
know of your new career but that's
exactly what I focus on that's all I
focus on okay so I have this course
oh no Jes and I teach it with a
framework called Adonis yes okay I'm one
of those people that believe that for
you to really take advantage of a a
framework it has to be a complete
framework something like Express Express
is great to understand
and just the basics of nodejs and it's
very simple you will create an ojs
server we're like five six lines and
it's a cool thing more power but let's
say you have an idea right now let's say
you wanted to create create something
right and you say something like what
Vanessa created the other day right you
guys saw that application review that I
did basically that's a application that
you could build in an hour down SJS
easily right it was cool about adonis
day yes as the framework is that you
focus more on building the application
instead of you focusing on which
libraries should I use which modules
should I guess should I try server-side
rendering should I not do server-side
rendering should I go do the myrn stack
which is like react in the server side
like you know people worry about this
all the time should i do mean should I
do merge should I do whatever how about
you build the project first before you
even start focusing on how can we
customize our project from scratch how
can we rebuild the saying wheel
constantly right so that's what I'm
doing here okay
shoutouts a bit code bit code just came
through you know hit him with a
three-pointer a real quick set hold that
hold that down Joe I got you your five
bucks man

it to Adrian but let's leave the people
to be able to the
go ahead guys
start voting now start putting in a
rotation Adrienne rotation Adrienne
which one I will basically send me a
email whoever wanted Freddy Martinez
coding connections Cameron Lopez send me
a email so I will have your thing so let
me see
coding connections caring Freddy
Martinez send it to me okay so
come on guys rotational Adrienne what
you guys want it's not hating it's just
saying hey man
I wanted - I need it - that's not hating
rotation or Adrienne y'all decide the
people decide are you not entertained
you ever say there's a cup of water in
the desert
Ramsey joint is saying is I I got a I
got a Pepsi in my I got a pen C in my
pocket
I got unlimited Pepsi in my pocket you
guys decide what you guys want to do I
wanna give it to Adrienne but there's 50
people there waiting for that cup of
water what do you do do you give your
cup of water to somebody else some guy
named Adrienne that you've never heard
of
you never met in your life you might
never see him again in the channel or
you who have been here since the
beginning of time since before Joe was
on YouTube you deserved that do you
deserve that that course do you want to
survive do you want that glass of water
that Ramsey Jordan gave away and said
hey man I got unlimited Pepsi what do
you guys want to do Adrian or yourself
don't
and the moment of truth is I don't want
nobody else to to to put anything
because it's gonna mess up the vote when
I scroll it I wonder people are here
live I want you guys to put two things
either Adrian or rotation Adrian or
rotation please don't don't don't leave

water what do you do with it Ramsay join
us say Joe don't worry about it I'm a
soldier

the crazy mouse kick there's the crazy
mouse there's the mouse with a twitch
what does the crazy mouse do he spends
he spins the rotation let's see what
falls on waffles on what Adrian or
rotation if it says Adrian Adrian gets
it
if it says rotation we rotate one more
time and we see who wins it okay come on
guys who you want to win this who you
gotta give that little piece of water
alright just a little bit just enough to
hold it down for the rescue team to hold
you down and get you you know rescue you
from that desert who do you give it to
do you give it to yourself and say hey
I'm trying to survive
or do you give it out to Adrian it's up
to you some sort of people the people
decide Adrian or a rotation in which
everyone comes up close to the bottom
close to the bottom
close to the bottom is the way we're
gonna go oh it goes down in the DM it
goes down so ad to dev was the survivor
he said keep that involve tation let
Adrienne Ernie let the Adrienne survives
just like us out here Ramsey said now
people have spoken
throw this little pinch of water there's
a little course right here throw this to
the wildlings
but the wildlings spoke the savages they
said ain't trying to hear that I'm
trying to eat a sadist came out of
nowhere say I'm trying to eat ain't
trying to hear that
don't let shame to rotation and the
Cyrus was ad the developer so because I
per se put in rotation we're gonna put
in rotation we're gonna put in rotation
from the beginning all the way from the
top from the very tippity-top all the
way to the top to the bottom and we're
gonna count to 10 1 2 3 4 5 Jesus Christ
there is one winner today guys there is
one winner and the winner is
Johnny flora Ming or flora Monde so
let's copy this okay let me just copy
this thing here unfortunately guys not

gonna give it out to whoever hat rotate
or rotation right so there's two winners
in this situation Jon Soto and Adrian so
there you go there you go there you go
there you go

was basically like this Ramsay Jordan
dragon he drank his his Pepsi and he
said I got unlimited Pepsi baka P a
couple of times and John so during a
drinking survival for me so thank you -
that's a effed up story you imagine some
shit that's the effed up story man yeah
Jesus Christ that's a effed up story man
we gotta end up with a happy ending man
that was a effed up story so look this
is the story Ramsay Jordan gave away his
thing Louie's mental Court gave away his
thing right the wildling said put in
rotation Adrian did not win even though
perhaps a Renzi joint said give it to
him alright so the situation so crazy
then we put it to rotation Rollins got
somebody else it got who they got we got
Freddie Martinez coding connections
Kevin we got John Soto did I miss
somebody
no so we got who won at the end who
survived Freddy Martinez coding
connections Kevin we put in rotation
somebody else won who won somebody else
won before we put in rotation one more
time who was it somebody one who was it

Sam would've won at the end Sam would
have been like oh man you can't be
saying that about me you can't be saying
that I survived wolf pissed like listen

everybody's joint like who got piss out
here you're gonna say you got piss in
there like you knows that's just how it
is man you're in this you're in a
situation we're in a scenario you know
what I mean something shout out to
Adrian and everybody who's in here we
got least been to court for giving out
his his spot Freddy Martinez Cody
connections Kevin John solo shout-out to
Ramsay Jordan like yeah man like this is
crazy
shout out to Johnny flaw Ramon he also
won send me send me a email so we could
get this man word :
the new Netflix man word I'm sorry guys
I took it there man
it's just it felt would it work with the
story man
listen fifty guys are surviving this one
you know Ramsay Jordan he got on the
Minnesota how can we make as many people
survived as possible you know what I'm
saying so it's like it's only one answer
now this is hit this is funny and this
is crazy which is a true story so I'm
gonna show you a little sorry we
switching subjects but not really right
so I'm gonna show you the map right now
I'm gonna show you the map Trojan map
okay I'm gonna show you the map right
now so all right so I'm from this
country Dominican Republic right this
country right now the mini Republic has
a lot of people that have money but even
more people that don't have money right
so what people do is they go to Samana
and they leave in little boats not yalla
so or not Yola I'm gonna show you what a
yo lot looks like what people call here
banana boats right well not you alright
so people leave from Samana right here
so when I order to come here to Isabella
Puerto Rico to try to make it so Puerto
Rico because in Puerto Rico is part of
the United States when you once you make
it to the United States then from there
you could get married with a Puerto
Rican chick to make your papers and now
you got a citizenship to come to the
mainland which is out here in the United
States you know those are the things
things that people do right now talking
about surviving I believe like a few
years ago there was a story and this is
a true story which I think they should
make a movie out of it and the reason
I'm bigger this up because I just
thought about caring caring is like oh
yeah I drink a lot of water so four
people can survive of my you know of my
my piss right so there was a situation
where they left in the Yola about like
50 I think I was like 50 to 60 people
you know you old I like this like this
is a little Yola and they all try to
make it to Puerto Rico they left there
was a storm and then the whatever you
call this the engines they died right so
the engines died and then now they're
stuck at sea deep in sea right and they
don't know how to get back home and the
waves keep pushing them instead of going
here the waves are pushing them this way
out here so now if the waves keep
pushing them they'll end up him now blue
sea where nothing is out there you know
if you leave out here and you end up
with with nothing no water no nothing
you're dead okay so luckily for this
group of immigrants this group of
Dominicans there was one lady there was
one lady who probably I don't know she
had been pregnant she had a kid like two
months prior and she left her kid in
Dominican Republic and took this trip to
try to make it to Puerto Rico about 42
people survived of her milk now I don't
know about you guys that story seems
crazy but it's a true story
so it's just crazy to me you know think
about it it's like I wouldn't mind
seeing that movie you go insane like
you're 50 dudes is in there like in that
you imagine what's the conversations
like after nobody got in the water after
nobody has any more like liquid in their
body
nobody has no more pissed cuz that's
what the first thing that they said
everybody drink their own piss and then
after that everybody was drinking
whoever had piss whoever his left was
sharing it passing it around between
4060 people right at the end people were
literally sucking on this lady's boobs
it sounds crazy it's funny a little bit
but it's crazy so when you're in
survival mode it doesn't matter you're
trying to survive so it's like keep that
in mind guys stay close to water and I
just want to see that movie yeah I
talked about this movie I just created
right now I will see that movie that
shit must look like a crazy bukkake like
a crazy situation like yo you imagine
like the last lady and hope her booze is
like popping I was like milk and dudes
is like yo whose girl is this like yeah
you imagine a situation like that talk
about awkward I mean but there was also
women in there so it wasn't just one
girl
there was but everybody drank offer like
that's crazy that's a crazy situation
I wonder if it's on Google main let me
see survivors from breast milk I wonder
if they have it yeah
look at this look mother's milk say 16
lost at sea
more people were there they died and
she's she basically she gave it out she
wasn't holding back she said I I got you
guys yeah put that well you know one
doing once that one to another sigh like
yo listen
yeah I'm just trying to think like this
is why this as human beings this is why
you don't put yourself in crazy
situations like this you got on saying
like don't put yourself in situations
like this I don't be like hey man maybe
we should go to Mount Everest like nah
maybe you should just stay your ass at
home be like hey maybe we should go to
to see we're just like 150 people and
like literally like like two water
bottles let's go deep into the sea don't
put yourself in that situation cuz then
now you end up somewhere in a boat deep
in to see sexy man world lady it's just
like yo who got liquid you gonna say but
you're imagining that awkward situation
was like y'all listen listen my I'm
sorry but we deep in see like somebody's
gonna have to you gotta sing you imagine
the dudes and they're just thirsty like
look literally thirsty like their mouth
is dry everybody dried up from the Sun
and it's like listen who some the most
thirsty dude you know he was like I got
first dibs you go listen being a woman
is hard in this world man
please don't put yourself in situations
like that man you get on a saying like
I'm trying to just stay serious in this
situation because it's like does this
thing happening in real world like
you're gonna say it for guys too you
know I really like hey you're deep in
the desert somebody's gonna have to give
that piss up you gonna say so it's like
yo man that's crazy
Karen said she deserves a purple star
give her a medal yeah you imagine some
shit like that like you tell somebody I
tell somebody the story and they won't
even believe me they were like now you
lying it's right there go stretch it up
go read this Mother's Milk save 16 I
lost see and there was more people there
that died and she she got to save 16 now
the question is if there was like 42
guys in there you mean you left 37 was
it 16 was a 42-6 seen as - okay so let's
say I don't even know the math I suck at
math let's do the math so calculator 42
minus 16 26 dude you let 26 dudes
die when when you know you out here like
you flourishing right now you're like a
man I got this but I'm holding back for
the last 16 you imagine that
conversation dudes is Titan man's like
yo whose girl is this this isn't like yo
whose girls is this hey I'm thirsty
you know I mean 26 people died you're
gonna have to give that shit up you
don't have to free somebody up in here
yo is
Oh God Rams Jordans like yo Joe don't

it's just a regular life man it's just
crazy that people will put themselves in
situations like that like listen you
survive so for the people that were
talking bad about a dream it's like man

Ramsey Ramsey why wouldn't you want to
leave this live are you ashamed that you
had to be you had to end up feeling two
dudes that's not right man
that's not yo man let me see Joe the
startup kid does not know life server
when I do MPA run watch after installing
a component that's weird
Oh
now don't worry you good man you go
don't worry nobody could really search
this they don't search on the frickin
YouTube they don't be like man he showed
up on a live stream you know you got man
but yeah guys listen I hope you guys
enjoyed this we have fun we chill for a
little while you know survival Karen
said survival of the chulos listen man
or even worse man so I wrote the cool
O's man you know hit me I'm outta here
this this R alive show is getting too
crazy this event so you think you being
a saying that Duluth what developer
starter key doesn't work for him how it
doesn't work that's weird
look I'm a door with you live I'm a door
with you live here all right I'm gonna
go to github do it right here get help
coding face.com starter kit download zip
okay so it downloaded right there's the
starter kit I'm gonna move this tool or
let's say projects I'm gonna there's the
start
folder I my name it tests thing
one two three name it that
alright oops
you don't need to launch map but now I'm
gonna say like this new tab I'm gonna go
to my location okay so we here I'm in
projects I'm gonna say CD testing one
two three
LS okay so this is my project right
there's the web developer starter kit
you're gonna say NPM install
it's gonna take a little while
you
you
also to make sure you download a new
version of the starter key like
sometimes I do updates to it to fix it
and add new things so always download a
brand new one don't don't use the same
one all the time I know some people they
try to download the zip file one time
and then they try to copy it from their
computer don't do that what you should
do is make sure you you download it
every single time from this from
github.com so let's call your face calm
okay so all right it's all installed now
you're gonna say npm run watch okay
alright now I'm gonna go to localhost
3000 and that's the starter kit okay now
I'm gonna
up Adam I'm gonna open the file you
gonna let this load I got a lot of files
opening up see what the hell is going on
got some plugins still loading up okay
so I'm gonna go to Joe San Jose Garcia
projects testing one two three
fire open close this okay all right and
now what I'm going to do is I'm gonna
change this I'm gonna say main body
background I'm just gonna uncomment this
save it and as you can see automatically
the background turns to purple okay now
let's do it with JavaScript let's see
first component okay I'm gonna
this instead of saying coding phase I'm
gonna say testing one two three
save that okay that's saving as you can
see here it's automatically doing
everything and it's reload in the
browser that's complete okay let me see
hmm interesting
so let me see what's going on here okay
oh so you do have a point
let me see there must be something that
I'm missing oh you have a point my
friend oh no matter of fact it did
change this is at always changing this
but this changed so if I come here and I
say like this on on this testing one one
two three save okay you see it says
testing one two three so everything
works exactly how supposed to you won't
be here confusing me man you're making
me think like it was messed up but it's
good yeah Carlos
when she will see a man this was so late
oh it's not creating a new browser
because look at this I don't know can
you see this on the screen yeah so look
at this if you go to over here right you
go to where is it
go file dot J yes you'd go down scroll
down right let's see if you click this
here and you change it to so true you
see it says change this to true if you
want the browser to open automatically
okay so I took that out because it was
getting annoying of like every time that
I start a new server right if I come
here I do this I say NPM run watch
automatically opens up the browser for
me you know what I'm saying but now if I
come here and I stop this and I do MPN
run watch it comes up and opens up
another browser you get what I'm saying
like that's annoying when you start
working on a project and you gotta stop
the server and run it again one more
time it gets really annoying cuz it's
just creating new windows new windows
new windows every single time like I'd
rather just click refresh one time or
stay on the same page instead of having
new tabs opening up you see
so yeah so I usually I put it false now
as default and I'll leave that comment
there says change this to true if you
want the browser to open automatically
