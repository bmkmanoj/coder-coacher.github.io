you guys so we're doing a portfolio
review live and we're doing it here with
coding face your boy all right so
hopefully you guys come in yeah get to
show some love you get to come in and
you know see a couple of the comments
that other people are going to say about
this portfolio I'm trying a couple of
new things as you can see there's a
couple of changes here we got ramsey
joining project fox online a couple of
people and the reason why it's a little
bit different is because currently what
i'm doing is i'm connecting a whole
bunch of different places so we got
twitch
we got youtube we got like another 20
other websites alive so depending on who
logs in whoever talks is gonna show up
and it's gonna actually show from where
they from
you know if it's people from twitch its
people from youtube it's gonna show up
right there
where's it right then left side alright
so let me make sure everything is good
and yeah man are we about to get started
right now let me make sure I set up the
viewer account okay and as you can see
we have subscribers a goal subscriber
goal sorry subscriber subscriber goal
which is 50,000 subscribers by the end
of the year can we do it I think so I
think we could do it right we could
definitely get 50,000 subscribers by the
end of this year so let's get it poppin
alright so today's portfolio I'm gonna
show you right now give me one second
is from a guy named Khalil McCall
alright so let me share the screen and
here's the website okay
coming here
so to see you guys so yeah so there's
the portfolio that Callie McCall
actually created seems pretty cool I'll
be honest is very basic I can tell that
he's just starting all right
and you know I always tell people I hate
don't get discouraged that's how it is
when you're starting up right was
important to is that he actually came
out of his way to start building his
portfolio I know guys that have been
coding for six months and they still
haven't built anything for themselves
oh yeah bingo from Tottori to tutorial
were from freako camp to you to me from
you to me to probe aside from
Pluralsight I'm here with you now at
coding phase comm from coding phase
comma I also do a little you know a lot
of videos on traversing media and I also
do you know a couple of things from from
from function so like they do it too
much out there and then they don't even
have a portfolio that don't like thirty
thousand tutorials but don't have
nothing to show for that they actually
created okay so it's cool that Callie
actually came in and created his
portfolio so this is cool tool that he
has is his projects that's the first
thing that he shows okay and he shows
about him this is Khalil phonemic or I
don't know exactly where he from but
yeah then he got his contact I don't
want to put too much his information out
there I mean it's it's on the internet
but I don't wanna I don't want him
getting blowing up like you know that
hey man I saw your line man how you
doing like you know how to weirdos be
you know so we don't want people going
in and corner him up right okay so this
is one of the projects that he has a
very basic cold web design you know
subscribe to our newsletter you know
from what I'm seeing so far
can tell that he's learning how to Kohi
him probably he's a little bit more
advanced right he he's an intermediate
right but the thing that I'm noticing is
his designs are you know they're not up
to par okay so what I would tell to
Khalil see if this works
Europe what up that works a little to do
list we all have done a million to do
list so we can't be mad at him
also too he has a little picture gallery
is cool
you gotta work on the Z indexes because
if this is showing up this thing should
not be on top of this this image should
be the one that's on top of everything
else so you got to work on that C index
okay let me see what else what else he
got in here little clothing company it's
cool cuz as you can see he's already
getting busy he's trying to build some
ecommerce storage which is great because
that's where you got to find your jobs
you know okay so I guess is like a
landing page
let me see what else you got a cold
denture clinic it's cool that he's you
know he's building stuff for businesses
as you can see this thing is going over
I guess it's supposed to be like a full
screen front page but as you can see
this thing is is off
all right let me see what else
got a couple of things objective reviews
I don't know also hide the press that's
my boy life of Pablo you know good thing
he got good taste in music right that's
the best part of this it is cool right
it's cool what he got
top five all right cool so from what
we've seen so far okay what we know is
that he's learning to code what we know
is that he's getting in the game ray
what we know is that he's just getting
started okay
we can't even judge it that much because
he's just the beginning I mean if people
will see my portfolio my very first
portfolio and the type of projects I was
working on it's like people will be like
man Joe you make distance again I made
that right but that's the process of
everybody right we all have to go
through the whole process of learning to
code learning to build different
projects and learning to you know
finding the right colors finding the
right typography you know the right
fonts and this isn't that there's a lot
of things that could definitely be fixed
on this portfolio I mean how can we
judge it it's it's pretty obvious that
he's a beginner he's just getting his
feet started wearing his feet wet he's
just gonna start into this whole web
development thing but what I will say
for him is I always tell everybody here
listen if you're not good with design
either you have to take a course in
designing websites or you want to say
hey man I'm not a designer I'll leave
that for the designers so what you
should do is go check out dribble comm
be hand-start net because you probably
have skills that people will look at you
and be like oh this guy's very good he's
a great developer but because you didn't
present it in a certain way people's
gonna look at him like it's not good
you're gonna say that people's gonna
look at it it's like oh you don't know
what he's doing this isn't that you want
to show people that your website is up
to par with everybody else right you
know a lot of developers are not good at
designing right a lot of people don't
have that you know it's like if you
don't have that you know that little
sauce to be drawing
like I can't I could draw I can't come
in and be like Alma create Picasso I
can't create you know one of those crazy
those crazy things like crazy paintings
right that people's gonna oh wow he used
this watercolor oh my god what a
painting on this he did oh my god how
did you mix these colors like that's not
me right so it's like I would have focus
on that what I will focus is hey you're
a developer you're trying to get a job
as a developer so go in there find
designs or even websites that you like
recreate them you know see how they
build it see how their fonts are see how
their text is like see how they place
the images see how you know the type of
icons that they use you know it's like
you wouldn't used like for example the
little tool to icon for opening up a
menu right
it's like different things that are
making your user experience better right
but if you don't know that and you're
not a designer and you're not somebody
who who who actually looks into those
things then your website that you built
that behind the scenes your code is
perfect your you know all your features
are there everything works exactly how
you wanted it to work now that somebody
comes to your website is gonna be like
oh this looks like 1998 you get what I
say so you definitely want to make sure
that when you come in you have nice
designs because it's your portfolio
right or even if if you don't have a
nice design keep it very minimal like
don't do too much colors don't do too
much stuff literally make it very simple
I don't know let me see if I can find
you guys a very example a very good
example I'm you seen many more portfolio
you
you
sure
you
all right so let me share this with you
guys okay so there's a design that is on
dribble right you don't have to be the
best developer to build this this is
super easy alright but it looks nice and
clean you see how the header is okay
there's the menu icon and I was like uh
area was a hello you know put in your
name you know right here you put in your
your projects you know everything is
white and then a little bit gray just so
you can see the contrasting in in the
projects and that's it a very simple
footer that's it
that's a portfolio for you guys you have
that and that would look great on your
website okay so you don't have to be out
here you know trying to kill yourself
trying to create like the best design
like you want to focus on showing your
skills but you want to give like a nice
impression when people come into your
website you get what I'm saying
so to Khalil listen man keep going you
know take this this advice and just from
there just keep pushing forward right at
the same time rebuild your portfolio
right if you want to get a job
it's the difference when you're doing it
for yourself right you're doing it for
yourself in your house portfolio like
cool that's fine if you feel like that
you want to do it like that but if
you're looking to get a job you want
somebody to pay you money you want to be
out here looking like a professional you
want people to look at you like oh wow
we need to hire this guy because if we
don't hire him the next company is gonna
hire him you get what I'm saying but if
your website look like that how you have
it right now people's gonna be like oh
yeah he's just up again he's learning to
code you never want to show to people
that you're still learning you wanted to
show to people that you're actually a
professional that you actually somebody
who's out heroes was really you know
really
knows what the hell he's doing right you
know there's not much that we could say
about this portfolio
all right besides that but yeah you're
an internship or job back at it again I
hope you guys enjoyed this quick
portfolio review we're basically going
to be doing a lot of new videos whenever
I'm doing you know videos like this I'm
going to try to do it live and do it in
a way where I can bring in the audience
and you know as you guys can see they
have their own messages here and they
actually could share what they think
about are the designs or what they think
about the portfolio so it's like it
gives you guys a voice I don't want this
thing to just being a hey it's just joe
talking it's just joe giving his opinion
at the same time i want you guys to come
in be able to give your opinions and
share what you guys think about the
portfolio itself alright so anyways guys
