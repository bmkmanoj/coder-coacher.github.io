back at it again man listen coding phase
comm listen I'm trying to get as much
content as I can for you guys you know
on the go wherever I'm at if I have an
extra little time I'm gonna do a little
video for you guys you know what I mean
but yeah so somebody left me a comment
like hey man like it's so hard for me
because I can't find no friends I can't
find you know people that can relate to
me who actually like code or likes
technology programming whatever it is
right and I could relate to that because
when I was starting to learn how to code
like none of my friends was into that
you know I was like nobody that I know
was into this thing so or or even like
you know if I talk to anybody they look
at me like oh yeah like like you know
okay change the subject we don't we
don't really care about that like that's
the real idiot thing because if you're
not into code for you for you is
probably boring you know what I mean so
I understand people I understand they're
not into it but you know for me it was
hard because I was a damn man like I
wanna talk to somebody that you know
that knows about this or I could help to
try to get to learn or he helps me
whatever the case is right and I
realized that most of the times you're
not gonna find that in your life at all
because nobody's really that I know of
like you know most of regular people
it's not into code they're not into
technology like that they use it as a
user but they're not there thank you hey
how do you make this how how is it that
they make this you know user interface
how is it that this thing gets to save
my you know my email my password
somewhere in the cloud like they don't
care about nothing I say like they're
not thinking about that right so for us
you know guys who are trying to learn
and guys and girls chocolate on the line
cold and you know the best way to really
you know find friends or people who who
can relate to whatever your you're
working on is either you don't go to
places like you know the team treehouse
has a good forum
which is pretty helpful you have
stackoverflow.com which you know for
answering questions is pretty helpful
now if you wanted to you know ask
regular questions about cold or
programming or one language you should
pick whatever it is you should go to
Korra calm I go there all the time like
I ask questions all the time if you
don't want it to show up your name or
anything it could be anonymous so like
let's say if you feel the question is
really dumb but you want to ask you know
when I ask the question and you're like
man I don't want to put my name cuz if
people see this they're gonna think I'm
dumb
it's fine put it on honestly I do it all
the time I always ask stupid questions
in there but it's cool because then I
get to meet people who are also doing
code or they learn how to program
whatever and you know I end up you know
being pretty cool pretty friendly with
them you know sometimes we change
Gmail's and then we just do a Google
Hangouts and we use you know we talk
about things about code or what what
languages are high what was you know
what's hot out here you know what I mean
so it's pretty cool also so you could go
to meetups alright so meetup calm you
search whatever it exactly is it that
you're interested on so Matt let's say
you're interested in JavaScript there's
a JavaScript Meetup yeah let's say
you're interested in meteor there's a
meteor meetup you know here in New York
I'm lucky because there's a meet-up for
everything there's 8 million people just
in New York City so out of those 8
million people there's always somebody
doing a meet-up somewhere in a cool
office I've gone to meet up seeing the
Google office I've gone to meet up and
link nulling thing was was the name of
the other place it's a tumblr I went to
what else I went to a meet-up in digital
ocean I think the the meteor meetup was
a digital ocean I think I know I went to
digital ocean bar can remember for what
meet up by uh yeah so it's like not only
do you get to meet new people but you
get to also to communicate with you know
I am wasn't like you know future
employers or potential employers like
take advantage of meetup.com man because
that's the best place to find people
that are just like you you know what I
mean so yeah man you know check out
meetup comm so yeah so Stack Overflow
Korra meetup calm the team treehouse
teamtreehouse.com forum and then of
course Conan face.com once it's
completed
that's the remain that's the main reason
what I'm creating that website because I
know when you first starting you don't
even know what projects you should do
you don't even know how to collaborate
with other people you don't even know
how to do open source like you don't
know how to do get you know and pretty
much collaborate with other other
developers out there so that's where I'm
creating coding phase you know and also
is gonna have a forum it's also gonna
have a chat room so it's gonna have
everything that somebody needs you know
to get their their feet wet in the
industry that's my my goal to it you
know but let's see you know once I get
the chance to finish it let's see how it
comes out man you know hopefully
everything comes out good and yeah but
yeah so this was a quick video for you
guys
your boys back I'm out here : face.com
