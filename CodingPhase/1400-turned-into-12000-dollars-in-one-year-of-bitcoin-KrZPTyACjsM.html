out of the game man coding phase calm
your boys backing out and did it again
guys let's talk about it
so today Bitcoin definitely broke the
record and it's pretty high right now
right now this is one of those things in
one of those ones that make you happy it
make you sad at the same time all right
so let me give you my little history
with Bitcoin all right
I bought Bitcoin when it was about
missing what was it I was like all wrong
year 700 something dollars all right boy
that's a 100 something dollars I had two
bitcoins about two bitcoins you know
last year all right
and then basically I was riding the wave
riding the wave riding the wave until
this year summertime right and for
whatever reason we got to 2300 so I had
like a for like 4600 dollars or
something like that
yeah like fully six hundred others
almost forty seven hundred dollars right
and then there was a big drop it was a
huge strap I mean to me was a huge crowd
I was like man that's like six hundred
dollars that you know that went down
there's past week whatever in this past
few days so when they dropped I call
like I don't know I don't know I caught
something yeah you know I got nervous or
something I sold a I was like man I
don't have the heart for this I can't
really deal with this up and down I mean
cuz you know people might talk about I'm
gonna oh man so I was not listening and
you know people got a freaking twenty
thirty thousand dollars into Bitcoin and
it's like yeah you got twenty thirty
thousand dollars into Bitcoin but those
twenty thirty thousand dollars is you
know it's like five percent of the money
that you have saved you know what I mean
like
I don't have that much money saved like
you know I got a good a good amount but
not enough to be saying hey I'm gonna be
throwing away four thousand dollars in
the air like that you know what I mean
like I don't know I come from the bottom
man and I got still give value to money
you know what I mean like that's how I
look at it so I sold it I sold it right
and I also at that time I was gonna move
out from the apartment that the house
that I'm living on right now and I sold
it in then whatever it dropped and then
it came back up slowly was shortly I say
you know what I'm not even gonna look at
Bitcoin man and you know I I stopped
looking at it and then it got up to here
right and that's it man my money
would've double right there man you know
and then the other day I was like oh
cool you know what I should buy again it
was on this time exactly on this time
September 14 I was like y'all I'm about
to just buy you know a one Bitcoin just
for the hell of it just to have it here
you never know what's gonna happen now
today it goes all the way up man you
know right now it's at six thousand
three hundred eighty eight dollars and
I'm thinking in my head man you know
that would have been four thousand
dollars that I would have had invested
no actually what I had going I invested
$1400 that's how much I invested into
into Bitcoin in that 1,400 hours would
have been twelve thousand dollars right
now in like one year of like investment
right and that's if I wouldn't if I were
just kept it there cuz I also when I
think about I'm like man if I were just
put in $50 every week or $100 every week
like who knows where my money will be at
right now right but man there's like one
of those moments man well I'll tell you
guys you know just by man just by leave
it alone we don't know where bitcoin is
gonna go we don't know where the theorem
is gonna go I mean etherealist seems
pretty I'll be
hey there I don't even know if I will
tell people hey buy this just because it
seems pretty wack just like there's no
money to be made with this people keep
saying that oh it's gotta go up you know
next year in business and that I don't
know there's like a a wish list right so
today I decided I said you know what I'm
gonna buy I'm gonna buy today you know
half a Bitcoin right you know half a
Bitcoin I bought that and then I bought
one become one Bitcoin not one Bitcoin
wallet there iam coin whatever whatever
you call them but man I'm really pissed
right now you know what it is to have
$1400 invest into something and you
could have literally I took it out to
make like five hundred dollars in profit
I mean like 500 I was in profit I
could've just left it there and
literally had today
twelve thousand dollars like that's
crazy now what I'm doing is I just say I
put this automatically I say you know
what let's just leave this automatically
and you know let coinbase just buy $50
per week I was gonna go $50 daily but
that's all over ridiculous
so I'm just gonna put videos per week
and just forget about it you know let
them charge me weekly $50 that's like
$200 per one that's fine if it grows it
grows if it doesn't it doesn't it's the
same thing as my better mint better mint
account like who cares you know what I
mean like but I'm really pissed right
now man I'm wondering like out of all of
you guys man
you know also have coin basis I have TD
Bank I have invest or eight coins which
just takes like a little change from
here and there I also have betterment I
also have or what else I had Robin Hood
but I saw all my stocks I don't want I
don't want to deal with the stock market
cuz you gotta be on top of that all
I just don't have time I hate it so I
like things that's what I'm addict right
and it's just like I vesting money into
it but I'm leaving it there and just
like forget about it all right now I'm
just wondering like from all of you guys

material coins and like coins and the
whole shebang like I would like to see
