again man coding face.com your boys
backing out and did it again man I just
wanted to talk about you know the fact
that this channel is so international
you know what I mean like we got a few
people in the US but at the same time we
got so many people in your round we got
so many people and you know Australia
like we got people all over man I'll try
to figure out how to get more people in
South America you know more in Brazil
more you know Mexico Dominican probably
God Chile Argentina I understand a lot
of people you know it's a different
language because they speak in Spanish
and you know but I'm trying to get more
people from there and also to more
people from Africa to join the website I
know a lot of times people have been
sending me messages like hey man has
been kind of hard because they don't
recept
my credit card I live in this country
that where I don't know it's weird
because it's like if you have Visa
MasterCard you should be accepting but
for whatever reason I guess there's
other type of credit cards in the world
which I do not know but if you guys want
to sign up to the website and you can
sign up for whatever reason send me a
message send me a message to my email
coding face at gmail.com send it to me I
will get you guys in sign you up
I'll do it manually you know and and
just get you in there man I'm trying to
get everybody as much people as I can
before this far out especially goes away
there's like you know once-in-a-lifetime
event guys so take advantage and I also
wanted to talk to you guys about what
I'm doing here man like we're you know
we're killing the game but at the same
time it's like we're growing up you know
we we learning new things we're learning
new marketing things to get us out there
you know that the whole idea of this
it's not to become like yo we gotta make
millions we're gonna nah it's just
survive I just want to survive and be
able to continue doing this and I want
to remind you guys listen if you already
signed up to the website take this
nodejs course that I'm building right
now guys like a super PAC and what was
cool about this is that once you finish
this course you're gonna be able to use
this as your portfolio of course you can
go in and change the the styling making
your own changing your own way however
you want it so this is like a basic
style for for the website that I'm
building so for your portfolio pretty
much you're gonna have a CMS section
where you're gonna be able to add your
projects you're also gonna have a blog
you're gonna have a contact page we're
doing all of that and no genius guys now
I don't know if you guys understand what
I'm saying
you're gonna be able to create your own
portfolio which is part of the five
projects remember I tell you guys when
you have five projects you have to real
estate you have let me see the real
estate the restaurant we have the
portfolio we have was the other one we
have the e-commerce this one more
missing on the digital agency website
right so you have those five websites
that if you have in your portfolio
you're guaranteed to get hired because
it just shows that you can do everything
you know when it comes to web
development and what we're doing you
know a lot of people told me hey we
should just do everything or react but
what I decided to do is let's sprinkle
those five projects throughout multiple
projects you know multiple courses you
know cuz you have you have a couple of
courses here so like let's say let's go
to coding phase calm let's check it out
right now right I'm sure you're right
now I don't know what the Internet's
acting up and this is the worst man I
just got the you know Verizon files and
even for rice and files is not good out
here
oh god oh man but basically you have
other courses guys you know you have the
one from nodejs you have pug pug is
where I'm gonna do the okay so let's go
to courses it's not the website it's my
internet guys okay um
basically yes so this project has the
real estate course right so this one's
gonna have the real estate course inside
of it I'm also gonna add maybe like
another project which is just gonna be
dealing with API is connecting to API
sin and pulling the data and
manipulating the data so I'm gonna do
another project for that but let's talk
about the five projects right so we have
the real estate project in here we have
the portfolio in here and I'm also gonna
teach you guys how to launch it to your
own website and even put it in your own
domain alright so you're gonna learn all
of those things
alright launching on Heroku put it on
your own website the whole shebang on
this one we're going to basically put in
the digital agency okay in laravel we're
gonna put the online store which is the
big store we're gonna put it here the
restaurant I don't know I might just put
in the restaurant back into the react
course so this one might just have two
projects might have the real estate and
the the restaurant app right here right
so both of these are gonna go into this
one so let me see let me write this down
somewhere okay let me see all right let
me put this here alright so react course
has real estate and also it has the
restaurant
the restaurant course okay now the
nodejs this is where we're gonna host
your your portfolio all right laravel
we're gonna have the beeps tour well we
just call it ecommerce it's like that
can't remember it like that yeah
ecommerce site all right so we got real
estate restaurant portfolio ecommerce
and then impugned folio ecommerce what's
the other one on digital agency all
right so this our five or four projects
that's cool so if four courses or five
projects are going to be living there
now and the reason why I'm doing is
because just to make our lives easier
right and just so you could show that
you you can do multiple different
projects in multiple different languages
it's not just like okay this person all
he knows is react that's not really what
you want to show somebody you want to
show it I hate I can do all of these
here so check me out you know what I
mean now what's cool about this
portfolio is that we're gonna make all
of the stuff dynamic right so in the
front page we're gonna have you know
just a regular page picture here you
know regular picture if you guys want to
come in and be fancy you could put in
JavaScript and make it you know super
fancy animations and the whole shebang
but here what we're gonna do is we're
gonna load up like our blog alright
we're gonna load up our blog on the
front page then we're gonna have a page
which is gonna be just all
projects right that's what you're gonna
put in all the other projects you've
built a real estate the restaurant the
e-commerce the digital agency any other
projects that you guys have built is
gonna be on that page then from there
we're gonna have a blog section which is
connected to this here all right but
it's gonna have his own page all right
and then each blog post itself is gonna
have his own page we're gonna also
create an admin set on an admin section
so basically you can administrate your
own website and you know choose what's
gonna be shown what's not gonna be shown
you're gonna have your login your
password the whole shebang guys pretty
simple pretty easy all right make your
life easy okay and we're gonna have a
contact page all right so that's what
I'm working on right now I'm actually
doing all of the stuff tonight I'm
setting up all of these things the real
estate app is almost done all I have to
do is go in there and finish up the
styling of it you know like let me see
let me go in here where is it all right
you see open oops
okay that's taking love it too long
because I have the stupid hard drive
fixed yeah because this harder always
makes my computer slow but alright so
let's see projects real estate okay yeah
so so far we got everything done all we
really need is just to do a couple of
little things in here you know as far as
like this real estate app that's gonna
be done yeah um the Pug digital agency
is gonna be easy because there's just
gonna be HTML CSS but done with pug and
I'm gonna show you guys why pug is so
good it's not because I'm trying to push
something on you guys
like people are trying to fight it right
I don't want it to pop I don't want
other guys I don't gain anything
teaching you guys something that's not
useful you know what I mean like it's
like somebody comes in like I want to do
everything with web pack if I'm teaching
you and gulp something with gulp is for
a reason guys I have experience with
this I'm not doing this stuff like just
because I want to do it like right now
to be honest with you guys I want to be
playing ps4 and hanging up so if I'm
really taking about time and doing this
is because you guys need it right if I'm
telling you pug is something that you're
going to use for a very long time not
only are you gonna be able to learn how
to make your HTML faster and at the same
time learn how to use template engines
because template engines are in every
framework you could use ejs you could
use punky could you use J you could use
Blade II there's so many different
template engines but all you need to
know is just one and then every single
one after that you understand it and
like I said the beauty about pug is that
you can use it for every single program
single programming language out there
even from golang to PHP from PHP to no
js' you can use pod and what's cool is
if you're going to be creating a you
know a page a HTML page you can
literally export your HTML from pug
using gulp make your life easier
you could you know some in so many cool
things man if you haven't had the time
listen if you know HTML and CSS
you took this alright I'm actually going
to be changing the timeline if you know
HTML CSS right after you know HTML CSS
and you've taken future proofs
JavaScript what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna have you guys working on pug so
I'm moving pug from extra-curricular
because in reality it's not an extra
it's more of a thing that you need to
make your life easier right so I'm
moving this stuff from here to up here
right after JavaScript so if you know
JavaScript learn pug then jump to jQuery
then jump to es6 and beyond right so I'm
changing a couple of things here I'm
moving nodejs
from here so I'm moving it to before
laravel like a pro because number one
I'm gonna finish this this faster then
I'm gonna finish till Arabo laravel is a
very huge framework it's not as easy as
as Express with Express it's like okay
you know JavaScript here hit the ground
running laravel there's a lot of
features that you're gonna need some
time to learn so yeah that's what we're
doing right now
I hope you guys really enjoy this man
you know take the time and go to the
website sign up guys I'm telling you
right now just sign up just so you can
lock in that price man five dollars a
month you're gonna get all of those
courses plus more I'm building courses

same time once you on this course you
own it forever right so you're going to
be able to come here and still see new
courses that are being added or like new
projects are being added to your courses

responses perhaps and you know for this
