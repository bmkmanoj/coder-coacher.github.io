don't know how I forgot about that yeah
I remember when a few months ago I was
like oh man I have this other channel
wave was this kid's name of my boy Juan
right and basically I gave him a channel
I gave him my channel which was already
established it was like a music channel
why the reviews and I upload their
videos way before
DJ academics was even around I was doing
that a while back and I totally forgot
that I had that that channel else
popping so I might bring it back up um
yeah so I might bring it back up so let
me show you not million dollars but
millions of views all right now I
totally forgot I don't even have most of
the videos here are not freaking high
colas isn't are now monetized because at
that point I wasn't really monetizing my
videos but I'm looking at this and this
is kind of crazy that I have a channel
with like millions of views which I
forgot I know I had another one back in
2011 that I sold and I already had
millions of views but let me see I
totally forgot about this channel man
it's so crazy there's like duh this is
like legacy Joe that's a legacy Joe back
in the day so we got the rich homie Quan
rapper who else we got mr. fat famous
that I really i fat kanye was Kiko - and
marriage proposal RP little snoop video
chance drug shy and held like a flock
but why you those videos have like
millions of you
like it's kind of crazy I totally forgot
about this channel
and you know what's cool about this
channel is that I'm about to take it
back I won't tell my boy like yo listen
I came on this channel it's like I gave
him a poppin channel like literally all
you have to do is put in on the end
screens your videos and you're gonna be
poppin because no matter what these
videos they have a lot of views in
constantly like every month again was a
like 200-300 thousand views on this
channel and I gave it to him
right and he's lazy this is how you know
people are lazy man I give him a channel
which which already has an audience has
millions of views and he wanted to get
into YouTube and that's all him yo start
being consistent start getting her on on
your shame you know starting when she
started working hard and this dude
literally he did one video he did a
couple of videos in August 14
that's almost a year ago you telling me
you haven't done no videos till now like
I'm taking my channel back man what's
cool about this is that I'm gonna use
this this channel as case study on how
to make money on YouTube right so I'm
gonna take the channel back for him
because he ain't doing with a I
gave him the opportunity he could be
earning right now five thousand dollars
a month if he was smart if you were to
continue doing videos every single day
from there to now he would've been
making five g's or more cuz look
millions of views that equals equals a
lot of money man
trust me so I'm taking a channel back
I'm gonna use it as a case study for
Lahti right on how to make money and how
to monetize all your channels change
that channel to Lodi
lottie's is a channel is gonna be
completely clean like this channel
a lot of curse words this channel has a
lot of content that a you can't monetize
like you know rich homie Quan shot and
on stage like like that right you
can't really monetize that right so what
I'm doing is the way to monetize
something like that is you take the
people are there that's already watching
that and you resent them to somewhere
else so that's what I'm gonna do um and
yeah man and it's gonna be a cool case
study for Lottie but I'm just thinking
in my head I'm like I totally forgot
about this channel you know it's like
you know some people hit me up or
sometimes on a free game on the YouTube
like you know stupid comments like ah
your channels not gonna bro like I
already had a hundred thousand
subscribers before and I already have
sold that channel i have a channel where
it's still active which gets laying
about half a million views a month right
like and all this stuff is not new to me
you guys are saying it was new to me is
really done that nature game and that
game on what development you know cuz
there's a thing like I always know how
to make money online always know how to
do my thing and you know I decided to
become a web developer because I also
wanted to have something that was steady
and you know to have a nine-to-five job
right but like I already know how to do
all of the before I was even doing
what development like you know what I
mean like I was still able to survive in
this world and you know what I mean like
people ask me Joe how the hell you
you know you quit your job and this
dissing Dalek when I quit my job I was
getting about like nine hundred dollars
a month from from YouTube which it's not
much but it's enough for you to survive
while you are home and and you're
learning to code and all this right
so that's why I was telling you guys you
always have to have some side income
you cannot just be dependent on one
single job in but out
only job that I make money on now do
what I do you know I come in and I have
like 20 different little things that
generate money look if you have 20
plates places in 20 pages that generate
you 500 dollars you're good you get what
I'm saying like that was my goal that's
how I did my thing you know what was
cool for me like you know becoming a web
developer is that it literally opened
doors for me to be able to build
anything that I want right like if I
have an idea of like a website that
could make money a small micro service
that I know can make money then I just
go and build it right like that was the
best thing about becoming a web
developer becoming web developers like
becoming I don't know like an engineer
or like a carpenter it's like you have
an idea you know how to build it you
don't know saying this it's like you're
like architect like hey you you come in
and you say hey I want to build my house
like this you could build it because
your architect you get what I'm saying
that's how it feels when you are a web
developer but it's cool because I
totally forgot about this channel I'm
like oh sure I'm about to monetize to
share this channel right now so you cuz
I gave it to this kid I gave it to this
cable world I told her I was like yo man
take this channel you know do what you
do get your money you know and I'm
starting you off with something oh
there's people out there that wish they
will have a channel that's already
popping like that with millions of views
and in still active right they wish they
had something like that because you
could make a lot of money on YouTube if
you have millions of views per month
like you just gotta learn how to
monetize that right today
lotty means living off the internet
right I'm basically that zooming sorry
phone zoomed in my fault
but yeah a lot is all about living off
the internet
I'm also gonna do lies you know live
streams here like I said I'm gonna use
this channel for my live streams how
I've been doing it that's why I tell you
guys follow this channel and follow the
Lahti channel because the Mladic channel
is it's part of this channel it's just a
cleaner a cleaner channel where we
basically we talk about how to make
money you got what I'm saying
this channel when you see videos here
they're strictly about what development
you know top programming languages are
freaking tutorials on how to install PHP
my sequel how to do this and that you
know when is the next video for ludie
coming out I'm actually recording some
of the parts I'm editing it it's gonna
be a legit video and I'm gonna break
down all all the ways that I make money
from like the different websites to
YouTube to hear coding phase to coding
phase com2 every single thing
right so I'm pretty much breaking down
how I make money per month right I'm at
an average of twenty thousand I'm afraid
and then the minimum that I've done so
far is like eighteen thousand marks
right so what I'm doing is I'm teaching
you guys a lot e how I do it right now
this there's gotta be multiple ways
which is what I'm gonna focus on on the
the other channel the Lodi channel on
Lodi I'm gonna explain to you different
ways of how to make money either with
social media
affiliate marketing becoming a web
developer and creating your services
micro services and being able to make
money with that be becoming a content
editor you know somebody who creates
blogs basically every single way that
you could think of how to make money
passively I'm going to create like four
sections
about creating a YouTube section I don't
know if I should do a social media
section social media section a
programming section what else what else
is out there
social media programming I think I'm
gonna focus on those two because if I
put social media social media is is
everything like that's what well
matter-of-fact content editing content
making so you could have social media
which is Instagram YouTube Twitter how
to make money with those those websites
and then you have programming which is
how to make money with web development
how to make money with phone
applications how to make money with
software applications you know you can
create a stupid high coolest Chrome
extension how do you make money from
that Chrome extension you know what I'm
saying like this this I'm gonna give you
guys a little preview all right
so let me see parla there's an extension
called panda extension panda extension
let me see Chrome Web Store
okay is it this one
um Panda
let me see how is it more extensions ok
pad the five all right you guys should
add this to your thing to your Chrome so
whatever we're gonna add this right and
I'm gonna show you guys this is a very
very simple Chrome extension ok now this
guy that built this thing it is
basically like how you call as I SR Fe
and I forgotten to me the name of it but
all he does is pretty much take the feet
RSS feed yeah so he created a page that
looked like a web application which is a
an extension for for your Chrome right
and all he does is takes RSS feed RSS
feeds from different websites like
dribble so you have it on your home page
so like when you open up a new tab
automatically pandas shows up right so
now this person he could put ads in here
you see ads by carbon he can put like
let's say if you wanted to add more
feeds like it lets you hold three feats
that's it once you have three more feeds
from like let's say nine to five Mac or
whatever website that you like this guy
basically makes money off that this is a
paid subscription to it
so let me see Panda weekly and uh log in
register so you could log in and then
pretty much there's a thing here where
he has it that so get more feet add it
to your panda homepage you got to pay
him like five dollars a month now you
think like who the hell is gonna pay for
RSS feeds right but there's many of the
people who use this thing all you need
is three percent two to ten percent to
make a profit so three percent of the
people signed up to that thing you're
good you get what I'm saying so that's a
micro service that as a web developer
you could do this with your eyes closed
you know
what is the application for website
Corning what that'll make no sense okay
so what's the what's the questions let
me see Gaurav Naggar says I'm a
beginning of confused how payment of
hosting give my client to freelance what
developer because how's hosting I see
any bill so how that thing works because
clients pay one time so who gives bill
of the yearly hosting well that's what
you got a charge though so I gotta say
you tell them ahead of time I hate your
your client right you looking to build a
website you're gonna need the whole
thing do you want the hosting just for
one year and that's it so one year is
gonna be $60 right that's $60 you're not
gonna tell them oh it cost $60 you're
gonna tell them to cost $120 so you can
make sixty dollars in profit now this is
when you come in you tell them hey man
listen if you really want to be secure
with your website you don't want to lose
your domain you don't want to lose here
your hosting because I'm not keeping you
tell them straight up I'm sometimes I
don't have a copy of your website so if
you lose your website you lost your
website the best thing to do is to
really save to save yourself from that
the heading is buying hosting for five
six years so what you do is you charge
them for the five six years if it's $60
$60 on let me see somebody send me a
message if it's $60 all right per year
you say sixty times five that's 300 now
you multiply that by two you charge them
six hundred three hundred that's going
for your pocket and three hundred
dollars that's going for the five years
after hosting you know what I'm saying
like that's how you do it you don't you
don't pay for it you know they have to
pay for that and then you make money off
whatever they pay ya what I'm saying
yeah that's fine if you got questions go
ahead ask me man oh so what's this guy's
name Bess you how do you make passive
income you got to go to Lodi go to Lodi
I'm releasing a video maybe by tonight
or tomorrow morning explaining how I
make money on YouTube on my websites on
freelancing on tutoring on everything
I'm gonna give you guys the minimum
amount that I made in in one month right
this counting this year I'm not counting
lassie I'm not constantly here before
accountant this year starting from
January 2018 either you know from we got
why we got January February March April
so four months right in those four
months I'm gonna give you guys the
minimal amount that I got right okay
well client paid this to a beginner yes
if they wanna look of course the client
is gonna pay you like this is the thing
you can never tell a client hey I'm
gonna beginner like naw you never tell a
client I'm a beginner that's why I tell
you guys you gotta build a portfolio
that's super legit that people will look
at you gonna tame this guy he's up there
like this is a professional that's what
you want to show you don't want to show
them that oh I have a JavaScript watch
from you know West's boss huh
you know what I mean like you don't want
to be showing that you want to show them
the full applications so when they look
at it they're like oh wow other kinds
already paying money you know they paid
top dollar to this guy
you know what I mean like that's how you
do it you never want to show to a client
that you are a beginner you know there's
been times that I got hired for
positions that I didn't know about
but the way how I conducted myself I
frickin got the job
you know was it it was like a job a long
time ago that they wanted me to do
WordPress when I didn't even know
WordPress all I knew was HTML CSS and
JavaScript at that time and I didn't
know nothing about WordPress I spent one
whole weekend looking online and
learning WordPress and copy and pasting
and and literally by the time I got to
work on Monday I already know what to do
and I even not know everything what to
do but I knew where to find the answers
you gotta say so yeah
yeah I don't know if I'm gonna do that
on Lodi I'm gonna do it here like the
career stuff like as far as like what
development like everything that's gonna
be on Lodi is gonna be about making
money like getting to the bag you know
what I mean like it's just straight to
the bag like here we talk about coding
we talk about getting a job getting you
know getting to you know get into
interviews how to you know how to pass
an interview stuff like that like we
talked about that here right because the
other channel I want it to be just like
a hub there's gonna be people there and
that is coming from all type of careers
and all type of businesses you know so
it's not just gonna be what development
there's gonna be people are coming in
from all type of lifestyles you know
what I mean like I had a girl who sent
me a message is like oh man I know how
to make jewelry how do I make money with
me making my own jewelry I'm like yes
that's exactly what the channel is gonna
be about like how do you make money with
the skills that you already have right
you know I mean so yeah
but yeah man we out here let me see
oh god I'm like I totally forgot man I
totally forgot about this channeling
that I have this channel like I know for
a fact was the traffic that I'm getting
on that channel I could get at least
three thousand dollars extra a month
from that channel alone cuz look at this
like per month I make about like from
YouTube ads and stuff like that on this
channel like I don't know maybe like 900
ava's so Mima and so knowing that this
channel is there man it's just another
income stream man so I hope you guys
like that technical commenting you know
some people you know I wish there was
like people that were more like me you
know when I tell you guys man I feel
like programming should not be a
religion like people talk about
programming at some religion and that's
why I wanna I want to get you guys to
understand this like the guys who are on
top the guys who own the companies they
don't look at programming and then look
at what frameworks and technology as as
a religion right the people who think
like that are the people at the bottom
right who are the software engineer is
the developers those guys are at the
bottom of the chain okay when you work
at a company you work at the bottom
right yes we get paid a lot compared to
somebody who works at McDonald's right
but do we make us much as the CEO of the
company do we make as much money as the
CTO that's the project manager sometimes
project managers don't even know how to
code and they make more money than us
you know what I'm saying so
you gotta stop thinking like things this
is our religion everybody that's on this
channel I'm gonna try to take you guys
away from that I want you guys to think
of this as a skill for for you to be
able to build income right I want you
guys to of course get a job and get
clients and you know do everything that
you got to do because there's a process
right but once you get to learn all of
the things that you need like you
shouldn't be thinking oh yeah I can't
wait to you know work at this company so
that retired nah man you should be
thinking about hey I'm gonna work at
this company I'm getting $100,000 a year
how can I start saving money for the
next two or three years to be able to
have 50,000 100,000 dollars in my bank
account so I can open up my own business
that's how I want you guys to start
thinking I don't want you guys to start
thinking like oh man oh I'm gonna do
this forever like nah you should use use
technology how to ce o--'s use
technology you know I mean as tools you
should have been thinking about
programming as a religion like oh my god
we've gotta love this thing we gotta bow
down to the code nah man you make the
work you make the code work for you you
get what I'm saying like that's what I'm
trying I'm trying to elevate a lot of
you guys you know this people that come
here to my channel or sometimes they
hate that I oh man it's you know it's
like you're here just for the money and
like bro what do you think Mark
Zuckerberg is here for you know what why
do you think Mark Zuckerberg built
Facebook you gonna say why you think
like Bill Gates been around for so long
it's not for the passion people will be
thinking always for the passion now if
there's no reward at the end there is no
passion you're gonna say like why do you
think you know guys that love to play
basketball what's the dream was to dream
to to play bass cooler single day to
play basketball every single day is to
think man someday I'm gonna make it to
the NBA if there's no reward at the end
people don't go to play basketball
you're not saying same thing as the
going to the gym a lot of guys go to the
gym to work I would look good whatever
but these guys that's there for a reason
they they're trying to stretch their
body they like you know what my body is
how I sell myself you know there's guys
that you know by the way they look they
could get more they could get more money
and get to places where people who don't
have the same bodies as them won't be
able to get into you gotta say like it's
like you go to to a a car dealership
let's say so Mercedes Benz car
dealership usually the the guys there
it's like a guy that's in shape you know
perfect smile perfect hair cold you know
what I really like he sells himself out
there right so he's constantly in the
gym working out you know getting himself
prepared so when people see him they see
like oh this guy has his together
you gonna say but you go to like one of
those dealerships where they're
selling you know a freaking Ford Focus
the guy got a big guy's got you know
looking extra fine looking extra sloppy
the you know the $25 shoe like that guy
is not selling you gotta say like
there's a huge difference you know so
you gotta start thinking about
everything in life as how to use
something to basically either better
yourself or basically get more income
unfortunately this world is about income
I wish it wasn't I wish we was over here
trading I could trade you know it's like
here's some strawberries and you trade
me some pears I wish it was a world
where we co actually just barter for it
for everything right and I'll be like
hey I got a ps4 game you give me a you
know a brand-new computer you gotta
understand that world does not exist you
know what I mean time equals money
and money equals to success into
opportunities you know I mean like I
wish the world was that easy where we
could just start trading strawberries
and like that you know what I mean
where everybody would just all be like
how you call it it's like the freight
stars you know what I mean like we'll be
out here we rolling around with rocks
and when I hey man I just got this
branding rock can you trade me this rock
for that piece of meat you know what I
mean we don't live in that world you
know what I mean like we live in a world
where you have to to be able to get to
places you need to start thinking like
the guys that get to places you can't be
out here you know thinking like a
regular dude man this regular people
don't do with their life you never
say like when you just become a regular
person and you conform and you're like
ah God for today and you know I got a
little roof you know I live under a
bridge but I got a roof over my head
like nah man you gotta start thinking
how do I get out of here how do I move
to an apartment for an apartment how do
I move to a house for the house I do I
moved to a two-story house for a
two-story house how do I move to a
mansion from a mansion how do you move
to a hi Scott ha ha
freakin you know freakin cool as hi
scraper whatever you know nothing like
this always loves to this you know
you could never stay stuck at that level
you know what I mean when you work at a
company I keep repeating this when you
work at a company and I'm telling you
guys this from experience you are at the
bottom yes you have skills yes you are
technical yes there's a lot of stuff
that you can do that most people cannot
do it and they do appreciate that but
you are at the bottom you're not making
the decisions that make money if you
come up with an idea that since hey the
company is gonna make a hundred million
dollars you're still making you a
hundred thousand dollars a year you're
not getting a million dollars because
you came up with idea you're getting a
hundred thousand dollars you gotta say
who gets paid for that hundred
the guy's not only the guys who are
project managers the guys who are CTO
CFO CEO those guys are getting the money
you my friend you are the high corners
you are the mechanic in a mercedes-benz
dealership you know what I'm saying like
yes you are a mercedes-benz but you are
a mechanic you get what I'm saying
so how can you build your own either
your own car or how can you build your
own company to to basically create your
own dealership that's how I look at
things you know so yes sir and another
thing too money does not equal to
happiness right that never works but
what equals to happiness is success and
also being able to provide for other
people and being able to to be able to
say yes you know I mean like you
somebody asks you hey do you want some
steak yes you want some champagne yes do
you want to buy this shirt yes do you
want to take a trip yes the parts where
you're upset you're depressed and you
you're sad a life is when every time you
have to say no it's like it goes back to
when you was a little kid he was a child
you know when you was a child you could
if your parents tell you yes you're
gonna be happy your parent tells you no
you're gonna be like damn this suck and
you start crying you're gonna say but if
you are able to say yes to everything
and you have the option to say yes
there's a big difference between having
to say say no because you can't do
something to being able to say no I feel
like saying yesterday you know it's like
it's a huge difference you know so
anyway so what's good with you guys man
sorry I went to that rant
I just I'm trying to get you guys to
elevate and take you guys to the next
level because like right now I just like
I said I just realized
this freakin channels here and I'm like
holy that's ex like I totally
forgot about that I created that channel
like three years ago
no I created a channel in maybe 2007
around there and I just left it there I
left it alone I could upload some videos
around 2010-2011 I guess some of the
videos are now picking up like getting a
lot of views whatever and now I just
realized on my own shortcoming $3,000
extra from me he gave us something three
how much it when you think about it how
much is $3,000 $3,000 is with somebody
that works at a teacher makes $3,000
right so I'm about to make $3,000 from a
stupid YouTube channel
you gotta say so when I think about them
like wait somebody's gonna have to go to
work every single day wake up every
single morning go into traffic go into
the job take their little kids inside a
classroom teach for eight hours and do a
meeting after school come back home
driving two hours to an hour to get to
their house and I'm about to make that
from my house from here from from this
chair right here I got the you know the
PJs on I got the PJs on I got the the
 t-shirt like and all of this is
from skills that keep acquiring you know
it's like how we thinking sometimes like
yo I want to know when was it that I
like I don't know I I did the transition
cuz I remember I was just like I was
walking around here like super broke and
like not knowing what the hell to do
with my myself love if you guys heard
that song provider right when I told you
guys the other night room listen to that
song when I was listening to that song I
was super freaking depressed I was like
depressed because number one I had no
money in my pocket I had no food we was
living with my mom
we'll leave and we'll leave five dollars
on top of the table
and be like okay guys he has five
dollars buy some food with five dollars
I had to buy beef with broccoli stretch
that for one day for me and my sister
and then leave the other half for the
next day so meaning I had to survive two
days each day with two dollars and fifty
cents you know what I'm saying like I
don't know if you guys have ever been in
situations like that like when I say I
come from the bottom I mean like the
bottom like they ain't nobody gave me
shake so sometimes I wonder I'm like
when was it that like things started
changing like okay finally things are
starting to look good in my life I think
it was like at 26 27 around there and
I'm just like man this is crazy it's
like you know sometimes you feel like
good things it's never gonna happen to
you and good things it's not gonna come
your way
but you gotta continue you know what I
mean like that's like when those people
that they freaking commit suicide and
shall I die are depressing this is never
like just hold on life gets better you
gotta say like if you continue at the
same pace that you're going and then try
to speed it up a little bit more
whatever process that you're doing if
you're trying to open up a store if
you're trying to learn web development
if you're trying to become a better
designer if you're trying to do
something else all you have to do is
just keep going life gets better at the
end you know it's like if you work hard
you know what I mean
it's gonna happen the people that don't
don't get anything is because they
conform if you conform it's like right
now I could say hey you know I'm 20
years old right I couldn't find a job
there's a job in in the the hospital and
I'm gonna become a janitor at the
hospital okay I got the job at the
hospital for $18 an hour okay I'm
feeling better you know life is a little
bit better for me right
but do I stay at their hospital being a
janitor forever no that's not what you
do
you continue growing you are that you
have two ways you have to get another
job or you say you know what I'm gonna
continue wrong here I'm gonna become the
head manager of the frickin maintenance
of the hospital those guys make money
you know the guys that do hospitality or
was it there's a career name nothing
hospitality something like that
those guys they make money if you stay
you could start somewhere as a janitor
and continue growing yourself up through
the ranks of just working hard and
showing up there on time making sure
everything is clean making sure that all
the rooms have the right amount of
gloves whatever it is that you have to
do you can grow them you know what I
mean the people that get conformed and
be like oh yeah no I'm gonna buy little
$18 an hour I could pay my little red
you know if I have a kid you know we
could get some wigs you know some
welfare and business and that if you
think like that you're not gonna get
nowhere you got on sailing that's not
that's not what is what's gonna happen
you gotta start thinking like how the
 can you start making more money in
and you start growing either in that
industry or in another industry but you
gotta do it you know what I mean you
can't just stop so yeah man sorry I'm
going to this rent it's just it's one of
those moments man it's one of those
moments man where I realized some
and I'm not old I gotta tell my peoples
about this we live you're gonna say like
man I can't believe like I'm about to
create one of these things and you know
undercut this this guy cuz we'll see
allow like look at this this guy he
has literally RSS feeds and then he
charged like $3 or something like that
for this

same application in undercut him and if
he's charging $3 I'll charge $2 you got
our saying I don't have the time
solution right now but what if you guys

video go subscribe to Lottie you know
let me know also
do you mind me talking about how to make

me to just continue just talking about
code on the live streams we can just
keep it just straight to code or do you
want me to you know share ideas on how
to make passive income you guys let me
know I'm gonna put a survey on the
YouTube channel to see cuz I know some
people would be like not Amandla
I just want my code man I just wanna I
want to know how to do functions you
know what I mean
like if you're one of those people let
me know if the majority of people want
me to just focus on a code I will just
focus on a code here and not share
different things all this this platform
you know I use well I want you guys to
stay happy and continue doing what you
guys are doing you know what I mean but
at the same time I want to elevate you
guys I wanna want you guys to get to the
same place that I'm at and even surpass
me like I know a lot of you guys have a
lot of good ideas that I don't even know

you so I think if I just put the bug in
your ear then you know then I'm just
trying to help out
Amen word yeah now I'm gonna I'm gonna
look I'm gonna do the survey I'm gonna
do a survey and see what the people say

is a personal channel where I talk about
my life isn't what developer the
projects that I'm working as a web
developer the things that you need to
learn to become a web developer it's a
personal channel it's not a channel is
not fun fun function it's now traversing

already know the basics of HTML CSS
there's a lot of people who are coming
in and learning
they're very beginners right but the
majority of you guys you have been with
me for a whole year right now so by now
you guys should already know all the
basic stuff now is when we start talking
about how do we get the jobs how do we
start getting getting our income up how
do we add you know extra income to
whatever we're making at a job like
those are the type of things I feel like
I need to start making in the next in
the next phase of coding phase right and
at the same time we have Lodi so lot is
literally for everybody Nadi is for
designers lottery is for girls who do
make up Lodi is for guys who go to the
gym and they wanna you know
show their pictures on Instagram how do
you monetize that Lodi is for what

David Shakir says how do you was it how
do you charge clients by the our flat
rate I have the skills will have a hard
time trying to balance it
whether I'm charging too much or not
enough it depends if it's like a project
and you know it's gonna take you a X
amount of these like it wouldn't make
sense to charge by the hour now if
there's something like a small a couple
of tweaks or whatever then from there
you would charge by the hour you'll be
like hey man minimum that I get paid is
$50 an hour if it's something gonna be
if it's gonna be something is gonna take
like five hours to charge $50 an hour or
$100 an hour whatever you want to charge
whatever you think they could pay to
sometimes people charge things it's like
great now some random guy shows up shows
up in a bicycle right if some guy comes
up to me in a bicycle and he doesn't
bring me a website I know them well this
guy's not gonna have the money you know
that I would charge you no I'm not a
charging like $5,000 I know the most
he's probably gonna pay is 500 so then
what I would say is hey 700 all right
and OBO I don't have that much money so
no but okay 600 many more I could do man
you know and then I say you keep it at
600 they give you the first half you're
gonna give me 300 at first and then the
other 300 when the job is done you get
what I'm saying that's how I would do it
