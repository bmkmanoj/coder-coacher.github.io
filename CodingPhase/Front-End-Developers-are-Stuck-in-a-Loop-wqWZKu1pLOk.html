again man coding face.com your boys
backing out and did it again guys once
again we get an amazing amazing amazing
article on the internet you know
sometimes I'll tell you guys man you see
a lot of BS on the internet but there's
a lot of times like this people like out
there like me that understand is like
you know so let's go to the title of it
pretty much it's modern frame modern
front-end frameworks should be less of a
frame and more of a work now for a lot
of you guys they're probably thinking
about this like what does that mean it
pretty much this guy his name's is a
cubic I yell I guess he has to be from
somewhere in the world I don't know I
know that's not that's not English or
Spanish I don't know where that coming
from but yeah this guy is super cool I
like him you know why let's give him a
follow because he has some legit legit
sense way when it comes to front-end
frameworks and everybody here knows it
right every single one of you guys I'm
not talking about the guys I just got
here you know if you just got here last
week and you're like oh man HTML CSS is
so hard this really doesn't fall for you
but for the guys that already passed
that stage now you're in the world of
JavaScript now you're in the world of
hey I'm here to learn which one is with
the best framework out there soon as you
ask that question you already failed you
know why because everybody's gonna tell
you
although angular do view do react to
angular 1 do knock out the backbone do
whatever literally you're gonna get a
million frameworks now you know what's
the point of a framework a framework is
supposed to do things that you can't do
with JavaScript right or for example
yeah you could do it with JavaScript but
it takes you forever to do like instead
of you having to come in and write
something you know 200 lines of
JavaScript code in vanilla
javascript it takes you 20 lines to do
it with a framework that's the point of
a framework right but what's the
situation that's happening now it's like
every single day you know people are
coming in you know companies come in and
they start you know a new framework
comes in everybody's like you know what
man
we got a jump on that framework so
people you know people start telling
telling the people from the company like
hey man we got an update man we got an
upgrade so then every six months to a
year a new framework comes out and think
about it like this everybody who does
JavaScript want to feel special
everybody every single developer out
there wants to create something that
other people are gonna use and other
peoples gonna give it a lot of stars and
then they're gonna become popular online
that's just how it is everybody wants to
be popular let's be honest right so
people keep on creating frameworks to
redo the same thing every single time
you know what I mean like this guy he
had a very good example let me see oh
where was so he says because of this we
are due to endlessly poor UI components
from framework X to framework Y fancy
calendar to ng fancy calendar calendar
to ng to fancy calendar to react fancy
calendar meaning hey we already did this
in JavaScript let's say for example we
did in JavaScript nah
now let's do in jQuery now we do the
same calendar in angular and oh wait
wait wait
angular 2 came out let's do it again
Euler - oh wait but you know the
originator of components and how things
look and everything works perfectly it's
actually react so let's jump to react oh
wait wait wait wait no let's not do that
let's do a view V buying this V buying
that because view now does were react
and angular does together they both had
a baby and then they have an abortion
pretty much that's what view is right so
this happens right all the time so he
has this a great paragraph
fear was I kill vinca big companies
invest tons of money and man-hours to
integrate a framework into their product
porting is expensive yes it costs a lot
of money every time that you know
somebody comes in and be like you know
what guys everything that we did last
year there's a better way to do it come
on let's do it and yes you can say hey
man if we don't port things and we don't
redo it again and we make it just a
little bit faster and we make the code a
little bit cleaner and we have a brand
new algorithm that can just take
whatever was taken from the freaking
database and make it in two milliseconds
faster you know if it wasn't because of
that a lot of us wouldn't have jobs
that's what some of them the people will
say but you know what it's fine cool
but then the the rest of the paragraph
he goes saying so he's like yo those
companies then spend a lot of time and
money porting components and building
whole UI libraries which works with
their selective framework so meaning
they're back in it already works
everything is there it already works
they still haven't seen customers this
everybody gets to buy the their product
that's really nothing else that needs to
be done but they still do it so they
start working and when they are about
75% they're a new framework suddenly
arise now the dev team wants to migrate
and the company has to choose between
migrating all their work and rebuilding
everything again and made the dev team
happy or lose their developers to the
trends there is a big problem which cost
big money as a solver consultant at
whatever company he works at I have many
times seeing companies get stuck with
two-year-old frameworks and cannot hire
developers nobody wants to work with it
anymore so years old it is serious
problem for software companies as it is
also a problem for us develop
do we really need or do we really want
our job to be focused on rebuilding
everything over and over and over and
over and over and over again but on
different stacks we need to stop being
imprisoned by libraries and tools but
how all right I'm not gonna read the
whole article but this paragraph here is
golden kids you know for for those of
you guys that haven't really been around
you know this thing sums up your whole
career pretty much doesn't matter what
company you go to doesn't matter what
you do you're always going to be
rebuilding the same things and same
things same things same thing same thing
same thing something now what's really
cool about this which he mentions it is
for you guys new developers right this
is why I tell you guys hey guys do PHP
hey guys do react to angular you know a
lot of people want to jump into view and
it's not that I hate it even though I do
hate it but it's just the fact that
there's so many companies out there
hiring for you to learn something that
is not going to get you a job guys is
really wasting your time time is money
you get old you have problems you need
to pay for all right so if you need
to pay for you need a job monies
are not gonna come from the sky all
right the only way that you're gonna get
money is by having a job or having some
type of business or maybe you know you
might sell drugs on the side that's
that's on you if you want to do that but
what I'm saying is as you can see here
he's like yo I have many times seen
companies get stuck with two years old
frameworks and cannot hire developers
you know it's like I saw this like last
year and I saw the last year I saw this
year there were so many companies
hitting me up about angular one like man
we need a developer who knows angular
one like begging little
begging hey Wow everybody on the
internet is talking about angular to
view and all this other frameworks
everybody's talking about that and it's
like man this company's begging here for
people to come work on this projects
that are already in at angular 1 or even
right now you know by next year let's
see what's gonna happen next year is
gonna be crazy
there's a lot of your frameworks coming
up and once again it's gonna be another
race two things are people gonna do
they're gonna jump into the next thing
right that's what every developer wants
to do that's what every you know a
senior developers out there man I've
been doing I've been doing react for
three years man we got a jump on the
next thing man the Harry Potter
framework just came out the Teletubby
framework just came out the Batman
versus Robin framework came out we need
to jump on it like you know what I mean
like people are pretty crazy you know
and it's like he goes into this right
and he tries to explain like you know I
mean what do we do do we just say hey we
know JavaScript regular JavaScript can
we just do everything in JavaScript you
know I think there should be a little
high collars longevity with every
framework there should be like a plan
like a five to ten year plan right for
companies and for frameworks all right
and the community should should
definitely agree with this and be like
hey man you know what instead of us
creating our frameworks right
how about we contribute to the really
good frameworks that are out there how
about we just stay there and we
contribute there all right and we
upgrade those frameworks all right
instead of us coming in every single
week somebody creates a BS framework man
I myself have been you know guilty of
that to test the waters to see if I
could create one I've created the rocky
stack and the rocky stands pretty legit
you know is it's just a stack that's why
they even call it a framework it's just
a stack as a collection of different
libraries that I think are really good
that worked with Crystal Lake right now
I seen people create frameworks that
it's like bro you're not solving any
problem you're not doing anything new
somebody hit me up today on the comments
what was it it was like a car handy say
um you shouldn't have made a video only
after five hours of working on a
framework and that was when I was
talking about vgs i spent five hours
guys two hours learning it fire I was
basically porting the same framework the
same uh sorry the same project that I
already have already created on my
website that I was working on 39 dollar
glasses comm for the company I was doing
this thing called a Tryon tool I was
building this thing I built it in react
right and then I rebuilt it again in
View GS to see how good it was because
this thing is hard this thing is hard
this thing literally can test out every
single framework out there if I can go
in there and build this freaking library
that I created it to basically you know
put the the glasses in somebody's face
calculate everything rear Enders every
time you know the whole shebang I'm not
gonna go too deep into it but if in
three hours after poured in it to view
Jes I'm like yo view Jes is trash you
get what I'm saying like it I'm sorry
he's like yo you shouldn't have made
this video only after five hours working
on a framework I'm like bro it's trash
I'm not going to spend any more time on
it it doesn't bring nothing new to the
table you get what I'm saying like this
is what what the problem is out there
you know sometimes people think like hey
man the cool thing is to learn
everything over and over and over and
over again
nah the point of this is to actually
work and that was the whole thing where
you know he said here model framework
modern Fernet framework should be less
of a frame and more of a work like yeah
that's a lot of frame you're learning
how to work with this frame of this
framework but you're doing less work you
get what I'm saying I hope you guys
understand what what this means you're
gonna be constantly learning different
frames alright because that's what they
are every single library comes in and
calls themselves a framework it's like
hey that's how you do it viii behind sv
bind that ng this ng to this well you
know do this with react create a
component like this like everybody does
their own different thing but you're
doing the same thing you know what I'm
saying like there's so many times that
I'll be like man we re creating the the
wheel every single day who is giving
this people a pass on this you got what
I'm saying like who was out here you
know why nobody talks about this like
they're what you know and to bring it
back to view js4 view Jay has to be out
here there was no need for it like
literally the best thing that even you
could have done was joined the react
team there was no need for him to be
doing of UJS app there was no need for
the industry didn't need it there was
nothing that they were bringing in that
was new it's just too something for the
ego to say hey guys I'm smart I could
build my own even though it's doing the
same thing as everybody else is doing
but hey I'm smart you know and this the
part of the industry where I'm like man
this is ridiculous and it's just how you
know
eirick I I forgot how to say his name
I'm a kind of setting like yo you see
companies getting stuck you know like
right now everybody jumping on something
right and they get stuck with a
framework and they're like man now we
honor the the Teletubby framework
and the next year is like hey it's Harry
Potter now kid
you guys are old and it's only been out
for like two years how can I be old you
know what I'm saying like this nobody
else is coming up with anything that's
revolutionary nothing that's new you
know a lot of the stuff that the reasons
why excuse me why frameworks were
creating was because the the browsers
were super old and they couldn't do a
lot of things
now this browsers out there that are
pretty modern you know what I mean like
you know like a lot of the stuff that
we're creating doesn't make sense to
create it you know what I mean like I
don't know I guess I'm I guess I don't
know I guess I'm getting all the same
out here but man as a as a developer
who's been here for a while and the more
that I learned and the more that I get
into the industry I'm like man this is
kind of crazy to keep reinventing the
wheel every single year instead of
making something that's already there
great you know like how about you know
let's make angular 2 great you know
let's bring angular 5 or 4 or whatever
angular 77 great
let's make angular 77 great cuz every
year they're gonna come out with a new
version you know what I mean like and
even at that it kind of is kind of a
little bit better the fact that they're
thinking about that to just stay with
angular and let's just build this let's
not focus on recreating the wheel
because every time that somebody fails
on something that I came in I failed
them on the last one I'm not gonna keep
the name you know Harry Potter we jump
into the Batman versus Robin framework
this year you know that's just how it is
and I feel just like this developers are
being stuck to this this problem in the
industry of just like hey man we we get
bored let's be honest as developers we
get bored a lot of times because this
repetitive work if you build a website
before you're gonna build the website
tomorrow again if you know how to work
with
controllers in there about tomorrow
you're gonna learn again you're gonna
redo the same thing create another
controller that connects to the models
that connects to a form it's the same
work every single day right
so it's repetitive people want to come
in and say hey let's just rebuild the
same thing but let's just rename it you
know so I think that's that article
right there is is golden you know for
people who the more experience that you
get into this man trust me you're gonna
be like you know this this guy knows
what the hell he was talking about like
literally like it's crazy and you know
what let's get a whole bunch of claps
kids what's the maximum class we could
give somebody on medium and I would say
guys like you guys should okay 4050
claps guys you should definitely
subscribe to medium.com just go in there
sign up create an account create your
own blog write share ideas share your
thoughts
I think medium is really great because
it just gives people open space to to
talk about different topics and you know
sometimes there's less people that
there's less trolls on a medium than
there is here in YouTube right like if I
come in and I'll leave a video just like
this people will be like just 50,000
hate comments because to everybody you
know it's like the the horde a zombies
the herd of zombies is is just going
straight and they just like whew yes we
gotta go that's how they lookin out here
you know what I mean so if I come in
there I go against the horde of zombies
man they trying to bite my head off but
on medium you got to share your ideas
you know people will find it will leave
a calming a positive or a negative
comment or respect
comment right it's not like like you
know what I mean like this is zombies
out here you know you got freaking ready
you got stackoverflow full of the
zombies like people can't have their own
ideas you can't go against the the
things that are wrong in the industry
because it's like man we've been
following this trend for the past five
years and we're gonna continue following
it you know what a good thing is that at
the end of the tunnel there's a light
you know all the things that react bro
into the table all of the frameworks are
pretty much copy so what's gonna happen
with that you know in the future I could
see something like webassembly
being you know some type of standard
dealing more with the browser and we
could see something like Kotlin the
language may be taking over cuz from
what I heard this from what I heard
supposedly there's a Kotlin to
webassembly compiler right now being
being built so once that happens there's
really no need for us to be dinner with
JavaScript so a lot of stuff that we
focus on doing with lamb you know like
frameworks and all this stuff is gonna
get pretty much killed by that now is
that gonna be good or it's not gonna be
go and be bad I don't know I just hope
that you know for all of you guys that
gonna be in the industry in the next
five years
you know for your next five years that
you're gonna be in this thing and for
the future hopefully you don't have to
go in and spend every single year
learning a new framework to do the same
thing that you did last year with the
last framework all right guys
is your boy Joe back at it again Cody
face.com your boys backing out and did
it again just a real conversation
I'm loving this article I'm gonna put in
the comments check my description check
out a courses that I got everything that

not the biggest expert in the world
right I just come here and give you real
things that happen in the industry I
never worked for Google I've never

you're gonna be doing way better off
than Johnny from Macy's right you're
gonna be doing way better all then you
know for tests from you know Domino's
hey you're gonna do be doing a lot
better than you know Linda from
marketing you know she's still doing
freaking emails HTML emails sending out
emails and trying to get new customers
but she only made fifty thousand dollars
for the past ten years like you're gonna
do it way better than those people you
got what I'm saying so that's what I'm
here for so if you guys wanna check me
out man check the website out coding
face.com is literally right there you
check on the description you get 50% off
on everything I got over twenty courses
and every single day I create more
content and what's cool is just its
original content it's not like BS from
the internet all right so I'll see you
