the courses trust me guys like one thing
to like i was saying man learn PHP this
thing is like so super helpful man i
wish somebody would have told me this
question when i started making websites
I was just focusing on the front end
just HTML CSS and JavaScript man but
there were so many opportunities for me
if I would have learned our PHP back
then that it's not even funny plus the
fact that you get paid more money there
is something that people don't talk
about you get paid more money when you
know the back end then somebody knowing
just a front end where Arizona man I
love Arizona to man I've been you know
like once I get all my shit together man
I'm trying to get the fuck out of New
York that's a hundred percent because
it's like even though i'm earning some
good money but you can't even enjoy out
here I'm being honest like New York is
so expensive man like the little like
you know I looked at my fucking my taxes
right and my shit was looking like you
know a little 120k right and I'm like
man I still feel broke like you know
what I mean like I not like I'm fucking
making a whole bunch of money in like
fucking super rich but compared to a lot
of people out here I still feel broke
man like for me to feel good in New York
I need to earn at least 400,000 half a
million dollars a year that's where I
want to get to now if I move to
somewhere like Phoenix wear or like
fucking somewhere in Texas where it's
like you know you fucking by a a fucking
mansion for a hundred thousand then you
know you feel good you're like okay I'm
doing fucking good but here in New York
meant this is like fucking just regular
money you know what I mean like this
isn't nothing crazy
why don't know to cali yet because i
want to have my own business in the
sense of like by the time I i leave the
the place that i work at now number one
I want to finish the project that we're
building that's one which is going to
take at least to the end of this year
number two hour and a half coding face
calm completely done because that's
going to generate money for me to be
able to move around and go around the
country so and then at the same time
it's like I'm about to have a kid now so
if my kid's gonna be here in New York
and my girlfriend wants to be here in
New York then I have to stay here for a
little bit but at one point I am gonna

bro more and angry and I would say
indonesian or what's the other one
because every time i hear the last name
in gooey and angry and I think of like
indonesian or like one of those
countries on the south of like asian or
asian man i don't know man it just got
that flavor man i don't know what it is
man your boys joke back at it again word
who man if I was to tell you guys all
the courses i'm taking on you to me yeah
i wouldn't even believe it y'all be like
man yeah I wouldn't believe at all I was
taking so many freaking courses on you
to me it's not even funny but the reason
why I tell people like hey just by the
five courses that are there my list is
because not because there's not other
good ones but because those are the ones
dying no work and those are the ones
that I use in the beginning to get me to
where I am then everything else that's
more advanced like here you can find
more advanced courses in there but for a
brand new developer or somebody trying
to get into this industry
you have to start with the ones that are
guaranteed that work you know I mean I
wouldn't tell you guys hey jump onto
something that is just not gonna be as
good you know Oh Vietnamese there you go
which are you sure if I can avoid avoid
like a plague the golden course from
what's the guy's name I forgot but it's
a golden course that it always shows up
as number one man that fucking guy is so
boring like guys you have to understand
this don't pick a course because it says
oh you're gonna learn 20 hours 40 hours
of course you don't need when it comes
to coding you don't need 20 to 40 hours
inside of a course what you needed
somebody to break it down to you till
maybe 5 to 10 hours and break it down in
the easy way where you can understand it
you don't need somebody explaining to
you as if you're in a computer science
class because all they doing is
explaining a whole bunch of theory and
whole bunch of shit that could be
explaining in one minute instead of
making it a 10 minute video to explain
that Shane one minute i would say man if
it's like this if you know if you don't
know anything at all of web development
start with the cold with the coats or
web developer boot camp the note json'
because it teaches you HTML CSS in a
basic of JavaScript right and then you
have no GS but this the thing most
people don't understand what's going on
in ojs until later on so it's like you
might follow everything on the course
you're going to learn HTML CSS and
JavaScript but the no side even though
you're following it you don't you don't
really understand ojs until you have at
least six months working with no GS
because you know I don't like to
bullshit you guys like it that's how it
works that's why I would say take that
course first cool and then you you get a
taste of what the back end is and then
from they take the PHP course so you
could really learn the back end and
therefore they start making websites
after you start making websites then
from there take the
javascript the weird parts after you get
the JavaScript the weird parts then from
there jump on to react the react course
yeah that's how it is like it takes time
you know some people might say hey
you're gonna learn JavaScript right away
with this course or whatever it's not
gonna be that easy because you have to
understand when you take the colts class
right he's gonna teach you HTML CSS and
javascript in bootstrapping he's gonna
teach you all the basics right all the
things that you need to build a website
then you're going to learn the jQuery
things right jquery is easy but its not
JavaScript now from there you're gonna
jump into kno jes which is advanced
JavaScript it's JavaScript but more
advanced it's like more stuff that for
you to really understand it you have to
really know JavaScript and for you to
really know JavaScript it takes time
this is not like a thing where you say
oh yeah I'm gonna take a course for in
five days I'm gonna learn JavaScript it
doesn't work like that because what
you're going to do is going to take the
course but everything is not going to
stay in your brain you're not going to
be able to know how to put things
together the way how you learn how to
put things together is basically
learning the things from coats course
and then from there start making your
own websites start making your own men
you make your own little menu that when
you click it it drops down meaning when
you click it it adds a class and it
drops down or you make a slider or you
connect to an API those are the things
that's going to make you understand
JavaScript right now from there you
gotta learn if you really want to dive
into JavaScript then you gotta learn on
the weird parts of JavaScript that guy
will teach you everything in JavaScript
but the problem of it is like it's very
verbose like it's very deep so for you
to understand all of that you have to
thinking you had like oh this guy is
really going deep into JavaScript so it
might get boring after a while it might
get boring so what you do is you walk
away and then you come back to it create
a website and then come back to the
course because it's very deep but at the
same time you gotta jump on that PHP
course so it's like it's hard to tell
somebody hey take this course first then
take the other one cuz everybody here is
different like you know what I mean like
some of you guys are gonna be able to
understand the basics of web development
right away so if you understand the
basics what development right away go to
PHP automatically now if you mean if
you're coming from zero if you don't
know you have no knowledge start with
the web developer boot camp
now you gotta take a steven grider
modern react with redux that dude is
he's the best actually I'm actually
gonna have an interview with him and you
guys is gonna be able to see him live
with me on my podcast like I've actually
got been in contact with him a couple of
times and we're just trying to set up a
date so you guys could see me and him
just go at it you know it's gonna be a
cool interview because that dude is
super legit
yeah I mean oh gee like I'm gonna tell
you like this if you know how to
basically build anything on HTML as far
as I do you know how to build the form
do you know how to build a table do you
know how to build a section so creating
different boxes sections you know a menu
a side menu are freaking a paragraph
section if you know how to do those
things nothing you know HTML you're
ready to move on now for CSS do you know
how to change the background colors do
you know how to target a class do you
know how to target a ID do you know how
to how to target like let's say
something inside of a parent div if you
know how to do that and change the
colors or change the fonts then you
already know CSS let's see you can move
on now for javascript javascript is
super complicated is deep so I would say
do you know how to add a class 2a a diff
do you know what a for loop is do you
know what I for each do you know how to
do switch statement do you know how to
do everything else statement if you know
those basics then you're ready to move
on to the next step which is a more
advanced JavaScript which would be
working with a framework you know I mean
so then from there you know you're gonna
be able to it's hard to say hey you know
JavaScript when you get to this level
it's hard to say that because you know
JavaScript way you know how to build
anything on it that's when you know
JavaScript you know what i mean so
that's that's how i could say hey you
know something
yeah you gotta you gotta be careful
making you know infinite loops what you
gotta remember is you always have to
make something that's gonna stop it so
meaning you do you do a loop right and
you say ok so for for a loop right so
you say ok i equals 0 so it starts with
a0 then you say I is less than 10 which
now you're basically saying it you're
giving up a limit to it you say ok once
i guess it's 10 it stops and then you
have the I plus plus which means every
time I loops is going to add one number
to the eye so once against the 10 then
it stops once you know those little
things we're gonna be good trust me but
yeah man are you freaking I just threw
away all my whole my whole freaking
lunch break right now with you guys man
y'all ate up my lunch break right now ok
i will see you guys in a little bit yo
tonight eight o'clock 8pm remember this
is going to be me and milk stars we're
going to do a podcast live so yeah man
