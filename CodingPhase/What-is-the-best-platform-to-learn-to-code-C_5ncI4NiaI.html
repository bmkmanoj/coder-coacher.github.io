back at it again coding face.com
your boy is backing out and did it again
guys today we got a special guest today
we got such a special man you know we
got an import it candy man you know what
I mean we got the real tough can do
hello Joe hello everybody thanks for
having me on
we're gonna we're gonna have an awesome
topic today and I'm so excited to be on
Joe's Channel I'm actually here for the
Chris Shawn scandal tape I don't know I
almost died that was one of the funniest
videos you've made ever you know when
somebody hit me of they're like oh have
you seen one what Chris Shawn did I'm
like listen I say yo Chris on for people
to be acting this crazy on today I say
yo Chris Shawn is gonna be either gluing
drugs somewhere rashon is gonna be
either freaking he's gonna be in a bed
with two black chicks and just like they
ripping him apart
so I'll say you know that's the only
thing that I could think of you know at
that moment I was like yo it's not that
serious visually rich on call himself a
software engineer calm down people mean
well yeah man it's been a while man I
seen real tough candy a long time ago I
mean few months I I'm acting like God
I've seen her years ago like I was a
little kid when I sew real tough caddie
crossing the street guys like I saw a
few months ago her channels been legit
for a long time I've been telling people
on myself this is one of those channels
man when people start catching up you
you better say a channels legit she got
nice thumbnails she got a good topics in
and it's not boring you get what I'm
saying like that's what I love about
your channel
where's like you come in you talk about
Cole
talk about technology talk about IT and
even though I go in there and learn
stuff from you they'll be like oh I even
know that I was like like the thing
where you was like talking about
well you had like a thing that crawls
the web site and checks the security oh
yeah I want to do tutorial on that so
it's called Wireshark it's a packet
sniffer and you can do all kinds of
crazy stuff with it but yeah stuff like
that just like try to keep it
interesting cuz you know how it is on
YouTube there's like a lot of people do
it like software web development stuff
but life is just so freaking boring like
or the topics are dry you know not all
of it can be so interesting but just
kind of self talk developers have more
fun let me just put it that way yeah so
I just like to have fun with it I just
like to have fun with it and I'm glad he
came across the channel and he sent some
awesome people my way so thanks for that
and thanks for all the support so
appreciate it and I was gonna act so I
mean what's your background I mean when
did you start getting interested with
coding well yeah so I got out of the Air
Force and I can't breed in these
articles about we're gonna code and like
in the New York Times they had all these
articles about like coding boot camps
and stuff and this language called
Python I said all these people are
making all this money I gotta see what
this is about so I started off just like
you know doing web development without
coding so like WordPress stuff and the
drag-and-drop stuff and it was fine but
it was a little boring
so then like I'd say it probably about
two years ago I started getting into
coding and just like JavaScript you know
this is of the basics of web development
and coding and stuff and then from there
just like kind of got obsessed with it
and just you know learn the full stack
and having fun with that so yeah it's
kind of developed from a wordpress step
up developer who didn't know how to code
to someone who who does the full stack
so and I love it I have no regrets it's
one of the best crew fields out there as
you know there are so many opportunities
if you're not making money in this field
you're doing something way wrong and
probably need to reassess your lifestyle
because like it will come to you you
just gotta keep working you know like
you say always in your videos if you
work hard it's gonna happen yeah true
for that - you know you do so many
diverse things - for
you're incumbent lights but anyways that
I can go on about that no you know I
mean that's something that I I come here
I just want to show people like you just
a regular dude comes in here it's like
he made it happen you know I don't care
if somebody comes anybody I'm smarter
than him
I do this better than him I go better
than him okay cool
what do you do that's the point of the
channel it's supposed to motivate you I
want people to come in if you like oh I
could do it if he could do I could do it
that's the whole point of the channel
you gotta say since I got one more
people in this industry I feel like it
needs more diversity it means you know
different races different people girls
all type of freaking sexualities like I
want to see the first purple human alien
and coding somewhere like you know what
I mean like that's why I'm trying to
push this forward that's what we got the
channel and yes so let's get started
with the topics which are basically
we're gonna talk today about all the
different platforms guys you know we're
gonna talk with real tough candy about
all the different platforms where you
can learn how to code and yeah so let's
get started ma let you roll that in
let's kick it off Jo coding phase comm
Jade yes so the first one it's free code
camp which we I know we both have strong
feelings on free code camp because as we
talked about before we went live it has
a great community the people there I
don't know like a million people using
free code camp right now and it's one
that I actually started off with before
I was just totally when I wasn't totally
ignorant about code and unfortunately
there are a lot of things I just kind of
got me stuck there and I didn't learn
much so I I'm pretty biased it didn't
help me but I know I know it has helped
a lot of people Quincy Larson the I
guess not the CEO is a non-profit but
the brain the brain child behind free
code camp is Quincy Larson and he's a
great guy but yeah I just I think it's
it's best for the community for asking
questions looking for advice but as far
as
the actual fundamentals didn't really
work for me what about you Joe yeah um
I'm definitely there with you I think
it's a great place where you go in there
like let's say if you don't even know
what coding is you don't know what
programming is it's great to go in and
be like what's this thing that people
are talking about let me log in and see
what's going on right because it's cool
for you to go in and try some things out
and be like this is boring this is not
for me if you're one of those people
it'll definitely help you out to see is
this for you that's a good point
oh yeah cuz it's free is like you you're
not investing anything is like you're
just investing your time to log in and
that's it and you don't even have to log
in you put in your freaking your Google
or your Facebook and that's it's
automatically signed up and you're good
right
so in that sense it's perfect for that
let's say right now if I'm somebody
who's going to be going to interviews
right and I already been going to other
platforms or I've been already learning
right and I'm about to start going to my
interviews and I say you know what I
want to practice a little bit of my
JavaScript right I want to practice a
little bit of a couple of different
methods I want to practice on algorithms
right it's perfect for them right but is
it good for learning and what I mean
learning it's not just following
something along it's not like oh cool I
know how to print hello and then I go to
the next one and then you don't even
know what the hell was the print you
don't even know what console that log
was you don't even know that was that
was a method of the console so you
didn't understand what the hell just
happened is going yeah is know just how
you you know you coined a phrase of you
know tutorial having I've been saying it
around but the Creator is the real tough
it's such a great feeling like you feel
warm you feel fuzzy you feel empowered
you like yeah let's go build a
restaurant and then you get out into the
real world like how the hell do I
declare a variable like you
when you get out of that bubble it's
such a different experience so I I don't
know yeah when you're in that tutorial
heaven you feel really good it feels
really good but once you get out in the
real world you got to remember that it's
a total it's usually a totally different
experience yeah that's that's the
problem where I see with free cocaine
where I was telling people like I'm
constantly answering people's comments
on my video I say I'll be careful
falling into the free cocaine trap of
like you think this is coding this is
practicing this is not cooling this is
this is practicing this following along
to something that's already showing you
everything that's in the documentation
right so when you go into free code camp
you go in okay I know one thing go next
go next go next right 20 problems down
the little map you don't even know what
the hell happened you don't remember how
to do none of the stuff that the last 19
things that you you just learned you
don't know how to do it right the only
way that I feel that people learn how to
code is by start building things things
like small projects where you say okay
here's an HTML page here's how you put
in and change the title and then now you
say okay change the title from there
build a div that has h1 inside of it
with a title inside of it or whatever
right but you need somebody to give you
that structure you know a lot of times
when you look at websites like free coke
amp and jump into the next thing which
is very similar to free cocaine are two
other services which is coke atom II and
solar so I'll put all three of them
together at the same time where all they
really doing is just giving you what's
already in the documentation but the
only difference is is that they showing
you okay that's how you do it the first
time and then the next problem that you
got next is exactly the same copy that
you got on the problem that they were
showing you before so you're not really
training your brain to think how to
break down problems and that's it when
you go to huge scale when you go to the
real world that's where you come in and
like um how do I do this is like you
need to learn how to
take it down step by step you know yeah
for sure anybody watching this right now
what Joe said in the last three nights
or whatever he's totally on point the
prep practice saying is totally
different from learning and I think also
to a lot of these sites they give you
links that documentation as a newbie
documentation is so freaking
overwhelming I mean there's all this
like it looks like Greek to me and I'm
not greedy I don't know how to read that
like it's just goes on and on and like
you said just like the little chunking
it is so important and seeing the little
components and how they fit in and the
project thing like you should also
probably interested in the project
you're doing like if you don't like
vegetables don't be working on a
gardening a garden website or whatever
you like you know if you like music find
a project that does music if you like
restaurants do a project the likes
restaurants otherwise it's gonna be
really boring
and you're probably gonna end up
quitting I mean it's so easy there are
so many points where you can just quit
and Sam it screw it I don't get this
like so you know find something you like
that's that what that's what I would add
to but as far as free code camp but like
you said code ketamine they are really
similar
I think free code camp probably has the
best community of supporters and support
but yeah they kind of they kind of even
out in other places yeah I also I give
it to you know the creator Quincy he
basically he created this community from
nothing
and is grown humongous right it's huge
now well at the same time as like
there's so many cool things about it
that is really to me so a frico camp
it's not really about the website the
free code camp to me is the emails the
great articles he sends you it's also
the medium website where basically
people come in and actually share blogs
and tutorials in and different things
that make the community great because
there's like people who are already most
of the people who are like creators who
are like coming in and putting in the
blog post those are people that are
already working in the industry guys
will already have jobs but they give
them back to the community through free
Koken right because oh yeah it's a great
way to
our goal is to promote yourself out
there and say hey guys here's a free CSS
great tutorial on free code camp that
you know at least a hundred thousand two
hundred thousand people are gonna watch
and then now they follow you alone so
it's like it's like a chain reaction of
like okay people help each other out
people share a different blog post
people share cool links so that's where
I think the power of free Coquette know
following the map is not really where
you're gonna learn
that's just like practice yeah and I
mean I I tried that method and like I
said it didn't work for me but I still
get Quincy's emails he has killer emails
like the three links that are worth your
time he sends you know I think he sends
it weekly um and they're medium articles
are legit he's always giving chances to
junior developers to write blog you know
whatever so I don't I don't think people
should discount it but be aware that
there might be better resources as far
as the actual website goes and that's
that's all I gotta say about frequent
walk yeah definitely you want to talk
about your team treehouse yeah we could
talk about sentry counsel team treehouse
is a website where you go in there you
basically pay a subscription they got a
whole bunch of courses they've been
around for years right so they they're
you know the gallery their portfolio of
courses like you monkeys like C++ C
sharp
freaking HTML CSS JavaScript whatever is
out there they have it in there um my
only problem with team treehouse is the
fact that it's so well produced in the
sense of like oh they want to have the
best videos the best animations and
everything it looks beautiful
it is a beautiful experience and it's
cool because you get to keep points and
you get little badges and little stuff
that don't mean anything but it just
seems cool well at the end of the day
they're like six months behind on
everything right this yeah so I was like
whenever like when I was there I mean I
don't know what they're doing now so be
honest 100% I don't know what they doing
now when I was there I joined in there
like 2011-2012 because I like the
community right and I like the fact that
there was a four-room and people were
nicer than Stack Overflow that people
are Stack Overflow they're like you
don't know how to do a console.log a
noob
you know that's is like developers who's
been here for 20 years looking down on
people who are just starting up right so
that's why I never liked Stack Overflow
but the four room 14 treehouse was legit
it's like you go in there you ask some
question people answer a people help you
out but for me like the moment soon as I
said anything negative about sin
treehouse or like any of the courses I'm
like I remember I was learning backbone
I already learned backbone from other
websites which we gotta go into later on
I learned backbone and then I had signed
up team treehouse and then everybody was
already talking about angular everybody
was doing tutorials on angular everybody
was working on angular angular didn't
come to team treehouse for almost seven
months while the whole industry was
already talking about angular and
basically creating videos in the reason
is because they focus so much on having
the cool animations having the you know
the nice lighting the nice studio behind
the scene and having all the cool stuff
it looks professional but it's like
you're behind this industry you can't be
six months behind
because right and it takes that long to
produce the videos cuz like you said I I
actually signed up for them last week
they do it like a three day free trial
whatever so because I was trying to
learn I'm trying to learn more PHP and
especially PHP seven but now that you
bring up the point they I don't think
they have any PHP seven courses on there
I could be wrong I could be wrong but it
definitely wasn't promoted on the PHP
page yeah well like you said so slick
their library is huge like whatever you
want to learn it's on there yeah and
because it's like 25 bucks a month I
think where people are more likely to
propel themselves and be motivated to go
use the service because it's like well
my 25 bucks or whatever I better go get
my money's worth
yeah so that could be useful but like
you said
probably the biggest thing is the the
slowness of them getting up-to-date with
the technologies and like seven months
later on angular what are they on like
angular 25 now I mean exactly you know
ya know even when react came out I had
went in I think I was like 2013 2014
around there well I don't know it was
between 2013 to 2015 I went back into
teen tree house I signed up for a month
I used to have the student discount I
still had a school ID whatever and I
went in there I was like these guys are
still not talking about react like but
behind are they you know like this
coming out with tutorials about amber
Jes like bro nobody's doing amber Jay is
like drop this last year why are you
dropping in now but that's my opinion a
lot of people love teen tree house oh
yeah
Chris Sean loves scene tree house I mean
he learned from me you know so you can't
be mad at it cuz people do learn from me
it's just for me I like to be on top of
things
you know if I'm paying for a premium $25
is a lot to me it's a lot anything above
$15 that means you need to be
accountable to give me the latest and
the best things that's out that's my
agreed agreed
and that might be a good point to is
that team tree house could be good for
the very basics that aren't changing
anytime soon yes so like HTML CSS if
you're having a hard time and you've got
25 bucks online you're gonna be
motivated to go to that site and learn
it in a month rather than three months
cuz otherwise gonna cost you 75 bucks
rather than you know 25 or whatever but
yeah the Advanced Course is probably
probably better alternatives so
definitely um you got any other ones
freako can be different okay I have
something for you
like I said I'm trying I'm trying to
scale up on PHP you are gonna kill me
I bought an Edwin Diaz course the other
night you got another one you gotta know
oh man PHP courses are so hard to find
online like but you mean legit ones yeah
yeah so I went with I went with admins
course it's pretty long but he knows he
does know most enough but you to me I
have to say of all the ones we've talked
about so far udemy has been the one
that's really got me where I need to be
for you know the basics and the advanced
stuff because like we were talking about
before the show there's such a diversity
and you can choose which people you want
to learn from like steven grinders on
their awesome I know who I'm going with
Colt steel the classic cold steel like
he's on there too and there's just like
there are some classic video courses on
there that you won't find anywhere else
so I the my money is on you to me and
there are $10 specials or whatever can't
beat them you always have the videos
whenever you're bored or got got nothing
else to do I can't say enough good
things about them even if they ripped
off Chris Hoxha's videos did you see
that video yeah yeah no I mean it
happens all the time I happen to
traverse the media I'm pretty sure
sometimes it's gonna happen to me where
you know people have sent me videos or
like me talking or some somebody else's
course I mean I don't care cuz when you
look at the sales is like oh they only
saw like three briefs courses because
it's like they take a whole bunch of
videos from YouTube and mash them
together and try to sell it on udemy is
like people for reason and they're like
they try to get the refunds right away
but yeah udemy to me is the best place
right as far as learning what you need
to learn right because the pros of you
to me is that you find a lot of courses
and you say okay I like this instructor
so you stick to that stroke you say I
like this person like for me Steven
Grider whatever he drops I just buy
right I bought it the : course I bought
in the what else what are the courses
that he had I bought all the react
courses most of my react knowledge I got
it from him
right uh most of my events or react
courses as I know react from other
places but for
him from him he just broke it down this
is easy and even at that when I created
my course on my website I took basically
ideas from him where I was like okay
these are the things that he did a great
job but these are the things that I
could break it down a little bit more
better just because I know from somebody
else I learned the mistakes that he made
and he probably learned the mistakes
that somebody else made and made it an
amazing course right
it just keeps going like that right so
for me definitely Steven Grider Cold
Steel
even though cold steel now that he's
Bujji now that he's making so million
dollars a year he's too good for you to
me now he he's sitting down with the CEO
that's how you know you're doing
you took you're doing too much on you to
me you're like y'all I sit down with the
the CEO when they bout to announce a
branding change on udemy can we call
cold steel to come down you know give it
a blessing but now he got like six seven
different people teaching one course and
I'm like whoa I thought what the run a
bootcamp part to us I'm the advanced web
developer boot camp you know what I
actually bought that the other week even
though I was holding out forever because
I found out he only did a part of the
course and the reason people sign up for
this course is because they like the
instructor the instructor connects with
them and Colt steel is just one of those
great communicators where he's funny
he's a little cheesy in places but he
keeps it light so it's not like a
life-or-death situation learning about
CSS like it's just a relaxed environment
but then he had his his helpers or
whatever and they they don't have the
stage presidents yeah so that was pretty
disappointing yeah
the swag is not there the sauce not
there it's not free yeah yes sauce free
in there man like this guys they gotta
go through the training this is what I
was telling like people the other day
you know not to go too much off-topic
but when you like let's say I come in
and I create this channel this platform
right and I come in I'll make it to
let's say a million subscribers and then
out of nowhere I come in and I pick up
some random dude and say place them
right here and say hey guys
check this guy out now nobody knows him
he never put in the work of like
actually mastering the skills of
communication mastering the skills of
just getting that sauce being
comfortable in front of the camera of
being comfortable in the microphone it's
like you bypassed that whole thing and
it's like the course is not gonna be the
same way it has to be somebody who's
comfortable like cold steel he already
day like two or three courses where he's
like I go in there way you know it's
like somebody like Michael Jordan Coast
Eagles in there with with a wheelchairs
don't make him bucket you know what I
mean so there's like he's comfortable
right it's like it's like he just got
out of his sauna so you're not my god
HTML oh my god like it's just like cats
and make some dog jokes and it's all
good but yeah so anyways the advanced
bootcamp course did not feature him
mostly but so that was disappointing but
back to the main topic just like you get
to pick people like cold steel on you to
me and that's what I really like about
it and it's not they don't have like
that immersive environment so you don't
feel obligated to stick around for 12
hours because I don't have like a
console they don't have like well here's
20 pages of additional information like
here's your videos click on them if you
like them come back go practice it
whatever and come back when you're
finished so I like that that it's so
informal and that you can just relax a
little bit because a lot of the stuff is
really advanced and sometimes high
pressure to learn so you know in fact
they can take the pressure off in any
way with their presentation or the way
they deliver material I think that's all
the better for noobs and not new it's
like anybody trying to learn tech yeah
and also to the fact that you know you
know of course you can pick whoever you
you like but also the fact that people
constantly create new courses feels like
our new framework comes out tomorrow you
know damn well somebody got a course on
it yeah you know you come in and say hey
I see it well CSS grids came out
whatever you know them well somebody had
a course right there's like whatever is
new give it a week there's gonna be a
course on it right now the cause of your
yo udemy is like sometimes you might
just get
you know the the random Indian dude that
nobody can understand and he's just
showing you freakin slides and it's like
you're not even coding dude like you
know it's like some random dude that
nobody knows is like hey or here's a
course about Java
it's like bro you're not even explaining
it you're not showing me no examples
you're not building a project you
literally copying the documentation and
putting into slides and the production
values are so bad it's like they hit on
like a VHS tape and you know
reel-to-reel tape like do it clean your
mic off I can't hear you but yeah and
then the thing too is like you don't get
to see a lot of the real reviews like
the negative reviews I know what you
they clean them off they scrub them off
so you can't see like the real critiques
of some courses on udemy which is really
cut it really sucks cuz people should be
able to express the course is not that
good or not but I mean almost every
course four stars five stars like aren't
there any bad courses here of course
there are but you to me scrubs the bad
rating so that my biggest beef with with
you to me that's that's definitely a
thing that they're guilty of you know
that happened to me with what was this
guy's name Todd McCloud his goal and
course was like a lot of people gave it
by reviews and somehow this course is
still on the number one spot as you know
the main goal and course is the same
thing with Edwin Diaz
you know I'm support him because he's
you know the you know thing he's I don't
know he's Dominican or Puerto Rican you
know I was like that's my peoples right
I want to support as much as we can
well why don't support is when people
just create courses well you to me is
gonna support me anyways they gotta put
me to the top so I was like who cares
it's like one time it was like a video
that I seen I think it was like the
Lambo course that he had it's like is it
oops I did a boo-boo I was like oops
sorry guys I forgot my coffee like
bronec lady yes yes can confirm can't
confirm I'm late bro like what are you
talking about like you know they just
edit that every recording just like put
effort to wait right yeah just because
the courses are ten bucks doesn't mean
you can be sloppy with the production or
just be like you know just like oh I'm
gonna do another PowerPoint coding
project here please buy it like you got
to put some effort into it especially
for newbies like like there's just so
many ways that newbies can get turned
off to this web development thing and
bad videos on you to me is one of them
so the last thing I'll say about you to
me and any course whether it's Joe's
courses or anyone else if you find
somebody that explains a good has a good
pace a good style and and you're
connecting that instructor stick with
them because there's thousands of
horrible crappy resources out there but
there's only a few good ones so when you
find a good one it's freaking stick with
it and it's gonna pay off
yeah and then at the same time I'm
trying to make sure people could hear us
you guys feel oh Jesus Christ
come on you're killing me oh no so
somebody said never mind it was you day
so what's his last thing that we need
right now is like we went through a
whole process to do this live video and
I wanted to have the chat room right
there so you guys go actually show up on
the live interview but oh man it was
freaking going crazy so thank God we you
guys can hear us yeah thanks yeah yeah
yeah yeah what about so that's all I got
to say about you to me you got anything
more to say about about you to me or now
you to me it's pretty good I I think
it's pretty solid they're good for what
it is you know what I mean like
technically if you're looking to learn
as much as you can from you know from
from somewhere and you say hey I want to
just learn this specific thing there's
really no other marketplace out there
that has
like as many courses as udemy period you
know now the last thing that I will say
is if you can find out if the
instructors do have like their own
website try to find their own website
because if you like their content
support them on their website instead of
supporting them you to me because you to
me basically for every ten dollars most
of the time the instructor only makes
three dollars
so at the end of the day they don't make
nothing you know it's like a record deal
from the 1990s like you sell a CD for 20
bucks the artist gets five cents so
because it's like I think it's like you
know me takes 50% how you call is the
affiliates take another 25% so then you
left with the other 25% so a most of the
of the courses that get sold are really
from affiliates rights like even I must
have our courses now are from affiliates
and basically what I say is if you
really want to support somebody and you
bought the courses or you to me and they
say hey I'm releasing a brand new one
find out if they have their own website
and try to buy from them you know cuz it
just really helps out alright so what
other places we got we got Pluralsight
you you take Pluralsight because
honestly this one's been under my radar
forever I just checked it out a few
nights ago I got nothing to say about it
now I really the interface is nice but
the website the websites like Jade they
got a lot of cool stuff to have like a
little test to test you see if you know
react test you if you know some you know
some JavaScript or whatever right so
it's cool for that right but I think the
power of a plural site is more for
professionals
oh the power Pro site is not for
beginners if you like you know a little
Johnny from the block and you're like oh
I'm gonna learn code today this blows
site is not the place for you because he
like Pluralsight is a place for people
who work at like the corporate
headquarters of dear clean and get like
a perk like yeah
sunny you added good this quarter here's
a card for portal site go sign up your
horses yeah on an individual level I
wasn't getting this feeling that there
was like a community or you know people
to that you could talk with but yeah it
was it was definitely not newbie
friendly from my interpretation yeah no
it's not for beginners it's not like you
go in there you know let's take a web
development course for beginners it's
like they don't break it down like like
that like the it's similar to you to me
but the difference is you get unlimited
of videos and the problem with that is
that number one the most of the
developers in there are like guys who
work in like Microsoft but I work in you
know those big companies so they not
thinking like oh this videos for
beginners guys are that don't know
anything like Johnny
the mechanic is not gonna go in there
and understand what the hell this person
Stronach sees the only person that's
gonna understand those courses are
developers who already experienced and
they know how to read the documentation
and they're comfortable and say okay
cool
I'm gonna learn extra framework today
like okay like I'm more angular
developer now say I'm gonna learn react
then plus I might be fine because I
already know JavaScript already know
order the things that come with a in I'm
gonna take this from this course from
Pluralsight from this professional right
but he's gonna teach you in a way where
he's like it's more for enterprise right
that's not really how you know
everybody's company codes like this
guy's using like super prop types in and
like like I've seen a couple of courses
in there I was like I signed up one time
cuz they wanted me to actually go in
there and start teaching on plural
signing I said I'm they gave me a free
membership and I say okay go I'm gonna
do this check it out but then I was like
this isn't like a place for beginners
this is more just how you say like you
know you you workout may season you at
the headquarters or you know you got an
MTA car you got a you know you got a
free parking he's a a freakin
Pluralsight ten dollar bonus that you
could go watch any course that you want
for a six months or what
it's like a little perk yes more for
companies is not really for like you
know self-taught developers who are in
the house and I saw two they had the
individual level it's like 30 bucks a
month which is already five dollars more
than tree house and it might have a
choose between the two I'm gonna go a
treehouse time whistles the community
the even if the videos are a little
outdated like it's definitely more
beginner friendly at a tree house than
portal site and what I saw yeah
definitely I would definitely go to that
yes I mean the bottom line for you know
for anybody that's never tried
Pluralsight Pluralsight is really more
for four companies it's not really for
beginners if you're self-taught
developer going to Pluralsight is not
the place because every developer in
there are guys who are like
professionals I guess once you get to a
certain level let's say your
intermediate developer right you you've
been doing this for two three years you
say okay I want to learn some stuff to
take me to the next level I want to go
work at a Microsoft I want to work at
Google I want to work at Facebook then
maybe Pluralsight might be for you to go
in there and see how their process is or
as a beginner to come in you gotta feel
overwhelmed that's the way how they do
things is more complicated than it
really is in the real world you know
what I mean but we could move on to the
next one also to coast cool calm well I
got to tell you can i I gotta ask you
for a sec I hadn't heard of this one
this was the one of all of them we had
mentioned that was totally off my radar
like I've heard of Pluralsight never
really got into it but codeschool
never heard of it so I checked it out
the other night it's really freaking
cool ya know maybe I haven't spent much
time with it but like their intros are
like cartoon they have her tunes like
they make it like a game so I think that
can be really helpful for beginners yeah
and I was like checking out the jQuery
thing and it was pretty cool they're
like a built in console stuff you know I
don't know I'm so far I'm feeling good
about it but what is your experience
with it yeah I also tried Cole school
comm I learned
born on cold school.com I probably I
will say I learned most of my beginning
of like JavaScript on cold school calm I
really don't mention it that much out
here because I don't know if they even
like they don't drop like courses like
constantly what they do is like they
drop one course per year or like two
courses per year so they're from there
what they do is they promote a a lot and
a lot of people sign out to them it's a
great place to learn I think the price
of is too much at things like $30 or
something like that
oh is it yeah I think that I want to
make sure just going there yeah cuz I
signed up for it they didn't ask me for
a credit card or anything but I got a
free sign up and I was like you know
check out the jQuery and stuff but it
looks like a cool sign I would say if
you're anybody new the intermediate
check it out yeah they got a lot of cool
stuff yeah
thirty dollars so is it okay yeah so
it's 30 dollars per month and they have
71 courses 257 screencast so they have a
lot of cool stuff if you're planning on
learning something like Ruby on Rails or
even get them a little bit better with
your Ruby programming or Python or even
JavaScript or now they have a lick sir
those are pretty good but is really like
introduction to it it's not it's not
like you gotta go in there and build a
project it's not known as the courses
that they have to teach you with
projects what they do is they teach you
the basics like our introduction oh
here's the syntax
here's where Ruby on Rails is it's a
framework is you know that's how you
create a controller like all the things
that you're gonna learn in 99% of the
courses on udemy for way cheaper that's
what they teach you but the only
difference is that they do have a
production level that's higher they
might I couldn't believe it
yeah like they can't cartoon intros and
just like they're pretty cheesy but it's
like alright this isn't like you know a
PowerPoint on udemy you used to seeing
but yeah I got it and I think they have
free coding classes for kids too so
anyone out there has kids wanting to
code I'd check out check out old school
the hell they have a lot of cool stuff
on old school calm it's just like I said
it's like it's a beginners courses like
if you say hey I want to get to learn
the basics of Python basics of Robie
basics of JavaScript then it's perfect
for you if you're looking to build
projects
that's the cons of it they stop building
projects it's just showing you the
syntax one thing too I want to add is
that it's okay to jump around of course
of course
- just like I don't know that's
something that helped me a lot because
at first I was guilty about not sticking
in one platform but then I was jumping
around at different platforms learning
JavaScript and hearing five different
people say it it's actually really
helpful because then it's like okay in
different contexts it's not just like
one person telling you this is how it is
but just like different people giving
you different instances of how to create
a JavaScript function or whatever and
there's like okay yeah this guys doing
oh this chicks doing it okay now let me
see give it a try so yeah people
shouldn't feel guilty about jumping
around it's okay to jump around and you
know compare notes yeah the first year I
think for everybody that's trying to
learn to code I think the idea of
jumping around is it's already accepted
in like the community because everybody
knows there's like you gotta find what's
good for you right there's people out
here that even they watching a video it
doesn't stick in their head they're like
I hate this so now you gotta try a book
right so now you gotta try to order your
book you know everybody got their own
way of learning it's the same thing that
I told people when they were commenting
I got so much hate on my free coke amp
video and it's like you got understand
that just because they worked for you
doesn't mean that it works for everybody
else it's like no it's like you're only
like 20% of like the code the whole
industry or the community is a there's
another 80% of the people that it just
didn't work you know what I mean like
they have to go to you to me they had to
sign up kicking tree house they had to
go to freakin coast school right
everybody has their own journey right
and
that's something that I tell people all
the time I was like yeah you gotta find
your own journey see which one it works
out for you know I have my own website
coding face.com
what I do is basically a break down
topics that are difficult and just make
it seem easy like I mean I just love
that yeah people I think that's one of
the biggest things that people don't get
is that people need to start at like a
sub zero level just like almost to the
point of like okay we're gonna turn on
your computer and nothing a
condescending dick about it but like
understand it and people aren't really
new to this and there's a lot of stuff
to learn so I mean just yeah some of the
basic stuff I think a lot of instructors
just gloss over and what you're doing on
your website is awesome because people
can understand what you're saying and
you have a stage presence and you're
good communicators so and I see her I
see her much like you have a crap ton of
classes yeah so many it's awesome
yeah I mean I've been working hard cuz
the whole idea behind coding phase comm
like before I even came if people go
into my original videos the first videos
I was like yo idea that I have for this
is to make a community where somehow we
generate money to be able to give back
to everybody else that's in the
community and people who trying to get
into this and don't have the
opportunities right it's like right now
I could be working and let's say a
retail right and I could afford to pay
$15 $20 per month to get the opportunity
to become a developer but there's guys
who freaking live in the Philippines
lives in you know freaking Ethiopia
whatever right and he can't afford that
that money right so how can we still
facilitate the opportunity for him right
so that was the whole idea of this whole
thing where I was like yo I'm just gonna
come in here share my my views on things
and I'm still doing that you know people
hit me up constantly yo can you send me
a code for a free coding me economy you
to me a freaking course and I still give
it out like when I first came in I was
paying about like $300 per month on
courses on just people helping them out
and then at the end I was like yo I'm
about to have a kid
I can't afford this I can't afford to
continue paying for everybody else so
how can I come in and create a platform
where I can say okay I'm gonna teach
everything that I know break it down in
a way where is gonna be easier than most
instructors teach it because people
forget that a lot of times the people
who are trying to learn online they're
not the college graduate graduate
they're not the computer science major
they don't have that background where
you tell them oh yeah just make sure you
use this function with this this doesn't
die and we gotta pass the parameter like
most people just you start talking to
them like that
they like you lost the Marmon
automatically right so you gotta start
them small you gotta be like okay we got
this thing here where we you know we
call it your function this is a keyword
right here between these two parentheses
there's a parameter where we just pass
it down to that function and you explain
it in a way where somebody could say oh
well this isn't that hard right so
that's the whole idea of it you know
right and you know people I think this
is such there's so much stuff to learn
in this field that I think people spend
so much time in it when it's time to
teach it they want to show that they
know a lot so they make it sound really
complicated you know it's not that big
of a deal like because it's difficult
but it's just curly brackets I mean if
you can write it down and explain it
curly bracket by curly bracket
parentheses it's just cold big deal just
you know it's it's doable it's not like
this magical food do where you rub its
head you like you know the magic darts
fly out of it and hit you in the eye
like this is just like so rude goldberg
ish yeah it's so convoluted it's really
nice so I think you're doing a great
thing with your website and the way you
teach people and obviously people are
connecting look at your sub Talent look
at the people on your website it's
freaking awesome
yeah yeah that's the whole idea behind
it man I'm just trying to help people
out get them out there and just pretty
much like I'm using this it sounds like
was it worth way where's like you use
the funds from this to help the people
that can't afford it that's exactly what
I do
you
I feel like a lot of times that's
something that most of these are
platforms all the people even the
youtubers and all the other people
that's out there that's into this
community a lot of people do this for
like themselves
oh this is for me or this company needs
to make this much revenue this company
needs to do this and that you know like
there's people that selling courses for
$500 which to me in this day and age
it's kind of ridiculous whereas like
you're broke this it's not real estate
it's not a get rich scheme this is
something that people are trying to
change their lives so how can we make it
more affordable and accessible to
everybody instead of saying let me try
to swim to myself in get a lot of
subscribers and every month I get to
sign up five people so that's five
thousand dollars that I made no I was
like how about you just come in and just
opened your doors to everybody and make
it so cheap that everybody can learn and
people are hungry to learn like you know
people there's a lot of people who do
give up but there's a lot of people who
don't give up they want answers they
want to learn they're they're so hungry
to get in this career field and once you
get in it like you spin sane in a lot of
your videos once you get in your set but
getting to that point I mean I applied
my first web developer job I applied it
like 60 freaking places and let me tell
you something not getting callbacks and
getting the same response we're sorry
we're not what you're look we're looking
for it can be really disheartening but
once you get in the door you're freaking
set so it's so important not to give up
and it's so important when you find a
resource that you like stick with it you
know don't be afraid to explore but
don't give it up so yeah ya know like
once you're in this is like you know
like one of those things like we're back
in the days I hear well in New York well
from like you know all the the Italian
families they they basically you know
the father works in construction and he
brings in his son and is like okay now
little Vinny is a construction worker
and now he could work for you know
building Yankee Stadium and now he makes
$100,000 per year this is the same thing
the only difference is they
once you you come in into the industry
you're good you said right right you're
smart enough and you plan yourself out
you say you got a lot of different
avenues you can say hey I'm gonna be a
salary man a salary man somebody who's
gonna go into work every single day keep
his mouth shut
work every single day and do his work
and go back home and kiss his baby
goodbye that's a redo the same thing the
next day that's a Saturday man you could
do that you could be a freelancer but
you say okay cool I don't want to work
for nobody I'm gonna get my own clients
I'm gonna get my own people to basically
create websites in different businesses
and so muster them right or you could
say hey I'm gonna be like a digital
nomad well you know go around the world
living in very cheap countries and live
like kings out there and then at the
same time you know sell your services to
small businesses and be like hey I'm
gonna do like let's say laravel or
nodejs remotely or you could be like a
remote developer where you work for a
company full time but you just basically
work from your house or you could be
like entrepreneur say hey I'm gonna
start up my own startup you know and I'm
gonna build my startup and I have this
idea of this project that I want to
create I know it could be successful so
I'm gonna give myself six months to
build it next thing you know you're a
millionaire it does the options are so
limited in this field and the whole
point of this video is to share with
people different platforms and tell them
you know this is out here this is out
here this is what happened that the
information is out there the time to do
it is right now his career field is
still exploding don't let anyone tell
you X such language is dead web
development instead that's clickbait it
usually works as clickbait but honestly
this film is exploding with
opportunities and both Joe and I are
perfect examples of people who have
really benefited from this career field
you know we both making money it seems
like you love it I know I do
you you're here every day and you know
just making more opportunities for
yourself as a self-taught developer so
that's what I gotta say about that yeah
no definitely I think like right now for
every
is watching this man and keep this you
know a lot of times I tell people man
don't use my channel just for motivation
and I noticed this all the time when I
drop a video that's like really
inspirational or like me just being a ho
to my subscribers and it sound like your
goal work go freakin go do your freakin
work go freaking go learn something
today my website spikes right meaning
all the people that have already
subscribed to the website it's like
everybody's oh I'm going into work and
I'm gonna learn this and that usually
have to use me as a motivation you gotta
use yourself and the opportunities as
the motivation like this how it should
be every day you know you shouldn't have
to have me come in and motivate you to
tell you this because you know the
evidence is there I'm just a regular do
if I would have freaking continue doing
what I was doing I would have probably
been a freaking IT work or somewhere
connecting somebody's printer you know
or some office or you know who knows
what I would have been still earning
like $30,000 $40,000 a year you know I
was like I was talking to my mom the
other day I was like yo my mom's right
she's been here for like 27 years and
she working in the same job for like
10-15 years but she's never being able
to pass you know the same money that
she's been making since I was a little
kid she's still making the same like 38
thousand dollars a year since I was a
little kid she's been earning the same
thing right this happens to people all
the time you go in and become complacent
where you were and you say oh I got a
job I should be grateful I should do
this and that it's like there's more
opportunities out there
I was just yesterday or driving with my
wife and we was passing by a
neighborhood is very close to my house
but it's not my neighborhood right it's
freaking you go through there
it's millionaire freakin mansions and
I'm like somebody will come in here and
we'll say all this people got old money
and this and that but it's like nah how
about if somebody created a amazing
application or created some type of
business and
their lives change and now they live
here all of the stuff I was something I
was like all this stuff races this is
not a limit in you know when I look back
on it I was like thinking about like my
own family I always bring up my family
everything that I do because everything
revolves around them right I'm like man
it's crazy a few years ago you know
we're in 2011 I was like a bit depressed
I was like you know ourselves like man I
don't know what I'm gonna do with my
life I don't know what's gonna happen
you know when you're like 25 26 you
still don't know what's gonna happen
with your life and at some point I was
like man I feel like I'm not gonna do
anything with myself I'm not gonna be
successful at anything as far as like
you know cuz I used to do like music I
used to do a whole bunch of stuff and I
tried those routes and it wasn't
successful there and I say you know what
like I'm not gonna do anything with my
life
right yeah yeah I in my head I was like
man I'm gonna be another person that's
staying right here Richwood queens in
the same freakin town all my friends
still lived there all my friends are
still there some still work at retail so
I'm still working at footlocker and I'm
like I'm not I don't want to be one of
these people right and then I'm here in
my own house I'm doing all this stuff
and I now literally I could buy whatever
I want I was telling my wife I was like
yo I don't know what I want to buy this
month like I have everything right so
then I was like would I have this type
of opportunities with my life be this if
it wasn't because of code like in this
guy's that's even a million times more
successful than me right so it's like
that gives me the the you know the
vision of like then those guys did it I
could get to that exactly what's that
one idea oh wait you know what I mean
like braids and if happen these people
can do it if I think about it you see
people on the street that are rolling in
dough they have the perfect life and
you're like wait what didn't I know you
go from grade school you're that little
punk like how did you get so successful
if how could these people can do it I
mean
you can do it if anyone is watching this
if you're watching this it tells me that
you want to better yourself and you're
trying to do better things with your
life you can do it it's not impossible
and it's so easy to get discouraged when
your code won't compile or your design
looks like crap but that's what practice
is for you just gotta keep doing it ABC
always be coding you know I just keep
doing it just doing it like and like
you're saying - about your mom you know
and a lot of these jobs your your salary
doesn't ever tries but the cost of
living Rises three to five percent in
America every year so you know you're
out you're moving back a little every
year and that's a horrible feeling like
a lot of people are in that position and
sucks and this is the one career one of
the few career fields where you can make
really great money without having a PhD
or whatever without being a doctor or
you know a counselor or whatever and
that's fun doing it and like you were
saying there are you could make six
figures just doing a blog learning more
better coding design skills I mean I
didn't see those videos all the time
those videos on YouTube she made seven
thousand dollars this month just on
blogging I'm like she can do it
the opportunities are definitely there
and yeah that's all I gotta say
yeah I definitely that's what I tell my
subscribers all the time man like you
know people hear me away you know crazy
stories of things like this is happening
to them like you know the like man I
came in you know I have to walk like two
miles to go use a computer on a freakin
cafe right like I had to skip from the
pole who literally is ago I walked two
miles every frickin day to come here
watch your video and then at the same
time be able to learn to code online you
know all the free resources and
everything you know you might think
about it you're like oh man satting you
never know a poor kid and not gonna go
nowhere well it doesn't work like that
that kid he has determination he's
working hard he's pushing himself to
better himself he could literally be say
I'm just gonna stay in the village out
here you know getting a drink at the
corner or saying you know what I mean
like it just give up but he's trying to
better himself and he you could tell
that hey there's opportunities in
is right in the casing is the only route
to help you move up the ladder in
classes right yeah that's the only way
and right now coding programming
technology period because even if you
wanted to just say hey coding is not for
me but I love technology and I'm gonna
go to a freakin boot camp to learn how
to set up solar panels right even if you
decide to do that because you're like
one of those people that they love to do
things with their hands it's fine as
long as you're in technology you're
gonna be good you're gonna say so it's
like there's so many different
opportunities so it's like taking now
because this is like the 1950s right now
man you know where everybody was in
General Motors and Ford you know all
those old people that you see now
walking around like how the hell does
grandma got a Benz grandma's not old and
you know grandpa's got a big-ass house
oh those guys was working oh you know
the the best industry at the time and
they're somehow they invested their
money and then you start seeing the
fruits of it later on right now you
might be a developer and start at
$50,000 in sales this guy is making
$120,000 yeah but you don't live in that
area say you don't live in that area so
it's like you have to continue in the
next 2-3 years you will make your
hundred thousand dollars a year but it's
a process you could never never try to
go ahead of the process just how the
real Casa Darrell says trust the process
trust the process and once you get that
first year in if you're working to
enterprise or startup whatever the world
is even yours even more I mean this is a
career field people are so desperate for
web developers even if they're not back
you don't have to be brilliant to be in
this career field like you don't have to
invent amazing things you just have to
make it a little teeny bit different to
have people pay attention to you and
people reinvent the wheel every freaking
day I see I mean it's just it's
sometimes it's fatiguing but other times
it's like that's just like a really good
idea that someone just just tweaked a
little bit and now this person's having
a really good life and they're
millionaires but yeah I mean it is it's
like the
rush days or the 1950s at Ford in
Detroit you know maybe one day Silicon
Valley is gonna be like a Rust Belt city
where it's just like why are these
abandoned buildings here that's like
eBay has like dust all over the sign you
know it might be gone in 40 or 50 years
but right now there's a lot of lights on
in Silicon Valley and the rest of the
world every city every town every place
you don't even have to live in a big
city like you're saying you can do a
remote job you could be in Tahiti
building websites and and have a good
life so definitely and yes or to change
the subject to of candy so what are you
into now I mean he used mentioning a lot
of PHP what you working on yeah well I
was working on the jam stack for a bitch
I thought that was pretty cool and
because there's no database or nothing
but I'm like yeah and then I was like I
was kind of jumping around I was trying
to find my place so I was doing I was
doing some node but then I finally saw
the power of PHP especially with
e-commerce stuff and I'm really big into
e-commerce and all the open source stuff
whether it's you know WooCommerce or the
open card there's like a million others
but PHP is what I want to get down
because it's a site from JavaScript it's
probably the most important language
when it comes to web development Python
2 is pretty cool for like data scraping
and stuff but I'm trying to learn PHP
for my job because we do a lot of
database work so I'm working on that
yeah and just trying to expand my side
projects a little bit my website with
Jeff Kinney comm doing some articles on
like developing your portfolio and what
you should include my experience
interviewing with the Silicon Valley
startup which was pretty terrible um but
it was interesting but yeah so right now
I just working on that PHP that is such
a powerful language and it's it's you
get fatigued a lot in JavaScript because
like you say about the Betty Boop
frameworks like there's some every week
you're just like oh please stop talking
about it like immediately invoking
function expressions like stop so PHP is
what I'm working on yeah sure yeah no
that's good because I always tell people
not you know if you're a web developer
it's a big difference guys you know when
you go to a channel and they tell you
top ten programming languages it's like
Tata in programming languages to who you
know if for what right they don't answer
that they just give you here's the top
ten programming languages because it's
gonna get you a lot of clicks and a lot
of views right but what they don't tell
you is I okay
top ten programming language to really
be split up into different sections like
hey if you have a website right and you
want to start building cool things for
it as far as the backend like the basics
of what developing in reality is is PHP
like for you to be jump into anything
besides PHP as your first back-end
language and you want to become a web
developer it's kind of ridiculous you
know somebody was sending me Oh Joe what
do you think you know I was trying to do
the mean stack and now I'm gonna focus
on them the murid stack and I'm like
listen I asked him a few questions you
know I checked out his project that he
was working on and I was like most of
the stuff you don't even understand it
cuz you're not even that good in
JavaScript I was just honest with him
right so it's like when you're not even
that great with JavaScript and you're
trying to throw a little extra on top of
eight this somehow hack JavaScript to
run in the backend and then now we're
trying to you know do all this other
extra stuff it's like how about you
learn the backend was something that has
been proven and shows that hey for over
20 years it's been like the standard
note is that it's so popular because all
the hipsters and all the people in
Silicon Valley are talking about it yeah
they use in startups you'll find an
excuse to use it but if you go to 90 95
percent of enterprises even older
startups man they use PHP you even for
like signing forms all that stuff and
I'm not saying don't learn node but no
it is hard for beginners and even
intermediate it's like I've dabbled in
it but honestly PHP that's what people
that's what people in my area want to
see - I know you've talked about that a
lot when you're
for a job in your areas is PHP probably
should learn PHP yeah it's like people
forcing it people be like no but I want
to learn Python and as I bro there's no
Python jobs in your area like stop like
every freaking place that you're you're
applying to they're looking for somebody
with like ten years of experience and
you know you've never even worked a day
in your life as a developer I be honest
look at yourself in the mirror and be
like hey man am I gonna go here and keep
on wasting my time
or I'm just gonna say instead of me
listening to the you know the trolls of
the internet who would like beard spears
died Ruby on Rails is dead do I really
want to get a job you gave us a few
really good job learn the the web
technologies that gonna get you that job
you know it's like yes you need HTML CSS
and JavaScript but you need to
understand how the back end was you need
to understand how you come into a page
how that page renders HTML how that page
you know you either have a framework
like laravel that returns back of you
how controllers work how you connect to
the database after you understand how to
connect to the database manually then
from there you you also jump into a
framework to make your life easier right
because the waying sequel statements is
not the norm right especially now it is
when are you work on like you know
different frameworks like lara where you
have already oo RM you're not constantly
doing sequel statements right you do it
like once in a while when you need
something that's super customized right
but most of the time you just say okay
laravel do this eloquent do that and and
i say you know what i mean connect to
this motto and show me this property or
connect to this post and find all you
know what i mean so it looks or a lot of
people are watching yeah it might sound
Greek to a lot of people but once you
get JavaScript down learning your second
language like PHP you don't have to
learn well I'm going to spend a week
learning loops like your loops work you
know what a variable is you know what a
function is you don't have to spend
money that stuff you can get right to
the protein of PHP and you know build
blogging forms build database stuff
and make some really cool stuff in past
the amount of time because you already
know Johnny's new unit programming
programming basis yeah that's the thing
that's where a lot of people they keep
saying like oh man I'm gonna do just I'm
gonna focus just in JavaScript because I
just don't want to confuse my brain with
you know different languages and it's
like guys what you don't understand once
you understand the concepts of
programming and this goes back to the
idea too of like why colleges are
teaching developers or like computer
science majors where Python cos is very
easy to learn that concepts it's not
that Python is the best language it's
not that PHP is the best language that
javascript is the best language it
doesn't matter which one you pick which
ever teaches you the concepts of is a
variable
yes a function is the loop is an effing
l statement once you get those concepts
you could take that knowledge into any
different language right any language
any it doesn't have to be in web
development late the programming
concepts are usually all the same a
variable is a variable there might be
some little tiny differences but you can
hop on any language and not have a
problem with it once you establish those
programming basics and like I said
Python is pretty it's a great newbie
language because it's very very I don't
know what the word is like less verbose
it's very easy to read I guess yeah it's
like it's like English is that it is
yeah yeah you know it's like super easy
like you know I like to me my favorite
language is Ruby because it's so easy
and fun it's actually fun to code you
know when I work with PHP JavaScript or
even something like let's say C sharp
right I find myself I'm working right
but I'm not having fun I'm like I'm just
working I'm solving problems with Ruby I
get like this feeling of like oh I could
just do this in like little tricks that
you could come up with like oh if I want
to print something four times all I have
to do is for that x and it prints it you
know it prints of four times in try to
do that in JavaScript
product rule in JavaScript you gotta
create an either a for loop or you gotta
create a freaking wild loop like now
you're not gonna get that that easiness
of you know programming in any other
language you know it's a great place to
start so if you guys are definitely
looking into a language to learn like
your first programming language there's
a difference between I want to become a
web developer cool learn HTML CSS and
JavaScript right but if you say you're
having problems with JavaScript right
Allah sees a lot of time people get into
issues with JavaScript they're like oh
man programming is hard take a step back
go to Ruby learn programming concepts
there and then when you come back to
JavaScript you're like oh this is just a
loop this is repairing the same code
multiple times and you know this is a
function this is returning a new value
this this and that
you know what I mean it's just gonna
make your life easier and you get better
when you once your eyes start comparing
the differences in the similarities
languages your mind speeds up and you
become a better programmer I remember
what I my second language is playful and
when I started looking at Python like oh
my god this is okay this is there's a
kind of variable here JavaScript barely
here blah blah blah but once you see
those difference doesn't start working
with some your levelling up at like an
astronomical rate because now your brain
is forced to compare languages and the
concepts beneath them so yeah my first
language like way back when is Java Java
is a horrible language to learn as a
newbie just the basic print statement is
very convoluted I won't say convoluted
but it's pretty hard where it's like
with Python or I don't know I I haven't
put it in Ruby but I imagine it's pretty
simple to just print some yes I python
it the syntax is is like pine tar Python
but the only difference is like it has
so many built-in functions and built-in
methods that it just makes your life
easier like even though if you try it
out just go in there play around with it
you're gonna be like oh wow like this is
like so cool you know cuz it just makes
your life easier
you know when your program and you
shouldn't have to do the same things
over and over again I you know like
let's say for example like a
language a modern language should know
that if you want to repeat something
like five times there should be a times
method to to the object right in
JavaScript or most of the languages they
don't have that they say okay if you
want to do this you have to create the
for loop yourself technically I know all
the things that I want to do is like
there should be an easier way to do this
in that's you know that's one of the
reasons why I love Ruby but yeah
JavaScript I mean I like the language
but there is a lot of things that it's
not that beautiful language I don't
think and I think es6 and es7 even yes
eat what is it
already yes a they're fixing a lot of
problems but the core of JavaScript once
you compared to other languages you're
like oh really like these like you said
the four loops I'm like no logic isn't
quite as clear as it is with other
languages it's not a beautiful language
it's not poetic in my experience in my
mind yeah but that's what I learn and
that's like my basis so that's one
second way but there's other languages
people should know that there's you know
there's other languages out there yeah
you know how to just be like oh I'm only
going to do JavaScript I've seen this so
many times and people leave comments
it's like I just don't want to you know
I don't want to confuse my brain is like
bro see all you need to know is the
concepts right your brain break your
brain will break it won't explode
there's like won't be like stuff coming
out of your ears there might be but
probably not yeah just don't be afraid
to break stuff and try it just try it if
it doesn't work move on but if it does
awesome
yeah I'm I'm actually thinking like I
started writing down on my notebook like
this idea of like creating a new course
which is just gonna be like me showing
people how to break down problems cuz I
think this is the the biggest problem
that people have when they learning to
code they don't know how to break down
things I was telling one of my students
that I'm tutoring basically I was
telling him how let's say I told him
this example say I would like you to go
and create
input field and then that input field
you put in a name right and then after
you put in that name I would like you to
connect to an API that's gonna return
you back a set of data according to to
that name of that person and then I want
you to display on right below the the
the input field okay the guy was like um
I'll get back to you on that
right now he's a brilliant guy super
smart but the issues that he's having is
how to break down things up you know
what it means like first of all you
start with the input for you create the
input field then from there you know use
JavaScript either jQuery or just regular
JavaScript so you saw a JSON right so
connect to the JSON and say hey I'm
gonna use Ajax right next to that
database get that all that JSON data
back you know make it into an object
come back display you know and then
render the elements and say okay I'm
gonna render this element inside of this
div container and then put into the
names that show up like you know it was
gonna be like a name and phone numbers
right now most people don't know how to
break that down you know I mean a lot of
people that are learning you know when
they go to free code camp which is why I
have so much problems what is like you
tell them dandelion yeah where's the
step one or even if you tell somebody
hey I'll just build me a very simple
slider right they don't want to stand
that you could literally just take a div
putting a couple of ul UL and then a
couple of allies for every image and
then from day and you basically say hey
there's gonna be four like this the
simplest way that I think of create a
slider there's four images how will you
make them slide very simple you who come
here say hey make 400% let's say for
example 100 percent or 100 pixels of the
images right and then you say every Ally
is going to be 100 percent of the width
of the parent and then every time that
you want to move it from one side to the
other one
all you have to do is say go to the left
negative one hundred pixels and that
will switch every image every time that
you click the button and make it into a
slider or you will see a plus 100 pixels
to the right and then that will move it
to the other side now right now talking
about it you can't really picture it too
too well but if you break down problems
like that you say okay I'm gonna take
everything one step at a time I think
people can understand code and tackle it
better than how they doing it now
nowadays because most people come in and
say I'm gonna watch a video tutorial
like it's Netflix everybody wants to get
to the end of the video it's like nah
you don't need to get to the end of the
video this is not Netflix you don't want
to know what the next episode is you
want to understand that episode that
you're in before you move on if you did
a course like that I I think it'd do
great
I think another a big problem with a lot
of these platforms been talking about is
that when they ask you to break these
huge problems down that you know maybe
to some people they don't seem that big
of a deal but like like you're saying
like a slider like oh my gosh where do I
even freaking start a lot of people just
stack overflow the answer which is to be
honest what we do a lot in the day to
day coding but you're beginning I mean
you got an all at the basic concepts and
just it's it's not going to help you
learn if you just stack overflow paste
the answer from stack overflow in the
free code camp box or whatever and move
on to the next exercise like to the
biggest skill I think like like you're
saying to is breaking it down a problem
solving it's not even about coding we
use code to solve problems our job is to
solve problems we don't clock in or go
to work just to code like that's not the
goal the goal is to solve a problem
through code and if people people can
break that down and say okay step one
for a slider or you know graph it on a
piece of paper and make a doodle and
like okay first this is my flowchart
step one do this and then you know
whatever but the people can really learn
that kind of skill I think it'd do great
and I think that's something that's
really missing and most of these if not
all of them versus yeah cuz I just think
I'm like most people just need to you
know learn the basics learn how to
soft problems because that's what we're
doing you know like yeah we know how to
code but once you know the syntax and
you know the concepts it's okay cool you
know the syntax and you know the
concepts
whoopty-doo what can you solve a problem
get paid a lot of money is to solve
problems not to say hey I know how to
copy code hey I know how to just look in
the documentation like anybody can do
that but can you solve the problems
right and when you understand the
problems you can code quicker and so
you're more valuable to people the
faster you can solve these problems by
understanding the code how it works like
okay I'm gonna use jQuery for this or
okay I think this project is suitable
for angular rather than react or
whatever if you can make those decisions
instead of waiting two weeks I mean
you're a valuable developer you're
solving problems and being able to
determine what kind of code you need and
how you need to plan that out so huge
skill anyway Joe I gotta bust out of
here I gotta go back to work but thank
you so I was literally about to start
you know cutting the stream down but
yeah man um thank you for coming through
