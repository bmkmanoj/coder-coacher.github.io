poor job back at it again man we're
going to continue with the first part of
this you know this series which is the
view right but to learn about the view
we need to learn what is a template
engine and for a damages the template
engine is cold nunchuck right so
nunchucks is a template engine created
by Mozilla it's widely used is pretty
much once you learn one template engine
you will learn all the other ones
first of all template engine is
basically to generate code in the
backend to basically to what the client
right let's start with this basically we
want to get syntax highlighting so let's
say you on atom right and you say hey
HTML or HTML and then you have a closing
tag and let's say an example you have a
body right now the file doesn't have an
extension so the braum basically Adam
doesn't know what type of file it is so
it can give you highlighting okay right
so highlighting basically just you know
it shows you what type of uh you know
tags they are or like nothing it just
it's so much better to you know Rico
like this right sure the same example
once you put highlight and context
highlighting you see now we know exactly
what tags we are you know because they
knows hey this person is writing an HTML
the language right so that's what we're
doing with basically objects now we're
going to get syntax highlighting for you
know the non just files so non text
files are usually njk so what we do is a
little pressure answers right and we
Serge
how typing nunchuks
now that will give you syntax highlight
of the larger so installed it this
template will give a language file for
atom and then now when you come through
a file that basically njk is going to
give you a highlighter right you
understand the syntax all right so let's
say we want to print a variable to the
HTML right from the controllers to the
HTML we will say something like this
name and then you put it inside of soup
you know two curly brackets right just
variable and put inside the block right
so it will actually show up on the page
so we'll say we usual h2 and we want to
print out name the variable name now we
go to control us what about make sure
that we connecting to basically be about
method now let's just sort out and go to
the pages in trouble we get hit to the
pages controller when you're saying hey
once you come to the pages controller I
want going to give me the about method
right so when the amount about method
runs basically what it's saying hey when
this route hits here I'll slash about
basically cell the view about which is
the about tumbler here and basically
there's a variable named name and then
inside of that variable is called Joe
right inside of it there's a property
name is Joe so now when we come here
what is going to say hey once the lines
on the page is going to automatically
send that variable here so there's a so
now because we have that variable named
Joe named name you're basically showing
it here right so it says Joe on the h2
you can see is in HTML is too
well that's how variables working on
apart from syntax is basically tags
right so let's say we have an if
statement right you say it's logged in
right instead of having two curly
brackets right now we're going to use
the the tag so we say hey curly bracket
I am percent and then we put in the tag
and then there's a variable and
therefore maybe we have a closing you
know close one of the tag so let's say
it's just basically running JavaScript
for the view so you will say hey it's
logged in user is logged and current
users like that now else user is not
logged in alright so that's just to you
know be able to be in connect with the
server and use the variables for the
page let's see what it shows right shows
user it's not like day right and that's
because we have not them equals two
folks now let's say we wanted to run
true right it's going to say users not
like them because we have to restart the
server right
you see it's still showing that now we
come back here take control see stop the
server and then we say NPM start now we
restarted the whole server right now
let's say change the true now this is
supposed to change users Bob day users
like them use tag right now remember you
could come to the documentation look
through here you could use for loops
there's a whole bunch of stuff just go
to the documentation play around with it
right I just showed you the basics of
how to use a tag on basically manager
let's say we wanted to add a head of
pivot right we're not going to go
manually and say hey on every about page
like every single patient about or
welcome and the contact page we're going
to put in the header so what we do is we
create a basically a master layout which
is dead right so that's why it's named
master so we have that Maithili
and we say hey we want to add a header
here and you say header then we put in a
link slash about way to go we're going
to add the home and contact right so now
what this is doing basically is going to
show up in every single page okay so now
it shows up in every single page now
what if we wanted to basically change
the title you want the time to show up
differently for every single page so
then what we do is we create another
block which is just a tag name block and
basically we put in the name of what we
want to call it so we say hey we're
going to call this block title right so
now when we come to the about page we
say hey block title name it about
picture so let's go back a little bit
right so we all know about about page
right so what does this thing right here
is saying hey extend master so what you
saying hey this is a child of the master
layout so all you want is this
information to show up in the depending
on the block that their arms and say
block title shows up on the block title
and the Blackhawks and shows up on the
black carpet so that's what you put in
here you say okay block title show up
here on this block title and then the
black constant so in the black content
so now let's say we want to change this
tool we want to add a little footer
right you copy this right go copy
and so clutter go this is the shoulder
all right now you come here and copy
this and you say hey you want this to
show up aspect
one English folder so now every page we
have this option to put in you know put
our content inside of those slots right
so we say hey when I come to the about
page change the title put in the content
and it show me the footer but never
change the top because this is going to
change its going to stay the same no
matter what page you are easy to
maintain so let's say an example we
wanted to change to change to the header
and say hey we want to do add an email
link now we don't have to go in attitude
every single page we just change it on
the master layout and those changes pass
it down to all the other pages so this
is here and go to about you see the
changes is there so that's like the
simple way of you know they know the
template engine any question make sure
you leave a comment let me know what you
think I only got a few seconds before
this thing stops make sure you saw
