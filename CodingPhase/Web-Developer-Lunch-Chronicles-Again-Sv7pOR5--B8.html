knows your boy joke back at it again
like summer is looking crazy out
here the Sun is out the beauties is out
we got to be teases out you know is
popping when the babies are out you know
it's popping summertime kid we out here
all right man oh I don't know I don't
know why I'm so hype right now you know
how you know how people get you know
people start going crazy summertime
start coming out so they start bringing
out the miniskirts the dudes start you
know hitting the gym start trying to get
buffed up people don't know how to act
and that's your boy you did summertime
man so right now I'm just gonna get my
little my little Turkey special you know
we're doing our thing but man I was just
like looking at the video from yesterday
you know with the mentees you know the
program and mentorship experiment that
I'm doing and man I like it I
really I really like boxing like I was
like thinking about I'm like god it's
just dope and I was like I'm
seeing how other people in progress and
you know they do better in their code I
help them out and at the same time it's
like I learned a lot from them to like
you know it's a lot of I'm learning
I'm learning how to how to teach people
how to find the right projects for
everybody how to break down how to break
down things that's how you know a spring
tool because if I start sneezing
allergies is here boy cool
so anyways man is crazy man
summertime don't know how to act bolo me
pork right because I feel I got in part
great
here man
now school I think Beth is gonna get to
the next level you know that's one thing
I like about it took is like we're
helping her her out so it's like we
guiding her you know Matt is doing is
doing his thing Tommy's doing his thing
April's doing her thing you know I feel
like I feel like April is like
in-between she maybe she's too busy at
the moment or maybe you know I want to
help her a little bit more just to get
to the same level as timing it and I met
but I know that she could do it by the
end of this project she's gonna be
really really good
like I know it she's gonna be really
really good I could guarantee you guys
that you know Andre to Andre
all he really needs is like you know
it's just to get back on it and you know
not think of this as something like a
race you know he just got to get that
first project done properly once he gets
his first project done properly then he
could jump to the next project you know
that's another thing that I like about
Ken because he he knew his project
wasn't done so until it's done
then you shouldn't jump onto the next
project you know but I definitely
understand where Andre is coming from
it's like you know when you were getting
a company and you're like already a
back-end developer and like people don't
care about you know the styles or the
HTML on the JavaScript because you're
already working in the backend so your
job is to produce as much stuff as fast
as possible but you know the reason why
he joined us is to be part of
the full stack you know you know be able
to learn everything so he's definitely
gonna do his thing
cool cool cool cool
were summertime kid you know that's when
you you come outside you like what a
biddies at the same man
now yeah but today I'm gonna do this
crystal Ling tutorials I'm excited about
that
I started working in coding face comm
last night again this weekend I'm going
to work on it more
hopefully Sunday I have something decent
that could say okay guys go and register
now you guys gonna have the channels are
up and that's gonna be cool that's one
thing like everybody wants to sign up
everybody keeps telling me like yo Joe I
want to sign up I want to sign up but
it's like I still haven't finished
everything you know so it's gonna be you
guys are pretty much gonna be like beta
you know and whoever signs up now is
gonna get a little badge that basically
says like you know you guys were
founders of the website yeah y'all were
like the original users that were there
from the beginning so you know whatever
I'll make you guys get discounts
whatever / or merchandise that I might
put for it
ya get discount if you know later on a
year two years from now if I'm charging
for any special service you guys always
going to get the discount so yeah man
hey guys don't worry about it man just
chill hang out man wheel we old friends
in here man but we old friends we all
cool don't worry about it you know
yeah I appreciate it you know you guys
when you guys buy the courses from the
link you're pretty much saying okay you
to me I'm gonna pay you $10 for the
course but make sure you give Jo at
least two hours that's exactly what
you're doing you know what I mean of
course you could buy the courses by
yourself without you know going through
the link you probably go to udemy calm
maybe you won't get the discount but you
could buy on your own time you know what
I mean but when you come back to the
channel and you use the link it just
helps out man
it really does
Plus like I told you guys I wanna I
don't know I'm gonna once I touch 5,000
subscribers I don't know I was thinking
about giving I call this giving $100
each to like five people five random
people from from the channel but then I
was thinking about it you know what
maybe I could do more than that I could
give you guys like a year's worth of
hosting you know maybe I could do that
you know and I could actually give that
to more than one person
yeah man I appreciate it man you know
because even though it might not see my
lies like $2 here in their $2 fee in
there you know it's like when people
come in and they'll donate $5 or they go
to the patreon and support the patreon
they're putting a dollar on it you know
all that adds up you know and the
goal is not to become a millionaire out
of this the goal is to be able to
do this more more full-time you
know so I could just actually just give
more for free to people that's the
goal man I just want to let you guys see
me man
like you see me I come out here and I
come and chat with you guys and talk
with you guys but it's not like this
channel is not a business this
channel is not trying to make
money this channel is about just hanging
out with somebody you know like even
myself like well now I started you know
becoming a web developer I didn't have
no friends that was into this shape you
know all my friends is like
Hustler's and and dudes who are
working you know construction
guys who are going to college
now that was like the type of friends
that I had nobody was into this so
there was nobody I could really talk to
about it
and yeah you could go on Stack Overflow
and this and that but it's like it's not
the same you know it's not the same when
you have somebody that you could talk to
me like oh
I'm stuck on this thing and whatever you
go help me out with this
you know so that's what I created this
channel I just want to help people out
and just totally you know all type of
people that are actually out here
where you bought 84 music going in what
courses you bought beautiful music I
wonder like what what you're doing
because I know you're doing your beats
and you do a music and so what actually
in what courses are you actually taking
man
just wondering
yeah licks elixir I don't know man like
serious one of those one of those
languages guys like I like functional
programming I just don't like your lick
sir I don't like certain things of it it
doesn't coach me you know what I mean
but that might just be me you know
hello Kimmy partner honey run amok in
touch again Amy see
word you already know that's why I get
my little turkey sandwich one little
turkey wrap sometimes I eat a salad but
I just don't like eating like crazy
chickens look over here there's a
Wendy's Oh down there there's like a
Japanese spot and then down there
there's like high coldest
Chipotle and like that
it's like I can't be eating all that
 food
I really just eat something simple and
then when I get home I cook my own meals
do you need a MacBook
you don't need a macbook but is
recommended it's definitely recommended
to get a MacBook just half a MacBook for
cheap guys you don't need a brand new
MacBook you could go on Craigslist and
buy a 2008 MacBook for $300 you could
buy a MacBook for $400 on Craigslist
you know 2008 2010 2012
you know those max books Mac books are
 cheap right now so just buy one
man trust me you will regret it and then
once you start working and you're making
some money then you buy yourself a brand
new one you've got okay I might drop two
thousand but once you know what you're
actually getting you know
first light then I watch the video big
respect for what you're doing for the
community yes sir
you don't listen for the squad man we do
this for for the people's right
yeah man they changing the
payment system you to me is its kind of
I don't know they they always
experimenting like you know a few years
ago when I first got into you to me
there were selling courses for thirty
five fifty dollars and then the the main
prices which are like 175 200 dollars
and I'm like man that's way too much you
know so then nobody was really buying
them people were buying them but it was
a small amount of people but then they
realized that it's like hey if you make
a cheap more people buy it and more
people gonna you know like once you have
a good course and you realize the the
power that you to me can give you a lake
and how many big horses people actually
get then you buy more courses so they
they kind of realize that they
like hey for us selling man
expensive we're not selling that many
courses it's better to sell a lot of
courses because people come in
and then they like okay this course was
good let me keep buying more courses so
they still going to make money you know
what I mean so but now they want to
switch up the payment system so I'm like
eh whatever let's see what happens you
know but at least you know for you guys
if you buy a course and and you have
already you already bought it then you
own it for life you know so you're good
what's the best web hosting service um
you could go it depends if you want to
create something simple a regular
website you could do Namecheap com you
have a video on my channel that's pretty
much talking about that and if you go
through my link you also get a discount
on namecheap.com but yeah that's where I
go all the time
are to do that or if not if I'm going to
create a web application I use Heroku
now Heroku is more expensive but what's
cool about it is that all you have to do
is just push your your your project to
github or bitbucket you push it to
Heroku and then from there that's saying
you don't have to worry about nothing
else you don't have to worry about the
servers you don't have to worry about
maintaining it they do it for you so you
know
if I heard the new dj khaled joint nah
man I would really pay attention to rap
music like that the only people that
listen to right now man is it's
famous Dex I listen to famous Dex I
listen to rich the kid who else I forgot
like a couple of people future of course
who else I think that's about it but I
think my favorite rapper right now is
definitely famous Dex you know and know
Ozzy for sure lil uzi for sure that's
for sure
yes different Grider man he's like j 84
man 84 he's a legit man
Steven grab this is legit man oh man you
look down you got a 2015 MacBook Pro
Retina screen 13 inches for 750 that's
good bro you doing good
you know how to get to the sales that's
what I'm talking about you know you got
to do what I do man I have my life on my
laptop and then once I want to buy some
something new I go and I sell my laptop
so I in in your head you got to think
about it the next time you buy your next
MacBook you're going to sell your laptop
for five hundred six hundred dollars so
then all you need is another thousand
dollars and you'll be good
now that's what's up at a format I wish
you know because I make beats man I make
beats too but you know now a lot of
people are selling the beats online I
see you're doing it you know and I'm
like man I wish I would have been doing
that back in the days cuz I
used to be putting beats for free like
online without selling a or nothin so I
really make money like that from people
I got a couple of beats online for a
couple of famous people but after that
then I kind of left it alone you know to
me I was spending way too much money
into equipment and I wasn't really
getting my money back
so that's when I was like you know what
man I gotta get back to school I got a
do say you know get my money up
I mean I will tell you like this man if
you really really wanted to go all out
try to get all of Stephen Grider's
courses like man that guy is legit like
all his courses that's all you really
need
you need the react native you know to be
able to make phone applications you need
the react course you need react advance
react with Redux what else you need the
es6 this you know most of his courses
are legit man I got all of them the only
one that didn't like was the graph QL
I think graph QL was not going to pick
up people are not going to jump on that
so that was a waste of time
yeah the Rob was a Rob personal guy his
 course sucks man I'm sorry but
his course suck it's like if you never
taste the clean water you don't know
what clean water is like once I went and
I started taking courses from Stephen
Grider cold steel then I knew what the
hell was actually a good course you know
like for me that's that's the the top of
the game you know hell you're Lucy man
that's my boy
XXX sent a co now niggas niggas crazy
my name is like yo I got the dagger dick
extent that's young as crazy man
yep
Co steals the man like with that course
you could be good man like even if you
didn't buy any other course that course
alone will teach you almost everything
then from there all you have to do is
keep practicing making different
websites
oh nice also you're making a pretty good
living then from me making beats man
right that's what's up
how many lunches do they give me only
one luncheon there's one lunch man I
usually take it like a one o'clock two
o'clock today I took that thing inside
140 150
now that's what's up son keep doing your
thing 84 man that's how it is man you
gotta you gotta know like what you're
good at you know I mean like you're good
at music and then at the same time you
you have the and entrepreneur of feeling
inside of you so it's like you also make
beat you sell your beats then now you're
gonna learn how to do you know
programming now you're going to create
your own website create your own
your own setup I'm pretty sure you have
a lot of ideas that other producers that
want to sell online you could
create a service for them you know what
I mean so that's what I'm doing like
with this whole thing of coding phase
comm I was telling my coworker I was
like man you know I've been spending
years trying to find like a good niche
like finding something you know
something to create like a good service
and then I'm like wait I'm good at
coding why am I not working with people
that want to learn how to code and then
you know that's why I was like you know
 I'm gonna create this website
because I know there's a there's a need
for it
I mean - what's your name me Ani
I can't even say but listen this one me
NSA
okay you're Joe how is it possible to
get a job learn web development at the
working place as you say isn't we
supposed to know our stuff very well
before you have the chance to work in a
company yes and no when you're a junior
developer they know you are junior
developer so pretty much you will get
paid lower than a mid-level or senior
level developer right so they notice a
lot of that you're going to have to
learn on the job every job it doesn't
matter what it is you could go in even
to become the president of the United
States you're hired to become the
president of the United States but these
are training behind it they teach you
where everything is at the teaching on
how to run the country that you can't
just be like hey I'm president and
that's it so it's the same say for what
development it's like you're developer
but it doesn't mean that they got to
throw you in the deep end unless you're
already a made to senior level developer
you know what I mean like they gotta
give you time for you to adjust it and
teach you how to do things on the
company and every company has its own
way so it's like you're getting paid but
you already know that matter of fact
you're getting pay for stuff that you
don't know yet so you're gonna learn on
the job you know what I mean all they
care about is that you know how HTML CSS
and the basics of JavaScript and that
you're a quick learner that's all the
things that that people are looking for
they're not looking for genius they're
not looking for somebody that knows
everything if they looking for that then
that's not the company that you want to
be in
yeah Ronnie man just keep going bro you
know this is not about who's smart
who's not you know it's more about
dedication and if you're having fun
doing it now if you hate coding don't do
this for the money because it's gonna
get more difficult and more boring the
more difficult it gets the more boring
it gets but if you like doing this then
you're going to have fun and also yeah
g-g-g-gia
Krishan in here I'm super late I'm
 answering everybody's questions
and talking to everybody from messages
like five minutes five minutes ago
yeah 84 that's the man like you
know if you don't have a good teacher
you're not going to be able to merge it
you know you might take a course a lot
of people buy courses online right or
take a course or they signed up to a
service to try to learn this thing and
then they realize they're like I don't
know how to push it together right and
that's because the instructor the
teacher the professor whoever the
is teaching you it's not teaching it to
you in a way that is simple it's not
teaching it to you in a way that you
know they don't take into consideration
that you don't know anything like MA
when I make my tutorials I'm making
dummy proof like it doesn't matter
what's your background you can
understand what the hell I'm talking
about it's like here most of these
 guys on YouTube they're talking
to you on some advanced
terminologies and a whole bunch of
that when you watch their videos you
like what do you say now you got to
rewind it you got to go on google search
things up me are coming here I'll talk
to you guys exactly how to talk to my
boys you know so people like that
now
when you have an instructor that doesn't
teach you in a way where he takes
consideration that you don't know
anything then that's the problem that's
how you don't learn because they
thinking that you already know this
and it's like bro I'm paying for your
course because I don't know you
know what I mean
yes sir
yeah here you get yeah
yeah man 4 yo guys listen everybody go
join together because you know even
though once I shut down this this live
video you guys could still go over there
and chat with each other yeah I could
still stay in contact man don't just
come here just for you know to chat on
on the live videos cool but also do the
Gator man because once I shut this thing
down then that's it there's no more chat
but if you go to the Gator and I'll get
our account you search code and face
calm then you're gonna be golden
you know you're gonna have two squad
you're gonna see your boy man you're
gonna see me in there you're gonna see
on Drake and I see Ken you're gonna see
ah 84 he in there you're gonna see uh
you know a couple of people you might
not see Chris Shawn I don't think rich
Shawn joined together yet but uh where
you gonna see the the squad man you're
gonna see the regulars the people that's
always there you know also so like that
you got stay in contact man because even
from all of this I want that all of
you guys stay in contact and just become
cool like it's so cool like when
you find like other developers that you
could become friends and like just find
out what level they up to what they
learning like I think that's the best
part for me is the community just
knowing that there's other people
learning to the same that I'm
learning and some of them are more
advanced than me and some more you know
less advanced than me and I help them
out
that's your love that you know what
I mean
exactly the more likes to you put into
this thing man the more gets recommend
it to everybody else man
Amy without when I would up where it's
good to see man it's good to see new
people's into the chat man I love this I
love when I come in here and every day I
see more people coming into the chat
coming into the live feed you know I'm
not teaching anything I feel like right
now if somebody you know one of this
 nerds come in here and they're
gonna be like oh my god this guy's not
talking about anything he's not teaching
any cold he's not doing this in that but
it's not about that there's live chats
on my lunch break are about just
talking with you guys and just getting
together and at the same time sometimes
dropping a little gem you know giving
you guys you know giving you guys a
couple of you know
catcha boy Andre in here Andre came in
first
 Jo said no frameworks Larry sire
no frameworks on up in this bitch we got
a code this thing from scratch yeah
because that's how you're gonna that's
how you're gonna get you know
you're gonna get nice with it there's a
difference between prototyping and
creating when you prototype you want to
create something super quick but right
now we create it you know so that's the

and that's the same thing for for
JavaScript guys don't use a framework
don't use something like angular or view
until you know how to do it with
JavaScript you don't have to learn
everything in JavaScript but if you
cannot do a for each loop in in
JavaScript why are you trying to do it
on angular you know what I mean
shoutout to milkman yeah yeah I'm gonna
create do you know yeah you know what
