figure it out I got to find a perfect
way to set this up so you guys don't
don't lose out on the quality and we
lose out on having the live shows all of
us are doing once once a day or once a
week like we'll make live shows more
meaningful you know our main like I feel
like right now a lot of people take the
line shows that I do every day for
granted and they're like oh man we see
Joe every day so if I miss it today is
okay because I'll see him tomorrow

not really the world's that you see on
the website it's for actually you know
internally component that we use
especially customer service and stuff
like that so I had to fix that but you

design because right now if you go to
the website that I work on right the
company I work for the website I'll be
honest it looks like it's really
outdated you know but that's what they
