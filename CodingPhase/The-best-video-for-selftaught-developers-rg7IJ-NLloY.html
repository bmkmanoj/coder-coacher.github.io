literally everybody who is watching any
tutorials on YouTube anybody who's
watching anything on udemy

reach out to him to see maybe if I could
put his video on my website dude because
this should be like your ADA video for
people to do I hate this how it is at
work your first date it hasn't been a
video this good ever
I'm seeing everybody's video I was
thinking about doing you know brain now
this is exactly what I was going to do
it my first day as a first as a
developer right so I'm googling it to
see is somebody already Denny and then I
realize I'm like wait I know I've seen
this case somewhere man
so okay so let's go back into his video
yeah this video this video so like after
I don't know man like literally like you
know you can make fun of me whatever
like my eyes got watery right my eyes
got watery I'm the type of person that
if I see a movie and that movie reminds
me of something that has happened to me
in the past my eyes get worried it's
like I get emotional right I'm watching
this video and it just brought me back
you know brought me back to that time
when I was like man I was working at
really bad jobs you know I was just like
I don't know how I'm gonna do this I
need to get in the game I need to
somehow make it I need to somehow I was
like I remember this and I was like man
I don't want to go back to this type of
work that I used to do like I just want
opportunity man yeah I work hard to
really get to where I'm at right now and
I'm like man I'm looking at this video
this kid reminds me so much of me at
that moment man and like you know for
everything just realizing the type of
job that it is to become a developer you
know realizing when you first go that
first day you like men um you know I
have a good job now you know as I all
this work that I put in I actually paid
off at the end and then like everybody
super cool of course you're gonna find
people who are a-holes
there's people who are good in every
industry right but there's a certain
type of quality of life that it
guarantees right and just the
environment you know when you work in a
big company and you're like man this is
really good you know what I mean and he
didn't say own the company that he works
on but it seems like he works in in a
legit place you know it's like you know
a place if they use am/pm from
programming they is a legit place like
most companies they don't have time for
that you know like a lesson think of a
really big corporation so you guys gotta
watch this video man this video is dad
good man and like I just hit my you know
hit me right here cuz I was like man I'm
so happy for this kid like literally I'm
so happy for it like I haven't been this
happy in a long time man and I'm
watching his video and I'm like man this
is so cool you know I don't know I don't
even know what to say it's like it got
me emotional I'll be honest I got me
emotional because you know there's a lot
of good things that I have now and even
now that I take in you know I take for
granted like you know like quality of
life that I have things that I had to
walk here afford anything that I want
I could get anything that I want you
know what I mean and I'm looking at this
video and I'm like man
Dallas me like years ago you know what I
mean like five years ago when I was like
you know you know working in freaking at
the mall you guys I keep saying this
like you know what I mean
like yes I had the moment when I first
decided to switch you know to become a
full-time developer I was working in
Wall Street as an IT but right before
that job I was working on our money
exchange got fired and then ended up
working in the same mall on the parking
lot you don't know how how how bad that
makes you feel like right like imagine
working in the store and then they're
like a your fire you doesn't work here
so now you still not you it's the same
bills and still got the same things now
you're working in the parking lot you
know what I mean like people like us we
don't have no no you know no pillows to
fall back on you don't have no mommy and
Papa to hold us down we don't have none
of that stuff it's like we have to make
it ourselves we pretty much the first
generation here you know when we get
here is like we making our stories you
know what I mean
we're like the pilgrims when it comes to
this right and here in him like I know
he he came from the bottom I could tell
that he really appreciate what he has
you know and I really you know I really
humbled me you know made me feel real
humble else I killed I got a appreciate
him I really love what I'm doing like
this days I'm like oh why am I still
coding like I should be trying to switch
to something else I don't like man I got
a really good opportunity you know I
could do anything that I want I really
worked hard to get to the level that I
am how I'm gonna switch it to something
completely different after all the work
that I put in its against it is there's
no play man is such a good video guys
you guys gotta watch it I want every
single person every single person who
watch
this video if you respect my opinions
you respect my my you know my experience
and advice that I give you go subscribe
to this kid because you know he dropped
this video always started he hasn't
dropped another video I want him to drop
more videos because I want to continue
here in his journey I want to know what
projects he's working on you know like
there's like one of those people that
you just like man I want to know more
about him right now he only has two
hundred four subscribers but he got a
couple of thousands of views right but
that doesn't matter this kid is like
this is the real true story behind every
time there everything everybody this is
what I wish I would have done from the
beginning if I was here years ago where
I could have documented my whole journey
of you know as I continue to learn as I
continuing to build projects and and do
things online there's the the the first
stage where he's at right now you know
he cut myself to a developer being able
to get a good job you know I understand
everything that he's going through I
won't do the same thing where you get
hired as a contractor from a third party
but you're still working on this big
company you like me you grateful you got
this opportunity and that opportunity is
gonna lead for him to be working in that
company full-time like 100 percent
directly to the company because when
you're a good employee and you know how
to do your work and you really put in
that extra hours guys at the end of the
day even though you might come into a
job as a contractor they're gonna give
you that job right because that position
needs to be filled all right they don't
want people coming in and out so it's
like if they love you and they care
about you in that company you're gonna
hold that position and that's yours you
know what I mean
and sky's the limit for this caveman
like I really just I don't even know
what to say guys like I love this video
this is like my number one video that
I'm gonna tell every single person when
they ask me
how is it the first day at work
especially as a self-taught developer
watch this man like this is like the
best video you know I really feel bad
because sometimes I get so many comments
and I feel haven't been able to you know
reach out back to him you know and I
really are I'll be honest I really feel
like this right now I don't want to
curse my foot my issue you guys fill it
up but I really feel like it's because
he has reached out to me and like he's
leave comment so he he watches almost
all the videos that I drop and I really
appreciate that man
cuz I feel like I don't know him
personally but I feel like I know it
just from this video along just the type
of person that he is and like he reminds
me so much of like my like my cousin's
my little cousins from the are like and
then it's like to see him doing this
right now I was like I'm really proud of
him I could tell he's Dominican so it's
like I'm definitely proud to see another
Dominican in the industry especially
because I know exactly well you know he
was talking about it's like man every
you know the typical developer that you
think like oh that's exactly how the
developers look that's exactly how you
go to a company everybody looks the same
everybody's wearing the little star wars
star track shirts or you know the little
button down shirt super tighten tucked
in and looking weird and stiff that's
just me joking but yeah it happens so
it's like a lot of times you go in there
and you're like man I don't even know
like I go in in two places I got some
type of you know I go into places with
some type of sauce you know what I mean
it's like do I fit in do people like me
you know what I mean like all those
thoughts go through your head you know
what I mean and it's really good to see
somebody speak about it and and just
speak about it in a really nice way you
know sometimes people think of me and
like oh he talks about certain things in
a cocky way guys
I've been in this industry for five six
years alright and sometimes I do be like
Sunda cocky but it's not really because
I wanna sound cocky it's more of a way
to break myself up you know because I've
been in really bad situations you know
in really good situations you know what
I mean so the bad situations make me
feel a certain way so I just I lift
myself up I don't need nobody else to
lift me up I left my cell phone you know
what I mean
so talking back about this this this
video it's like you know I was like it's
just a legit real a real video people
need to watch it every single
self-taught developer should watch this
because especially for you guys you know
like most of my audience is people that
come in from random jobs man like that's
something that he talked about it you
know working in warehouses working in
factories and working in you know
manufacturing like that's a lot of
people that's like man all in one is
just a comfortable job they're gonna be
able to do something that they love it
it be comfortable and get to you know
have followed at the job at the same
time now a lot of people have the luxury
that we have to you know go into the job
with a smile you go into the most of
these jobs you know miserable like oh
man I got a goal but I gotta you know
stand at this door you know be a
security guard I gotta go to the
restaurant in you know flip burgers I
gotta go to you know the freakin
warehouse with the high lows and you
know whole bunch of dudes in there super
hot in the summer sweating like real
stuff real real life things man you know
and he's just really good at seeing this
kid in here man you know in a like I
said like he has reached out to me he
has left comments you know has told me
hey check out this video I haven't had a
chance I just haven't had the chance
there's there's so many people that I'll
hit me up and I try to try to comment as
much as I can with everybody and talk to
everybody because like I said every
single one of you guys have a good story
every
one of you guys is a good person you
know so it's like that's what I tell you
that's it when I come here I think of
you guys as friends I'm not you know
it's like I'm hanging out with my
friends I'm not here being fake with
with other people you know when people
that are not my friends are a completely
different way people acts me a monatomic
man Joe is this how you are all the time
with you know a new job with this and
I'm like no not really
this how I act with my friends you know
you know closed environment you know so
it's like I consider you guys although
all of you guys like my friends and like
people that I relate to so it's like
sometimes I wish I could just get in
contact with every single one of you
guys get to listen to your stories let's
listen to your background get to find
out when you got a job when you know
you've been working you know hopefully
me Omar we could get together work on
something together I'm pretty sure he's
probably out here no East Coast so maybe
we could link up you know I wouldn't
mind being his friend hey you know as
weird that sounds but you know it's like
sometimes you know you don't find out
many people that are like you in this
industry right it's like we are the
glitches of the matrix that's hard look
at it with the glitches of the matrix
right like to some people that were like
oh these people not supposed to be here
some people are supposed to be working
on something else or you know you might
you might feel a certain way you might
be like hey I don't know if I'm gonna
fit in I don't know if I'm on the list
know if I'm gonna be able to be good
there's guys that's way smarter than me
this this and that
but sometimes you just need to really
like you know have a community talk to
other people's like you know I haven't
even met that many Dominicans who are
ready to what development like that at
all
there might be like me and Edwin Diaz
you know like besides that I don't even
know who else I think 84 music is
Dominican he's trying to get in this
game you know but I don't know how many
Dominicans doing this thing right

mind just kicking it back with him but I
yell bro we just gotta work something

could throw at him whatever anything
