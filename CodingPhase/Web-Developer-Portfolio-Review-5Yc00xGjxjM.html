coding phrase calm today we have
something special for you guys we have
another web developer portfolio stay
tuned
you
alright guys so here's actually Aries
Newman's portfolio listen this is pretty
legit man I like the design of it I like
how it looks I like the the feel for it
you know to me like he has
well he's passionate about inspired and
driven adaptable he shows his work you
know this is home page alright
it has everything here okay he's about
me his contact page now if you click on
work it takes you specifically just for
the work page okay it has all his
projects now here it has his
testimonials I guess from clients that
he's had you know a couple of lorem
ipsum you know they're coming you know
as he starts getting more clients he'll
start filling them up okay
he has his about page which is pretty
cool got his Instagram guys Facebook you
know he got a couple of paragraphs here
talking about him selves well he like
space video games to draw exploring you
know Netflix buying things on Amazon
technical jargon so he's a coder wait a
designer well both okay
he started hand coding everything but
then he fell in love with the
functionality of WordPress and he's been
using it for the past I guess the past
year or so so there's sort of
programming languages that he knows HTML
CSS JavaScript PHP sequel Java and good
old English I mean technically he's
gonna put this here but it's okay man we
let a slide libraries that he knows
frameworks you should put libraries or
frameworks put in WordPress foundation
jquery jquery mobile congress wordpress
plugins software they'll be photoshop
illustrator after effects animation CC
go to Microsoft Paint
grid system semantics foundation flow XY
grid to be honest I don't even think
that you need to put this okay so that's
not needed I like the little icons here
that's cool
let me see what else you got here Oh
what is this like a console lock me see
that's cool I like it so let me see what
else he got so as far as his job
it's work that he's done okay let's look
into this he's done this one was a
entire tourism okay so when you click on
on a project actually takes you into
more details of the project see that's
not in that makes sense I've been
telling people to do this when I have my
portfolio up even though I've taken my
portfolio down because I'm actually
redoing a brand new one but when I have
my portfolio I had the sack same thing
when you click on a portfolio or project
I just click on it it takes you to the
project and then from there I have
exactly what I used to build it
when did I build a you know what
technologies I used so this is pretty
cool I like the fact that there's like a
real project that he built this wasn't
like something from from Google or you
know github some hey let's build a clock
like nobody cares about your stupid
clock man sorry Wes boss but yes so it's
like a real project a real company and
wasn't under culture or adventure book
at or I'm guessing he built this a
wordpress cool so he did build it with
WordPress he's using foundation jQuery
you know the basics right now I'm
guessing he's more leaning more to doing
like WordPress jobs and WordPress work I
mean this is good this is perfect as for
a company like this it helps them out
that if they have new images that can
actually add add
themselves they don't have to wait for
the developer or the designer to come in
and Adi WordPress is perfect for that
man
you know especially for quick jobs like
this the website looks nice man I can't
I can't rely like it looks nice and
professional it is very fun a very
playful okay let me see what else we got
in here I got a few more projects in
here we got project synthesis let's
click in there let's see what's this
where exactly is this okay is it a
project
I guess this is something that he was
creating just to show I guess
his skills this is just a basically a
HTML website that's cool I like it okay
all right cool
so it looks nice let me see what I'll
see god they got the kite shop is it a
project oh this is nice this looks
professional now this is something that
you could definitely get paid for for
sure you know let me see yeah it's a car
so I guess this is just like a landing
page it's just all the HTML to way like
the front end it's not really connected
to any real ecommerce website but it's
fine that's that's totally fine because
this shows somebody hey he could build
something for us in
hopefully you know this looks legit
looks like a real store I wish it was
you know done with laravel or some type
of back in so we could actually see it
in there fully working okay let me see
what else
see we Harbor okay let's look at this
you
nice
like I'm gonna be 100% honest with you
guys this is one of the best portfolios
we've kind because all of the projects
that he has here seem to be real
businesses and even if they weren't real
businesses he basically built them as if
they were real businesses so somebody
comes in and sees this and says hey
he has clients he might be like you know
a brand new kid on the block but his
projects are up there like you know what
I mean like he's doing a lot of good
work let me see
click there ok so I guess this one it's
not really working go back
okay let's see what else CMD online
command prompt so there's like a project
that he built let me see
we don't have permission for anything I
don't know this is cool is a cool
project
I like wait a day here okay
but as far as like everything that's
here like it's pretty legit and his
website is Aaron Newman CA so I'm
guessing he's from Canada which is fine
CA is always good if you if you're from
Canada show somebody a there's a local
guy you know so definitely a pretty cool
portfolio here guys there's barely any
complaints that I can give I'm really
happy that he has real projects and it
wasn't like oh here's my github and you
could go to my github and freakin watch
you know how I do a JavaScript clock or
you know go to my website and look how
we sort out a string and it's like
nobody cares about that like you're a
web developer like you nobody cares
about that so I'm really happy that he
has a lot of real projects in here and
this is legit guys so anyways man make
sure you subscribe make sure you like
this video and guys please leave a
comment right I want you guys to answer
this question do you guys think that you
will jump into WordPress at some point
or would you just say hey I'm gonna skip
that I would like to know let me know in
the comments I'll see you guys later
see boy joke back at it again coding
