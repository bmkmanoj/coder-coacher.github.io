back at it again man : face calm listen
today we're gonna start with a little
bit bull strap you know just to give you
a little sense of it and to be honest
with you guys I don't even know if I
should be even call this boot strap it's
more about a great system and you know
having things responsive because in
reality I don't really use bootstrap for
all the other modules and components
that they have I just use it for the
grid system and at the end of the day I
don't even use the bootstraps grid
system I use somebody else's care system
so listen to this this is my story
behind it so basically if you come here
you search bootstrap grid CSS only right
you're going to find this guy Z Rafa
so his grid system is pretty legit is
just pretty much named after bootstraps
but the only difference is the super
light and it's just a great system
nothing extra and nothing more
just grid all right so we got to start
it up like this we have a download this
download zip we download the zip file so
basically there's the fire that you're
gonna get now inside of your big store
folder or whatever you named it you know
for the repo the project that that we're
building right we basically going to go
to assets we're going to go to sass we
got to create a new folder and we are
saying grid named it the grid right we
got to go to CSS on the one that we
downloaded for the bootstrap grid only
we're gonna download all the grids that
he has alright we're moving to grid now
inside of this folder we're going to
rename this files and we're going to
rename them to underscore s CSS use dot
s CSS make sure you do it right
rename it again
say on the score da SCSS yes
same thing for this one on the score the
SG says use that and then remain on this
sorry underscore pronounced name it s
CSS all right so we should be set now
now here on our code we're gonna go into
the SAS right and basically we're going
to go to main dot s CSS we're going to
all this that we're gonna import grid
slash was a grid 12 in the same grid 12
and then we're gonna put semicolon total
space that's it so we're done in that
sense right now what we just did we just
imported just the grid system
we're not inputting anything else from
bootstrap because in reality this all it
has is just the same main conventions as
bootstrap but everything else is just
simple slim and light all right I'm
going to show you in a second what I'm
talking about so think about it like
this every page is set up into boxes
think about it in a very simple way
everything that you see in a page as you
can see here there's one box there's
another box this here's a box this
here's a box there's another box and
then each image here is just a box
that's how I think about it when I look
at a page right now as you can see here
there's gonna be 12 columns in one grid
system that's what's called grid 12 so
grit 12 right so think about it like
this how will you break down this four
boxes there's five boxes here you will
do something like you know maybe three
here for node 3 3 2 2 and then 2 that
will equal to 6 right usually that's how
it is now for us for our page what we're
working on this is 2 2 columns here as
people see here it's 2 columns each one
is half of the screen so because it's
half of the screen think about it like
this 12 divided by 2 how much is it 6
now if you wanted to do it like that you
say okay I want to make three boxes for
so you say ok 4 4 4 equals to 12 what do
you say you want to say I want to make 4
boxes on on the screen you say 3 3 3 3
and that's it you divided that 12 grid
system into 4 so basically that's how
you guys think about it that's how it
for me it makes it easier to just bring
things down because I just look around a
bit okay this is 2 boxes this is 3 boxes
there's 4 boxes whatever it is alright
so for now let's go back into this now
let's run yard watch to pull our folder
cool now what we're going to do is we're
going to delete the width from the info
which is this and the model so now we're
basically going to start from scratch to
see how we're going to all in this day
ok
now also what we're going to do here is
we're going to come here to what we have
to model we're going to give it a new
class with nothing column MD 12
well column D 6
and they copy this again column MD and
then now you see back to 52 six also for
this image we're gonna give it from now
we're gonna give it let me see
image with 100 with 100 percent so this
can scale you see how scales alright so
let's do that now
for now let's come here and give this
model with 100 per second because we'll
have the maximum width it doesn't grow
any bigger than 500 but and what the way
for 100% technically what it does it
goes from the left to the right so it's
right now it's on 100% you see okay so
okay let's keep this simple let's start
using the bootstrap I keep saying
bootstrap because it's the naming
conventions of bootstrap but it's really
a great system it's just a great all
right so okay let's do this column B 6
what else do we have to give here on
this buttons price and D six oh six okay
what else in the C it goes good let's
remove the whiff of this with delete it
with that button with the leader that
one okay
now there's like a floating thing on
this okay this importance plate
inline-block justify:center you see wise
once the flow it has to be like a flop
or something like this patterns play in
reflects it's on the rotate from this
one
okay now definite got see remove this
top five here when you see how much okay
move the top five
it's a half removed see it's probably
like a many more wave somewhere or
something okay let's see what else we
got to put so now this the insider you
give this a maximal way for 400
something okay let me see that's good
that's fine
that stuff is fine for now yeah so
that's good now what I'm gonna do is I'm
going to copy this page right and we're
going to actually create the lookbook
area so copy this page and I say start
closing all these folders
okay we gonna copy this duplicate this
to look book by HTML all right so look
okay now let's do this okay so let me
see what else
now I win the lookbook we're gonna
delete all of this stuff or you're going
to create four columns okay so from here
the whole content area
okay cool
we got a refresh on this one okay so
let's go let's continue now we're going
to come here we're gonna say live call
md3 what this is going to do is create a
column we want four columns and we'll
say image cool so you see now we got
four columns here because of the great
system now if we want to say hey for
large screens we want the colors to
become you know divided into you know
for them have all four of them have them
into two and two so we're gonna do like
this column large six large six now for
smaller devices we're gonna say let if I
keep like this come on six
let's rename this so this was are going
to be into four so we actually going to
get you're going to say in a second you
see four large screen he's going to be
three now for smaller smaller I get is
not explained for for not for this or
we're going to say six right so that's
going to split into two
oops we got a name into SM okay so you
see it splits up into two now what we're
going to do is we're going to start
making the the boxes all right we're
going to say okay it's constant area and
then side alone was the columns so
inside of the columns is where we're
going to put in the divs so we're going
to name this image let's see look in it
all right copy this this here come to
this here this here what it is we click
okay now what we want to do is we will
say look image we come here we're gonna
face style now we're going to look for
cover full string CSS background now we
click here basically perfect full-page
background image well we could actually
reuse this for anything so we're going
to copy this there's like one of my own
CSS tricks that I use all the time so
when I can paste the sea-air style and
right now this inline CSS is now best
practices but when you're prototyping
you need something quick you can't go
from you know one page to another or one
file to another so I usually just paste
it right here for the moment until I fix
everything up now let's get some images
let's go to search this baked they look
right this pic images are not huge so
let's see what we got in here
you got Fredo else we got in here I want
to pick something that it's not going to
be too crazy so let's take this off or
not copy this paste this in here now
we're gonna start from the top we're
going to remove the fixed and then we're
also going to give this a height of what
no I want to say I'll give it off 250
pixels and with a 100% now yeah there's
exactly what we want it now let's see
how it stacks out cool all right now
let's get other images so we can
actually see the big difference of using
columns copy this and paste it in here
this is here tape engineer okay cool let
me see something
which or I can I stop somewhere okay
yeah now this is here place this here
now let's get other images take this one
of course you guys gotta find y'all
images that you might want to use so
let's see another one
let's go okay your boy if you're Metro
don't I'll see you when we search Nick
Young Metro okay let's see what else we
house coming out alright looking good
now let's do a couple of changes let's
make the heights a little bit bigger
than that let's say ah 400 so we'll
change where we said 250 the change to
400 find old a place
okay now also the stool is let's give
this a margin margin bottom of Sony
Pictures copy this paste paste paste all
right well that's looking good all right
cool
now a secrecy the reason why I stacked
up like that is because of the great
system now let's do it let's fix it up
because for large I think it should be
three okay so each one is taking three
spaces so yeah that's good that's fine
so now let's see what else can we do
here now as you can see we don't have a
margin for some reason the margin is not
coming in so let's try to fix that I see
mr. margin what that is this supposed to
be container okay so we gotta fix that
up tomorrow I must have made a mistake
somewhere
all right cool now we have a look book
page we learned a little bit about grids
and you know try to keep those
responsive you see now it will also
check through here see how we'll look in
a certain device now - 6 - 6 + C the C
it's not being shown and responsive
because of this metal tag ok copy this
thing make sure we're in here we're
going to see it - so you can see now for
the iPhone 6 this I will look at for 6 +
I Pro C for every single one is
different
see you like this will our screen which
is like desktop and laptops then as you
get smaller goes into four which is a
tablet and then I get smaller
it just goes to a world basically one
column one column taken to draw twelve
spaces and that's for mobile right for
cell phone of course we've got to fix
the menu create our mobile menu maybe I
will do that next but yeah guys so this
is just simple working with grids all
right I'll see you guys in the next
video
