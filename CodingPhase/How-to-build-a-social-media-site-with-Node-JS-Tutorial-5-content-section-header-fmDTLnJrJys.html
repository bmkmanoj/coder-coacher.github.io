coding face.com
I hope you guys enjoy the next video
that you're about to watch this is part
of my no Jes course we're building a
social media site with no Jes alright
guys don't miss on anything that happens
on coding phase com subscribe and click
the notification and you get notified
every time that I drop a new video or a
new content alright guys so now let's
get ready to start building the content
area so the content area is this section
here okay so first of all what we want
to do is break it down into sections
we're gonna have one that's gonna be
let's say the header and then on the
bottom we're gonna have the content okay
so let's come in let's get started we
already have two grey set up so we
should be good okay so if we come here
we can see that there's a great already
so there's different columns as you guys
can see okay so let's get started with
the content area so I'm gonna come down
here later on I probably you know change
this into multiple files but for now
since we're just working on this warm
view which is gonna be our main view
basically we're just gonna keep
everything in this main dot CSS and I'm
gonna come here put content area alright
save that okay cool now as far as the
HTML we got to start building this so
let me see you or yeah we got the left
menu we got that section now we have
this section of content area let me open
this up I close this up here so we don't
have all of that code taking our space
so we are ready to go okay let me open
this up a little bit
okay cool so let's look at the design
let's see what we have we have the
header we have the content area you got
a search box we have a couple of icons
so let's start with the search area
that's in the header okay I'm gonna say
div class search search header okay
search-header close this out okay do
another div of this div do like this
better
we're going to say search search box
you're going to put in input type text
this input type text is gonna be there
we gotta say that's fine we could just
leave it at that
oh yeah so we've got the search box we
got the input and then we have what we
have here which are the three icons okay
so let's do that now we're gonna say
this I like this better they've icon
section okay save that save this now
let's bring in those icons so the icons
are the notification Bell message and
user so we can go through here that'll
fall awesome and find those icons
okay
which is the Bell
I see if it's filled up yeah it's filled
up so we got the bell here okay
copy this from here copied pasted it
right here come back look for the other
one which is the message I think this
one okay I get this copy this paste it
right below let's see what's the other
one user
copy this and paste it here save that so
we have those three icons that's fine
now what we want to do here is we want
to basically give this there is a search
input field you gotta give it like a set
with okay so to do that we're gonna come
back to our CSS so we got the content
area
we got the search header and then it's
added such search-header we have search
box okay
now the search box is going to be a wave
of let's say for now let's say 600
pixels okay
we're gonna say inks out of this the
input and we'll say input type type text
so input type text is going to be with
100% save that okay that's fine now
we're gonna say search box okay put this
to be margin:0 auto okay let me check
something okay that's fine
all right so let me see min if I'm gonna
make sure much is that's like 600 let's
say 600 so that's fine we also want to
get the colors for this so to do this
I'm gonna use Photoshop you guys can use
Adobe color to upload it if you don't
have Photoshop I'm gonna show you right
now so I'm gonna do it through Photoshop
as easier but if you don't have any
subscription to Adobe what you could do
is you go to a color that adobe.com you
register for free okay after you
register for free to this website you
have an account you just take the image
and then you will basically just come
here highlight the colors that you want
see like this we want this we want this
what else we want we want that
putting order so take this one make sure
okay so that's the last one all right
see okay so when you click on it shows
you which ones are the ones that you're
highlighting
okay that was down one this was this one
so technically I want this one to be the
first one so I could no later on I want
let's say this to be the second one so
I'm gonna go like this put this here I'm
going to come here and put the blue take
this blue over here because we need that
for the gradient so you got that one we
need this one for this one
you
okay now what else okay so this one is
this one and there's another color that
we might need so this little red icon
okay cool so we got all the colors that
we need now all we have to do is click
Save and social media HD save okay now
you go to edit copy so here you could
just copy now the colors I could come
here and do something like this I can
say color later on we probably create
some variables I mean you know what
let's do it now so I'm gonna copy this
and I'm just gonna put this for now in
your new file call variables make sure
you put the underscore on the front so
it is variables that SCSS and we're
going to call this let's say text field
okay text field equals tool
now what else we have this one is this
one's actually the color of this so this
color is going to be the background of
the content box so let's see background
content background content let's see
paste that there save that like that
take this name it just red so it is like
the red that we're going to use for the
website okay let's see this is actually
the background for let's see so the
darkest spot yeah so this is like dark
gradient so I'm gonna put in darkside
darkside blue okay save that this one's
going to be the light side blue
okay the next thing that we're going to
do is we want to actually get a couple
of new colors too so let me click here
go back in here make sure that I get all
of the colors that I need so
we have this here I want to get
I want to get the color of the the fonts
gonna okay that's the color of the font
okay color of the header okay now we
want to get the color of the border
you
you
okay
and what was the other color
let me see
that's fine
that color and then the color of the
inside of the text field for the message
okay so there we go
so that's more colors that we need so
let me go here save it save this a
social media hd2 okay all right so this
was the color of the text P text okay H
text so it was like for headers okay
this was the border yeah
borders our border put a singular better
now this was bad
around I say search background ok so
search background paste that in there
and then we have this which is search
input background okay save that now what
we're gonna do is we're gonna import
this so I'm going to copy this and say
import variables save that and then it
imported it okay so to make sure we get
to see the changes in have half our
project react to it what we're gonna do
is we're gonna stop the the yarn run
watch and then run it again okay so now
it's watching the new files of variables
okay now it's actually looking for that
alright cool so first of all we're gonna
come here until our page let me see we
got groups where we at constant area
right okay so there's the content area
let's put this background save that okay
border none'
okay let me see that I have a
border-radius yes okay so come down here
we're gonna say border-radius
let's say four pixels that's a little
bit too much so let's say what already
is three
that's better okay I'm gonna say fun
size I say to Ram it's a bit too much so
maybe like a 1.2 rim 1.2 Ram okay that's
much better now the next thing that we
want to do yeah that's fine but let's
give this a little padding so padding
let's see 10 pixels all around or 5
pixels let's see 5 pixels top and bottom
and 15 pixels left and right so when you
type you start there okay
now the next thing that we want to do we
want to make sure that this thing ends
up right here on the side so let's do
this now we're gonna come in and get the
icon section okay
so we're gonna say outside of the search
box we're gonna say icon section we're
going to sing position we could do
position:absolute if we want to okay but
let's do position:relative for our
search header position:relative and the
reason why I'm doing this is because I
want this to be over here on the side
and I don't want to use flex boxes I
don't want to use grid I don't wanna use
none of that because I want to be able
to control it depending on the size of
it okay so let me see so we got this
search-header position:relative okay
we're gonna say top zero left the right
I'll say right zero okay there you go
so we got it there on the side as you
can see now the next thing that we want
to do is
see I want to make sure I know after I
hit a certain certain size we're gonna
change the size of this okay so let me
see we have this here let's bring this
down make this a little bit bigger also
to put some padding around the
search-header
so we're gonna say padding say 20 pixels
to start with see if that's what we want
that's a little bit too much let's say
15 it's a little bit too much 10 pixels
Tempe yeah 10 pixels nothing that's fine
even though this is a little bit smaller
I don't want it to be that small you see
like that's like the most the biggest
size that I could get but I don't really
want it like that
I don't want it that small like we're
using this as a reference but it's not
really exactly the same sizes okay so
next thing that we want to do we want to
come here where is this icon section
okay so icon section we're gonna say top
zero top zero and then we're going to
say okay so top zero nine zero well
right sorry yes and Knight is right
that's R so we want this to actually be
over here so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to say top 25 pixels
it's a little bit too much we want this
to be the icons a little bit bigger than
that so we're gonna say font size 1.2 a
ram ok the size is fine there now we're
gonna say 15 pixels ok and there you go
so now it's centered now the next thing
that we want we basically want to space
this out so we're gonna say let me look
at the icons so we're gonna sit like
this and think and any I under it we
want it to be padding:0 on top but let's
say 7 pixels left or right it's a little
bit too much let's bring this down to 2
okay color if the icon should be the
same color as a belief the text so they
both have the same same colors so let me
go into that get those variables put
this text field
so is to make it easier because we're
not gonna use this as a text field we're
just gonna take this from here and do
like this
may
not the text field but the paragraph so
still 79 79 79 I know you probably think
a man that's taking a while but that's
how it is if you want something nice and
beautiful and to look right you have to
take your time with it you can't really
rush it you know so let me see what else
what's the size in this thing so let's
look from there to there so there's like
1,400 how much I put how much whiff I
put on this thing this AB container so I
put maybe a 14 yeah maybe I 14 is better
so change that to 1400 so max with 1400
pixels yeah that looks good
that's I'm happy with that sighs okay
and everything is in the right place
okay cool now next thing that we want to
do we want to make sure we put in a box
shadow under this okay because that's
what's gonna give me the difference you
see like how we have here so I'm gonna
search for box shadow generator okay
we're gonna use this one CSS Matic
okay we're gonna put in the zero so zero
to the left or a zero top and bottom for
now I don't want nothing spread I just
want to look at the side
Missy huh
Klee now like that yeah
okay so zero there this is just so I can
see how far I want this to be so I want
this to be like two three pixels or one
pixel and then
Oh
but this as 0 then the blurred
you
you
Oh
you
you
because I want this to be just at the
bottom I don't really want this to be
showing to left or right so it's like we
have to do it in a way that is going to
look good okay
perfecting it okay
put this at one opacity of one
you
you
you
let me try this let me see how that
looks
copy it is and then now come here to the
header section or search-header
add that there okay and let's see how
that looks not that bad
but it's not really what we want let me
go back to the generator it's not really
what we want so
there's a zero
you
what does that zero okay let's see hold
on
you
you
you
you
copy this see you try this out
you know sometimes is it's all about
trial and error you see what we have in
here like this is exactly why don't want
it to happen
so to do this what I'm going to do is
I'm gonna put in overflow:hidden okay so
I'm gonna put on the content area
overflow:hidden okay we don't want this
going outside
you got what I'm doing see we just want
this to be inside of this area right
there that's it anything above that or
to the side we don't want to see that
okay now this is like a very very faint
box shadow so this mostess vertically
okay
you
copy this now let's paste it here see if
this one works
okay now
gotta make the color a little bit
lighter seems like to be fine so the cop
here pace this here
and there we go Wow
so so we got it now that's exactly what
I want like it's a very faint shadow you
don't want it to be like you know
showing too much get what I'm saying
okay
now also tool to the icons let's say the
search box where is it this icon section
so the icon section we're gonna save
padding right oops
padding right say 15 pixels or we could
have literally just say yeah let's just
keep it like that padding right 15
pixels
okay
and yeah for now that's pretty much it
maybe we'll make it a little bit more
padding for the icons so let's say five
pixels it's a little bit better
all right so that part is it's done for
now let me see let me see something
okay because we also want to have that
little little notification there
okay so to do that what we're going to
do is we're going to create a new
element and you know what matter of fact
I'm gonna take all of these and put them
inside of dips so I don't like this div
div and copy this so this are the CSS
tricks kids this is how you get things
done okay that's how you build a solid
website that people be like damn how he
built that it's just it takes time but
at the end of the day it just makes
everything you know way much better okay
now how long I'm gonna do some changes
cuz we change the order of things we're
gonna say and div say
display:inline-block okay so now we're
doing the same thing that we did but the
only difference is that now I can come
here and put in another elements add of
this so I can say no D for notifications
let's say comments let's say user okay
so here what I'm going to do is I'm
gonna say instead of comments I'm gonna
create another element which is gonna be
Dave let's see know the number what was
he was a hearing comments and now it was
in notification so
okay paced out there and I'm gonna put
the number three okay so we're gonna say
here we're gonna put in no D and then no
D and nobody number which is the number
okay then I say background red which is
the color that we gain from the
variables that we saved okay and color
white obviously font size let's say
point six rim for now okay as you can
see there you go so we got this okay so
it's actually in the comments that's my
fault
so let's say comment number number or
you know why instead of doing because
most of these could have other
notifications so let's do this let's
change this around and instead of yeah
put an OD number but we don't actually
have to say comment or specifically
which div it is so let's just put a
nobody number okay and I'm gonna try
this out I'm gonna put it on every
single on every single icon so we can
make sure that it looks good on all of
them whenever we get notifications all
right so
this we're gonna say this number we're
gonna put it on all of these we're gonna
say position:relative ok
position:relative no position:absolute
and then this one we're gonna say
position:relative so we could keep
everything aside no that's opposite
human error
never forget human error kids okay so we
got this as you can see now now we good
now you're gonna see top zero all right
zero we're gonna see padding five pixels
all around I'm gonna see border one
pixel solid and then it's gonna be white
if you just put white okay there you go
okay so that's exactly what we want now
we're gonna say let's see write negative
ten pixels it's a little bit too much so
let's say negative five pixels okay I'm
gonna say border-radius
five pixels
all right so it needs to be tiny tiny
tiny so the way how how it is is
actually padding five pixels on the left
and right and let's say two pixels top
and bottom there you go you see now
thinks is coming up now things is
looking good okay now what we're gonna
do is we're gonna say top negative five
pixels even though I think that's a
little bit too much no I actually came
out pretty good okay so there you go so
we have our notifications let's see what
happens if we have double-digit number
so 13 13 13 save that see how that looks
that's fine that's more than fine to be
honest with you that's actually pretty
good
say somebody has triple digits I mean if
you have triple digits notifications
that means you never log in so that's on
you you going on saying so that's fine
to know okay cool so let's put this out
we're just gonna keep one of them for
now you're gonna say like this also -
we're gonna put in active so for it to
actually show it has to be active okay
so no D number all right I'm gonna say
this plea none now if it has the class
of active it's gonna say this plea block
save that okay so there you go so let's
say 13 okay so the only way that is
gonna show up is if there's a
notification there okay so everything's
good so far so I think we can finish
this this header part is done I'm gonna
see you guys in the next video bye guys
this video is brought to you by viewers
like you and people that support our
website coding phase comm go check it
out over 20 courses in there that's
gonna guide you to become a developer
