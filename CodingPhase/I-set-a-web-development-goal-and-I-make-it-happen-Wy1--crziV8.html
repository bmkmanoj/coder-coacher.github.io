chintuji already know Superboy joke back
out it again man coding face calm and I
got so much good news right now man so
much good news it's not even funny man
like I'm just excited man I feel like my
life is is going like a thousand times
up man like every day I don't know why
it's like I feel like I'm going up every
single day man like you know channels
doing great you know I got my website
going amazing
today was the the first official day
that I have my course released on udemy
I'm gonna put the link below for you
guys pretty much I'm just excited man
you know I'm really excited because you
know five years ago
let me tell you like this five years ago
I was watching a couple of courses on
udemy man and I was like man I just
wanna I just want to get in the game man
I wanna one day be as good as you know
this instructors I want to be able to
teach this right and that's when I was
like you know what that's what I know
I'm good that's what I know that I've
made it that's what I know I've learned
a lot I've learned enough right to have
my course on udemy and actually be proud
of it right and it's just my first
course man I feel like yes I can
probably do better I come of course like
it's your first course it's like you
know like when our artist creates their
first album you know or the first time
that they go to a studio on the record
side they feel a certain way they're
like man this is my first time man I'm
just getting our feet wet right but from
the response that I've been getting from
everybody that's taking the course on my
website I know you to me is gonna be
pretty great you know
it's going to do pretty good and I'm
just excited I'm excited about it
because you know now I can compete with
the people who I want to compete you
know what I mean I can go in there and
really start going hard you know it's my
first course it's on udemy now learn
HTML CSS alright so we here now we're
here now kids so now you know next
course is going to go online it's going
to be future proof JavaScript then from
there we're going to jump to you know
the laravel course you're going to get
that out I'm planning on giving out a
free course on hyper app I just finished
talking to you know one of the creators
well the creator of hyper at the author
of it in this cage or man super amazing
um the fact also - he lives in Japan and
he's also another life - you know
killing the game right now like how you
killing the game in Japan you know what
I really like is the difference if you
kill it here in the United States
because here it's easier to you know
know English and just pretty much like
do your thing here like it's not that
bad but you are not in a completely
different culture in a completely
different country and you're killing it
right so we're going to do an interview
with him pretty soon right now we're
scheduling everything out because you
know I left here in New York he lives in
Japan but it's really good because at
the same time it's like I want to give
you guys an exposure to a really great
framework and you know it's your choice
if you want to learn it I'm going to
teach it to you guys because in reality
guys it's a really damn good framework
right it's pretty easy to learn super
simple um if you know HTML GFX I said
come on like you know how to do that
right you know the basics of objects
right and JavaScript that's it you good
after that you go you can start creating
components right in this one kilobyte
man so I'm very excited about those
those two things man is in 2003 Tori's I
got my website doing amazing I got the
YouTube doing amazing um today we
released the first course on udemy that
means we we here to compete with the
beep the big boys right the big boys
that's huh I don't want the little kids
and I'm talking about the big boys the
big boys man you know the big guys doing
it up and you to me that's where I'm
trying to get at and I'm excited about
that in love cause getting in touch with
the creator of hyper app because do it
is super humble super chill you know
unlike other peoples which I mention
they're not making you know live in a
bubble but uh this dude is a super
humble man like super chill man like you
know always nothing but the best for
them they're killing it with hyper app
it's just legit guys you know it's not
hype it's like not just saying no pun
intended if no there's no hype behind it
it's just it's hot and it is
good so good framework very stable and
listen Elm is one of the best
programming languages out there like the
new ones are coming out but it's very
difficult so the fact that one of these
guys they came in and took a lot of
ideas of elm and just say you know what
let's give those those ideas just on a
framework you know and give it back to
the people who want to use it with
javascript with a plain old JavaScript
you don't have to be a to learn a whole
bunch of different jargons and different
new words it's just do you know
JavaScript here keep going get it
running get your app out there all right
and it's just the beginning man I'm
telling you guys you know as what all
situations where you know you know
what's about to happen you know when
something is about to blow up really
really big but it's like you like the
first one like me and you right now
we're like the very first ones to find
out about this once the whole world has
a everybody starts talking about hi Brad
then bye
time you like oh man goddammit hi prac
one commercial mom and that's always
like right now you got to get in this
gym because it's like there's the time
kids ran so you can put your mark you
know there's a lot of people who are
creating stuff for react amber or UJS
angular but the community is so big that
when you create something it doesn't
even leave a dent on it right I'm all
about leaving that big footprint like
you know what we will see a first since
we the first ones creating this you get
that clout you know what I mean so for
you guys brainy developers if you want
to join a community that is going to
take you to the next level man I've been
working with hyper app is a great place
to get your feet wet in the industry
especially in the community you know
sign up try to be a contributor so you
know help out with the documentation
whatever it is try to get your name on
this thing man this plane is hot
man I'm telling you guys it's one of
those situations where once it blows up
all those peoples who were working on
that that framework that application
their name means something in the
industry and it's like now whenever you
go to a job whenever you go to you know
whatever interview ring you can say hey
man oh I was one of the first ones on on
you know hyper app or whatever framework
right or I'm the creator of this I'm the
period of this library I'm the creator
of this extension to hyper app whatever
it is right that's why I always try to
be one of the first ones to support
something one I know is about to blow up
same thing I told you guys about crystal
and crystal wings is coming in right now
so I would say guys get on that alright
um coming back to you know what I was
saying before man I'm just killing me
right now man like it's not even I don't
like talking you know me I'm not a
person who just likes to come in and
talk when I come here is for a
reason you know the past few months you
know there was like like the last
you you know two months right there's
like a little dark dark cloud but that's
gone right that's gone we don't care who
closed us we don't care if YouTube wants
to give us views we don't care if we are
going to give up you know cloud to other
people who cares there's like such a
small things to my life and it's like I
don't care so it's like now it's all
back to like positivity because a lot of
good coming back to me like it's
just more good thing after the other you
know just killing arena right so yeah
man and another thing to keep you guys
updated on what I've been up to so
remember I have that $2,000 computer
that's just catching dust on my desk
well I cleaned it up fixed it up I mean
it was fixed you just I don't touch I
don't like window so what I did was I
wiped the whole hard drive
I'm stole on Linux on it so I'm going to
be doing also you know tutorials for you
guys that like Linux alright those of
you guys who are on Windows guys I'm
being honest you guys at some point you
have to join the real world of
developers when you got either B or
Linux so you got to be a Mac look this
Windows thing is like guys I'm being
honest trust me once you taste that
clean water you're never going to go
back to that dirty well I swear to God
trust me for developer is so much easier
everything is there you just go on the
command line you're going to terminal
and you're good you have everything
there it's not like you got a hey I got
a find an executable file just some
dialog nah man do everything through a
terminal man like I'm being honest guys
it's like it's going to help you out so
much in you're going to get so
comfortable because in reality when you
work with a server when you're working
with your production websites like
there's no windows there's no user
interface where you go in there let's
double click on this nice
terminal guys you're going to have to do
everything to the terminal so pretty
much is like if you have everything
everything in a UNIX system right it's
just so much easier your brain is
working as if you're working on a life
website so I don't know that's my my
little quick advice for you guys but
