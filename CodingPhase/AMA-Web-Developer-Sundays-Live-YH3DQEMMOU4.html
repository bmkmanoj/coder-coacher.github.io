Franklin was good we hear you know man
I don't know what you guys may have you
guys checked out the new course from
cold steel my 484 music my 484 you know
coming through now I've been checking
out on this new course I got it like two
three weeks ago but I've been taking
down the law you know I'm not telling
anybody I was waiting until he released
it but yeah definitely gotta check it
out cold steel I'm gonna put it on my
description also because it's just like
jig he's killing it right now I swear
everything Steven Grider and cold steel
plate those are actually the best
instructors I wish they will teach me
everything like that's a lot of stuff
that I want to continue learning but I
really wish that you know they will
teach it cuz it's like they just just
nice with it they don't like you know
those are my inspirations those are the
guys that when I grow up I want to be
come just like them you know I mean I
want to become definitely like sniffing
Grider cold steel because they just know
how to break down courses they know how
to break down tutorials
now everybody can do that thing trust me
playin man let me see
yep I think that's the name of it I'm
gonna tell you right now I'm looking
into mine I'm logging into my you to me
right now trying to see exactly what's
the name cuz I took it I took it like
the past two three weeks I've been
taking it slowly you know like one chord
C in there will course my lunch break
and course like a little video on my
lunch break a little video you know a
couple of spots but like I would say
it's hard man he had the ultimate my
sequel bootcamp yeah it's legit
definitely worth the money yeah and my
mother's a teacher my father was a
teacher too so it's like I guess I have
an Emmy for some reason like I want to
teach other people you know I definitely
want to continue teachers but I
definitely know I need to improve more
in my way of how I teach things but it's
also that I it's not that I don't know
how to teach it's just I don't have the
time like I wish I had the time of like
just to sit in front of the computer and
be able to just like create a course so
people can learn from that it's hard and
I think after I finish this tutorial of
creating the you know the beeps tour
after I do that then I'm gonna create my
own course I'm gonna sell you to me and
I'm just gonna take you know even if it
takes me one week to do one video I'm
just got
because is that I wanted to do it plus I
feel like even here on you to me like
not hearing your name on YouTube right
here YouTube even if I create a course
here I'll create a course for free and
give it out to people I feel like not
everybody is gonna take it because not
everyone that's here on YouTube they're
here because they wanna you know
quote-unquote learn or they want to put
in the work a lot of people they want to
come here to my channel because they
like what they see they like what you
know the swag you like the personality
they like seeing what the hell I gotta
say for the day right but then if I come
here and I bust my ass into a tutorial
now everybody does it you know what I
mean so so it's like I'm not getting
nothing back in the sense of like being
rewarded like all our people is to be
like oh if they if I bust my ass and
create a course or create a tutorial I
wanna see that people actually took it
and they actually started doing the
courses or doing the tutorial at least
somewhere like you to me a plural site
what else um one of those websites right
if you create a course and you put it
there you know people are gonna take
that course meaning they paid money for
it so they gotta take it so it's like
for me I think that's where it's
rewarding it's like you know what I mean
it's like you create a you create a
course right it's like your college
professor you create a course and you
create like the best course that you can
for people right and then after you
create it only seven people show
up to class you know what I mean that it
is discouraging cuz I'm like oh man if
I'm only gonna you know have seven
people here you know why am I even
busting my ass doing tutorials you know
what I mean so I'm just gonna do like a
course like this month I'm gonna finish
this course that I'm doing the bait
store and then
they I don't think i'ma do tutorials or
more because it's just not working I'm
not getting nothing back here I'm not
talking about monetarily
it's just I'm putting in a lot of hours
into that and like I feel like nobody
here takes the tutorials you know the
mean so compared to the numbers of
subscribers that I have so it just tells
me people just want me to give them
advice you know see the little swag come
in here and that's fine you know so I'm
just gonna get what they want it's just
better I think it's better for for me to
just do it like that cuz at the end of
the day you know like I could get in
front of the camera give you an advice a
quick advice it takes me five minutes I
upload that and then I say I'm gone I
have the rest of my day to chill do
whatever I want but when I do tutorials
it takes a long time to do everything
like you gotta edit it you gotta plan it
out you gotta see what the hell you're
gonna build like you know so for that if
I'm gonna do that I might just do it for
you to me just because I want people
that to watch it you know so if people
go on it and they buy I know if I spend
$10 inside I'm gonna watch it I'm not
gonna just spend $2 to throw it away you
know okay placing a value is not so much
about you trying to make money but more
like ensuring that the buy is truly
ready to invest their effort into the
course that's my opinion yeah exactly
yeah I agree with you 100%
yeah
I think I think uh YouTube has you as a
bot now they think you're a bot Matt
because even me they sent me they sent
me like warnings whenever you post
anything like oh warning could be spam
okay you know but it's cool I appreciate
you know I appreciate the love you've
been out here showing support for the
kid and definitely promoting it you know
definitely appreciate it but here and
let me know if you guys got any
questions I'm here for you today I got
time today King okay let's see
have you seen the Google Drive where
there's five hundred gigabytes of par
ready
you didn't mean treehouse and
Pluralsight courses and no I have it and
I wouldn't even look at it to be honest
with you because I know how long it
takes to take to make those choices and
I just don't think it is worth it plus
it's like you getting knowledge there's
a big difference I think even music when
you pirate music it's not that bad to me
because music you're gonna listen to it
on the radio you're gonna listen to it
on youtube you're gonna listen to it in
other places but knowledge is I don't
know I feel iffy about that too doing
like torrents or doing anything like
that because that takes a long time it
takes a long time for somebody to create
those courses it takes a long time
sometimes even a lifetime for people you
know like I say somebody who is uh I
don't know a doctor got a doctorate of
like whatever right and he creates an
online online course and then he goes
and creates it and then somebody goes
and puts it on torrents net or torrents
that argue whatever it is right and then
now you're like what the hell man like
it's for me
I took me the whole life to get to the
point where I'm at now and be able to
create this course for you but now
so tourists you know so I think
to me I think that's messed up but me
I'm not that broke if you're that broke
and you like completely have no money on
you go ahead torrents but if you know
them where you go for $10 $20 $30 man
don't tolerate a book don't tolerate a
course because you're getting knowledge
this is something that you're gonna get
for the rest of your life so you
basically out here pirating it's just
not worth it you know bliss is not it's
not nice you know let me see let me see
what I would I would have what up let me
see
Sojin well I think that you should focus
on lifestyle videos are people with
your personal personality how the
industry is yeah I definitely agree with
you I'm probably gonna start doing that
more you know creating more more videos
about me creating more videos about my
said situations or or things that have
happened to me in the industry you know
people like that so I'm gonna give them
that let me see what else I love what I
would I would okay let me see I watched
the first two so far Neil yeah man I
appreciate it definitely appreciate it
you boy Neil said why didn't you create
this channel sooner Joe well to be
honest with you I hadn't no YouTube I
don't know you to which was very popular
it got millions of views I got up to
almost 100,000 subscribers is like 90
something thousand so it got up there
then I got rid of that channel because
it was more like music and stuff
that and beats and I was like you know
what I'm not making music anymore I'm
not doing I don't want to talk about
music anymore it bores me now so
basically if I wouldn't know everything
that I know now I would have started my
youtube youtube career like back then
backing and oh eight oh nine when I
started doing YouTube cuz right now my
channel would have been like like crazy
I would have been one of the first I
remember back in oh nine there was
nobody on this thing doing like
programming tutorials or programming
videos it was just
Eli the computer guy being a weirdo and
not like the guys just I just always
wonder why he always does the the same
videos in the basement that he could he
has a lot of money he could go out out
of his basement and go somewhere else
and to you know do a nice video camera
do so know do some nice shots you know
so plus he's one of the originators like
Eli luckily the guy's been around since
God knows when but yeah me I definitely
wish I would have started back then it
would have been hot if like if I would
have been able to start this YouTube
when I just started like my careers of
what developer so then people would have
been able to see my growth over the
years and see how how well I've been
doing a hard bad I was doing in the
beginning like you know that would have
been hot you know I wish I could have
been able to document that time Joe
question can we use your tutorial cold
painful projects yes go ahead use it let
me see
thank you for the sec open it just for
front-end oh yeah I mean right now if
you just using the front-end part you
just created on the front on coal pen
but once it comes to the back end and
laravel you're gonna have to you know
you're gonna have to do that on your
local computer what operating system do
you use I use o Mac Mac OS X so I think
it's called Sierra right now yep
straight up max man if you don't have a
Mac man and you co afford it you don't
know what the hell you doing man in this
world how much do you make hourly hourly
let's see let's do the math divided by
12 divided by 4 divided by 40 let's see
I think it's like right now sake forty
three forty forty three an hour it's not
bad and then with everything else that's
like my official from my official job 43
an hour just like
oh yeah who do you know I think that's
what I make and then from my other
businesses and online stuff if I was to
consider all those things I don't know
how much would that be
let me see C divided by 12 divide a by 4
divided by 40 62 so yeah so overall at
them you know at the end of the month
with everything that I do that is with
my job and related to what development
is about 62 an hour an average you know
so it's not bad I think it's not bad
that's not bad because you know I
remember those days when I was making
$12 an hour they were my first job when
I was making $7.25 an hour and even now
at 62 I still feel like the human time
the the time that a human has and gives
into any job it's worth way more than
that I feel one hour for a human life
should be at least $500 we look at
giving away your freedom giving away
your time to spend with your family
giving away your own personal time of
things to create things I think it
should be worth a 500 so I'm still not
getting paid enough because nobody's
gonna give me
this time the time that I spent in to
accompany the time that I spent even
here on YouTube like nobody's gonna give
me that time back you know what I mean
like you spend time and just things and
it's like who's gonna give you that time
back or what's that time that you gave
what you got out of it was it worth it
you know so I don't know all right let
me see what other questions you got have
aa party done notification squad unless
I must leave there should be a calming
and light for me within a minute my boy
Matt let me see what's the best way to
learn if you have a full-time job in
another five another field and full-time
family number one you have to talk to
your family and tell them like hey I
have to take some time off and you have
to give me this time because when you
have a family your family thinks oh he
goes to work full-time so when he comes
home that time is for us and sometimes
people don't understand that you need
time for yourself not only do you need
time to give too long to them but you
also need time for yourself because
you're not a robot you're not somebody
who's gonna come straight from work
spend time just with your family and you
like you don't have any other
aspirations or or goals to do in your
life besides just coming home and being
with your family so I think that is hard
you know I really think that it's hard
especially when you have a family and
you're trying to learn and you're trying
to do all of this stuff it becomes very
difficult but at the same time you gotta
have at least one day to two days of the
week where you say hey this time is for
me I have to do two to three hours for
me and then the long term is gonna be
for you guys to because you're gonna
have a better life I'm gonna be able to
provide better for you guys so you just
gotta talk to them you know because I
think the hardest part is
now you make in time the hardest part is
people understanding that you have to
make time for yourself to be able to
learn this stuff so yeah but I would
definitely say you to me for sure like
and not only because you to me you know
has helped me out but also because it's
just the only place where you will find
people have put in enough time to
explain things that in other places they
don't explain it as good as you to me or
they show you examples as good as unity
because everybody knows that this thing
costs a lot a lot of money back in the
days people pay a course $200 $300 of
course right when you look online like
those guys Tai Lopez and and all those
guys that they sell courses online or
they sell like you know quick seminars
and stuff like that those guys they make
a lot of money because those courses
cost like $200 five hundred thousand
dollars but what people get out of them
I'm not saying Tai Lopez but like you
know what's that guy's name Tom Robbins
or something like that
I forgot the guy's name he's like a
motivational speaker people pay like up
to five hundred dollars for a ticket
just to show up to one of his seminars
right one more now what do they get out
of that they give more than what they
spent into because if you go into a
seminar like that and that thing
motivates you and teaches you how to you
know double your profits or it teaches
you how to make money online or whatever
it is that the course is that's better
than anything else and I feel like a lot
of the courses are giving me like the
courses from cold steel and Stephen
Grider like those courses anywhere else
that wasn't udemy will cost you a whole
bunch of money
because their dad good it's not like you
know freaking Joe Schmoe decided to
create a a course it's like this
guy's really know their and then
they break it down for you in like dummy
talk in a way that anybody can
understand it so yeah udemy is the bus
I'm being honest
team treehouse is good for what it is
team trade house is almost the same
thing as free code camp they give you
the tools but you're the one that have
to bust your ass trying to figure out
how to put everything together now udemy
teaches you the certain courses of
course not everything to you to me but
certain courses on udemy teach you how
to put everything together how
everything works so you know that's on
you if you want to take it you know any
other questions let me know let me know
let me know Tony Robbins right I think
that's his name
goin or Jas from the back end if neither
than what would you advise already know
Jas I think nodejs is good I think
nodejs is is good for what it is is good
for people that already know JavaScript
and then you're like oh I know
JavaScript and I don't want to learn
another language then go no js' is
perfect but people who are back-end
developers they know no GS is not the
answer to things no js' has become very
popular because people who are doing the
front-end they basically are more
comfortable doing stuff with JavaScript
well if you're like a seasoned developer
the more that you learn you're gonna
realize that no js' is not the answer
no js' is great for a beginner but as
you learn more programming languages and
you start learning different data
structures and you start learning
MongoDB Mario to be no sequel like
reading TB or you start learning
freaking postgrads
like once you get to a certain level you
gonna realize like nodejs is it's fun
it's easy to get started
it has a great ecosystem but for the
back end I don't think it's the answer I
think there's a reason why companies you
know like Google you know they chose
Python or they chose people you know
switch from Ruby on Rails to to Java or
Scala like there's a big reason why they
did that and they didn't switch to no GS
you know so that's that's my answer to
it
how long did it did it take you to
become a confident o to become confident
in your programming skills well I would
say let me say hello um I would say like
two three years because for me like I
really respected this thing it wasn't
just like you know a lot of people are
getting interesting that I oh yeah oh I
could make money I could get it switch a
career and you know get something better
than what I'm doing here and that's
great but when I came into the state I
put a lot of respect to it you know so
what does that mean like when I came in
I probably say hey I'm a junior
developer because I was a junior
developer now people will say hey I'm a
full-stack
and you look at them and you're like
wait you just started six months ago
how are you a full-stack developer how
are you a web developer you don't have
the skills here you haven't gone through
the trenches you don't know what it
takes you a beer or web developer but
people just love giving themselves
titles it's like people who you know
they create it is like this is like
somebody comes in and it opens up a
lemonade stand and says hey I'm a CEO
CEO of lemonade lemonade's and
incorporated it's easy to just give
yourself a title but it's different you
you haven't put in that work your
company is not making money you know
what I mean you're making dollars is
that how can you
you call yourself CEO you're calling
yourself a boss when you're not making
that much money now that's the same
thing for web developers if you're a
junior developer it's fun to say hey I'm
still learning I'm still junior
developer and that's how it was for me
I didn't start going to two places over
like oh I'm a web developer I'm this
this and that
and telling people like how super
confident um you know because you have
to know know certain things you have to
know a lot of the you know programming
how how the internet works you gotta
know how you know HTTP requests work we
can't just be like hey I could build a
page on HTML CSS and I say you're a web
developer no you're still a junior
developer you know so for me I still
wasn't comfortable to say hey I'm a web
developer until three years and that's
the truth like I will apply for
positions but deep down inside of me I
know I wasn't ready yet so that's all on
you you know what I mean like at one
point you're gonna you're gonna realize
hey I'm I'm a good developer great I
know what I'm doing this and that
now I go into interviews like I don't
care like I don't go in there thinking
nervously like oh my god they gotta ask
me something that I don't know and it's
like I already been to everything I've
been through every type of situation
that anybody could put me and I've came
out okay I've came out good you know
I've been in companies where they were
like top of the top you know top level
work and I've been at the bottom of like
little small businesses and from here to
there all my work has always been good
and everybody loves it
nobody has ever talked about me
that I've I can't do my job you know so
now I walk around with that it's like I
walk around with a cake or like I'm good
you know I was like no matter what type
of job it is I'm not nervous about it
because I already know the front end and
I know the back end and I got to the
point where I could go in and learn any
programming language you put in front of
me because every programming language is
the same thing the only difference is a
syntax so yeah I will say like three
years is how long it took me to be
comfortable to where I'm at now
now the HTTP side thinks I was saying it
hit me at different jobs different
situations where you know I had to
create more complex components right and
then you're like oh man I don't read all
I've been doing was the front-end
meaning that HTML CSS and you know some
JavaScript but now really connecting to
the backend that much you know because
you could just fall into a loop of just
doing design work which is just HTML CSS
JavaScript right and you never get out
of that zone that's why I try to tell a
lot of people here join and join the
rocky stack tutorials
and start watching them because that's
gonna get you out of that zone of just
being a regular developer like the guys
are software engineers they look down on
web developers because now a lot of them
and a lot of web developers know all
they don't know about computer science
they don't know about languages outside
of the web now a guy that does something
like C sharp or well does like you know
C Objective C or or it does Java other
languages is easier for him because he's
already hit hit the trenches he's like
he's working languages are real
low-level so when it comes to the web is
different you know so for me it
definitely hit me like halfway through
of like learning something working on a
project and I was like man I really do
look not much about programming like I
know the web well I don't know
programming and then I was like hmm I
gotta step my game up and of course you
got to do some research you got to look
out online you know so and also to like
learn from their friend your mistakes in
also don't be scared to ask questions
that's it
all right any other questions let me
know let me know kids I'm in here let me
see what this kid says I think new
developers can get a job with PHP larva
or angular one outside of New York and
Silicon Valley yeah of course you know
that's all you really need to be honest
with you and one of the reasons why I
always bring up PHP it's because if you
don't live from the major cities which
most of you guys don't like a lot of the
people that are you to that watching
things day you're in you guys damn well
know that you don't live in the main
cities meaning like New York LA San
Francisco Dallas was another word
Colorado like if you don't live in those
cities like or even Georgia like Atlanta
Georgia
like you know them well in your area
they're not talking about nodejs they're
not talking about Ruby on Rails what
they might be talking about a c-sharp in
PHP so I would sell people it's an
easier way to get into a PHP job then
you getting into a c-sharp and that's it
so yeah how do I feel about Ruby on
Rails Ruby on Rails is it's amazing is
pretty much every every framework out
there copies Ruby on Rails I think for
you to be a great web developer you have
to go through Ruby on Rails to me I
think there's no other MVC framework out
there better than Ruby on Rails I mean I
think I don't know if Ruby or rails
created it but Ruby on Rails basically
show people what you can do with a
great MVC so yeah I think everybody
should learn it that should be like one
of those things Ruby on Rails is like
HTML to what developers if you haven't
learned it if you still haven't played
around with it I don't know what the
hell you're doing with your life because
this thing is is pretty much like an
essential thing so let me see it's such
because a lot of my peers in university
say Oh PHP is there don't learn it and I
see a lot of PHP WordPress mariage
apples so I'm just like what yeah
Mohamed this is the thing a lot of
people this I'm gonna go back to to the
regular thing man a lot of people the
goal and aim for the sky meaning they
aim for the sky they'd be like hey I
wanna get a job as an OGS developer the
aim for the sky as was another cool
technology Gold developer right they
want to become gold developers they aim
for the sky they want to become a Python
developer right but the reality of
things is you might not get those job so
why are you gonna do you're gonna stay
in your house waiting for you to get
that dream job of hey I want to become a
Python developer know like those jobs
don't come around easily those jobs take
you gotta be like an expert because the
companies I usually use those languages
they looking for experts they're not
looking for just a regular guys or just
they're not looking for just you know
developers code they're looking for
experts people who have been in an
industry for years like let's be honest
you can't compare yourself with somebody
who has like a doctorate in like you
know mathematics or has I got you know a
master's in engineering and then for
whatever reason
he couldn't find a job in engineering
and now he has to step down and say hey
I'm gonna apply to become a Python
developer so what companies are gonna do
they're gonna give it to you oh but you
need to Vella / or they gonna give it to
the guy who has a master's a doctorate
in freaking mathematics or engineering
whatever it is right they're gonna give
it to that guy that old guy who is like
you know he's been doing it for 15 years
giving he been coding sings Lisp or
whatever you know they're gonna give it
to that guy so you have to be realistic
do you wanna have a job tomorrow or do
you want to wait months looking for a
job
me personally I'd rather find a job
tomorrow and then keep on applying for
that dream job until they call me up
once they call me up for a dream job I'm
there and then I leave this job well at
least I got money in my pocket I could
eat I could take out my girlfriend or
whatever the hell I want so I think
that's that's another an advice that I
can give you guys like a real advice and
you know what talking about that that's
a really good topic for me to make a
video on you know so I'm gonna add that
to my list because I gotta make a topic
a video on that topic right cuz let me
just write this down sorry guys this is
a really good good topic you know people
go and they want to aim for the sky and
sometimes you don't reach that we just
have to be realistic you know sometimes
you just don't make it somehow you don't
make the cause somehow in the area where
you live this tolerance competition and
you don't make it to that dream job and
then now you basically you put all your
marbles into that little bag you
basically put all your eggs into the
same
asking you know oh yeah I was you know
those people who are out there and that
I man I freaking went on my life what I
wanted to do is just work for NASA and
it's like they study all this you know
all these years and all this and
then they never applied to anything else
and then when NASA never calls them up
they depressed and I oh man I
gave away so many years of my life I did
so much and nothing ever came back
to me I never got hired and it's like
man you could have been doing something
else you could have been working
somewhere else cuz you're pretty smart
you just didn't get to go into NASA or
NASA didn't call you up or you don't
have to write connections or you just
send it to the right place or whatever
it is very good oh man so probably gonna
make a video on that tomorrow
that thing is a very important topic let
me see Emma see what else any other
question is Portland Seattle good I
heard see I was pretty good I heard you
know I think Microsoft Office over there
so there's a lot of companies that you
know they want to live close to
Microsoft and you know so whatever
there's a big company like Microsoft
Google you know the other smaller
companies startups they're always gonna
go around them so Seattle is definitely
good
Yosi a thank you for for the donation
man I really really appreciate it
airhead night you know find out is what
is the CA I think that that's like five
dollars if I Canadian dollars oh
yes we made it
getting Canada money man thanks for the
support man you know now now everyone
gets gets to support the channel uh my
boy big boy big hey you know he was one
of the first ones to actually to support
the channel big coat and to this day I'm
super grateful because he started the
trend so yeah man
let me see I'm trying to really see what
other other questions you guys have
masae before see any other questions
okay any of the what developers you know
have other related skills like digital
marketing or they only concentrate on
web development um
there's some people who are they only do
that like you know list for big code um
there's some people that they only focus
on web development and sometimes it's
really good because if you only focus on
one thing then you could become a master
of that in one sense that's good but at
the same time I feel like everybody who
is a web developer dear they have a side
where we are all creative people meaning
like we like to create new things we
like to come up with ideas and and come
up with something cool so that's why we
become what developers or programmers
whatever you want to call us so I think
a lot of people think to other things
like you know I know some people that
are musicians some people who are
entrepreneurs they they do they sell
things like on Etsy they what else what
else I have a friend who was a artist he
sells paintings like people have
multiple skills
I feel like web development and
programming in general it's like a way
to create something new out of your mind
out of your brain through programming
right but most of us do other things
there's like me I feel like I have other
things that I like to do I just don't
like to call 24/7 I think for the past
year I've been calling constantly and
that's why I'm trying to walk away from
me not that I want to stop coding but I
also want to do other things like I want
to teach I want to teach you I want to
teach better so this all the process
there's one one of the reasons why I
started this channel tool because it's
like I wanna
more learn how to break things down in
an easier way for people to understand
it without me having to be coding for
company like I don't think I see myself
coding for another company after the one
that I'm in now I don't think I'm gonna
work for another company it's gonna be
very hard for me to work for another
company because I just don't want to you
know like I already gave five years into
this as you know as a developer in the
industry I think now is ready I'm ready
to start another phase in my life of
either creating my own business or doing
something else you know so I think a lot
of people do other stuff they're not
just doing what develop me so yeah even
like one of my roommates he does
affiliate marketing so he makes money
for affiliate marketing and he's doing
pretty well so I think people you know
they they do coding and then they do
other stuff you know
you
yeah I mean you can learn look I would
say that I always tell people learn PHP
as a that's like a tool that you must
have under under your belt like you have
to have that word you like it or not at
one point you're gonna have to deal with
PHP if you're gonna be dealing with web
development at one point you're going to
have to deal with PHP so yes you have to
learn it then from there if you want to
learn something on your own time learn
go now
are there a lot of jobs for go no well
will they hire you as a junior developer
probably not they're looking for experts
they're looking for guys who are like
let's say a guy who who's been coding
ten years in PHP and now he learns gold
golang or he learns crystal lang or
whatever or whatever language out there
right but he has ten years behind him of
dealing with web servers and web
development and you know HTTP request is
and you know like he knows the whole
stack so now using nodejs to analogous
now using go is he is like you know it's
like riding a bike it's a different
language but is just he knows what the
hell's going on so would they hire you
or that guy that's why I tell people you
know yes
start a coding bootcamp where you give
up capes at the end all right we'll see
ya hey brother I hope everything's good
with you in your life I have a few
questions about my approach I reasoning
quit my job and I'm gonna spend the next
six months fully diving into into it all
nice not nice that you quit job by nice
that you're going hard okay one question
only you do personal projects but they
don't mean anything to employers how do
you actually get professional experience
they look for professional experience
they look forward without freelancing
thanks for your advice airhead knife
what I will say is you have to create
real-life projects like I always tell
you guys that's why I'm building this
big store a tutorial where all of you
guys can actually use that for your
portfolio to show that hey I built this
real life
website even though it's not a company
but it has all the things that you know
a company will have like you know
payments a payment gateway
you know back-end database is user
authentication when you go to a job
interview show them that you have all of
those skills it doesn't matter if if
it's a personal project it shows that
you can do the job what people have a
problem with is when people show up to a
job interview and they like hey um I
have a github account you wanna check
out my code people are going to look at
you like you're crazy you know what I
mean like a lot of people do this most
developers here on this channel too
because they send me portfolios they
sent me portfolios that don't have real
projects and it doesn't have to be a
client but I mean real project I mean a
real business is real websites that a
business situation can have
like you know lesson example you have a
small business look around your map
right so I could go right now and search
Ridgewood New York right Richmond New
York that's my hometown right I could go
here into math and search business let
me see
okay maybe that's not a good idea I'm
seeing okay cool
so this multiple businesses around my
neighborhood right so I could come here
and choose any of these right I choose
five businesses for this right and
create real websites folder so I come
here and say hey business plus what the
hell is this okay rich with taxes calm
you see this website this website looks
like you could make a better
website than this right so what were you
doing you will come here look at this
website take their information take
their content take their titles take
their numbers take everything create
another website for them right and put
it into your portfolio with their
information their contact all the
information what you know whatever come
here and go and say hey black and gold
barbershop you know they don't have a
website created for a viola world I was
over you look somebody the
used to have a website in the low state
so create a website for this barber shop
come here and be like okay what else
what other place well you probably you
guys probably can't see on the screen I
just realized sorry but go on your map
go on Google Maps look around your
neighborhood search businesses or
business and then from there find all
the business around there choose five
businesses and create websites for them
that's the best approach that you can do
like that you will build real life
websites you don't need a client you
don't need a company to hire you to for
you to have real websites you still need
level developers for your website yes I
still need level developers send me an
email if you'll arable developer and you
want to work on : face comm trust me
listen if you help me out I will throw
you some money plus at the same time I
will also you know help you out with
whatever you need or you know a
recommendation anything that you might
need because I I need other developers
to help me out build this project is
it's too big for myself to create
everything you know and create YouTube
and do all this stuff so if you want to
help out let me know all right Adrian
semia email this coding face at
gmail.com how long will it take to feel
comfortable with JavaScript I will say
six months six months you can be pretty
dangerous in a year of doing javascript
beer you're pretty good already
so what is a good database language
sequel it's the number one database how
management system so the best one is my
sequel so on everybody wants to learn
sequel because every company has a
sequel server somehow all right let me
see makes a lot of sense
thanks for keeping one hundred feels
good I can bring about a video topic
yeah let me see thanks for being G give
me the motivation resources to get there
of course self different self discipline
and it's necessary but yeah let me see
ah loving the Rockies tag in the HTML
Javascript series you have you you have
using it
keep them coming yes definitely I'm glad
somebody's enjoying a man I feel like
you know I feel like nobody's taking
them you know I get a lot of use I get
thousands of views on my videos but like
I said I told you guys go to coding
phase no J is not changing sorry I got
so many accounts go to github.com slash
coding face.com so coding phase D ot
CLM comm right and pretty much if you
see the project that says what developer
start okay give it a star if you started
any of the tutorials just so I know who
actually is using the videos for what is
for who are actually you doing the
tutorials who are actually getting
something out of it because I feel you
know I'll be honest I even like this
this week I created all this courses or
this tutorials and I'm like man I'm
excited I'm thinking I'm right okay I'm
gonna get a lot of comments on people
telling me older the tutorials are hot
they enjoying it and
the comments that I'm getting you know
not to put Matt on the spot because he
left a comment but a lot of other people
 left comments that have nothing
to do with the tutorial at all it's like
if you let me finish the tutorial you
will see what happens tomorrow a new vid
or new video drops which is explaining
what happens and why I chose that but
then I'm getting those comments on
getting comments of people having a long
discussion about a markup language and
I'm like this isn't what the
video is about so it is very
discouraging because I go here and I
spent a lot of hours on doing this
tutorials and on top of that I don't
know who's actually doing the tutorials
so if out of the 3,000 people for know I
think now we got what 5,000 I think yeah
5,000 5,000 people if I have 500 people
who do the tutorials I'm happy if I only
have freaking 50 people doing the
tutorials I'm not gonna be happy because
I'm putting in a lot of work and a lot
of time into this and people are not
doing the tutorials you know and why the
hell would I want to be doing that you
know spending so much time on it if
nobody's gonna do it so you know so when
I get a comment or somebody says hey I'm
enjoying the tutorials
it is definitely uplifting um because
you know like I'm this close to not
doing any more tutorials at all because
I really feel like people are not
getting what they're supposed to out of
me um people are not learning what they
need to learn artery people judging the
tutorials and comparing it to other
people's tutorials when they're
completely different
I wish I could be like traversing media
or what's this guy's name
Derek banana bananas whatever where you
know what they do they have one screen
here and then they have the code here so
all the code that they do in they
already rewrote it they are really
rolling and then what they're doing is
copy and paste from what's here to here
I don't do that I actually come in just
freestyle a tutorial I have an idea I
created for you and actually show you
what's the process of being a developer
not just copying paste copy and paste
copy and paste but what's the process of
being a developer I showing you how do
you make mistakes or how little mistakes
come up while you're coding and how to
fix them so because I wanted to give
like a more realistic approach cuz I
know damn well when you guys code none
of you guys called perfect when meaning
when I say perfect meaning is you don't
revise your code you don't come back to
it and fix a little line here and there
or you say hey I'm gonna use a different
tag for this so I actually wanted to
create tutorials that were more
realistic to see different situations
but instead of people taking it
for what it is people take it as if I
don't know how to code or some and
I'm like why the am i explaining
myself to people you know it's like the
other day things started in the morning
I was still telling people at 5
o'clock
you know from not from like 9:00 in the
morning where I dropped the video till 5
o'clock in the afternoon still talking
about this this navigation
explaining to people what the hell I'm
trying to show them you know so I was
just like why the am I even
spending an hour doing this tutorials
breaking it down to people and then
people don't understand that there's
gotta be other parts to the videos and
I'm creating something completely
different
and from what they're used to they're
used to seeing somebody coming here copy
and paste the code I'm not doing that
I'm coming in and giving you the results
of certain things of like oh we're stuck
here we're going to Google this we're
going to find out how to search for it
we're going to find out where to get the
resources for flex boxes we're going to
figure out how to look at the
documentation for react those are the
things that are trying to show people
because what development is not about
writing perfect code programming is not
about writing perfect code programming
is about problem solving if you think
that you're going to go into a job and
find the perfect solution right away it
doesn't work like that so that's what I
want to give people a sense of what's
going on in the industry so even with my
tutorials I'm showing them in a way
where it's like there's gotta be
mistakes mistakes intentionally done
because a video that's perfect can now
it's not realistic it shows that you
copy and paste when I look at Derek when
I wasn't Derek banana there Venice or
whatever I could literally see when he
goes like this he moves to the side
press command-c comes back and looks
either pasty or he's already changing
the chana dal the michaelis changing the
other screen on the side he doesn't call
perfect it's just it's already written
for him he already hasn't prepared and
it's the same thing as traversing media
sometimes he makes a mistake but now if
you look at all his new videos all his
tutorials are very well prepared and why
are they well very well prepared because
he doesn't work a full-time job as a web
developer his full-time job is YouTube
his full-time job is creating courses
for you to me so of course there's gonna
be a different type of style but there
type of way of how he creates the core
since they're from you know somebody
that comes to my channel I'm giving you
a realistic view of how it is what I
haven't to sugarcoat it and be like hey
I'm copying Facebook know so yeah sorry
I won't just went into a rant because it
does get me pissed always like today a
day another four hours a day um five
videos for the rest of the week which
are tutorials and I wouldn't be
surprised if somebody say some dumb
and just gonna piss me the
off because it's like man let the
 tutorial finish or just watch
this tutorial if you don't like it cool
but just watch the tutorial man
you know but yeah man so that's the
whole thing sorry I went into a rant but
it's just it is annoying you know you
come here you spend time doing tutorials
and it's like number one that everybody
here wants to do the work because people
just want to watch something is cool you
you know every time you want to watch
tutorials because even though the big
guys will have fifty thousand ten
thousand subscribers when they drop a
tutorial they barely get four hundred
views on it or they're barely getting
500 views thousand views on it it takes
them a whole year to you know get
together ten thousand views so on one
tutorial so you know what I mean so I
understand not a lot of people want to
do the work but at the same time it's
like ah man you know it feels good when
somebody comes in be like yo I like the
tutorials or I'm actually doing them I
don't care if nobody likes them I just
wish people would just do them like
trust me like you're gonna learn
something because a lot of you guys are
are doing free cocaine which also burns
my blood where is like I'm giving you
something ten thousand times better than
free cocaine but you rather ghost man
hours and hours and hours of free
cocaine which is not real it's not real
situations it's not real projects it's
not real that you can show off to
people and be like hey this is what I
created this is the website that I
created I create a big store are
creating uh you know an online store I
created a restaurant I created a real
estate I created something real that
people will say oh there's a real
project people are spending too much
time on free cocaine which is literally
a waste of time guys I'm being honest
with you guys you're spending time into
something that it just is a mindless
programming you're not gonna get nothing
out of it at the end I'm being honest
because a lot of you guys is gonna
finish freako camp and you're not gonna
know how to build a website after it
it's that simple
you know so but whatever
sorry going to rent you know me I go
into a quick rant rattling all right
more coming when I live with junior said
I mean away when I'm an okay cool
I'm taking Steve from gratis react
native course have you tried it
yes I tried it it's pretty cool I like
that but I really noticed that I'm not
I'm not a mobile developer like I don't
like mole developer like I'm not really
a fan like I like the web better
yeah airhead you already know thank you
man for sure
thanks for let me see another coding
face yes sir we in here
I do web development but also to machine
learning on the side which includes math
also breakdancing yes sir nice does your
company know about your channel I told
them that that's all one person which is
my coworker the other developer that
works with me um basically I saw him
about it he likes and he likes the idea
of it fun on PHP was a good starter
project hmm like I said how you know
create a realistic creating realistic
with multiple listings that you can
filter through it by price they can
filter through it by location by state
do it like that that's a pretty good
project that you could build this is
gonna do yet to have a web developer
background before going into UX UI by
the way I'm a fellow New Yorker leathers
in Dallas Texas New Yor stand up what up
Casey can't see I mean it's not hurt you
if you want to join basically become a
UX UI developer it's mostly design but
design in and also to preparation and
research so it's not gonna hurt you
knowing web development because then now
you could actually talk to the what
developers while you tell them hey
there's the best experience a user can
have so yeah it's not gonna hurt you
trust me absolutely have been trying to
sell sell flash for almost three years
with no luck haven't gotten anywhere
then I saw you to me that's a
five-minute ball five of them
yeah Derek I think if you will take the
courses you're gonna be golden like I'm
being honest how long did it take you to
be conferring with JavaScript it's a
beast like I said after six months you
should be good I will say only go hard
if you like it otherwise you're gonna
have to sell to go hella hard cuz you
hate it yeah it's true
what's up k meadow where do I honestly
it is when I approached I didn't have
discipline of it didn't commit watching
Gary made me self aware yeah I love Gary
Vee - you know I wish I had like a
camera following me 24/7 like Gary Vee
like I would be dropping like major gems
like sometimes I say cool here but
I say better when I'm not like in
front of the camera when it's just like
me
talking to my friends I'm told it to my
girlfriend talking to somebody else it's
like y'all I hit on with the gems no but
yeah the missing learning back in
language using in your town here the
Houston area challenge is go to Andy
calm yes sir
let me see what else missing
please keep doing the tutorials yeah I
hope you people people like you man
you are right freak oh yeah freak Oh
camp is not good man I'm telling people
to do some civil service
yes man to all five projects trust me
because I will point you gotta think
about it like this man like you you're
ready very talented you already been
doing this for a while but at one point
you're gonna want to get paid for this
like right now you're young you're in
college and school you're doing your
thing but at one point you're gonna want
to say hey I want to get paid money for
this I want to start applying for jobs
so you want to have real projects to be
able to go to interviews and be prepared
so yeah listen guys um the APM install
you don't have to do it you don't have
to install the packages that I give you
from you know for Adam at all you don't
need it you can literally install it
manually by looking at the names of the
packages and searching it through the
package install go to settings or
preferences on Adam and then search for
packages and then go to install and then
from there from install you look at the
package I think our cold day was it
something package txt look inside that
file search the names that are there and
install the manuals for some reason on
Windows which is what I say Windows is a
piece of um people have a difficult
time so then they're not doing the
tutorials just you don't need them the
pattern is if you can install the
Manatee cool if you can't you don't
hassle alright Joey just father you
don't get all gonna head up to the
tories man don't quote don't quit though
ya know I'm not saying I don't know I
don't want to quit you know
but at the same time also I don't want
to spend too much time or something
that's not gonna that's not gonna
nobody's gonna watch you know what I
mean like when I do those videos where I
come in give you guys a quick advice
that takes me five minutes ten minutes
to do when I do it tutorial it takes me
an hour to do a video takes an hour to
like rerecord it sometimes I do it all
over again gotta fix some things uh you
know whatever it is so it takes time
which you know at some point I'm not
gonna do no more tutorials because this
rather I wanna have an audience that
does the tutorials you know what I mean
like if I create something if I create
something like I want people to do it
you know from busting my ass for it I
want people to do it first job
project should I give two bucks on my
last five ones I suggest you start
changing for five charging for tutorials
I am really ready to pay if necessary
yeah I mean that's why I didn't want to
do I didn't want to be like one of those
guys who come here Oh guys hey guys I
just created a course on on you to me
and go by over there I didn't wanna do
that I don't and people know it here
I've been here for like six months
that's not what I came here for but at
the end of the day I just want to have
an audience that really does the
tutorial the tutorials like here on
YouTube I know people want to see me
come talk which I come have fun but the
same time when it comes to tutorial if
I'm gonna do an hour two hours in every
video I want people to do it cuz that's
what my payoff is not it's not the money
it's not gonna pay me off the reviews is
was gonna get me excited to do more
videos and more stuff you know like me
watching my reviews go up or go down
like on udemy or any other service
that's out there that that lets you have
courses online that's where I'm gonna go
next you know like I wanna have I'm
gonna do all my advice videos here but
then at some point after the summer I'm
just gonna do tutorial somewhere else
cuz here you to me that's not that many
people who do lo tutorials so I was like
I'm busting my ass for no reason you
know it sucks for that you know the few
of you guys who actually watch them and
see them it sucks cuz it's like I know
you guys really watch them but then it's
like man I wanna have a bigger audience
that watch tutorials you know like if
I'm gonna create something like right
now if I go and create a file for
example not that I'm gonna do this but
if I also create like a prank video I
will do it on you
- I'm not gonna do it on abc.com or
whatever because they're not they're not
therefore for pranks and they're not
there for like that you know what I
mean like hearing YouTube are starting
to notice people are not here for for
the tutorials you know let me see any
more questions man just go ahead leave a
question man I'm about to leave soon so
give me any questions you guys my half
now so like that I can answer them
yeah yeah yo for real my boys mad after
you bad for Matt Matt what time is it
it's probably like 4 or 5 o'clock in the
morning 3 o'clock in the morning or
something like that is crazy it
depends if you had to choose you to
larva or Ruby on Rails I will say start
with laravel and then apply for jobs on
Ruby on Rails because it's going to be
you want to be able to have a job first
and then be able to get that job for
Ruby or rails because they're not going
to give you that job unless you have
experience you can't go from zero to 100
or Ruby or rails at all trust me I've
