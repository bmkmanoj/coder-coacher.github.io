at it again man coding face.com listen
you're bullies back I didn't get it
again all right guys listen we're gonna
do something that you guys have been
waiting for for a long time we're going
to install laravel okay so make sure you
follow your boil take it in a little bit
this one we're gonna do is install math
search man
mmm 8mp download this download it click
download after you download it install
it then from there you will have any
applications you'll come here you have
drawer you click map click on the grey
one this you will find your server right
there is basically to start running your
PHP now as you can see here you're going
to click on preferences you're going to
see different options here you know
start/stop ports basically what ports
you want this to be running at PHP which
PHP version you want for me I want uh
you know for sure the latest one which
is 7.1 you got this web server and then
you got my sequel right so what you're
going to do is click web server and then
click on this option remember in the
beginning when I told you guys to create
a folder right on your home folder so
home you're going to come to let's say
for projects all right well whatever you
named it whatever doesn't you decided to
make it right so for me I'm going to put
in projects alright so we're gonna check
here and basically select this area
right
and then from the press okay now we're
going to start the server let it run for
a little bit give it a second okay
that's it's running now what you would
do is click localhost 88 so there you go
that's your file alright now let me open
this up okay and then desktop projects
this one now desktop is on cold projects
oh it's a home ok projects alright so
here we open this up then we come here
we say index dot PHP
alright let me close this up
okay so we have index dot PHP the
regular HTML now you save that you see
this is my index so now we want to
create C on our computers is that simple
alright that's why I love math now for
you guys to have windows there's
something called lamp I currently don't
have a Windows computer but this is
pretty much the equivalent to man or I
think man pass from windows so oops
somebody you can call it yeah so they do
have four windows so you guys learned
luck now you actually go install this
for windows alright
and it's the same process alright now
let's do the next thing which is install
composer I remember I told you the
terminal is super important well this is
why pretty much everything that you're
gonna install or any packages that
you're gonna get
you're always going to use the terminal
so now let's follow the steps all right
you're going to come here you're going
to copy this all right and you're going
to basically paste this here what that's
gonna do is it's gonna install a
homebrew for you right I already have it
installed right and then from there
you're going to copy each one of these
command C and paste it here and then
press Enter
all right after you do that you're going
to have PHP seven follow this one and
still brew install PHP seven don't
install PHP five six
that's an older version install PHP 7
all right so you're going to come here
and say brew update boot at homebrew
doops
boot at homebrew PHP brew install PHP
five six brew install composure right
and then you're gonna come here and
you're gonna check we're gonna say okay
composure - V the reason why I am
stalling it is because I already
installed it there's really no point and
it's such a simple task that all you
have to do is come here remember this
come here
click CV little curly write this right
under the skate key now I'm going to
bring you to your home base press LS go
to CD projects or whatever you name
things right you come here and you're
gonna basically run composer - V sorry
so that means that you have composer
installed right and everything is good
version 1.4 so you should be good you
should be golden right now let's go to
laravel laravel comm from there after
you're here you're going to come here to
documentation after that you're going to
come here and install larvae so the
other thing this is a whole bunch of
different ways of installing
people gonna think they use homestead
some people say they use pure PHP to
install a whatever they want to use it
doesn't matter all right
because to me this is just the easiest
way to deal with laravel and you don't
have to do too much configuration all
right so just come here copy this
compose a larval installer and then
paste a year so remember that copy that
paste a year then from there is
installing after that you should be good
you know everything is fine right now to
start a new project you basically copy
this copy it from here all right not the
whole thing because you see this little
space right here that's going to trigger
this whole arm script to start running
what you want to do is copy it from here
without no space at the end so when you
paste it you could actually have the
option to edit this alright so what this
is doing say ok Composer create a
project and prefer this true on
basically preferred distribution which
is the latest laravel right and then
from there you're going to say big store
which big store ok
all right so installing after this he
should be good let it run it takes a
little while you know it's the first
time doing an installation um basically
what is gonna do is going to install all
the PHP packages that you need for
laravel to run now that's it
everything's fine now it's telling you
here run PHP artisan optimize well I
mean it already ran it for you and PHP
artisan key generate so it already did
it for you now we're gonna come here
and we're going to go into the big store
right now let's switch up let's click
open just go to projects right go to the
big store and click inside of it so now
all the files that we get are the ones
from the big store okay cool
now this is very simple there's a lot of
folders here there's a lot of files if
you guys checked out my rocky stack is
very similar right but for now you
pretty much don't have to worry about
nothing that set this file the one that
says DMV you click that right then you
come here where is it you come to map
right we gotta stop the server right we
gotta stop the server we're gonna click
preferences and we're going to change
folder you're going to go into the big
store and now we're going to go to
public public is what people see all
these files that you see out here people
don't see that when they go to the live
web site they don't get to see that that
part so whatever is in public is
actually what people see when they land
on your page on your car
whatever it is right so start server
okay now let's do this let's go to
localhost maybe okay as you can see
let's say we have laravel installed okay
guys so now I want you to go to this
website equal Pro install this software
I don't know if they have equivalent to
this on Windows bye um I think you can
also use workbench which is free it
should be free search work fit alright
sorry workbench my sequel right so you
could download it and basically install
it on your computer and just Google how
to connect to your my sequel database
with map right so if you download a
sequel Pro right you can come here and
basically you could do this let's close
this up I want you guys to see it from
scratch sequel sequel Pro alright you're
gonna click here the first one or
whatever is there I don't know exactly
was there so you're gonna say map you
gonna name it - ma'am
right and then you're going to come to a
socket and you're going to paste this
applications slash map /tmp slash my
sequel slash my sequel sock right and
then you've got come here say root
and roots the same as the username
that's the password root all right
you're going to click connect right
everything should be flawlessly okay so
you basically have everything ready for
you now what I want you guys to do is
you're going to come here to the bait
store right on your dot EMV file you're
going to come here and say hey database
connection my sequel that's right host
one two one seven whatever 4306 that's
fine and you're gonna come in unis a
database beep store and you're gonna see
root root all right now we got another
thing that we got to do with the
database right so we're gonna come to
config and we're gonna say database
right now we're going to search for my
sequel okay here's my sequel and you're
going to paste this alrighty I'll paste
that you're going to comment that so it
is basically you annex akut let me make
sure yeah we got those three and paste
right into it alright so he's going to
say UNIX socket DB UNIX sake or whatever
and then just copy the same things it's
a lot of BS s there but to make this
work
this is what you got to do it so command
s after you copy that and then command
as here now to test it out we're going
to go inside our project but first let's
click LS to see where we are
ok so I guess we're in the project
folder you see let's go inside the vape
store folder
yeah press LS you see all the files are
here are the same ones that are here all
right now what we're going to do is
we're going to say PHP artisan migrate
and then we're going to say enter if
that happened to use as table created
successfully
that means everything went smooth and
now you should be able to see it here so
what you're going to do is come here and
click refresh table now you have your
database all right now this list we're
gonna say PHP artisan migrate roll back
so what that day was just it deleted
everything and it rolled back to square
one right where nothing happened
see I said the migration migration table
all right but everything should be good
now you guys are ready you guys have
laravel installed you have a project and
like I said you can use this way to
create projects on your own local
environment for laravel for any
situation all right guys I'll see you
