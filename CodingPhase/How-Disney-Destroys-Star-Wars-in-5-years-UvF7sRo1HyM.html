face.com your boys back in I don't did
it again today I have a special video
because you guys know a huge huge huge
Star Wars fans right pretty much I want
to talk about how Disney single-handedly
just like killed Star Wars and there's
really no coming back from this
I just don't see it happening the only
way that this could happen is ten years
from now is basically they scrap all the
movies you know cuz we're gonna look
back on this you know we're gonna look
back and we're gonna be like oh man this
is bad we're scrapping this whole thing
it's not candy alright now we're gonna
start with number one okay about ten
different things that I want to talk
about I hate the fact that they have
this forced feminism throughout the
whole franchise they have it through the
movies they have cartoons they have it
through the games they have it
everywhere what the hell is going on
this lady Kathleen the lady from Disney
she's completely effing up this whole
franchise guys girls we did not need a
whole bunch of new characters to be like
hey here are the girls the girls are
here like Padme wasn't bad those other
girls Sokka wasn't bad who else was in
there Leia wasn't bad like those are
girls that were very powerful very
strong or what they did the you know the
expanding universe had a lot of good
girls out here who were powerful out
here you don't need to force it down our
throat and be like hey guys the girls
are in town now we're taking over here
you go you know down your freaking
throat put this girl's girl
girls girls power put this down your
throat we don't need that like I
freaking hate that I really do I really
hate that because it's like instead of
you putting girls to become powerful and
you guys know me I'm constantly you know
praising girls I want them to get into
this industry to win and feel
comfortable but what you cannot do is
say hey for girls to be strong and for
girls to be smart they have to make the
men look weak and dumb that does a
disservice to the girls because it shows
then that the girls cannot hang when the
boys are smart or are strong that's dumb
in my world I look at em like wait what
you know how many girls could hold
themselves on their own like they got
this they don't need you to create a
movie to make them seem super powerful
compared to all the other guys you got
Leia you got the purple lady on the new
movie you got array you you got
everybody's there's a girl rogue one was
a girl the they have a show an animated
show that is all girls
what happened to Star Wars I understand
you're trying to promote you know all
this stuff
it wasn't like Harvey Weinstein was
touching all these girls that in Star
Wars Harvey Weinstein had nothing to do
with Star Wars what do you think about
it I don't even know how to explain him
and like why are we getting forced down
our throats force feminism like make
girls powerful at the same level as guys
or even more powerful than a guy that
strong that's smart that you know it's a
badass make a girl that you know that's
stronger than that guy don't make the
girl stronger than some weak guy who was
like oh you know sensitive is like I
don't know if I'm stronger than her
like no that doesn't help nobody that's
like going to a baseball game and you
lost and you get a freaking trophy for
being number two is like okay everybody
that lost you get a trophy too
wait what this is dumb
number two I hate talking minorities I
really do
I love mace windu cuz mace windu was
just badass you know I was like you're
gonna put a black dude on TV make him a
badass
don't make him some corny dude this guy
fan like we don't care about this dude
right and if we don't care about him
like he's super weak he's falling down
race is helping this kid up like
constantly freaky they stopped bringing
this token minorities around man this
guy DJ in the new movie comes in for
like five minutes and it's like a tokens
I hate we got a black guy check we got a
new Asian girl check we got a new
Spanish guy for five minutes
check Spanish guy check like you get
what I'm saying like come on show some
respect man like care about the movie
man care about the the audience man
don't use us as a way to just like hey
we gotta do we gotta use the quarter we
need you know we need one black guy one
Spanish guy one Asian person we need you
know we need a rainbow color of every
single person just to fill them in now
give them good characters give them
people that we could look up to
you know what I'm saying like don't give
me this talking do it man like that's
that that pisses me the hell off man
don't give me a token to it man that's
like when you show up to a freaking you
know it's like a whole bunch of racist
people and then they bring out the guy
from from freaking we're from get out
they bring out the guy from get out
like hi master and the guy you're trying
to you know give them the pound and the
guy is like like those are the type of
dudes you bringing around like we we
don't want those type of dudes to be
representing us on TV like our movies or
anything like show a badass show it dude
that's out here like man you know some
crazy laser it's like that
that like we're here what up like you
know what I mean show me somebody like
that show me somebody who you could be
like damn that dude is out here like mmm
you know mace is out here this up
right now
somebody that you could be like damn
like you know what I mean like that's a
superhero but you coming in with the guy
from get out there's like Finn from get
our sights you can't flash the camera in
front of him cuz he's so so whitewashes
like get this dude up out of here
straight up man I don't want to see
these people um let's see who else or no
originality reusing everything from
previous movies like we don't need that
like George Lucas for some reason man
what he did was great man what he did
was amazing
well he did was something that you know
not a lot of people have the vision for
like you know for you to come up with a
story that last six movies and a million
books and a million games it's not that
easy right I understand some people that
can't handle the date they won't be able
to have that vision but to say hey man
you know what we don't need to create
nothing new we just come in and copy
what I want he did from before we just
cashed in on it because the Star Wars
brand is on it
Lucasfilm it's on it and Lucas is not
even part of it you get what I'm saying
like come on man people don't care about
the story or look back in the history
man this new director that did the last
man I wish I could just if I bump into
him
i'ma just straight-up spit on him like
like that's what you did to us
right you know when when people come in
is like this a big story behind Star
Wars man listen this this is a huge
drama movie this is like something that
when you go in there you're like there's
a history you know it's a beginning
there's a middle that's an end to this
whole day so if you're gonna continue it
you're supposed to come in with new
stories things that it's also at the
same time it's gonna keep the characters
are there with the same attitude the
same energy that they have you know what
I mean like how you gonna come in here
and and just create your story like who
does see my dude who'd of you you get
what I'm saying like who does you bro
late this is this is like a story it's
like you know the whole story is I okay
somebody's gonna cross a bridge you know
what I mean it's like cool at the end of
the bridge there's gonna be girls is
gonna be bottles is gonna be you know
party the Duke comes in and rewrites
whatever was the ending is like you know
what the dude doesn't get to go across
the bridge he jumps over the bridge and
kills himself that's what this dude did
right you just don't come in in the
middle of the story change everything
that's around it and you say yeah I do
whatever I want
what is you to be changing okay
legends was great man the prequels were
great you get what I'm saying like you
know those books were great those books
were like my childhood those books are
things that even to this day I go back
and listen to it you know all the
bullying you know I'm driving a car I
want to listen to a story it's like you
know it's like fables you know what I
mean like somebody comes in and tells
you a story
about Star Wars like I love that you get
what I'm saying like you're not making a
cannon or any of it to basically come in
and rewrite everything on your own
shitty way like I don't even know how to
react to that oh my god there's another
one who does it's no you can't just
build up somebody that's like somebody
coming in and be like they build up Star
Wars right and they build up Darth Vader
and then on the second movie they cut
them off and kill them wait what how you
do that like who the hell is it dude
like we were supposed to get closer we
were supposed to come in and get some
some answers like who is this dude this
dude came from the outer regions you
know he came out you know he's coming
with a this crazy you know first order
where's kylo ren's in the the you know
the whole squadron were like what's
going on who is green learning this
thing's very who who's giving the green
light on this you get what I'm saying
like I'm literally I'm sorry we're about
to cry man like who's giving green light
to this dude man like when you find this
dude's like this dudes they don't know
anything about Star Wars and they make
it movies about them
you know George Lucas man straight up
George Lucas man yeah I don't know how
the hell you sell this to Disney like
you don't do that sell it to oh I don't
know Warner Brothers or even Fox even
Fox who woulda came out with something
better than this I don't know another
company so I set it to Miramax Lou or
one of those companies come on man show
some respect for it man
who else who else man um number eight
Luke is a Jedi Master man why bring him
back to make him weak sucking on an
alien man milk like he might as well
just be chugging down gagging on that
like come on
bro you don't do that to a Jedi Master
you don't do that to look you know what
I'm saying like you don't do that like
why would you do that like what did you
get out of it well what would you put
you know freakin a Jedi Master somebody
who pretty much was someone serious
throughout the past three you know three
movies he was a serious dude so then on
on the seventh movie is like hey man
he's sucking on the alien and there's
out here just swallow it like come on
man you don't do that to to Luke
Skywalker come on man Anakin went
through hell for all of this stuff and
then from there at the end of the day he
regretted that he went to the dark side
Luke almost went to the dark side came
back in on the stud every day I stopped
doing all this comedy stuff man like
this always is not a comedy
Stowers might have like one line two
lines there's a comedy in is just it has
to be clever for it to work
if you come in and be like like you know
seven guys walk into a cantina what
happens like nobody's gonna laugh at
that like come on man and don't do it is
thing another thing is how is rogue one
a side movie better than both Star Wars
movies Episode seven and eight together
how is rogue one better than them how is
a movie that we already know what was
going to happen because we know that
yeah at the end of rogue one everybody
dies we know that right how is it that
somehow that movie was better have
better action had you know new things
are you know different planets and like
even the girl she you know her story
worked you know the little love interest
that she had it worked
like how is that movie better than both
for the main movies how does that work
who drops the ball on there who fumbles
that you know like who fumbles that who
move we gotta here with a frigate
flagged out here for dropping that you
know what I'm saying like I'm the same
and I'm pissed off can't believe that
they do this like him it's 2017-2018 how
you dropped the ball and now that you
guys are watching this I'll be honest I
haven't watched episode 7 I haven't
watched episode 8 in the movie theatres
and I'm just not going to watch them
those movies are freakin bad yes I've
watched them all XBMC YES on cam footage
and yes I waited until the blu-ray came
out and then I bought it because those
movies are straight to DVD straight to
Netflix those movies are not good I'm
sorry to say this to the people that's
out there Brian Johnson does not have
enough credit to actually be directing a
Star Wars movie I don't know who the
hell thought that this dude was a good
choice like this dude has what he
directed three episodes of Breaking Bad
whoop-dee-doo okay you're good for TV
