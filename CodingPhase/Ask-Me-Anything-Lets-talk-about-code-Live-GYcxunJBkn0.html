talk about being a mid developer I'll
miss it it's all about senior developer
let's talk about whatever you guys want
to talk about but at the same time today
I'm I'm 9 to move yes you know what I
mean like if you get me know in a really
bad move I'm gonna curse you out and I'm

Donovan who else I see a Harrison Toby
word man and yeah we got Alvaro console
re-cancel Ari that's how you say so we
got a good team we got a couple of
people's man so let's talk about it okay
are you looking in into the blockchain
mainly in theory Oh am I looking into it
uh-huh I think it's interesting in my I
don't know I don't know if I'm
interested to be wanting to code in the
blockchain I think is it's gonna be like
a niche area to get into let me see
but somebody I don't know I just don't I
don't see it as a day-to-day thing you
know I don't see as a day-to-day thing
there's certain applications like must
say you have certain data like doctors
right
the doctors have all of your data right
you go to one doctor then the other
doctor should have all of your
information like you know that in
essence like something like an ethereal
block
it worked it really works you know what
I mean
something like transactions and you want
to keep track of that like that works
you know what I mean like me buying a
freakin a Gundam Wing DVD and then that
transaction beats wing stores I don't
think that that's needed you know what I
mean but you know how it is
people use technology and they overuse
it sometimes like a new thing comes up
and then people's like oh we gotta use
this for everything you know it's like
people that be like oh man I'm trying to
I'm trying to build my whole layout and
CSS grid and as a bro you just wasting
time like you know people get excited
they be like oh man this is something
new and I'm gonna do everything in that
new technology or that new way of doing
it a diría misko I don't know man I
don't know if it's like a thing for
everyday you know you know what I mean
let me see what else so any other
questions and see what else Joe Jose
Latta says sub Joe or what do you think
about progressive web apps future though
I didn't progressive web apps is cool
especially for certain applications like
let me see you see if I could find what
was the name of this one head I can't
die yo I think I got that I oh they have
a like an online text editor that uses
progressive web app technology and like
you could go offline and still use the
editor without no internet without
nothing it's already saved into your
computer okay so if like you're using
the internet and you're on the website
you were on on on a code right if for
whatever reason you you're on a subway
you go under the tunnel you're you're
still working on your applications
written that they did
before basically works without no
internet so sense but I'm seeing a lot
of people talk about progressive web
apps right and they're like man we gotta
use this for everything that's another
technology that doesn't make sense for
you to be using it for everything
because let's say for example I come in
and tell you hey can you build me in an
online store right and you build a whole
online store and it's like a single page
web app and then you like okay you know
what let's spend another three months
making it as a progressive web app and
it's like does that make sense to be a
progressive web app you know what I mean
like it doesn't make sense because what
the hell the person can't order anything
without being online so for you to make
the website offline to be working makes
no sense
that's what I think you know what I'm
saying
I mean Who am I to think to say anything
but people are coming out with stuff
that be like wait you making this a
progressive web app so now all the bugs
that you still have on your website you
still not fixing those but you're
worrying about making a progressive web
app it doesn't make sense now like I
said if you have an application
something that you created right like we
did that that application and react
where you could come in and figure out
how much does a Bitcoin cost weight but
you still you still need the internet
for that let me see what's a good
application hmm let me see I'm up well
let's say an example let's say something
where even if it's a video game right
even if there's a video game on on on
your browser right or on your internet
browser on your phone if you come into
this the site then you downloaded the
game right that game should be able to
be played offline that's a progressive
web app
all right that game is a progressive web
app you can make it to work offline and
be saved on the user's memory like
there's so many different situations
that you can use it but you gotta know
exactly when to use it just because it's
cool now doesn't mean that it has to be
done for every website you know that's
what happened a few years ago people
started talking about single page apps
and they made every single website for
like a whole year
I think 2014 2015 was all single page
websites right if you look into all the
websites that are in angular 1 99% of
our single page apps right and now most
websites don't do single page apps they
either doing server-side rendering or
they're doing just regular rendering
like and when I talk about server-side
rendering sometimes people get a
confused wait wait thinking like oh
you're talking about having react being
react being on being in the backend and
serving the views like in one extent
that's what it means but that's not
really what's going on for every
situation because if you're using Java
you can't come in and say hey I'm gonna
use react for for the from you know for
it to render the views you can't do that
that only works for no Jay yes all right
so but when people say server-side
rendering it just means having the
backend render the page which is what
has been happening for years you know
and then when around 2013 2014 people
started going to a single page app
single page apps and everybody got so
excited about that and started making
every single website single page apps
and then they realize that I always
there's problems with SEO so we lost
traffic there's problems with you know
you have to download a huge file for the
website to work because remember this
you're downloading the whole page you
downloading the whole website pretty
much so it's like you're freaking
websites bundle is like five megabytes
so if you live
in a third-world country or you live
somewhere with us no internet you're
downloading the website for like two
minutes
like so single page apps doesn't work in
every situation and even at that single
page apps only work when there's a
specific thing that they need to do now
how people was using a few years ago
where they had their whole website
single page apps that was a huge mistake
so you gotta be careful sometimes with
from you know new technologies new
things that people start coming up with
some progressive web apps and it's like
yeah use it for the right situation now
for every day let me see what else
anything else let me know let me know
let me know let me know do you think you
still have to push jQuery wait do you do
you think this is skillful factor says
do you think do you think you still have
to push jQuery a lot or just go onto PHP
and just hit the frameworks like react
angular um listen
learning jQuery is not gonna hurt you at
all it's actually going to help you
because it's gonna help you understand
this could get done quick with jQuery
and then it's gonna make you think in
your head upside way if I could do it
with what jQuery how can I do the same
thing with vanilla JavaScript
so then you come back you do a little
step back that's what happens to me I
learned jQuery and then I step back and
then I was like wait I could do all of
these things with another JavaScript the
only difference is gonna be way more
lines how can I do that right it's very
easy just go in look at what jQuery has
and then step back try to do it with
another JavaScript there from there into
something like react cuz react is gonna
make you a way better JavaScript
developer so yeah do that now if you
want to be a back-end developer or like
an overall developer once you understand
JavaScript and you understand
programming
and you understand the Don you don't
have to be an expert but once you
understand it then you can jump to PHP
one of the things that people mess up is
like they focus so much on the front end
that they don't even understand how the
backend works and it's like the front
end is cool you know you got your little
HTML your little CSS and your little
JavaScript but there's so much more out
there that happens in a website you
can't come in and you can't connect to a
database with just for gain JavaScript
and what I mean by that is like you
can't come in and connect to my sequel
with just with just JavaScript and do
everything through the front end just
like that like you got an e at some
point you're gonna need you're gonna
need a back end you're gonna need the
back end to create the routes
I can't took you know create those clean
URLs you're gonna need the backend to
deal with storage you're gonna be need
the backend to deal with on of course
the database on what else sessions
there's so many things that you need to
deal with in the backend and if you've
not had any exposure to it and you just
focus on the front end
when you go into a real life website a a
company you're gonna be like oh man I
don't know none of this stuff and you're
gonna be nervous you're gonna be like oh
my god how do i how do i work in this
you know what I mean cuz they're gonna
throw certain words at you then you're
gonna be like ah what I've been doing is
the front end you know what I mean like
you don't want to be in that situation
because that's why people get that how
you call that like impostor syndrome a
lot of times because they go in and
they're not sure if they could do it
because they haven't really had the
training you know but if you already
been had exposure to any of those or
technologies that any company is gonna
throw at you then you just confident
you're just like oh yeah did this in my
house I did the same in a project I did
this on a udemy course I did this with
yo I did it on YouTube etc right so you
should definitely try to get into the
backend with PHP or whatever you decide
where no need for kerning man let me see
who's in here man who's in here do you
find anything interesting from CES 2018
I don't know I haven't checked it out to
be honest with you I was seeing if
there's anything cool with technology
happening
if I leave bare without
yes that can definitely happen so Juan
Lopez says your Joe you talked about
tutorial heaven and never build your own
projects but do you think you could get
into a tutorial carousel that's a good
one I'm gonna make a video about that
yeah I'm gonna give you props for Lopez
you know tutorial carousels make you
just keep learning the same beginner
stuff over and over again so you're 100%
true on that you like listen that
happens to you know how many times I've
you know cuz even right now I know a lot
of people have have come to me right and
you know they've gone to like the web
developer boot camp then they came to me
and then they come to my website they do
some of the the beginner stuff already
that they already learned right I never
tell people hey do the beginner stuff
that you already know jump over that
skip that if you already know it move on
you know sometimes we we keep doing the
same things over and over and over again
that's one of the reasons why I get so
pissed off like a lot of courses like I
keep bringing this guy's name what's
this guy's name the guy that created the
what's the name first todd todd McCloud
I don't know what's the name are
something I was so pissed off at his
course because it's like his course was
so beginning to be in the beginning like
it was explaining things from computer
science that if you're using golang you
already know this stuff like there's no
point of coming in and explaining four
hours of the same thing you know what
I'm saying and that happens in a lot of
tutorials and a lot of courses people
come in and be like hey let's learn
react and then they're like they give
you three hours of basic JavaScript and
you're like wait why are you teaching
the basics
javascript nobody should be interested
in learning react unless you know
JavaScript so if I'm taking your course
in JavaScript and react don't teach me
nothing about JavaScript right so this
happens all the time to people they come
in and they fall into that tutorial
carousel you know I mean it's like hey
you learn HTML boy because the videos is
here in the beginning let's do it like I
don't want to do it you get on
understand so it's crazy man but that's
how it is so I definitely agree with you
that can definitely happen that's why
you just got to be careful out here man
and if you know something skipping let
me see house a lot of sense got a herd
of people talking about it but do they
know let's see I'm reading a reading
skill for fact it says do you think you
still have to push take or okay I'll
write down I'm sorry let me see what
else let me see you know manipulating
the Dom is a more common practice to use
events or jQuery with manipulating the
Dom is a more common practice to use
events or jQuery well you can just use
events on on your element you've been
okay when I hover on top of this or when
I when I click it but at the same time
there's so many things that you you have
to remember from you know using events
that back then and even now for people
it's easier to just say data side
question aquasmart data sank all quotes
inside of you know that assigned
parentheses quotes and then put in the
element and just put in the class the
class of the ID and that's saying and
then you say that on click do this and
that's it for that people are are pretty
comfortable to just keep it moving like
that but you know it's up to the person
if they want to use just plain
JavaScript my reality to be honest with
you guys man
listen the client the employer doesn't
care what is it that you use sometimes
you might have a seat sometime you might
have a a senior developer there somebody
who want to just be a a-hole all right
let's be honest somebody wants to just
be a a ho and they'll be like oh we want
to do this with another JavaScript we
want to do this with just jQuery
we want to do it with just react in this
lake bro
the client the owner nobody cares how
you do it as long as you get it done and
there's no bugs
but you know at the same time if there's
a senior developer there who who got a
stick up his you-know-what he might just
be like oh we're gonna do this or
vanilla JavaScript like okay so let's do
it your vanilla JavaScript you know what
I mean like but it all depends on the
company it's like the company or the
owners they don't care how you get it
done as long as it works and there's no
bugs it just sucks cuz sometimes there
might be a senior developer or somebody
who's just a ho and just be like you
know just want to make your life
miserable so let me see what else
these an external sound card you should
take it there listen man I'm gonna make
up I'm planning on making like once I
get everything situated I get everything
good I plan on making another channel
for those of you guys that care about
other stuff besides coding you know cuz
to be honest with you guys I can talk
about code for only a certain amount of
time you get what I'm saying but there's
so many other things that I want to talk
about this you know things in politics
things in music this things in popular
culture like like there's so many things
that I want to talk about that I
wouldn't be able to get into here
because this is more of a coding channel
you got are saying so you know later on
I will have like tutorials on other
stuff there's so many other things that
I know that I want to you know talk
about but it just doesn't make sense to
talk about it here you get what I'm
saying but yeah I'll definitely see what
I could do with it that let me see what
else what database language should I
learn 2018 I will say learn C cool man
you'll be good man
trust me what Mike are you using for
YouTube
it's the blue Mike I got more stuff
coming in soon but for now we we're
using the blue Mike we started with this
but we in it with this we getting
something better than that you know we
got a nice space here man is it is
comfortable you know what I mean like
your boys out here we chillin you know
it's not that bad
let me see I'm reading all the comments
skillful Factor says there are so many
jobs for angular Ruby a in Ruby on Rails
along with react not sure which to pick
I was thinking about just doing all but
half know doing it all both have no
limits part two question let me see I
can't here let me go in the background
yeah man
Little Joe a little eat then he's still
screaming out here man I don't know why
let me see
and I
I'm trying to get this this new thing
it's this new michaelis interface that
pretty much is gonna drown out
everything that's outside it said that
things are coming into the mic from my
voice is gonna get drowned out so
there's not gonna be no noise from
anything outside so we're gonna get it
popping yeah I brought the the Korean
man in the corner and the curtain is
here it's just not in the background
John this law says D Miller Joe ideas
for courses foresight Hiroko get etc why
are your thoughts on native mobile
development it's great if you want to
get internet yeah definitely
Philippa says do you see the dudes in
teen forests that create a wordpress
theme that generated 9 million in sales
they use visual composer and create a
ton of templates in added WooCommerce
but I believe it listen in around I
think like 2013 2014 like I was like
working on some like WordPress stuff and
I was like going in into it I was like
man let me show the screen to the people
let me see team forest
let me share this
okay let's see you know people talk
about WordPress they talk about this
dissing that man you know I've seen I
don't even want to call his name bossy
I seen you know some dweeb on the
internet talking about oh you can maxed
out at 60,000 with knowing WordPress
like bro you don't even know what the
hell you talking about like you know
dweeb like you just starting like the
other day like you just got a job you
know what I mean like these people this
is the problem with YouTube sometimes I
see people here they just got a job if
you just got a job you don't have an
opinion on stuff like this like you you
can't tell people hey don't learn this
learn this because this is where the
jobs are this is where this is not bro
you just got a job like you don't even
have your feet wet yeah like you just
tapped into water in the water was cold
and you came right back out like why are
you giving opinions about things but
yeah anyways so I was listening to this
dweeb
and he was talking about like Oh
WordPress are 60,000 you magnet you get
maxed out I'm like oh man this kid
doesn't know man like these guys
are making a killing on WordPress this
companies around it about WordPress this
digital agency surround it just for
WordPress so let's just see okay let's
see these people right so these guys
they selling this BST right I've seen
this for a while let's bring here for a
while all they do is they keep them
updating it it's the same theme same
stuff they just update it so let's say
60 times 38 wait no three hundred and
eighty nine thousand and eight hundred
eighty-two okay so let's say three
hundred a
9 882 how much is that that's wait it
can be right because then this guy's
made a killing
you're telling me hold on hold on $60
right say see the oddest times 389 389
882 sales which means that's how many
people they sold it to that's 23 million
dollars 392 right 390 mm a 920 okay
now times let's say point 80 so this how
much they made after Dean Forest took
their money took their things took their
little you know a little charge they
made 18 million dollars almost 19
million dollars just from WordPress
right now
of course you're gonna say oh that's not
everybody you know this this and that
okay that's cool
all right you start going back you start
looking let's say a day by let's say
last year okay so in the last year right
these guys if they would have listened
to what everybody on the internet says
right they would have missed out on
let's say 69 times for 188 okay click
there so they would have missed out on
two hundred and eighty eight thousand
dollars most likely the creator of this
stuff is really just one guy you know
there's a trick that people don't tell
you about every time you see this like
oh kriti old studios are this this and
that right like a company it sounds like
a company is usually just one dude in
his house creating this all right let's
see portfolio so they only got one the
listing pro website all right they've
been around since May 2015 but they
released us this year okay so they
already made two hundred thousand
dollars like I don't know if people
understand that you know what I mean
like in one year two hundred thousand
dollars like you know what I'm saying
like people come in and they talk about
this stuff and they'll be like oh PHP is
dead oh this this and that
oh like you should have learned this you
max out at $60,000 like bro you don't
know nothing like like this dweebs out
here man
I'll be like yo I don't even know how
people even take them serious cuz it's
like you just start you just got your
job yesterday like how can you give an
opinion or something when you just
started working you know what I'm saying
but people don't know these people don't
know about the digital agencies these
people don't know about big corporate
companies these people don't know about
you know guys freelancing making a
killing like hey sometimes I'll be like
what so you're Phillipe I didn't get to
hear about those guys that mean 9
million well as you can see those some
guys that in the last three years they
make 23 million you know what I'm saying
like now we look at that we'd be like
hey man PHP is dead hey man you max our
$60,000 like guys it doesn't matter what
language it is it doesn't matter what
you do where you take it like people
come in and give opinions on certain
things like you know like they kind of
kind of ridiculous you gonna say
yeah so it's like they made 23 million
after they paid off the the people from
ThemeForest I think is invited the name
of the company or something that like
you know what I mean and then on top of
that that's not even counting how many
people pie really 13 you know say like
you create a wordpress theme and you
release something for us most likely you
give king piratey
so if they so to you know they make 23
million dollars if it wasn't because
they got pirated they probably made
wouldn't make 50 million you know saying
so it's X is the limit is up to you what
you built you know what I mean so like
nobody coming here tell you hey man
don't do this don't do that and even
even I myself when I come in and I tell
you guys like hey guys about Python
right I'm not telling you don't learn
Python there's different type of roads
right if you out here right and you
right now most of the time when I give
an a an opinion or I give her an advice
to people and that's how the hey man you
should focus on this is because I'm
focused on the jobs right but that
doesn't mean that you can't make it
happen with whatever technology you you
want you can come in and get it poppin
yeah the really good I wonder
yes dr. Linda data I don't know if it
got cut off for now yeah let me know if
I got cut off but you know what I mean
when I tell you guys like you I Donna's
cool job is a web developer that's
totally different you know I mean but it
doesn't mean that you can't make it
happen with you all right
you could come in and create something
create an application create something
that could be like sell for I don't know
for a freaking 500 million dollars or
two hundred million dollars whatever
right it's up to you as your imagination
is your creativity that gets a pop it
it's not the language it's now whatever
you do
means some yeah there's a lot of
companies out there that they coming in
and they killing it these guys that are
there by themselves where what a team of
two people one developer and one
designer and they create amazing
websites and I say that as their digital
agency it's up to you what you want to
do with it
so you're the memory back on what people
were saying before
a man rap sitting in a basement
let me see
how much time it takes to become decent
in JavaScript they all depends on what
you call decent like if you can build
something then you're already decent
let's say now if you want to be an
expert that's totally different that
might take you years like javascript is
deep man there's a lot of stuff about
javascript that you know I was like it's
not something that you can just pick up
in one day it takes time even the most
experts you know if we can come in and
be like Oh show JavaScript like these
developers out there that don't even
want to touch the outskirt right this
certain things that just don't work in
it it's like not only do you have to
know how to programming know how
programming works but you also got to
know the JavaScript tricks like the
things that don't work on JavaScript and
how to work around it like it's kind of
ridiculous but and how it is and that's
the world we live in
so Martin Contreras says I was started
using Ubuntu yeah man Linux is the
shades it's legit man I'm telling people
man guys if you haven't issues with
Windows just install Ubuntu you're gonna
be great you're gonna be like in a whole
new world as a developer it makes your
life so much easier
Joe can you make
Torian how to set up SAS on Adam without
using starter pack um I mean you could
do it with dope I think it's it's
overdue now I was supposed to do a gulp
tutorial a long time ago so I'm gonna do
it pretty soon maybe in these days that
I'm gonna be here without no good
internet so I'll probably do that for
you guys you know because I've been
saying I'm gonna do it but it's like
it's so tedious to teach Gope then I'm
like ah it's like I'm dragging my feet
but I'll do it for you how's that
megabytes upload speed man I mean I
haven't had the internet yet this is
connecting through my phone I'm on
tethering through my my BS phone right
now I mean I got a good asshole man I
got a freaking no.8 so I'm good but the
problem is the internet no matter where
I go is like there's really no good
internet people will be acting like
there's like super fast speed internet
like nah man I haven't bumped into
really fast Internet in a long time
now I'm not talking about listen when I
say dweeps there's a difference not ah
you got a messed up I'm it when I say
dweep when I say dweeb
is totally different man dweebs is like
them dudes who is like somehow you don't
even know how how they gonna procreate
in this world you don't know how how
they survive in this world you know it's
like that's a dweep if you consider
yourself a tweet dazzling you I'm not a
dream you know I mean I'm out here the
dweeb is like somebody's like scrawny
little guy glasses and he's like hi guys
can we get some milk you know what I
mean like that's a tweet to me somebody
who's just like like I don't even know
where they come from you know I was like
a mixture between alien and a dog I
don't know how yeah that sounded harsh a
mixture between an alien and a dog just
like here's a dweeb nah but what I mean
by that is like this people will just
dweeps I'm sorry like your dweep if
you're doing your dweep out there that's
not my fault you get what I'm saying
like that's on you you know but I can't
consider I'm definitely not a dream I
could be a nerd being a nerd is cool a
dweeb is like it's like there's certain
levels to this you know say like you
could be like a nerd you could be a
smart person you could be like uh I
don't know an interesting person you
could be whatever you tell you wanna be
but dweeb is like is below all of that
dweeb is like the dude that they put
into the locker room to do that they put
the boxes over his head like give him a
wedgie
what will he you know that's tweet to me
like I never go I never gone through
that in my whole life but you know I
mean it were all
all good intentions man if you're doing
your dweep that's it you get what I'm
saying so anyways man let me see what
else
holy face are you going to make the Ruby
on Rails course along with angular now
I'm doing it just will not like a
certain topic I'm doing just that
certain topic I'm not mixing two topics
because then if you're doing two topics
things like you got to teach both topics
confuses people yeah all the digital
agencies are not about WordPress man
seems like 80% of companies that we have
out here in Phoenix or WordPress steam
stuff yeah unfortunately that's how it
is it's a job man it's a job and people
come in and be like oh we don't we don't
want to do that but it's like man they
don't know what the hell they're talking
about
PHP there's money in PHP man I know guys
who do PHP and they have like literally
three they work for three agencies they
work for one agency where they do mostly
like WordPress stuff the agency that
they work for where they do like web
application a glare eval and they have
another agency where as I pretty much
like small businesses 200 grand a year
like for whoever tells you that hey you
maxed out like $60,000 that clearly you
know that person don't know what the
hell he's talking about at that moment
that's when you'd be like okay peace I'm
out of here
you know what I mean like this in
situations where I'm like oh man you
know people come in and be like oh my
god Christian said he's a software
engineer but who cares about that you
know people will say I unsubscribe
because of that all right that sounds
dumb to unsubscribe for that you know
what I mean there's people out here
giving you crazy advice crazy things
that you
way what like what are you talking about
like 60,000 max like you think people
are freaking paying mortgages and
surviving in this world with 60,000
dollars having four or five kids and and
you know going on vacation trips were
sixty thousand dollars nah man guys are
making money out here on PHP on
WordPress and all of that
like people sound crazy you know what I
mean like that's when I unsubscribe
that's when I say unsubscribed and I
never went back
straight up after I was like bro you do
not know what you're talking about
you're out here just like you just got a
job and you're talking about PHP like
you've never done PHP in your life like
Oh easy Joe do you have a do you have
like of tutorial you can refer to a
video tutorial what um see what else
what else
yo-yo says could we do it Satori series
of WordPress development yeah I probably
do that somewhere in the future what is
like as you guys can see there's a lot
of stuff that comes in like more people
want stuff like I need to knock out the
Ruby on Rails tutorial um there from
there
do that one there from there we gotta
jump into the go p-- cuz we gotta finish
that goal right I'm still I just
finished matter of fact I just finished
the animations course I finished a whole
animations course today so that should
be good and the only reason why it's not
up is because I can't upload videos
through my phone it's gonna be like
super it's gonna take forever because
each video is like one gigabyte so it's
gonna take forever so I'm like you know
what I'm just leaving it on so the
internet comes in somewhere this week or
next week but yeah so that's done and
then I'm just knocking out all the
videos for like the Ruby on Rails then I
want to do that goal because it's like
even though we we did the parse ljs
course on it you can't use parsonage as4
every day like if you've been taking the
the tutorial that I did for building the
portfolio you're gonna notice there's a
lot of stuff that you can't do with
parse ljs but when you build your own
custom what developers started K or your
own your own what development
environment then it just you have
control like you have control of
everything you have control where things
come in how things is gonna get exported
like you have control of everything but
for real like you can't do a lot of
stuff in parcel yeah so you have to know
gulp so do all of these things go p--
and web pack
okay can you
of storing images their videos and
databases via HTTP requests only know
how to store text how our image is
stored that's very simple there's
something called base64 or hey abyss his
name is hey abyss that's his question
he's at you know can you explain the
concept or storing images videos in
database via HTTP request so let me show
you this
I don't know hopefully you guys I don't
know if this the internet still working
or did the video drop or not you guys
let me know if I'm still recording or
I'm still live so let me see you can
search base64 image - okay so I can take
these images all right clicking here
let's click this image movie universe
that PNG is encoding it right now okay
and then now we look at the code and
look now all of this is just a text file
so you could take this image well you
could take this copy it paste it here
let me see it pasted hold on sometimes
it's hard with this thing but pretty
much you take an image you may convert
it to base64 okay so that there wasn't
no text inside of it what it is there is
text okay so there's the text right this
right here is the whole image so we'll
be
sixty-four you take this and you save
this data inside of your database and
then now what you did was you actually
stored that image in your database
instead of restoring it inside of a
teiko list inside of a hard drive or
somewhere out there you just put it
straight on your on your database okay
so that's how it works it's not that
hard
I did that a couple of times with this
like this was a company that I used to
work for okay so this is the website
that that I built
okay let's see Portland okay select self
review all of this I built it you know
by hand every single thing so let's say
simple programmer right okay so what
this does is I take this area here write
a snapshot and what it does is let me
see put this at 63 it takes the image it
makes into a base64 so now I'm not
saving the image into the database at
all I'm not saving it into the hard
drive or like the storage the server
everything is done on the browser right
when I came in and I pretty much I
created this whole thing that made this
this whole application super fast cuz
when before I created this this company
what they had was they will save it to
the storage and then come back loaded up
it was a whole process like they used to
save the images like three to four times
every time that they cropped it so right
now all of this that you're seeing right
now
this whole image is base64 okay
and as you
image is there now and there now because
I have the image in the on the browser I
actually saved it to the database when
the page actually reloaded I saved that
image into the database so now every
time that I load the page it says okay
this user or this session of this user
we have the image of that user on the on
the back end so it loads the image and
then when I come to any other page I
switch automatically the image is there
in the the image of the glasses show up
on time post uh and come here and keep
on changing it as he oh that's pretty
much it as far as like you know using
base64 it's not that hard it's super
easy you know this website after I've
you know I fixed it with my my other
partner like this website became more
legit like we literally came in we got
the new designer like you know this time
is that I feel like if you guys were to
look at this website before I started
working here this website look like
like this people owe me a lot man like
straight up like this people owe me a
lot I mean I was glad when I left from
there because I just felt like people
were not appreciative then like
literally everything on a website was
your boy like even to this day you know
like the new kid that's on it that's
honor on how you call this on a company
the junior developer like we literally
did every freaking thing on this website
and we left it like 99% done like 95%
done all right a junior developer came
in with no experience no nothing and
took over because everything was
completely done and even so they lied to
the last day
I still feel a certain way because as I
bro like we save your freaking company
we save it company we created the the
website to actually go fast and
everything that's on the website we
freakin did it like and then on top of
that like this people were not grateful
at all like they felt like like I don't
know man not like I want to get my ass
kissed or anything but it's like bro
like when people come in and save your
company I appreciate that you get what
I'm saying so but whatever going back to
the topic like that's the main reason
why I don't deal with what companies no
more man it's like you know especially
smaller businesses because this is like
they don't appreciate the things they
look at it as okay this person got paid
for it's like okay he did his job and it
is my job but at the same time as I
broke the things that I did at the price
that I did it it's like I'm an advanced
developer working for you for like
twenty thousand dollars less than what
I'm usually charging and it's like you
still don't appreciate you know what I
mean so it's like never again that's
what it's like nowadays I'm like man and
I make my own company I mean do what I
gotta do you know what I mean like I
don't want to work for nobody unless
it's like there's a bag unless there's a
big bag and I have equity in the company
I don't even want to work for nobody let
me see
let me see what else was in here so C's
degree let me see what else
yeah now you can make listen guys you
can make as much as as much as possible
guys I'm reading people going back and
forth with phillipe you know like the
Filipe make up more than one hundred
sixty-five thousand a whatever guys you
could come in and make as much as you
want you know there might be you might
even have an amazing year you might come
in and make like you know as like I was
looking about I told you guys I was
looking at my taxes we're looking at
almost like a hundred seventy K in a
year
all right now does that happen every
single year no right so it's like you
gonna say like it could happen you can
make it happen you know I mean there's
people who are already making $120,000
on their job and then they have for
YouTube and they make another $50,000
and then they have their own clients and
they make another thirty forty thousand
dollars on their so now they made two
hundred thousand you know like you know
you really don't know nobody finances
you know what I mean the only thing that
I do
freaking smell bs is when somebody comes
in and be like oh I just got I just got
hired by a start-up and I'm making a
hundred and ten thousand dollars with no
website no experience no nothing like
that's BS you know what I mean like I've
seen a couple of people coming here and
be like oh man I'll make this distant
much and this I bro I don't know who you
lying to it's like this kid who I used
to work with right
who I used to work with and he was like
oh man I'm getting hired to Capitol one
you know and I'm gonna make you know I'm
making he went to like a job meeting for
Capital One and he's like oh man
came back with a story of I oh man I'm
getting hired by Capital One making 97
thousand dollars and I was like girl
like you haven't even graduated college
you just started working on your first
job you're barely a junior developer all
right
like why would a Capital One hire you
and give you $90,000 especially when you
look at glassdoor.com much they pay
their junior developers it's $80,000
what makes you - special that you're
gonna get $17,000 above a whole bunch of
developers who are hired in that company
you know sometimes you could slow the BS
but you know what I mean but that's how
it is man
yeah people sometimes people don't don't
understand sometimes you this different
um you know like you you might have a
good two years or even one good year
like you might make you know like 300
grand there's people that they come in
and get on a very nice contract and then
they come in and get a couple of other
contracts and it's like they're legit
and you can make you know God knows how
much but that's not like every year
thing you know so it's like that happens
all the time so and also don't worry
about that see let me see what else I'm
gonna see Joe will you go about
utilizing platforms such as upwork fiber
to get some experience with basic
knowledge how yeah I think it's perfect
for people to go in and start learning
with you know with fiber put your
services out there you're not doing that
in your house you gotta say like you and
your house not building anything out
there and be like hey man I'll edit your
website for you know five dollars if you
wanted to change the title if you want
me to do something extra it's gonna be
twenty so now you just charges on twenty
five dollars an hour how to play the
fiber game if you look at fiber in
search the top paying fiber users you're
gonna notice how they make their money
you can make money in every single
platform you know I mean like it's like
YouTube like you could come in here in
YouTube and make money on YouTube and
sell you services like create videos for
companies like hey you need a website or
hit me up I'll edit your website people
to understand that YouTube is the
biggest search engine in the world
basically after Google and a lot of
stuff on on YouTube is free you could
come in and get a nice keyword
and be number one in that keyword and
then now you could resell your services
to to the people that they found your
video of course you make your videos
that are high call is useful for people
you know it's like even myself you know
what I mean like a lot of the I think
about 60% of of all the new signups that
I get on my website they come from
YouTube right and not to say nothing bad
about none of you guys are here on the
live chat but a lot of the people that
sign up to my website have never even
been in a chat right you know is they
they're just people who are just
browsing right and they want to learn
and they see one video and then at the
end of the video says hey come sign up
to my once I check it out they see that
there's something good there and they
sign up right so that's sixty percent of
the people right that are on my website
right now people that come in from
Google from Facebook and other places
where people share my videos whatever
that's another 40 percent but the
majority of the people is from YouTube
okay so that goes to show you you can
come in and make money with YouTube now
how he like the computer guy is doing it
he's like oh man
I remember when you could create content
and and that's all you needed to do is
like no YouTube was never going to be
just content uh you know the moment they
give commercials you had to understand
that go to the people that were making
amazing content you know guys who you
know Logan Poe and all those guys that
they know how to play the system
Heiko the frigate spinners things came
out they were up on that right away they
were making videos about that all the
kids wanted that so they were selfish
spinners and then the frigate spinners
were advertising fame in their videos
and it's like a big freakin 360 a bubble
where it's like okay you do one video
bar one thing
advertisers advertise
in your videos and then you sell those
same products and then you make money
like that well II like the computer guy
was saying is like oh I make the content
and that's it and it's at all you know
what I think this YouTube doesn't pay
you that well you know what I mean and
it's like even like you got a traversée
media right traversée media comes out he
gives you guys so many so much good
content right traversing media tomorrow
could come out with a book right what a
book that he could say hey guys I came
out with this book he gave you so much
for free why wouldn't you buy from
traversée media you know what I mean
like that you know the guy's legit so
it's like that's the same thing that and
that's how it works with YouTube or any
type of platform
it could be fiber it could be Craigslist
I know people who make a lot of money on
Craigslist you know and that's one of
things do you know I'm gonna try to you
know this year especially now that I'm
moved to Connecticut I noticed that
there's a big gap it's a big hole on
Connecticut that is there's really not
that many good companies doing what
development right so my next thing that
I'm doing is I'm doing of course YouTube
I got you - I got my website right I've
got high colas
I've got YouTube my website I have other
websites that are coming money which are
small services services that are dumb if
I was to tell you the services you'd be
like yeah this is dumb
how can you make money off that but it's
like people search for it um then those
are the three main things that I make
money from now because I'm not working
full-time no more all right if God would
be a situation comes where I was like
hey I need a extra 60 grand 70 grand
then yeah I'll go in and work full-time
right currently I don't need it but what
I'm doing is I'm jumping on Shopify and
I'm also
bring on expanding the services for web
development for companies here in in
Connecticut because I'm seeing like
there's a big gap like there's not that
many good companies here there's people
who are building websites who that look
like I know a lot of good designers
where I could buy the designs from them
and I could build the website is myself
and then charge a client you know ten
fifteen thousand dollars but something
that could probably take me a week or
two you know what I'm saying so that's
where I'm at right now
so and I've been saying I'm like yeah
I've been wanted to open up my own
company and this this and that so I've
been telling you guys I eat you know
time but you know slowly but surely you
know that's how you say slowly but
surely time time to time give time to
time you know just taking my time with
it but in the long run I know what the
hell I'm doing is like so he's like for
you guys you guys can definitely do all
this stuff I know people that are in
neighborhoods in areas where nobody's
really creating good quality content or
good quality development so if there's a
hole in your area how about you fill
that hole right you fill that need for
the people you know there's a lot of
clients out there that are hiring from
the big companies or hiring from the big
cities like let's say you live outside
the city all right all of those
companies they got to go to the city
they gotta go for example like I was
talking to somebody here in Connecticut
they're like oh that most of the
companies here they hire people in New
York City and I'm like why don't they
hire people here in Connecticut and
they're like well nobody really have
right so it's like hey man it's like I'm
the connect you know what I mean sorry
I'm coming in with a brick you know what
I mean is that coming through you know
what I mean it's like here's I got that
raw what you want you know what I mean
so that's what I'm trying to do now and
take it to the next level man
but that's because like I tell you guys
you
gotta make things happen you cannot come
in and be like hey man I'm just gonna
sit back you know late let Lady Luck do
it for me she's gonna come in and
sprinkle some sauce on on me nah man no
I mean I don't take I'm gonna grab that
neck and blow that back out I'm gonna be
like Lady Luck I got you hold that you
know what I mean like a little too
graphic but it's like yo like I'll make
I'll make it happy I don't wait for Lady
Luck to come get it from me like now MA
it's like let me get that like we making
this luck happen right now you know what
I mean we see Jeff Johnson is like yo my
ex man her current boyfriend in rehab in
Connecticut yo I keep hearing that
there's a lot of rehab places out in
Connecticut I don't know why let me see
what else
yo you good yeah man so it's like you
gotta make you happy man you're gonna
hire people when you open your company
that's the idea I was thinking about
that I was like yo you know I know I can
get the clients I know I can get a lot
of easy jobs so what I was thinking is
like I could reach out to a lot of you
guys that already know you know all the
basics and all the stuff I wouldn't even
have the time to build everything so if
I can come in and get the clients reach
out to a lot of you guys that I know
have the talent and I could say hey guys
this is the guidelines this is how we
building the sites I get the design you
guys rebuild it and then from there you
know a P a couple of you guys whoever I
decide that you know it's up to par you
know so that's what I'm trying to do
right so there's a lot of things that
I'm trying to do that you guys kind of
see and you guys know me everything that
I say I make it happen
so as you gotta see on things start
popping off and I'll be like yo we got
this crime we got this person then I
reach out and be like hey guys send me
your your resumes and I'm not gonna be
like oh just send me your resume just to
see it now it's like I wanna see your
portfolio I wanna see what you've done
and I'm gonna send you a test meaning
I'm gonna say you a design and if you
come back you send it to me I will hire
you you know because I'm not gonna be
able to build all these websites I
already know it cuz I can't do
everything I can oversee or build the
back end but I can't do every front-end
site you know what I mean like it's too
much you start getting overwhelmed you
know so you know I'll charge somebody
like 75 an hour and then come in give
you like 35
if I keep 35 sorry somebody you know ten
grand then come in for every job give
you 4,000 which is like enough for the
month I think a 4,000 that would be good
keep six you know cut your boy gotta eat
but yeah huh
and there's a lot of stuff down I'm
doing right now you know I mean Kevin
Lopez like Joe alright I'm in a bad mood
now it's not that I'm in a Bama I'm
actually in a great mood
I came in an amazing mood but it's like
soon as I come in
you know I mean like people don't know
the things that I had to go through the
past few days and it's like you know
what I mean I came in I was like yo guys
you know somehow the Internet's not that
gray somehow I'm connected through the
phone I have my phone connected with an
antenna to the outside to make sure that
we have freaking servers in here like
I've never seen this the things that I
did for to get this live stream going
you know like there's no internet here
there's no cable no DSL no files
no nothing right not even the wire right
so I come in here and I'll try to get
this popping and the first thing that I
start seeing aah when damn uh what was
it
people saying dumb stuff like what was
it something like I don't even remember
what was it it was like something dumb
like I can't remember the word but it's
just like what the hell are you talking
about I said the other day like oh I
wasn't gonna be able to be here for a
few days and because I somehow went out
of my way to make sure that I could be
here
people are like they're pissed because I
made that video I'm like bro you should
be freaking glad that I somehow I made
it that I could come in and come in live
you know what I mean oh click beep yeah
so I'm like what the hell are you
talking about I'm trying to click me
like bro I don't need to every time I do
a video I drop no matter what
I'm gonna make the same video hits I'm
still gonna get the same people coming
in to the live show I'm still gonna do
everything the same way I don't need to
click bait you know you guys haven't
seen me create a top here's the top 25
programming languages I haven't done
that in a long time because I don't need
it you know if you go to socialblade.com
go and search coding face you will see
that coding faces like this it's just
like that was the guy's name who same
boat my stats is like like that is just
straight up going up you know I mean
just look there's no coming down cuz
your boy is out here
so it's like I don't need to do
clickbait but it did get me pissed off
cuz I'm like man you don't even know all
the things that I had to go through like
and then on top of that it's like I'm
super tired and I'm like I'm pushing
myself through this I'm like nah man we
got to figure out how we gonna get
connected cuz I want to talk to my
peoples and then when I get here my
peoples is like clickbait back ah so
many days right like you should be
freaking glad you know what I mean like
if not shut the up like that's how
I felt so it's not really that I'm in a
bad mood I'm in a great mood it's just
people just retarded so I'm just reading
the comments right now I'm reading what
everybody's saying you know yeah it's
like I'm sorry you know for the people
that you know it's a lot of people here
who don't even comment there's people
here who just love to show they watch
the show and you know they come in here
to chill you know but at the same time
man people coming here is like they
having a bad day you know what I mean
like I never go into nobody livestream
and talk about them I never go into
people's life so I don't even go to
their channels when I don't like
somebody I don't even go in there like
you could literally check my subscriber
on thing like myself people who are
subscribed to my place subscribe to
their Channel
a lot of the people that I don't like I
just don't watch them and I advise you
guys to do that too
you're gonna say like if you're in a bad
mood and you want to get me in a bad
mood yeah congratulations you got me in
a bad mood earlier but at the same time
it's like then you get blocked and then
you were like oh what happened why
nobody can see my message is your block
might do it we don't even know that you
exist anymore you threw yourself off the
cliff you know what I mean so that's on
you so I'm sorry guys that's just how I
am man you guys know me man like I don't
know I work in a different I feel like I
live in a different world than a lot of
people man I live in this world with
like I just keep it real keep it 100
with everybody like if you're gonna get
me pissed off in real life I just
slapped the shout-out on you and that's
just how it is and if we just scrap we
scrap but what can we do through the
internet we can't do nothing you just
gonna you get me pissed off I blocked
you never seeing you again you know what
I mean so you know then you become a
ghost then you become Sam Sam comes in
here try to troll once in a blue moon
whereas I broke we don't even see you no
more your your goals you get what I'm
saying
house teachable treating you teacher was
good man teachable is but that bad is
way better than you to me I want to make
a video about this um you too means you
to me is it's like robbery I think you
know means I feel bad like now me
looking at the numbers after a while
like I feel bad like for Steven Grider I
don't know why Steven grad is still on
you to me because Steven Grider Coastie
I mean co-ceo he he's he's part of the
company by now he's like they having all
the commercials they have him or
everything so he makes a lot of money
but guys like Steven Grider even that
guy from
here our Maximilian's whatever the
German guy like those guys they do a lot
of good work man they do a lot of good
work they putting a lot of hours because
creating tutorials and courses is not
easy guys it's not it's not like you
come in and you just be like hey you
just freestyling you know whenever I
freestyle something I'll make you free
alright cuz there's a freestyle of
course alright but when you come in and
you put in that time it takes time to
edit it takes time to do everything plan
it out do a whole bunch of stuff and you
know there's some guys who even have
animations on their videos and it's like
all that stuff takes so much time it's
not even funny so you to me doesn't pay
you nothing for every ten dollars that
you make no for every ten dollars that
the course sells right you make three
dollars because the person who like I
say affiliates they take your link and
they promote your link so every time
that you you come in and you buy a
course from you to me that person only
makes three dollars which is like
robbery like that's straight-up like
robbing somebody when you think about it
and it's kind of messed up there's a lot
of koi so that's a lot of courses that
even people hit me up and be like damn
Joe this courses that you have here that
I will pay forty fifty dollars for it
and it's like you gotta fill dirt cheap
and I'm like yeah because it's worth it
right I rather you guys having for cheap
let me give you a high price but like of
course like you know like Steven Grider
like a lot of his what development
courses I think they're worth to forty
fifty dollars you get what I'm saying
like they were free but you didn't me
only pays two three dollars like that's
crazy
so teachable luckily as you guys could
see like that's what I've been saying
from the beginning teacher like coding
phrase calm because I haven't really
it's on udemy but it's not really I
don't make no money from you to meet you
nummies it's pretty much helping me pay
taxes that's what you do means therefore
like everything that I learned from you
to me is just to pay taxes like it's not
for nothing at all yeah top tool is talk
to is good talk toes good way
sometimes top tool is like I don't know
it's like they want you they want you to
take like three tests they want you to
do a whole bunch of stuff I'm like I
don't have time for that to be honest as
I came an you give me the task you give
me whatever you want me to build and I
build it for you I don't have time to be
you know to sit down and take a test for
free if there was to pay me and be like
hey you gotta take this test for 3-4
hours and you're gonna get paid cool
I'll take it but I'm not gonna take a
three for our test come in and be like
hey man it's free you be like wait what
you're not gonna pay me for that time so
he's like I haven't I don't really mess
with top two like that checking some
stuff over here
let me see if you want to take them come
on let me see what else
yo can you make a video about why you
moved to Connecticut analyst it's
killing me to find out that you buy a
house or rent or what okay I could talk
about it maybe I'll make a video about
it why did I move to Connecticut
number one is way cheaper here compared
to New York crisis right the house where
I live at could have probably easily
been like three thousand dollars in in
New York City easily um am i paying
$3,000 no I'm paying half of it I am
paying half of like three thousand what
else is comfortable this is not that far
from New York City I wanted to move to
Arizona but it would have been too far
from the family I still got my mom who
lives in New York I still my girls still
got her mom who lives in New York so I
needed to be close right we could have
probably moved to Jersey but I feel
Jersey is dirty I'm sorry for the people
who are Jersey for Jersey but I find
like if I move to Jersey I failed in
life like that's how I feel about Jersey
you know it's not against the people I
moved to from New York to Jersey I feel
like I failed so you know so then I say
you know what I'm almost to Connecticut
so we still close to New York City but
we outside of New York City and you know
what we live as comfortable is pretty
nice you know pretty good neighborhood
it's not ratchet at all I haven't seen
one ratchet person in the neighborhood
like if you go to the city yeah of
course you're gonna see some
wretchedness but where I live at is it's
comfy you know I mean like this comfy I
haven't seen one ratchet person I
haven't even seen one person outside
that's how good the neighborhood is
that's how I like it you know me I like
to keep my stuff bougie out here like if
I don't see nobody in the neighborhood
gray
eight that's what I wanted to know how
much of the school the schools around
here are super expensive which tells me
hey the people that live around here got
bread so nobody wants what I have you
know what I mean I'd like to feel like
that I always tell people like this man
you gotta move to a neighborhood where
your person there cuz that motivates you
you know what I'm saying you want to
move to somewhere where you're poor
you're poor there you know cuz if you
move to an area where you're the Big
Shot you're the Big Willy that's never
good
because envy you know it's like sixteen
I say ladies area yeah man so you want
to move to a place where you're the
poorest person there you know I mean
it's like that's the way to motivate
yourself that's the way to live in a
good area live in a good neighborhood
you know and be good you got what I'm
saying so that's what I did that's why
I'm insane yeah now if he was like don't
you know and I'm not talking bad about
nobody in Jersey guys don't take it back
you know don't think you're bad you know
it's just every every ratchet friend
that I have that have moved to Jersey
has not been good for them so it's like
I'm not moving to New Jersey
yeah man you don't mean take seven well
you mean takes it's like this for ten
dollars you get like 350 350 usually the
affiliate or person whoever's the fella
associates you know people who share
your link you know they come in and they
get like three dollars and fifty three
dollars in signing and then whatever is
left you and me takes so yeah so it kind
of sucks man I'm saying Kelvin Davis
what website has your friends tried to
get see here to chill mercy well
teachable is really more of teacher was
a platform so teachable I'm paying
teachable for hosting older videos
that's it that's all they do they're not
really there to sell courses they're not
really there to sell anything all they
sell is the hosting it's as if I was to
host everything in AWS so I pay them a
set price no matter how many videos I
put in so you know it's actually super
cheaper than me hosting it on AWS cuz if
I put it on AWS I gotta keep updating
the the the freaking how you call this
the servers I keep on being more
bandwidth I gotta put in more RAM to the
server and this just now cuz there's
more traffic like they handle everything
for me for a set price so you know I
mean is I got paid I think it's like
$100 to teachable and then everything
else it's profit to me
like you can't you can't beat that
yeah I still want to move to Arizona man
I think Arizona is it has a lot of
potential man don't sweat the people who
are now dedicated good yeah Jersey got
the hood for Italy's word go to alpine
New Jersey for Wayne
I hate ratchet I want to see something
get every tax it was he I'm reading what
everybody's saying
she I've got to mean on you Hampshire
Rhode Island route for instant has no
state tax yeah that's true
yeah one more to another country at one
point
yeah jerseys horrible oh my god I'm
sorry I'm not moving to New Jersey not
even if they pay me yeah man but you
know what it is I also - it's not always
you see that's what I'm saying key
Kelvin like look at that
six hundred bucks for a mortgage like
that's nice you know what I mean like
that's that's what it was calling me for
for Arizona like I could go over and buy
a crib and literally the rest of
everything that I have is just profit
it's just for me to say for you know be
able to do investments or be able to
open up my business or it's for other
stuff you know what I mean so it's crazy
damn man Kelly is like yeah why do you
think I was able to quit my job to learn
this I'm home for six months at least
word yeah that's what I'm saying you
know what I mean and that's the same
thing for me he's like you know I was
like here in Connecticut like I couldn't
literally like look I sneeze I sneeze
on the floor and I'll find the money for
the rent I could sneeze on the floor and
literally just find the money for a
renter such cheap it is when you think
about it so it's like that pressure of
me having to come in and have like
$7,000 $8,000 a month on just on bills
and renting all of this stuff can't be
doing this especially if I want to I
want to grow and I want to create my own
business I want to do all this other
stuff cuz it's like all my money is
going to rent going to bills and a whole
bunch of stuff so I said eff that man
let me down sighs let me move to
somewhere cheaper somewhere where you
know I was thinking I was like yo I was
even thinking about paying the rent for
the whole year in one shot I was like
yeah I should just pay the rent in one
shot you gonna say and just just chill
for the whole year like you know that me
that's why I moved on I was like you
know what eff that man like we good you
know right now I could you know if I was
like still like living in New York I
will have to go back to work probably
because to maintain everything you know
it's like it costs a lot of money you
know and it's like I'm the type of
person that I don't like to just to lift
check by you know check to check I hate
that I hate living like that because
it's like I spent my whole life living
like that my whole life living like that
with with my family you know like my mom
never had no more
nothing so it's like for me to live that
life again as an adult I'm not doing it
sometimes you got to do it man
and I just like as far as I go to
another country like I want to I'm dying
to to move to another country like I
wouldn't mind going to like dr4 you know
a year six months go to Thailand for
three months
like I've been dying to do that you know
if I I'll be honest I wouldn't have had
a caring I would probably went to
Thailand by now because I was planning
this whole thing everything that you
guys have seen for the past year like
this wasn't something that I did one
another like I had all of this planned
to quit my job saving enough money to be
able to be good for a whole year
you know if with the money that I see I
couldn't went to Thailand me by myself I
would've went to Thailand and lived over
there for like two three years straight
up like you would have seen me your boy
out there like yours your boy Joe out
here Shane my we out here in Bangkok you
know what I mean
we know Bangkok we out here in Bangkok
but we don't Bangkok you know what I
mean
so and that would have been the videos I
would have been out there just like that
but that's how it is man what's with
Thailand Thailand man it's cheap man if
you want it like let's say for you guys
you guys right now yes starting a lot of
you guys don't have no families you have
nothing if you want to get a business or
startup going the best place for you to
go is to move to a place like Thailand
where your rent
it's like 200-300 dollars a month right
and then give a cost of living two
hundred dollars and then everything that
you have is money that you can invest in
to you
online business like people come in and
they make mad money because they they
have to capital you know when you work
here and you work let's say you make
five thousand dollars a month right but
out of that five thousand dollars all
you have is like five hundred dollars
left after paying all your bills and
doing everything and eating in and going
out to eat and gas and all that stuff
and all you have left is five hundred
dollars to invest on anything you're
always gonna be a slave to the system
but when you have the opportunity to say
hey I'm gonna earn five thousand dollars
a month but all I have to spend is six
hundred bro that's my profit you get are
saying like all of that is is like crazy
now you don't even have to get a
Thailand citizenship you just switch up
you if you're an American you go and
cross the border you go to like you go
to Vietnam you go to what's the other
one
Myanmar and you just cross the border
and soon as you cross the border and you
stamp your your your freaking passport
and you just go right back into Thailand
when you do that it's as if you started
for fresh because I think you can only
be in Thailand for like three months at
a time so you keep going to the border
every three months you go to the border
and come back into Thailand now of
course the tile ankles Jeff Johnson's
like your tan is probably too because
sex is cheap of course you know if
listen if rent is cheap the sex is gonna
be cheap but are you there for that nah
you know what I mean like to be honest I
would be scared like you know it sounds
good on paper I think to me like all
that stuff like going to like those
countries and having the freaking
prostitutes it sounds good on paper but
in real life I'm scared as hell I will
would do that because it's like
you're exposing yourself to how many
dudes those girls be freaking you know
banging out over there in a date you
know what I mean it's like if you came
in last and the last guy just had like
gonorrhea so crazy like that
now you got it cuz she wanted to get it
for cheap I ain't trusting that at all
it's like I'm not touching nobody out
there like even if I were to bring out
this single in my head I don't even know
if any of the girls who are local are
not even prostitutes you know what I
mean like there was this guy on YouTube
who was like oh yeah you know it's like
I have a lot of you know Thailand Thai
girlfriends and this and that and I'm
like girl how do you know them chicks
when you you know when you go home and
she goes home she's not really a you
know a Thai prostitute you know I mean
like that's how I look at it I'm like I
wouldn't even want to deal with that you
know some girls even in the yard when I
was like 16 years old right I'll never
forget this story man this is a real
story there was this girl called Ileana
who I know from back in the days when I
was like maybe like four years old five
years old I used to live in New York and
me and this girl used to you know go and
make out you know you and your locate
you know you have like this girl who
lives next door and you go out you
freakin Macau and this and that I was
like one of my first kisses right like I
was like five six years old whatever
when I come back she bad she bad bad bad
alright I'm out there right and I'm
chilling with this chick and then my
family that I oh man they got him right
I was like 16 right but I know her since
like five six years old
so my cousins they're like oh man they
got you I was like what you mean they
got me is I bro she comes she with
every guy that that comes from New York
like you're like a seasonal you know
like you're like the summer thing you
know she got a
winter thing she got a spring thing she
got a full thing like you know
elzar oh man that's true and then from
there I dropped that chick you know
that's that's just how it is so it's
like after that I'm like how many girls
don't do that in those countries you
gotta run saying like they know they bad
you go out there you from the US they
know why you're there so they you know
it's like you like a summer thing you
know I mean you're there for like for
like two three oh yeah that's my

know like I wanna say like I would I
will go to Thailand just straight for
the for the experience and for being
able to save money that's it besides
that I would never even want to touch
anybody out there I just wouldn't be
able to trust them you know I mean
