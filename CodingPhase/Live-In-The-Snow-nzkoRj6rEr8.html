fridge right now like
a little watered down probably missing
oh hell yeah

how it supposed to taste
it's not bad baby Jules can I go back
like no juice she left her Tamarindo
Jews inside a car like two days ago
Wednesday and I'm like you you still
you're still good drinking this juice
you go sailing
that's not milk that's not you know
that's not food it's cold outside that's
like leaving it in the fridge and coming
back to it you know what I'm saying
are you left it in the car come back to
me come back to that month
mega machine it's like Tamarindo word
you don't know tom buddy no oh man you
gotta get your game on man were you from
what country you from man like Tom
arenas all over the world
somebody knows everywhere that's
tropical
Jacob was like yo there's no you good
like that juice is good right now how
about that's like a slushie right now
that got frozen in the car that's
how you know it is cold outside man come
back so days later pick up a pick up a
drink
I mean this is not like what with this
kid Emilio one of my friends and many
are from like six seventh grade we go to
his house right
he spent like four days in my house and
then I go and drop him off to his house
and there was like there was like three
pieces to three slices of pizza or his
on table he goes are all sure I forgot
to eat this like three days later
they've been depending outside now in
the fridge not owner or not in 9co and i
refrigerator it's just like like open he
goes I audition is still good
three days later like I still eat this
now by this game only Brian Lee Brian
one time he dropped on our full feet
long are you gonna meet Patti on the
floor on mud he picked it up wiped it
down saying two-minute rule I picked it
up it just started eating baby probably
was
it says black infernal says Joe how
fishy is it that there's company hiring
entry-level developer no experience they
trained I don't know decent amount
already but it seems fishy I mean most
likely what they're gonna do is they're
gonna hire you for like $12 an hour $14
an hour but hey if you know nothing
about web development and somebody comes
in and tells you hey we're gonna train
you and pay you while training you
that's not bad that's actually good
because a lot of people right now our in
da house
learning how to code and they don't have
a job so it's like you might as well do
it you know what I mean like you might
as well work over there and at the same
time learn you know what I'm saying so
it's not bad get some money in your
pocket and still learn
you know sometimes we think like we we
want everything right Under the Sun it's
like wow I was saying there's a video
that I haven't put up yet which I
believe is the title is you don't
deserve it I don't know if I I think I
deleted I recorded I'll delete it but it
was basically about talking about you
know people who don't take jobs because
they feel like oh I could get a better
job right but then they spent four
months four or five months looking for
that better job so it's like they spent
four months without no money in their
pocket just because they think you know
there's people out there getting
$100,000 now man if somebody comes in
and gives you 50 60 take it you work
there and then you apply for that
$100,000 job while you still working
there and then once you get it you're
gonna hey guys thank you for the
opportunity I'm out and then you go to
the next job
there's no loyalty when it comes to jobs
man and I'll tell people all this time
like when you work at a place yes you
can like the people yes you could enjoy
working with them but there's no loyalty
in it the company doesn't have loyalty
for you the business don't have loyalty
for you if you know if the sales start
going down and they need to fire
somebody and they fire you they're not
alive I've been having conversations
Farage a look at this
the old bri-bri without I saw your
performance that looks hot man I'm glad
you're back on you on track man no wait
a singing thing huh gotta get on this
mop
maybe I'll call you back okay
tarjay you gotta be bougie with it
tarjay is not target target seems cheap
tarjay means like you know there's a
little upper class
that's like one of my my boys like man I
don't like talking about the dollar
store I told about the bees store
because you said the D store is like it
sounds like nobody knows what it is the
D store go to the D story copying bees
who's the thief Lord how people's that
says thee store there
so when people will be like these what
manager I don't know what you want me to
park it there is no closer that was the
closest thing yeah

I hate floats if I'm stronger in grid
then painting bullish icon who will hurt
will that hurt me while looking for a
job
no it's just CSS grids is good but it's
not good for every situation because you
spend more time trying to align things
it's the same way yes
yeah it's the same thing as flex boxes
like flex boxes are good for certain
situations but now for everything I've
seen spend more time trying to align
things in in a flex flex box way and
it's like man you could have done that
in two seconds
we're flows like literally so that's
like one of the things that I have like
my little pet peeves are you call it
stinks out here like the sewer
let it go
yeah Marissa CSS bits is good but not
for every situation I wish people will
understand that it's like all those
things are tools they don't mean that
they are placing other things
