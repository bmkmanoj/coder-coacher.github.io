at it again coding face.com so listen
this is what's happening with YouTube
today I don't know since when did it
starts and started last nice and started
in the weekend or one exactly to start
happening well pretty much if you search
my channel name coding phase or you
search for anything as far as like any
type of channel out there if you click
on a channel you're gonna get error
you're gonna see right now 500 internal
server error I mean this got a
ridiculous because this is YouTube this
is Google this is like the top at the
top so for this to be happening is kind
of crazy
alright so most people the way how they
find your your channel is by doing a
search right the going and do a search
of your name the channel's name and
basically it shows them everything right
luckily right now if we click on an
individual video I can still see the
video completely we can still see the
video but if we was to be like hey man
I'm watching this video I like this
person's content and I want to actually
subscribe to the video can you subscribe
I don't know but I know for sure that if
you click on the the name of the channel
and you try to go to the channels URL
you're like hey man I want to watch more
videos by this person for some reason
it's just not working we got some Google
monkeys working on it but I just don't
know how this happened right but they
trying to do some changes I don't know
why exactly they're working on but I
just know that 500 turn a server error
on YouTube
which pretty much means a lot of people
are gonna miss out on a lot of content
from everybody so you know visit my
website coding face.com guys this is the
best place to get in contact with me

touch with me I'm also gonna be linking
