okay so boy Jill back out of the game
man coding fees.com
your boys back in I didn't did it again
one more time
we in here we live we check we're doing
this for for the two right now and
today's topic dangerous but you know
since you're an expert like you boy you
know when you come to a certain level of
you tubing on the car that's what we do
but today's topic is you always see your
family Samaritan code
you owe it to yourself why do I say that
to me you know because I was just
thinking about it man like right now we
be my fee and baby ether we out here
looking for a new crib and I was just
thinking about I was like man like we
were to a spot right where people were
trying to rent a house for a level of
hundred dollars but for like three
months for three months listen to this
three months people haven't been able to
rent it anything because people have bad
credit people have the duplex yeah for
like three months people haven't been
able to rent it because they have bad
credit they have no income you know and
one of the things that one of the guy
was settling he's like yeah you know
most people in this area the area where
we want to go see that that duplex most
people they don't earn anything you know
like they they earn like what twenty
five thousand thirty thousand dollars a
year and you know a lot of you guys
probably at the same level in not to
bring you guys down you know what I mean
but that's like that's not money you
know I really so for this real estate is
like here most people that come here we
can't even rent it out to them at that
price you know what I mean like what
that sounded whatever they Ernie you
know what I mean because the owners are
looking for somebody with ok income and
a good credit and one of the main
reasons why people have bad credit is
because they can't afford things right
it's like right now you want to buy a
laptop right well you don't have the
money for it you need the laptop but now
you're gonna have to get yourself in
debt for that laptop but what happens if
you work at Best Buy or you work at our
freaking you know Macy's or you work at
Toys R Us or you work or whatever
freaking you know Dunkin Donuts you know
that laptop might be 2000
dollars twenty-five hundred dollars for
you that's a lot of money you know to
come in and pay that now god forbid you
know you're jobless you owe for you know
God forbid to cut your hours now you you
can't even afford to pay you back right
and when you think about is like it's
not that much money but it's because the
system is so rigged and so messed up
that even if you work a regular job it's
not enough for you to earn and be able
to pay all your bills on time and be
able to do everything that you need to
do so I was just thinking about that was
like man what if pray now I wouldn't
have freaking been doing this like I was
like so little wifey's there was a point
where I was doing with like limo service
like like that's like like a taxi cab it
was a really a taxi cab boy it's like
limo service like they call and they
have like saying you know that's another
story but at some point I did that for
like good tools and then I quit I was
like missing for me there's more like
man this is
oh it's so go I'm seen one chillin I
don't need to do that guys it's gonna
happen at some point
all right and even if you just wanted to
be single ah him and I have no family I
want to live my what type of life is is
that that you can't even afford to do
the most minimum things you know I mean
so you owe it to yourself if you don't
owe it to your family because you don't
have one you owe it to yourself like
biggie that things is gonna come to you
because you know I'm gonna leave it to
the universe man I'm gonna hey man Jesus
grab the wheel listen Jesus is gonna be
like your mom I could grab the wheel
from one side but you got to grab the
wheel from the other side I can't do
both hands you know
Jesus is like I can't do both hands out
here kid you gotta grab one side of the
wheel - you know what I mean so you
can't just be out here leaving it to
destiny it's like you gotta make you
oldest I'm just gonna let this happen
yeah
somehow we'll be okay the moment you
start thinking like that it's like
you're giving up man because things are
not gonna be okay that's how light it is
man life is a bitch you like it or not
the moment thing oh I think this is
gonna be okay
it's not gonna be okay things is not
gonna work themselves out you got to
work that up you gonna say like
you're gonna be like man I'm gonna stay
at this job you know God is good people
is good they're gonna give me a manager
position in five years from now
no they not let's be honest no they're
not they're not gonna give you a man and
just like just not that's how life is
you know what I mean if you stay there
but I owe you if I work hard and I show
up every day on time that does not
matter you still get income increase or
a year
it's like what the hell you're gonna do
it you're not gonna earn anything you
know we don't live in a world where you
know teaching we barter for you know for
whatever it's like it's not like back in
the days I could come to you in Malay
and I would and you're like oh I got
some milk you want some milk from the
cow like and we barter for that like nah
the world is not there no more we
already been passed that it's all about
money out here hold on the money wave
the green way the blue cheese swing you
get what I'm saying so how do you even
make money on you gotta work hard
you can't just leave it for destiny you
know that was nice rising his team over
there's not team over to there's not a
team to use for small
it doesn't matter what company you go to
that's the only thing that out of this
whole net neutrality thing I sorta need
to fix that they need to give a service
to everybody you know they're gonna
charge XYZ amount extra for the internet
like I better be having 4G 5g everywhere
I go like this is ridiculous we in 2017
and we still walking around with 3G

everything goes good we might be moving
to Connecticut a little move try
something new
go from one of the suburbs to the
suburbs no for the submerged to the
woods I don't even know how people do it
like when people move like across the
country that seems annoying because I'm
moving from one state that's next to
another state and I'm already annoying

man no service is good out here man you
