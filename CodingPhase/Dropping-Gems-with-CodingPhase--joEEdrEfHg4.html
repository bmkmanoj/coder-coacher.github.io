the back came out the front came out
from under below the house with a base
man right now kids so what up see boy
job back at it again encoding face calm
your boy is back in ID and did it again
listen kids we got the lights we got we
got the little little spot you know this
way what a magic goes down you know I
mean yes sir man you you know your boy
out here with a polo pulling out the
polo real quick cuz it was a little bit
cold down here I said let me throw some
flashy real quick oh wait just nothing
fancy nothing crazy just I don't want to
pull out the beep you know so let's just
pull out the polo still classy you know
what I mean so anyways guys let me see
who's in here man let me see who's live
with me right now let me make sure I see
you guys see you guys in the chat row
let me open this up listen guys today is
gonna be a little bit different I don't
know if I'm will bring any more people
into the live show but I want to answer
some questions you know what I mean
night time for those of you guys that
can make you on Tuesdays now you get
your boy on Thursday nights you know a
little quick no dad little dab season
real quick you know socially out here
you know the originator the young flow
of this you know this young swag you
know we started this man you're my damn
props you know you know what I mean
I can't be in here like that kid natural
so what's good what's the questions any
questions guy leave a question there man
I'm answering everything tonight
whatever you want to know about being
here man Wolfpack you already know we
grant so okay so what's good what do you
think of the transition from JavaScript
to PHP cut our learning in a week I'm
pretty good at JavaScript
I mean as far as programming wise you
know learning to program in PHP yeah you
can learn in two days to be honest with
you right because once you already know
all the concepts of JavaScript like
functions or variables or strings you
know integers freaking effing else
statements like best programming right
like you already know it so every
language out there is gonna have
something similar they might need me a
little bit different but you know PHP is
almost like JavaScript okay now - that
you don't have to deal with the DA now
you just being a with programming so if
you're comfortable with JavaScript and
you understand how things work with
programming you can definitely bring
those skills into PHP and anything that
you might not know that you might say
Tim how do I do this cuz PHP has a lot
of different methods guys I'll be honest
PHP has like a many methods that they've
added to the language over the 20 years
that has been around right I think 10 or
20 years I don't know how long it's been
or what it's been here since the 90s
right so with PHP like once you you you
know how to do a certain thing and you
say hey I don't know how to do this
method I don't know how to you know
something specific like the
documentation is there you literally do
a quick google search and you're gonna
see that hey there's a method for it
okay so as far as that is gonna be easy
now working with the back end you got to
understand the different concepts you
gotta understand off you know you got a
render a page
like let's say if you're working with a
framework you gotta understand the
framework I understand how the routes
work how the routing system works how
you know how to connect to the database
those things are the things that might
take you a little while maybe like an
extra two lays but then after that you
should be fine man it's not gonna be
that bad
so anyways right what else what else let
me know anything you guys wanna know I'm
out here we live and I'll do this thing
for you guys I was feeling a little bit
sick today but I say listen man I put it
on the hood er I coming downstairs let's
do this live alright so let's see
leblanc uh Monique I see you you say you
lost your job so you started to do some
freelance okay so she says what do you
think about using platforms like beaver
or like Elementor and stuff to cut time
I don't even know what that to be honest
with you I'm not even gonna lie to you I
don't know what the hell is that I don't
even know what the hell is Elementor and
beaver I have never heard of that what
is that to be honest with you I'm like
what I've never heard of beaver
okay so let's see what else
any other questions man Joe and Omar
will be a good video to watch yeah
whenever the doors are open they're me
Kevin Durant Kevin Davis says you get
rid of the asbestos on they're gonna get
coating face toward your setups alone I
mean I got a couple of stuff here man I
got a couple of things already set up
you know I got the lights you know I got
the thing yeah I was gonna set this up I
was gonna hook this up but the problem
is I don't know I can't really be in
here for too long
or maybe it was because it was super
cold when I first came in that first
week now I'm fine I'm here you know what
I mean I got I haven't set everything up
all I got a whole bunch of equipment
stuff that I can use but I'm also too
lazy you know what I mean like that's
one of the main reasons why I'm doing so
much live strings - because it's like a
live stream it's like I could just come
here and talk to you guys answer your
questions hang out do all the stuff what
I'm doing videos I have to go in there
set up the camera set up the studio
lights set up freakin what else
definitely editing then on top of that I
gotta think about the topics I got to do
everything you know I mean so it's like
plus I'm doing online businesses and
like it's a lot of stuff so may become
so much so yeah I don't know if I'm
gonna set everything up I mean I bought
order equipment I got everything here so
I could just set it up but maybe in the
future I wasn't thinking about I was
gonna return a return a lot of the stuff
that I bought but then I say you know
what I'm gonna keep it because my goal
is to open up like a loft like a studio
a proper studio in just like build
different a ground up in half like a
place where I could gold so instead of
working here from a house work over
there so that's the goal but let's see
hopefully by the end of the year I could
do that okay so let me see the skill
factor who was a skillful factor says
hey you have a question if there are
wordpress jobs I want to hire you should
you take it even though you're still
learning well I'm getting good with
react what does having a good job with
getting on offer with WordPress and
react have to do anything like listen if
you're getting off right if you're
getting offers just take the damn excuse
me take the damn job man like I keep
hearing people saying like oh man I
don't know if I should take it if you
never worked as a developer you don't
really have a choice that's your first
job I see people that come in and be
like oh man I'm just kind of way into
the right job I'm gonna way into this
perfect place and like now man
go ahead the first
the highest in taking and then from
there you're gonna have all the options
that you want well at first it's like
who the hell is you to be choosing which
job you gotta take like to be honest I'm
just being real with you you know it's
like yourself to use some random dude on
the internet learning stuff online
like that's how companies think right
I'm being honest with you that's how
companies think and I know because I've
been in both sides you know the side of
being a developer trying to get my first
job in them being somebody who is a
senior developer hiring new you know new
junior developers who are either coming
from way an associate's degree or a
bachelor's degree in computer science
and guys who are coming in with just
like hey I watch a team treehouse
bootcamp whatever are you to me free
context whatever right so get your foot
in this door man like just get in there
stop asks asking and worrying about man
I want to be doing you know I think this
is crazy I think some guys need a man I
want to be working in you know what's
golang and this is what I want to focus
in maybe later I wanna focus on Python
and it's like somebody was trying to
hire me as a front-end developer but I I
declined the job because I'm gonna
become a gold lamé developer inside burn
like why are you talking about like
somebody trusted you and you're gonna
wait here until that that perfect that
perfect job out there like it doesn't
work like that just get hired in any
company there from there you're good and
then after you're there for like a few
months then you start applying to your
dream jobs but guys is your first job
nobody knows you you get what I'm saying
that's like you come to a block think
about it like this is that you come to
Lovelock nobody knows you and then you
tell somebody hey man I'll try to cop
side dude nobody knows you nobody's
nobody is vouching for you
like we don't know you like you're not
gonna get nothing on the block you know
what I'm saying like that's just how it
is that's real life you know and even
though this the corporate world you know
but nobody wants somebody who who
doesn't even know
what they're doing with was there cold
you know they're not gonna trust you you
know what I'm saying so if a company
does trust you then be grateful to take
that job in there from there oh boy okay
anything else man let me know what else
I'm out here answering questions guys
give me some good questions that you
guys might have or Christopher Taylor
says no hug credit word dudes coming in
here like yo can I get a a salami on
credit it's like bro now hear me you
could go to the a raps with that you
know I mean that's not a b-boy word let
me see
go make a non-profit website or pimp it
out what I'm reading what people saying
here okay so what's easier to learn PHP
or react if you know the front-end you
know HTML CSS and JavaScript they react
there's gonna be a little bit easier
right how do you know it's easier than
PHP I think PHP might be easier for some
people because to get to the level of
react you got to know a lot of concepts
and you got to know how to work with
object you've got to know how to work
with es6 you got to know how to work
with webpack gold like all those things
it's like package with react like
reactants like a more advanced developer
like that's why people get pay a lot of
money because it's not some random dude
that's got a pickup react right and
react comes with a lot of different
things too you gotta know Redux you
gotta know react router you gotta know
find the right library if you want to
use forums me personally I write my own
forms and validators but I see guys that
they they gotta find the right one and
this this and that is like it's a big
thing now PHP PHP is just PHP is a
programming language and then it's so
easy because if you want to see
something on the browser you can just
say hey
index dot PHP and it's just like HTML
you know where you could just write your
code there and everything is in one file
now that's in the beginning okay later
on you gotta learn a framework like
laravel then from there you know you
just gotta follow the instructions that
lerigot has and you're gonna be fine so
it should be easier when you really
think about it cuz react has a lot of
concepts that most people can get it in
one shot you know PHP you could go in
there but also this is how you do this
this is how you you know get a get
parameter using this how you save stings
from performs like it's that easy but
with react there's a lot of concepts
that you gotta learn yeah in PHP is a
lot bigger but the problem is there's
not that many concepts PHP is just a
programming language and if you know the
web you're fine with react there's a lot
of stuff like you need to know
functional programming like when you
really think about it if you're gonna
know re write something I read Redux
like you gotta know functional
programming if not it becomes difficult
so I was like it's not that easy
Rohan says another question of what is
easier people keep asking what's easier
like yeah I gotta get something else man
ok Rohan says I know the front end what
is easier to learn PHP over your note
now I will say PHP is super easy ruby is
fun node is cool but you got to do a lot
of stuff manually with nodejs
so it's like if you don't understand how
they should TP your request you don't
understand how a lot of stuff works with
no with note is like you gotta know like
the lower level of like the web de veau
I don't know if that makes sense to you
guys like PHP a ruby like you don't even
have to be a good
and you can make an amazing application
now with node you really need to know
your shape it's not like you gotta go in
there oh I'm just gonna you know put a
little string and tie it around put some
gum on it and it's an application now
like you need to know your shit and note
all right so let me see what else what
is a book you recommend or of course
that will help you build a single page
app if you want to know about single
page app I have a course on my website
called learn react with well learn react
by building our Exodus car like that's a
full single page app now if you want to
learn with angular or something else
like there's probably a whole bunch of
them on udemy so go check it out go find
something on udemy to try it out what's
easier being lazier Grande code out of
the grind code out every day word being
lazy of course oh okay why are you 13
progressive web apps what are my
thoughts on it I mean it's a cool
technology I think every year JavaScript
surprises us or anyways somebody creates
something new something better than
whatever was last year and new
technologies browsers are being updated
all the time so they come up with
something new and now we are looking
like little rats following the cheese to
relearn something new which is the same
thing that we were doing last last year
but in a different way so we don't think
about it I think it's cool now do I
follow a have I created progressive web
apps I'm not really focusing on that
because to me progressive web apps is
like not every website out there needs
it right it has to be a specific website
where you have like a service that you
say okay if I'm using the service and
for whatever reason I
my internet connection I want this
website to continue running on the phone
and still working right like let's say
an example like a calculator let's say
an example it sounds dumb but a
calculator right if you have a
calculating you'll be able to to run
your calculator and even though you're
on the ground you're gonna be able to
calculate whatever math things that you
want to add or multiply whatever you
want to do right so that's something
that you will say hey I would like this
to be a progressive web app that they
could use it even without no internet
okay but like let's say your website
like Facebook or Instagram for it to be
a progressive web app wouldn't freakin
matter because in reality when you think
about it like a social media website you
wanna see what's out there
live so if you don't have no internet it
doesn't really matter all right I hope
that makes sense like if you don't have
no internet
nobody's gonna really want a progressive
web app for that it has to be like some
type of service that you need it to be
offline I've seen people trying to
create their websites as progressive web
apps with a portfolio and as I bro like
what are you doing nobody saving your
website into their browser nobody's even
you gotta seventh nobody's saving you
your website like they'll go visit to
your website and that's it they move on
like nobody cares about that you know
people also too just because something
is new doesn't mean that you have you
gotta jump on it man if you're not
working in that type of industry where
you creating services you learning
progressive web apps is really wasting
your time you go what I'm saying like
people come in and say hey man I want
you to start learning like let's say
even react native or I react native it's
cool but if you could go into react
Nader super deep into and you're like
wait why am i learning this like why am
I putting so much time into it none of
the companies that I work for or the
industry that I work for they're looking
for somebody to create mobile apps so
why am I wasting my time
learn react native I hope that makes
sense to people like you know I mean
like figure out what's your your meet
figure out what's your industry and then
from there start learning the things
that you need in your industry you don't
learn things just because they just came
out you know so let me see what else
Kevin Lopez without without without
without la Blanca Monique do you have
any courses to learn all the JavaScript
concepts yes go to our website man sign
up use the link on the description for
ten bucks man like you can't go wrong
when you go to you to me and you buy a
course you're buying multiple courses
for ten bucks my website you sign up one
time per month you could probably finish
for four to five courses if you really
go hard right if you're doing a part
time you probably could do two courses
in a month so in reality you pay for two
courses for five dollars it makes sense
you're gonna say there's people who
signed up to my website back in July
when I did the fight out a special and
right now they paid $5.00 a month right
that was the best deal that anybody
could've got it right and till this day
they're still on the website so trust me
a lot of people get a lot of good things
out on the site so go check it out I
mean is legit is there really necessary
to learn get yes you don't have to be
the best like get guru alright just know
how to push how to merge how to not
break the build and that's it
that's all you really need you don't
need to become a a get expert like
nobody is looking for you to be a get
expert especially most companies they
already have everything set up
I've seen people you know spending so
much time and learning how how to set up
gay how to set up a buffer scratch and
it's like boy like you don't even need
that when you get hired at a company
you're a junior developer know
body is trusting you to actually build
the whole system for them all day one is
a extra hand like to be honest with you
anything that's complicated
they don't want junior developers
touching it that's the truth okay
that's why I mean in my website I focus
on the things that you're gonna need on
the job right I don't go into super
advanced topics you know I don't talk
about frameworks that are hot at the
moment I'll talk about things that's
gonna get you a job two things that is
gonna get you higher the things that
really you need it's not like you gotta
go in there and be like oh man I'm gonna
build this whole website from scratch
nobody does that when you a junior
developer most likely that whole company
already set up everything was already
set up for you all you have to do is log
in with your you know with your
information that's a skillful factor
says I know this is off topic but how's
the family and stuff all good on you and
everybody good family is good you know
we've been good we definitely been
chilling around here so yeah Oh Samia
diem go ahead man it goes down and up it
goes down
listen yeah just hit me on the DM man
send me an email coding phase at
gmail.com anything that you want to ask
me in private or you want to send me
privately you just send it there
and we'll be good you got what I'm
saying - yeah I haven't even resetted
this the viewer count
we definitely got way more than zero
listen make sure you subscribe make sure
you click on the notification you see
the little bell click on that man so you
so you don't miss anything man you who
actually show up to my live streams and
you go actually hang out with me okay so
let me see let me see let me see
check in the live chat tank happy says
how old are you
everybody knows I'm 30 years old man I'm
old man out here man I'm old I'm 30
years old boy do I need a portfolio firm
apply for software engineer position so
engineer I wouldn't say you need a
portfolio unless it has to do with
something with the web okay you
definitely want to show what type of
projects you've worked on and it would
be nice if you have a website that
actually shows the applications you
worked on or the companies that you
worked on so in reality your portfolio
is more like a resume you know a
portfolio is for you to explain your
projects the type of projects that
you've done if it's on the web and you
can show it to people you can show it to
them if now if it's something that you
can take screenshots of you can also do
that but when you're a software engineer
like it all depends on the skills that
you have man what languages do you know
what what's your background what's your
training
you know a lot of times you'll see that
they'll say software engineer and then
they're less like 20 different
categories of languages and in reality
they won't even tell you what's that
you're working on until you get there
and you're you're at least past the the
first interview so to be honest with you
I've only seen one like software
engineer position and it was for dotnet
which technically was kinda like web but
it was more for in-house
it was like an in-house inventory system
so I mean that's the only experience
I've had that I've seen any type of
software engineer interviews and stuff
like that but to my guess when somebody
is sending out emails and resume it
would be nice to have a website that
actually shows all your skills because
the person can actually go to your
website and see what the hell you've
done when a college student this is
something that a lot of college students
do they just send in a resume okay so if
you're a college student and you want to
become a software engineer and you go in
to a company and like let's say like
this somebody receives 200 there's
different resumes you know the ones that
are gonna stand out or the world started
gonna be from like Ivy League school
that's to be honest with you right if
the company is not getting like Ivy
League school students or whatever
they're gonna go in and look at whatever
portfolios they might have what type of
projects they worked on have they been
part of hackathons and things like that
so if you want to really like blow their
mind out be like yo I have a portfolio
or half of my projects I have details
what technologies I use like you wanna
it's like a way to present yourself so a
website is definitely gonna help you
okay let me see see yo what's up spread
in the stores yes
you know Yahoo spreading the sauce man I
see a lot of a lot of sauce around sauce
alia okay so let me see yo where do you
see what develop in the next 10 20 years
I see it in the same place where we at
Rana
I see it on the web like we probably
gonna be seeing a lot of JavaScript you
know 10 20 years definitely for sure
probably a new language is gonna come up
something that's kind of how you go
so whoever assembly I don't know if it's
gonna be JavaScript I don't know what
it's gonna be if it's typescript or
whatever is gonna be but I know for sure
that there's gonna be another language
that's gonna come after JavaScript
something that's gonna compile even more
to a lower level like web assembly so
once that comes out then it's a wrap you
know what I mean but this always gonna
be JavaScript and PHP sites Ruby on
Rails sites like there's always gonna be
those sites especially like technologies
like PHP or Ruby on Rails like when
something is proven that works people
stick with it you know people are a very
hesitant to jump into something new that
they don't know if they've been around
for that long you know maybe 10 years
from now no js' might be taking over
even more than what it is now but I
don't see is like the dethroning or
making everything else obsolete like you
know I mean okay so it's solid Brown say
you already know node and how to make
your own applications modules api's and
such there's a worth - PHP since
learning wait what is PHP worth learning
since it shouldn't be too hard since I
already know node yes of course that's
one thing I've told a lot of people to
like learn a PHP even if you know no
even if you know a Java or something
else like that if you want to become a
web developer you know this is something
that people have very confused if you
wanna be a game developer you do iOS you
do c-sharp
you do like Swift you do Android
development those are the things that
you focus on right if you want to become
a software engineer then you work with
languages are on the lower level
something that you could come in and say
hey I know C C++ C sharp like that's for
software right if you'd know the web if
you want to become a web developer PHP
is like 80% of the
whole internet PHP is the language of
the web right so people keep saying Oh
JavaScript JavaScript JavaScript yes
javascript is out there now but PHP is
the the language of the web like it or
not is like look online it's 80% was too
intimate you gotta say you think you
can't you can't like hide that from
anybody and be like oh it's nice it's
like it's like a standard you know of
course if you're gonna do anything in
the front end you need HTML CSS in
JavaScript but people get so confused
between seeing JavaScript being super
popular and they think like No - yes is
super popular it's like no that's not
the reality
javascript is popular because of the
front end because of the frameworks that
keep popping up angular react like every
company now needs a front-end developer
a front-end engineer somebody who knows
JavaScript and knows angular and react
right but people think what they do a
search or indeed and say damn and DS
showed up that you know there's a
hundred thousand JavaScript jobs and
it's like hey dummy that's because
javascript is like a standard now that
doesn't mean that there's a hundred
thousand no js' jobs so huge difference
okay so let me see what else they had
says Krishan doesn't have a portfolio
he's been a developer for one year yeah
but you're talking about people who are
the exception guys
look man to be honest with you guys if I
was to listen to anybody out here you
know for everybody that's on YouTube and
everything you know not even to
discredit nobody or to put anybody else
down or nothing it's just me being
honest I will listen to me
right why because I'm like the norm
right I'm like a developer who work hard
didn't get a job I'm so a year because I
wanted to master everything which is a
huge mistake right now Chris Sean II
dreaded therefore or like who else there
was somebody else who told me that they
they started in like two months or like
a month after they just started coding
like that's like the exception guys like
that doesn't happen every day that's
like people that come in on the internet
say hey I want the lottery and it's like
yeah they want the lottery that doesn't
mean that most of you guys are gonna win
the lottery you know what I'm saying so
it's like that's not what the examples
that you should try to take you should
always prepare yourself for the worst
you should never prepare yourself for
the best you should always think like
man I'm not gonna be able to get this
job if I don't have a fold if I don't
have a resume if I don't have to write
projects that's how you should think you
shouldn't be thinking like I'm gonna
wing this and I'm gonna show up and
somehow I'm gonna get the job no it
doesn't work like that most of you guys
is not gonna get that there was a good
thing that he said oh the dreaded depth
on one of his videos the other day we're
about being a remote developers 99% of
you guys are now gonna become the remote
developers on your first job it's not
gonna happen like stop looking at people
and think like oh this person got this
amazing situation happening to them it's
like let's be honest guys that becoming
a developer is like think about it I do
this like okay it's like going to the
NBA right there's people that go is
going to go to the NBA
Allah grafite was gonna go to the NBA
but Allah are gonna fail right now the
people that go to the NBA or day LeBron
James no not every single person is
gonna be LeBron James some prayers some
people they're gonna get the short end
of the stick it's just that's how it
works guys like it stop putting yourself
and like thinking like oh man this
person got a job in a month that's gonna
happen to me think negatively to be
honest with you think negatively and
when it comes to you it's a blessing but
when you're thinking oh man why didn't I
get higher in one month what is it I've
been hiring two months three months four
months five months six months seven
months eight months nine months now is a
year and you didn't get higher you're
like then this developers are so much
better than me this person's
so much better than me is like nah man
people are forgetting that little thing
that is a little factor that people
forget about and it's called luck right
you might go into the right interview
the person that was gonna get the
interview before you and he was gonna
get the job he got stuck in the elevator
now you showed up you went up the stairs
you got the job right the guy who was
gonna show up and in
tricking through coffee on his shirt now
he gotta go back home right you was
there so now you showed up hey you got
the job you gotta sound like this just
this little factor it's like why isn't
everybody a millionaire why isn't
everybody famous there's that little
factor that people forget about you know
how many good musicians are out there
millions do you know how many good
basketball players are out there
millions right so it's that little
factor that not everybody has and luck
is not like a magical thing luck is
something that happens that happens like
you are at the right place at the right
time that's what really luck is right
it's not really about all it's a magical
thing it's like Oh God God sprinkle a
little something on top of you know it's
being at the right place at the right
time that's it all right so stop
thinking like hey man this person that
this and I'm gonna be able to do that
think negatively until you get it that's
saying you're gonna be fine let me see
what else cause also two guys you gotta
keep you gotta keep an eye on what I
said the other day faking it until
you're making you know I keep seeing
people that keep bringing up people like
oh man this person is so so legit his
first thing is you know they got a
hundred thousand subscribers is like
guys that doesn't mean anything a person
might come in and have a million
subscribers that doesn't mean that they
are expert or anything or like they're
better than other people is
just how it is man there's like you
gotta also to like use your brain and
and be able to to take gems from
everybody but you have to make your you
know realistic reviews of how life is
man like right now you think you could
be preparing yourself the most right it
could be the best developer in your
house right and you say man I'm ready
now after a year of going to every
bootcamp shown to every meet up soon as
you cross the street you get hit by a
car now you lost your right arm that's
it now you're over here your one arm
Willy you know what I mean in the office
like you're gonna say now you're a
little bit slow and then all the other
developers like that's how life is
so think negatively and then when good
things happen to you
it's a blessing but yeah man okay with
this as most developers are here trying
to scheme the game like Zaza and Golden
State Warriors
you gotta grind it out guys you gotta
grind it out and just like you know do
your thing manually because somebody
doesn't have a portfolio like dice or
them you know like that's the exception
of the exception like they got that by
luck and that's I'm being 100% honest
like that doesn't happen you know I see
that all the time even you know like
let's say in the last company I was in
right this kid who came in who got hired
that was pretty much gonna take over the
spot that I had and I was like teaching
him a lot of stuff that I did and
whatever in the company like he got
hired by luck like literally we need a
extra developer we couldn't find nobody
that will go all the way to let you know
to bubble fucking in a line in and then
we was basically desperate
you know he was the last develop
to show up some guy showed up with nyema
portfolio he came in with a resume he
the other kid came in with a resume but
at least he had a degree so then we said
listen man we're just gonna have to take
this kid and train him and that's what I
did you know what I'm saying so that was
bad luck
that wasn't like a skill like hey he was
prepared he had the skills he he was a
great developer it was just like luck
you know what I mean so it's like hey if
you're you thinking like Chris Shawn
showed up there and it was like a man
krishana has a month two months in there
it's the best developer that's out there
probably not they needed the extra hand
like that's just being realistic to
things now is that gonna happen to you
hopefully we could all pray for it you
know what I mean we'll all be here light
up a candle for you but it's not gonna
happen
I don't know okay let me see
Hey Joe says hey Joe you heard of
ServiceNow what have you heard of a
ServiceNow I finally got an offer to
become a graduate ServiceNow developer
would this be a good start I don't know
what the hell ServiceNow developer I
don't know what the hell is that
yeah attitude counts and people skills
too you know like if you're going to
interview confidently and you make
people laugh they feel comfortable with
you hey we given this guy a chance you
know what I mean let's bring him in that
happens all the time
Bambi says so do you think five projects
include a portfolio interview prep job
can guarantee can be guaranteed yes
listen knowing everything that you need
to know HTML CSS JavaScript right if I
tell you hey build this page for me and
you can build it yes you're golden you
you got the first check now
if like my saying I don't know maybe we
should talk about this about skills wise
skills wise like how much money
like what type of jobs you can get into
so let's say HTML and CSS right you
could get to a $35,000 job to $45,000
job sometimes even more right if you
have a degree so if you have a
bachelor's degree in business and you
come in into a company and all you know
is HTML CSS you could get higher right
and get maybe 50,000 55,000 right if you
don't have a degree
your ass is stuck at 45 all right now
you know JavaScript right and I mean
knowing JavaScript by meaning like
JavaScript jQuery you know how to work
with Ajax you could go into a company
and say hey I'm ready I can build you
any website that you want and I know how
to deal with data then in dealing with
forms and pulse into the backend from
there you could come in and get anything
from 45 to 65 right to 65 now to touch
the seventy to seventy to eighty five
you gotta know one framework you got to
know at least one framework so you gotta
choose one whatever you your brain works
with right you gotta choose either
angular or you gotta choose to react
right and the reason why a lot of
companies put in angular react view
ember like the whole shebang of a whole
bunch of different frameworks is because
what they want to know is do you know
how to work with a framework if you know
how to work with a framework they can
teach you if you have the right skills
how to work with the framework that they
use you get what I'm saying so now for
70 to 85 thousand dollars that's what
you're gonna get
now anything above eighty five thousand
dollars it just comes with experience
nobody's out here the people that say oh
man I'm I'm getting you know a hundred
thousand dollar job in the first shot
man a lot of people are capping you know
what capping means capping is like when
you lie you say you got something in
your cabin you know a lot of people cap
man like straight up people lie people
say I'm doing this I'm getting paid this
and they're not getting paid that right
it feels better when some
comes in and tells you oh my god you got
pasted down-- much on your first job and
it's like nah they probably make like
enemy sometimes even 75,000 and they say
oh I'm earning $100,000 people'll I
think it's not even funny man I had I
don't know if I'll tell you guys the
story about the scare who used to work
with me in another previous company and
he was like oh man I'm going to Capital
One him in Maryland and I'm gonna get
hired for what was like eighty five
thousand dollars and then you start
looking into it and it's like senior
developers are making $85,000 I at
Capital One you're a junior developer
with a college degree you don't even
have experience never worked at a
company you did one internship you think
they're gonna pay you the maximum cap
for that position no you're gonna say so
people do capping capping is when you
just say oh I got this and in reality
you don't have that you know what I mean
people do that all the time and that's
why it comes back to what I said before
you know fake it till you make it you
know so yeah okay let me see what else
Jason e says what do you think about
bootstrap studio bootstrap studio is
great for a designer bootstrap studio is
great for somebody who is trying to be
productive with web development but
they're not there yet okay they're just
beginning okay when you're in the
beginning as a developer you gotta think
about like this you gotta have little
wins and wins at the end of the week
right so you want to say hey man I want
to build this cool website I want to
build something that looks nice and this
and that people they use something like
that like bull straps to do because they
might need it they might just say hey I
don't really know how to build this on
my own but I want to build something
that looks nice and it's nice and pretty
right or you could be the other type of
developer
where you have multiple clients and you
don't even have time to be coding
everything and you say hey I just need
something to create this little quick
landing page for this client and here
you go and get paid for it right
me personally I don't use none of those
tools because it doesn't make sense for
me when I could do that myself if I know
how to code why would I use something
that pretty much is like putting a
middleman in front of me for me to be
able to get something on the screen you
get what I'm saying like if I could do
it myself I don't need a middleman
in front of me you know so that's how it
is okay let me see
janna sound ek4 html/css diwali the only
way you can make some decay is if you're
a content editor so a content editor is
like somebody who has like an English
major right so let's say you work for I
don't know for any magazine let's say
Volcom right they hiring somebody who
needs to have HTML or CSS on their
background but they need to be a content
editor meaning they have to have some
type of English major as a degree right
so they can make $70,000 with just HTML
CSS because all they need to know it all
they need to do is just go in there and
edit the HTML and there from there right
there whole content but you you're going
in for developer developer needs to know
certain stuff so like for me like my
first job was very like very shitty
right my first job as a developer and
you came to consider that as a developer
I was just in there as a content editor
for a company basically uploading
products to eBay and uploading products
to their website and then there will be
certain sections that I had to use HTML
CSS but that wasn't me being a developer
right so my first job that had to do
with anything with HTML I was getting
$13 an hour which is garbage right now
in three months I left a part of it you
know some guy left the comment is like
damn Joe it's like leaving the company
so quick it's like you know I'm sorry
doesn't look good on your resume I'm
like boy like who's gonna stay in a
company making $13 an hour especially
when I was already making money I was
already an IT developer right I was
already an IT develop an hour I to
develop our IT personnel and a company
in wall street right and I left that to
basically become a developer I quit my
job and stayed for like almost a whole
year in my house just basically working
and learning all this stuff so it's like
how did I leave that job for $13 an hour
which is pitiful
so once I got the opportunity to get the
next job I was ours a piece like I send
them an email oh thank you for you know
for the love whatever I moved on you
know what I mean
let me see is it still possible to climb
the ladder without a degree hell yeah
listen I'm proof of it man like I
climbed the ladder like you could still
go up there man
like I don't have a degree in
programming or like I mean my degree
says programming and systems but my
associate but it it's not really I don't
even put that on my resume like I just
put my projects in my the companies I've
worked for like I don't even show
anything about my degrees or anything
because it has nothing to do with what
development I mean you have an
associate's degree with an NIT so
serious Greek says I have an associate's
degree in IT what do you think my salary
cap will be as a full stack developer
well if you have no know history as a
developer your cap will be like a 65 70
70 thousand right and then I see become
more experienced there from there you
not continue going up the ladder right
once you have a year two years then you
could say now I'm worth 85 now worth 99
were 400,000
then my recent recent comic brother on
the video you may have tied up with of
kanji just isn't there
listen man I got nothing against the K I
just think like the amount of money that
he's charging people is ridiculous
you know what I'm saying like guys who
have worked at Google you know what I
mean like guys that have worked at
Google that go to Google to train people
at Google don't charge $500 a course
right so it's like a kid who's like a
college student who just started in this
like this no history of him working at
any major companies like what makes you
think that your courses worth $500 like
you know what I'm saying like it seems
like an a on top of that a lot of the
the subscribers there seem to be pretty
much bought from like different websites
and like Facebook ads and you know
Facebook groups that people share is
like right now I I could go into a
website and start sharing my my videos I
could produce a video where I edit
everything there's no mumbles whatever
is like I don't stutter I don't say yeah
ginger soup boy Joe right I could go in
and fake the shit out of it right
and basically posting this on on a
Facebook group get a whole bunch of
subscribers but none of those
subscribers are our quality subscribers
and what I mean by quality subscribers
the people that are gonna be buying your
500 on a course they're not the Indian
guys from from India those guys are not
you know you see in the comments people
are like you know I can't afford this
this how much is 500 thousand rupees
like you gotta say like doses like what
the hell is this like this is kind of
ridiculous so they also scribing to him
because they relate to him and they
think like oh he's just cool he's a good
dude and he seems like a cool dude but
his audience the ones that he's trying
to sell to are the Americans right you
guys saw who are here like most of my
audience is really Americans
British Australians you guys to get you
guys to subscribe to a channel costs a
lot of money when you pay for
advertising right it costs a lot of
money to get those type of subscribers
so what happens is if I go and go to a
website on Dominican Republic or India
or Columbia or let's say El Salvador and
I promote my videos there and I get a
whole bunch of subscribers and says oh
my god I got a hundred thousand
subscribers two hundred thousand
subscribers right I don't really care
about those subscribers the people that
I care about is the Americans that could
buy my 500 out of course and I could say
hey man look at me I'm legit I'm the
most popular guy here I'm if what do you
think 200,000 people in the world
subscribed to me is because I'm legit so
because I'm the J pay for my father's
out of course you gonna sound like those
are the tactics that title offers do
those are the tactics that Gary Vee uses
but those are tactics that Hayek oldest
was this guy's name get a grant it was a
grant cardone whatever like and yes I
know I have a lot of subscribers from
all over the world I love all of you
guys but what I'm saying is if I promote
on your country like right now if I go
to max let's say Facebook on on Mexico
or YouTube and promote for a Mexican
audience it's cheap to promote to you
guys like it's very inexpensive right
but to American countries not American
countries that sounds dumb so
english-speaking countries it costs a
lot of money like let's say if I wanted
to promote my Facebook post on our
Facebook great and let's say I wanted to
promote it here in New York City it's
gonna cost me like $5.00 per every 1000
people that sees it right now if I go
and promote that same post in India is
gonna cost me like 40 cents to get a
thousand eyes
I hope you guys understand how it is so
it's like if I come in and I'll make
myself look like hey I got a million
subscribers and I'm this expert right
the person who was really able to pay
$500 looks at me and says damn he got a
million subscribers I I should buy his
$1,000 course you get what I'm saying
this call is called capping man
so yes like that's that happens man and
you know I think what he what he should
have done he should have just if he
wanted to promote his his uh courses and
do whatever he wants to do he could do
whatever he was right nobody has control
of nobody nobody could tell you what to
do right
but the problem is that the web
development community is not a stupid
community it's not like you're trying to
get high call it's like guys trying to
sell real estate or guys trying to sell
drop shipping courses or this this and
that it's like you're dealing with
people that are smart people who are
gonna test you on things right and and
got a question what you do you get what
I'm saying so that's how it is no so
it's like I wish them nothing but the
best but that can definitely be an issue
with people how can you contact me send
me an email coding phase at gmail.com
okay let me see
why do you okay break your name says why
do you use C to war in your courses
website why because hosting for video is
expensive right I try to do it with my
own website I could have built a way
better experience than using teachable
but the problem is the hosting right
especially the type of traffic that I
get on my website I get like you know
thousands of people on my website so
imagine especially now where I'm
planning on on opening the doors to you
know to the top 50 poorest countries and
also to everybody who's under 17 you
know who 17 and younger so that's
thousands and thousands of people right
now I pay $100 for the hosting on a
teachable right and basically anything
after that that's on them they gotta pay
for the hosting me I'm
smart I'm using them and say ok I'm
paying you $100 but I'm using like two
$3,000 worth of like traffic I hope that
make sense like you know sometimes you
got to learn how to game the system man
you know everything so yeah that's why I
use teachable there good good people's
there from New York too
plus I'm pretty sure that they're
hosting together for cheap because they
got so many instructors there that they
probably get like they're hosting you
know wholesale you know so anyways guys
any more questions let me know
seems like the the Chairman was going
dead we've been here for and now what
come on guys we got 70 people up in here
man ask me whatever you want we're gonna
keep on talking if it starts going dead
then I'm gonna just be out okay so let
me see looking at the live chat time
I'll keep asking keep asking I missed
some questions that's what I'm saying if
I miss if I miss a question please keep
adding them because it's like the chap
she keeps going up so it's like if I
miss it then you know what I mean
says you getting into machine learning
nothing machine learning is interesting
but it's not really my thing I'm not
into like numbers that much I'm not into
big data like that I'm not into like
analyzing data you know I got somebody
who's preparing a course for me to
basically teach it to to people online
but it's not really my thing it's not
like something I wake up in the morning
man I can't wait until I started doing
some you know machine learning is like
I'm not into that you know any like I'm
into creating products or then actually
even dori stuff like machine learning or
things like that okay if you install
working on a bachelor's in computer
science software engineer would it give
you an advantage when applying for jobs
even though you haven't completed of
school yet yes yes it will you know when
I started applying for jobs I didn't
have a bachelor's degree you know what I
mean so it definitely gonna help out
suggestions for PHP interviews some
suggestions I would say definitely know
a framework like Lera right just look at
one of those old frameworks like cakephp
what's doesn't want the igniter or
something like that I just look at it
I'm not saying to become an expert on it
take a look at it because you never know
you might go into a position that says
PHP developer and they need somebody to
do cakephp or help out with cakephp and
then you say oh I don't even know what's
that you never want to do that you want
to know what's going on in that industry
in that community of PHP developers so
to know what's going on with them at
least know what type of frameworks are
there from like legacy code so like that
that could help you out also to learn
how to deal with the backend as far as
like servers and you know a little bit
of DevOps when you are back in developer
you have to know how to deploy a website
how to use git to deploy a website how
to use on testing integration how to do
you know just like all the stuff look
into DevOps just have a knowledge about
it right AWS is a big thing if you know
how to deal with AWS then that could
definitely be a big plus for you look on
udemy there should be a course on it one
of my friends told me that this like a
really legit AWS course but is boring as
hell like you know those are one of
those topics that they're just boring
there's nothing that you could do about
not gonna be fun it's just something
that you got to drag yourself through is
like if you take in the JavaScript
understanding the weird parts of
JavaScript that course is so deep in so
long it's so slow that is boring you're
not really building any cool stuff but
you learning every single concept of
JavaScript okay you know how can you
deal with people calling you a nerd
because I code can I call it comfortably
yeah man listen you don't have to worry
about what you do right you don't have
to worry about what you do if you are a
nerd whatever like that's on you you
know I mean like don't pay no mind to
nobody most of the people that are gonna
be out here they're gonna end up working
at McDonald's they're gonna end up
working at UPS they're gonna end up
working for FedEx you know while you're
gonna be out here making money you know
how many people I see so many people all
the time like the nerdiest of the
nerdiest you know that live amazing
lives you know what I mean like they
drive a nice car that could buy whatever
they want it could travel - why have a
city or country they want Wow people
that used to be cool you know the guys
that used to you know the jocks or even
the girls that used to look good in high
school and this and that now we're like
strippers or you know they're somewhere
we know we're like three kids because
the guy that used to look good in high
school or you know junior high school
he's a drug dealer he's locked up so he
left her with three kids
like now she's picking up the next drug
dealer and it's like those people they
live that type of lifestyle like nobody
gives a damn about them like they're
losers okay so the people who you
thought that were cooler in high school
cooler engine in high school those
people are losers now they like that's
how it is right the people that are the
cool people are the people with money
like no matter where you go if you got
money you're cool if you're poor you're
not cool like it or not doesn't matter
what language it is doesn't matter what
culture it is doesn't matter wait
from was it color your skin you could be
the darkest person in the world you
could be a con a con got money in his
pocket he's the coolest person in the
world he goes to a place where you know
people are super racist but they still
kiss his feet because he got money in
his pocket you know what I'm saying like
you could be the ugliest girl in the
world you know you could be built like a
a fridge you know what I mean a little
minivan nobody cares about that
you got money in your pocket you could
get the flyest guy in the world the guy
who works out every single day cuz you
got money ma you gonna say and it's like
the same thing for guys you got money
you could get the most beautiful girl in
the world right and you know being smart
is school and being smart it just opens
up possibilities for you in life you
know somebody that might look good or
somebody that might be more popular than
you at the moment
that doesn't mean five years from now
they're gonna be anything they might
just be you know one day you might come
in when your Ferrari you come true you
somebody tells you hey man you want me
to put 93 or 89 and then you see like oh
look at the guy that was cool in high
school why are you in a Ferrari like
that's how it happens so you know when
it comes to like coding and just being
nerdy even I myself at one point I was
like man I just don't want to be no nerd
you know I mean I was like that too
because I used to be hanging out with
everybody that was cool all these people
but the same time I got even I myself
got derailed you know I've been doing
this since 14 years old you know when I
was 14 years old I stopped all this
stuff one because I didn't have no
support and two because I was like man
ain't none of these guys are going to
like was the AP math is getting or
knowing I could shit you know I mean
shorties ain't giving it to LA right the
ones that we're getting it was the guys
that were playing basketballs the guys
that were wearing the Jordans were
wearing the AVA Rex
jack is the Pelle Pelle stuff you know
the Vanson jackets come in and fly with
the fitting coming in with a swag right
I got the
myself and I was like hanging out with
the wrong crowd I ain't getting back
onto it till I was like 24 years old
you got no saying so following the crowd
following the other stuff and now all
those people were they yet now you gonna
seem like I'm good you know I was gonna
do it now I'm gonna tell you guys I was
gonna do a video about you know breaking
down like all my earnings and I was like
per month and I'll say you know what I'm
not gonna put this out if I actually put
this information out the amount of
haters that I'm gonna get it's gonna be
ridiculous
because nobody's gonna believe it
nobody's gonna be like oh this guy makes
this much this guy does this and that
and just from like coding and there's
not possible and even that people will
probably try to flag my videos and do a
whole bunch of stuff like trust me
people are hateful so that's why I
didn't want to share the video but it's
there maybe one day I'll share it you
know but it's crazy man don't worry
about it you know people gonna call you
a nerd whatever listen man trust me by
the time if you're young right now by
the time you're like 20 years old man
you're gonna be good now one thing that
you can't let yourself go all right just
because you you cold doesn't mean that
you can't wear flock clothes then
because you your code doesn't mean that
you gotta be a bum you got to look like
a bum you got to also take care of
yourself I know a lot of guys who you
know they they super nerdy and super
smart and look like homeless people like
you can never do that because you gotta
maintain yourself you know you gotta
keep that flashing you gotta buy your
clothes soon as you start getting some
money spend some money to you know get
yourself something that people look at
you like them he got some good cheese on
damn he how much that watch cause like
you know I don't even wear no fucking I
don't wear no jewelry on YouTube no more
I don't want to do it I got a $8,000
chain on old diamonds I got all of that
I don't even do that no more
right I think even my car I'm trying to
I'm trying to like kind of get rid of it
I'm trying to get even something smaller
like before I wanted to get something
more flashy to get
Rodney and his net but now the more
money I'm getting I kind of feel like
maybe I shouldn't let people know that
I'm getting money like that because
people will look at me differently
you get what I'm saying even here I feel
a certain way I was the main reason why
I didn't share the video that was gonna
make was because I was like you know if
I share this with people online I
wouldn't even be surprised that people
be like oh I'm subscribing just because
I just don't want to get money there's
people like that you know the people
that do support my my website that we
like why should we you know help him out
to you know promote his courses or help
him out or get farther in life if we
know he's getting this XYZ amount of
money because there's people that's like
that so he's like I'd rather now I'm
starting to be like more to myself like
okay I could do my thing but I gotta
keep things on the hush but going back
to what you said man like don't worry
about you you nerdy or you know people
might call you a nerd or whatever is
like do you
yo for some reason every time I see
Carlos coming or anything I start
laughing man Carlos Carlos reminds me of
like one of my friends like like I know
I could probably chew him all the time
this is because he's like just
children's like a cool dude so every
time I see Carlos he just makes me laugh
man I'm like Carlos is in here man
so the museum aim and Ava X jacket Tim's
jean outfit all of that you know pink
shirt you know back in the days with
Dipset you know James Webb def is like
y'all f is Sheree break your name is
like Sheree put it out
now I don't want to do it I was gonna do
it
but then I said nah I can't put this out
man I can't put this out man like you
know the amount of people people hate on
me automatically right if people will
know that the amount of money that I
make on my own what I haven't like
people you know as a Christian I asked
me the other day like damn man it's like
you know it's like that you've been
working from home for a long time I'm
like yeah probably
I'm good you know what I mean like I
quit my job in September man like I'm
sweet I'm sweet you know like most
people can't do this you know what I
mean
and I'm not even a big you talk like
youtuber you know what I'm saying like I
do get mad at that I'll be honest cuz
the amount of work and time that I put
into like YouTube listen I was
calculating the amount of things that I
do even on my website right da moneh
hours I put into all my courses and how
much money I make from the courses alone
I work for $12 an hour I'm a I'm working
for all the stuff that I do for you guys
I do the courses I do YouTube after I
calculate the amount of hours I put in
for the whole freakin month and
I calculate everything I divide
everything and how many does that I
worked I'm working for $12 an hour you
know saying like when it comes down to
it do I do this for the money that I
make on YouTube no I don't even make
money like that on you - right it's
everything else that I tell you about
the things about you know CSS generators
are freaking websites that do services
getting your adsense account or you know
doing all that good stuff you know what
I mean those are the things that's gonna
get you money right now do I be tight at
the fact that I should be right now the
amount of content the amount of work
that I put in I should be at like
200,000 subscribers straight up like but
the problem is that youtube doesn't put
me out there that really pisses me off
because I'm like man I got the sauce
under originator of this I'm literally
like the most influential you know
youtuber that does web development out
here period literally that's a
everything that I do everybody else
follows
but then what sucks is that everybody
else either YouTube is giving them the
light and then now I'm like you know two
years from now most of these people is
gonna be popping up you know what I mean
unless you to start showing me some luck
most of these people is gonna start
popping up using my ideas and using what
I do and then people is gonna be
somebody's gonna email me like hey man
stop copying from XYZ developer it's
like bro you don't even know I'm -
originator of this shame you gotta say
like all this shit that I do here
even from the udemy reviews listen
everything that I've done here on
YouTube dudes have taken pieces by
pieces by pieces by pieces by pieces and
just kind of remixed it right from
everywhere and it's not just one person
it's literally every single person out
here and what sucks is like I know my
channel should be bigger and I'm like I
don't even know what the hell to do to
literally just like get this channel out
there and I don't want to pay for No
no fake subscribers I don't want to pay
for views because that's fake
that's capping
you know saying so but it's crazy you
know I'll be thinking about I'm like man
I should be at 200 right now 300 right
now like don't mow off of work that I
put in this is crazy
but what can you do that's what I'm
saying
that's what I'm saying you got Jomo Tech
you know 50,000 subscribers in like four
days but I mean you can't be mad at it
because it's like his he got a very very
popular video it was like hey he is the
life of a facebook developer well he got
in trouble for that he actually he got
in trouble for that because you can't do
that you can't just be in your office
showing around like hey this is what we
do at Facebook he's looking to get fired
you know that's being honest you know
but it's just crazy I'll be like
sometimes I'll be thinking about them
like man there's days I wake up I don't
even want to do it to be honest with you
like because I'm here because of you
guys but because of YouTube it just like
that shit brings me down that's it it
really does bring me down really I'll be
pissed off I'm like yo you know the
amount of work that I put in the amount
of time that I come up with ideas the
amount of things that I do here that's
original that nobody else is doing
nobody else was doing
nobody else's it's out there and then
for all the work that I do then people
come in pick pick at it right and then
from there blow up with what I do that's
what knowing you know I don't need to
say no name you guys should know
everybody that's out here that fucking
copies machine and it's like I still
show log because it's like hey man you
what the hell you gonna do but it is
really fucking fucked up and one's gonna
piss me off it's like two years from now
some some random kid is gonna send me an
email or send me economy hey stop biting
this person is like motherfucker I'm the
one that created this whole shit before
me there was nobody here like everybody
was corn balls you get on saying like
it's fucking ridiculous but whatever
let's move on from that yeah sorry
that's a rank right there you know what
I mean that's that's my Kanye moment I'm
about to put that shit up I don't chop
in that whole piece right there and be
like yo that's my Kanye moment you know
what I mean that's gonna be for later on
when people want to see the hey what
happened in the livestream Joe had a
fucking Kanye moment man you know what I
mean
Joe went in there and set y'all I'm the
fucking most influential developer out
here since fucking Bill Gates nigga like
yo my fault man Kevin you don't you
don't got the answers Kevin man but the
fucked up part is gonna be literally you
know I mean the fucked up part of body
is gonna be like yell dudes is gonna hit
me up two years from now and it's gonna
be like yo stop biting XYZ and stop
biting this other person and this other
person I'm gonna just be like some
random so random youtuber out here I'm
going to be like Jesus fuckin Christ
I created the shape now man but Tyler
Benton is like yo you don't have to
spray to see you know my foot made the
hook came out of me you know I don't
really like to to use the word but
that's how it is like that's how we
speak out here man plus I'm half black
so ain't nobody telling me shit I just
don't like to use it because
for you know for people that get
offended but you can't tell me shit I'm
half-black so hush your mouth bro
so I straight up anyways man send me any
other questions man do this are you like
yo Joey you're like brother I don't have
black like ain't nobody telling me shit
like I'm from the hood though like if
you black good for you man those are
here I feel you know that's also I so be
honest I feel also too nice that's some
insecurity man you know I find it to be
like some insecurities way you know when
people unless you know somebody's saying
it out of malice it's more of like an
insecurity like may YC gotta say this
why this person saying that it's like if
you're not from the hood if you're not
from the spy if you don't have a poor
everything you don't have a Dominican
you don't have duals around you that's
like that
then that's on you you get what I'm
saying it's like when I went to I would
have went to Howard to South Carolina
right hey listen I used to n-word all
the time like yo what up mud was good
I'm in the block - ain't nobody telling
me son but it was like girl man it's
like you shouldn't be using that word is
and I'm like wow because I'm a little
bit lighter like why like I don't got no
black features like well I gotta pull it
out like I'm black like you know I mean
like I have that you know I mean so it's
like like it enough you know what I mean
well one racist do comes up to me he's
not gonna be like hey you're lighter
than the other one it's like no bro you
still and and and you know what I mean
like like it or not yeah
but anyway so let me know anything else
word hailing with a dab real quick -
season man let me see let me see what
else I think is a YouTube almost every
everyone copy gets at five others and
the other hand and the other hand
everyone thinks how original he is being
him best song what house doing doing it
for years on YouTube
anyways word but the problem is that
there isn't before me like there isn't
you get on saying like and there's gonna
be so many other people that's gonna
come in and that's fine I don't I don't
mind people coming in doing what they
gotta do
my point is YouTube is effed up you know
I don't want to become the next what was
this guy's name Elida you like the
programmer was it you later
you let the computer guy you know I
don't want to become the Eli the
computer guy
next you know the computer guy cuz and
shit but I am trying to be here for like
10 years and end up at some freaking at
around the corner of YouTube you gotta
say like when you know everybody copies
insane like you know how annoying that
is I guess I don't know when you're a
creator you would really understand what
I'm talking about
it's really annoying when you come in
you create something and then people
study a pickpocket the whole same remix
a repackaging is I hear you go and
there's like then people come up and be
like wow I've never seen this before and
I was like of course not
dole just remixing machine you know what
I'm saying so that's what I was so tight
to with this guy Eric I was so pissed
off with Eric because Eric was the very
first one and I wanna I wanted I hit him
up and you know Eric don't worry about
it we should be cool whatever
yeah because it seems like everybody has
remixed everything that I've
here so it's like now I was like who
cares okay you want some new ideas show
up to coding phase and whatever he does
let's take a little bit from here take a
little bit from there you don't say so
and then from there people blow up with
my own shit that's my problem
but whatever next thing you know you
will see somewhere else reviewing yes
that's when you know that's like the
last thing that people haven't done yet
that's like the last thing that I
haven't seen yet when you start seeing
people start reviewing portfolios on my
jesus-fucking-christ like can I can I
keep that
at least you got no saying I cannot keep
that at least you know sorry
that's when you're gonna say damn they
took everything from Joe like literally
I sorted I look there's the things that
nobody could talk nobody could review
review portfolios straight up I'm
punching somebody in their face if I see
somebody straight up like just copying -
ehh I'm like yo bro like come up with
come up with something else man like
leave my series every time I come up
with a new series somebody comes in
snatches it that's like the last thing
that they haven't taken you know what I
mean but whatever so let's see what else
they gonna take my name the word can I
live what do you think about free
University I don't know what's that what
do you think see what's your thoughts on
Django for work I mean this song
companies out there that are hiring for
Django but that's like you know this was
what got Philippe tight that day it's
like weird old companies meaning it's
weird companies out there meaning like
this probably like one out of
hundred companies or even more than that
one out of 500 companies using Django
but if somebody's doing web development
ain't nobody using Django like these
people that use it you know that there's
people out there it's like a lick sir -
somebody might be using elixir but
that's like a weird company like nobody
that's outside of the norm you know yeah
you do miss me with Django but that's
what I'm saying
people this is literally what I'm saying
they people come up with like y'all one
company does a and it's like Pinterest I
think interests use Django or Python or
even Instagram use Python like just
because one company use it doesn't mean
that every company out there is using it
because what happens is you might see
something that's popular in San
Francisco or in New York but you that
live in Florida you are not bumping into
those type of jobs right so are you
gonna move to San Francisco or New York
or do you just study something that's
globally used like PHP and Ruby on Rails
you answer that I wouldn't even have to
give you the answer for that you know I
mean if if you have half of a you know a
brain cell like you you should know
which one it is listen I wanted to do
this live - I wanted to do this live I
forgot about this thanks for reminding
me about Philippe listen let me share my
screen
thanks very much about this okay so I'm
gonna do this live I'm gonna do this

second
I do like somebody left me a comment it
seems like you might like mmm a Rogaine
and Bravo
I do like Joe Rogan but the reason why
I'll subscribe from Joe Rogan is because
I already know the channel these
channels that you already go to
automatically that you don't need
notifications for it's the same thing
with Chris Hawkes like I don't need a
notification from Chris Orcs cuz I'm
gonna go there no matter what do you get

like channels that you you don't even
know that you like but you don't even
