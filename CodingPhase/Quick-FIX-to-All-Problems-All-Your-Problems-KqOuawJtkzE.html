it again man
this is nice I've noticed I'm not up you
have no one deals with the how they do
it so they try to follow my tutorials
and then getting stuck at just the
beginning right and I understand why
because please don't understand return
so I'm going to do something quick
antenna future just what you need to
know about the terminal to be able to be
dangerous and just to be able to do most
of the projects out there because
everybody uses their style of coding and
you know of basically creating projects
right so we're gonna do this we're gonna
come here imagine like this close this
up quit you're gonna come here you're
going to search terminal right open up
your terminal it's gonna throw you to
the home your home folder right whenever
you see this little curly light that
means you're inside your home folders to
make sure you click your CD which means
change directory you click curly line
right now you click LS which means show
me all the folders and all the files
that are inside of this this folder
right the home folder right now you're
in here you see this project for me I
usually write like to write my code
inside of a folder main code but for you
guys I'm gonna create this folder we're
gonna say mkdir mate directory project X
right projects
alright project X you click enter press
LS now we created this folder you see
project X before wasn't created what
that did was if you come here and you
click on downloads or you click on any
of the folders and you right click here
and then you see here your username you
click there
and then this is your home folder right
here you're going to see all the folders
that you have you know for your computer
your applications your Creative Cloud
downloads movies music pictures whatever
right now the folder that we just
created Project X I want you guys to
move to the left alright so now you
always have in your favorites any moment
you could come here
then check what the hell is going on
right so that's what you're going to
have all your projects right so now now
that we're in here through here we're
going to do this I'm going to say CB
project X oops 100 because I I'm
basically made it like that so project
CD project X I named it like that a mr.
t sorry okay so it's PR oj ec x I don't
know why I'm into that right so I will
start of this folder right now this is
the same thing as if I was doing it
through here but the only difference is
we're doing it to the terminal
all right now remember at any moment you
could come here and say CD and then you
press shift and right under the skate
key there should be a little squiggly
line on your keyboard you click that you
can go back can you click a lesson to
see what's inside of it that's going to
bring you back to your home page right
ok now let's go back let's go back in CD
change directory project X right so
we're inside there's nothing there but
if I come here and I create a new folder
here testing 1 and I click here LF you
will see the folder testing 1 this is
the same thing only they felt like I
said you're doing it too little term all
right now let's envision this we're
going to come to the project download
this here alright you're gonna come here
and you're going to say clone or
downloads it from now we're not cloning
in because a lot of people don't even
know how to clone so it's fine
right now we're downloading it right we
download it shows up here ok open up
when you find a window go to downloads
as you can see here start a kit to 2018
master what you're going to do is you're
going to copy this we're going to rename
this thing they name it a babe store
right you got a copy this copy
everything that's inside of it and we
got to put it inside of the based or
folder now you have my project inside of
your babe store folder right cool now we
got to come back to your terminal
alright okay we're going to press LS you
see because I changed the name here now
it's name big store now we're going to
change through Saturday CD and then we
have a big store what that means is
change directory to the big store
there's the same thing that's me saying
double-click into it right now now that
you're here you're going to do something
like this you're going to say are you
going to make sure that you installed
yarn you follow all the steps here you
have still no GS to hear your story on
you download Adam that Adam packages you
don't have to worry about it if for
whatever reason it doesn't work on your
computer on your Windows computer or
Linux or whatever you're using this
works for Mac for sure but if it doesn't
work on your computer
I'm gonna teach you how to do it on your
computer right Oh on any computer pretty
much all right so now that we here
we're inside the big store right now
that we here and we click unless we see
all the files that are inside of this
folder
remember here you see this Joe MacPro
based or that's the folder that we are
in anymore Matt will say see the
backpack which is just dot dot it takes
you back to the para folder which is
baked store now if I come back and say
see the backpack it brings me back to
the home store so the whole project and
as you can see it here on the project
the home folder sorry the project X we
came from the project X and then from
here we came from the base store project
so you see how the same way how you do
it here or you like okay back back
that's what the dot dot does okay guys
now let's go back in here and get any
moment you can say see the project eggs
and then slash Bape store what that
means is change directory through the
project X and then base store you see
now we're in here okay let me move back
in so you can see it what we're actually
doing it okay now through the terminal
you're gonna say once everything is so
wants to install everything from here
and you follow all the steps you're
gonna say yarn when I run the art that
right thing what is doing is just
downloaded all of the packages that you
need from nodejs
that's it and what that's doing is it's
installing it locally here as you can
see this this folder wasn't here before
no modules it was not there so you're
basically installing all those packages
inside of this see is like hundreds of
of files and folders and and JavaScript
libraries and a whole bunch of
right now
let's give it a little second cool it's
done now what we're going to say is yard
Watts
that's it that's all you guys needed to
do for some reason a lot of people
didn't know this I'm sorry I thought
that everybody knew this by now but not
everybody knows this so that's what made
this tutorial for you guys now let's go
back into this thing because there's
more stuff that I want to explain to you
guys now let's open Adam right you can
come here on Adam and click at the left
click on preferences I think for Windows
is like in the Edit form where or it's
around here search for preferences or
settings or on Windows so ok we're here
we're inside of preferences which
becomes settings right you could come
here to install and then you see this
packages here
I don't package that list you could come
here and just copy this say Adam
beautify and search that you see you can
install it from here and just click
install right there it's going to show
like that and you click install now
you'll also see start adding all of them
you know you go one by one and install
them manually
for whatever reason for some people it
doesn't work what they do the APM
install - - package if that doesn't work
for you guys just do it manually at any
moment you guys can open this package
file right and you can look at the names
of the packages that you meet for Adam
okay now if for whatever reason you
don't see this file inside of your
folder right this file called dot babel
RC it means that your computer cannot
see hidden files so whenever you copied
it over to the big store folder right
when we copy that
this file did not get switched over so
this what happens on it all right you're
going to get this error whenever you run
your watch you're going to get their
ever because you're missing one file
even though you're seeing this right now
the moment is that you're seeing
actually something that was already
compressed and transpiled by my computer
right but you're getting this error
because you're missing that file so what
you're going to do is you're going to go
on your atom and create this file new
that babel RC right and then you're
going to paste this inside of it and
save now whenever you want yard Watts
there's no errors everything is running
smooth that's it all right guys you

second watch this video again trust me
once you get this you're gonna always be
able to do any type of project I using
for tutorials from anybody on YouTube
anybody including me you're basically
going to understand this and like I said
do what I do to make my life easier
every time I create a pro like a folder
or a para folder whatever project folder
I created here and say parent folder or
whatever you want to call it for
and then I always put it here on my
favorites so at any moment I could close
this up and I just come back I could
just go here para folder and find all my
files
