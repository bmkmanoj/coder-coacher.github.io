it again man colleague face calm let's
make sure you subscribe make sure you
like this video and yeah listen
community so you know it's been very
controversial some things that I did on
my HTML but people don't understand
there's a reason what I'm doing right is
to basically show that you can have
mistakes and there's something called
refactoring right which was gonna be
this videos you know chapter or this
topic or this video and that's what
we're gonna do on this work right so
we're going to come into back into the
code that we already did refactor was
already there so the idea of this is to
show you guys that even if you make a
mistake it's fine even if you come and
you do a certain way there's a million
ways of doing things like when it comes
to HTML when it comes to see yourselves
everybody has different little tricks
everybody has different ways of coding
and that is fine the most important
thing is what's the finished product
it's the finished product like this how
it looks in the design yes that's what
people care about nobody's going to come
in unless you're working on something
specifically like let's say for a
disabled or handicapped that they need a
special reader to to read the web pages
nobody's looking at your markup know
what it's called
over it now you could believe me you
cannot you go to not believe me whatever
you want to do but on this video we're
going to do a little refactoring add
some new tags fix a couple little things
and yeah that's what this chapters about
alright so let's start this up remember
guys so remember that you're inside of
the folder right so we're gonna run yard
watch what that's gonna do is start up
gulping start up the whole task of
basically watch everything that we do
and
refresh the page as we do changes to it
alright so let's start this up first
thing that we got to do is we're gonna
change
this section reason why I made it into a
section was to basically explain to you
guys that from here to here it's a
section from here to here section but
there are better tags for that right so
we're going to say header we're going to
name this into a header and then this
into a header alright cool
now what else can we do here
also our navigation we can actually use
any map nav tag and go like this instead
of using on order list you could come in
here and use a nav tag and remove all
the allies so let's see all right let's
see what happens it's going to be a
little bit messed up now let's change it
so we have menu okay move this from here
and just put it directly on the link all
right now this text is supposed to be
color I think black
any moment could come back and change it
right so yeah that looks clean now okay
what else we got a refactor from this
thing oh let me see looking at the code
model men's sizes section this is fine
yeah so that's pretty much data as far
as like refactoring that we needed to do
and I guess that refactoring just means
you're going to come back to your code
look at what you did and then from there
fix any mistakes that are there
this happens all the time even at a job
or you know any project that you're
working on you're always going to
refactor your code just because you call
it a certain way in the beginning
doesn't mean that's how you're going to
hand it in at the end all right guys
I'll see you guys in a little bit
Wow Gigi you already knows your job back
at it again man listen make sure you
subscribe and make sure you like this
video man by the way if you want to know
exactly what questions I took to become
a web developer they right there in the
description it's no secret it's nothing
crazy is no secret gift that I had is
just pretty much I took the courses
they're pretty cheap they're like
written dollars beads on specials and
just this immense change your life
change your lifestyle do something fun
and something cool that you could call a
career</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
