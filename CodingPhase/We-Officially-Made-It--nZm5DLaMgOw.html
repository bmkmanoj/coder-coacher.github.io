successful I'm successful in YouTube I'm
successful in life I'm so successful in
everything that I do for some reason my
positive energy always bring good things
to me you know if I was a shitty person

bad things will come to me but I'm just
a good person people like them like it's

this shit has been since I remember in
kindergarten people that I know from
like kindergarten they're like yo Joe
you made that class legit you know high
school I was a fucking like oh man I
feel like I'm about to start bringing
our videos from my high school days man
back in the days I used to play ball
back in the days when I used to be out
here you know blowing backs out but high
school days was the shit
college days was the shit you know now
I'm an adult you know what I mean like
I'm supposedly I'm in a dog and for some
reason now I'm the shit too as an adult
like I'm good you know so you can't be
mad at that what you got to do is worry
about yourself worry about how to better
yourself in life if you have a channel
better your channel if you have a
relationship but be bettering your
relationship if you have friends be a
better front to your friends just try to
be better in everything that you do you
know so don't be mad at the next person
you know you know it's like the kid goes
like oh man people go check out
traversing media dadada listen my
channel is not like traversing idiot
right it's not like his channel at all I
don't stay in front of a computer 24/7
creating tutorials I don't get paid for
that he gets paid for that they just
literally contacted me maybe like a week
to 90 week or week and a half ago they
wanted me to promote their channel
promote reversing media promote I was
the other one
their company I think is dead something
it's like some Indian company that he
works for they pay him to be in front of
a computer all day doing tutorials if
somebody comes to me and tells me Joe
we're going to pay you to those
tutorials I'm gonna give you like the
top-of-the-line tutorials you know
because that's all I would do that's
what I would stay at home doing that's
what he does
24/7 he doesn't work for a company like
he doesn't work out here in the field
I'm in the field I'm in the trenches kid

for you I'm like I'm in the trenches

like guys this is YouTube and like if
you see all my videos I I put youtuber
first so people can understand like when
I'm on YouTube I'm just having fun you
know you can't be mad at that you can't
be mad at somebody being successful for
having fun and enjoying himself and the
reason why I did this was because you
know people who are developers people
who are programmers people who are
coders people who are in this industry
they take themselves too serious and
they need to take a chill pill need to
relax enjoy life you know get a
girlfriend you know sometimes you might
need a girlfriend you know like code is

have to understand what I do here is now
what I do at my job
like at my job I'm professional with it
I'll do my work I shut the fuck up when
I need to shut the fuck up and I just do
my job and I get paid very well when I'm
here with you guys I'm talking to my
friends I'm not talking to my boss I'm
not talking to my coworker I'm not
talking to anybody else I'm talking to
my friends you know what I mean like
this how I am with my friends that's why
my channel is different you know and
it's like this is like the last time I'm
gonna address this it's like guys just
because you see your boy out here
dripping and over here spilling that
sauce on you don't think that's how it
is that you're supposed to act that a
you know a good job you gotta know how
there's a big difference between work
and when you're with your friends right
so use your brain man like this is
YouTube rank do you think I go into an
office I go to a meeting like Deb I'm
like okay boss dribbling that sauce on
you Deb I don't come in there like that
come on you gotta be retarded to think
that I go in there like that he's like
come on man
use your fucking brain like like that's
the only thing that annoys me it's like
people don't have a fucking brain out
here for some reason it's like it's not
a heart use your brain
now let me read the comments let me see
what everybody is up to yeah man James
dual coding channel man go ahead I can't
wait to see it let me know when you do
it so I could promote it here I'll help
you out
throw some people at you
my boy 84 without--without what I would
up
yeah man people fear they fear what they
can't understand man it really it really
I could I would be pissed off I'll be
honest if right now if right now I lived
in a third-world country right and I
live in a third-world country and then I
see somebody like me is like this guy is
fucking good and he's he's living good
everything is good fucking people
support him people like him and then I'm
here under a tree and I should be there
I should be mad for that I don't think I
would be pissed off I really don't think
so because that's somebody else's life
that's not my life so how can I make my
life like that listen you could throw me
right now in fucking South Africa I'm
gonna shine in South Africa you know you
could throw me in Brazil I'm gonna be
good in Brazil you could throw me in
Dominican Republic I'm gonna be good
Dominican Republic you can throw me in
the Philippines I'll be good for the
Philippines
you gotta learn how to make your life
better
don't be mad at other people you know
this times you know like when I first
got into this thing I was working a
bullshit job that I hate it and then I
saw like all this you know slow white
kids or Starbucks working in the
computers and I'm like man I could be
doing that how can I be doing some
bullshit job when I could be working
from anywhere I want I could do remote I
could work my own clients why am I not
doing that so I just started busting my
ass and shit paid off what you seeing
right now is the long journey of five
years of me busting my ass and this is
just the beginning people are gonna get
really pissed off I told you I'm pulling
out the mazi
I told you I'm pulling out the Maserati
and I'm gonna do that for next year and
then not only that that I'm getting a
new house
where I'm at right now that's a rented
house I'm buying my own house and I only
buy my own house
then from there I'm opening up my own
business so I don't have to work for
nobody else so that's what I'm saying
like people should not take these things
as like oh man all this shit good shit
happen to this asshole I hate this guy
no you gotta take it like man if this
guy did it I could do it you know what I
mean like that's what that's what I want
for people to take out of this channel
be like something in that shit is not
possible shit that you want to do that
you can't do it because X Y Z reasons
right whatever right so just bossy ass
shit is going to happen like even
fucking traversing media that fucking
guy he makes mad money nobody's fuckin
mad at him he makes man money because
not only do they have him in and the
other ending come I forgot the name the
other Indian company um Dex meeting
assumption I don't know I do onyx or
something like that they fucking got a
whole bunch of courses on you to me that
got a whole bunch of courses on their
own website he makes money from YouTube
I'm talking about at least a million
dollars they make and then you're mad at
me that's what I'm saying like it'll
make no sense
the only difference between him and me
is that I'm over here showing my
personality I'm sure Who I am I'm not
here just it's like hey guys here's a
tutorial here's how you do this is how
you do that no you could go over there
if you want that if you want a youtuber
who's also a web developer who also
works in the industry then you come to
me you know what I'm saying
so yeah that's like like I always say
this is my lunch break specials when I
do my lunch break special
they could be 10 minutes 20 minutes 30
minutes 40 minutes of me just talking
ranting or talking to my fans talking to
my peoples my viewers my friends that's
it if you don't like it cool you know
come on man yeah like if I don't like
somebody like I'm gonna tell you right
now there's certain people die just
don't like and I don't watch them you
know what I do on Google well YouTube
you know if you see on my on my
thumbnail on the little corner the
secular three dots and says turn off
notifications or you could even put that
thing it's unrelated but search results
or something like that so then you will
never see me again that's what I do to
people if I don't like your channel I
don't like what you do it I play
download button don't show me
notifications of this person I don't
want to see their fucking face you know
what I mean like this young people just
don't like and I just get it on my face
I don't want to see that thing
ms 26 2017 keep everybody keep reaching
by yourself but still what someone's
themselves what the fuck yeah exactly
oh yeah man just do you just do it Joey
don't trip on me I don't need that
no I'm not talking about you Matt
there's nothing wrong I love you Matt
you're my boy
yeah I know I could definitely make a
lot of money on c-sharp I know that but
it's the type of companies man trust me
man like I'm not built for that I'm not
built to just be with a shoot 24/7 you
can't breathe because your neck is too
tight um I can't you gotta kiss a lot of
ass
I'm not asking sir I'm the type of
person that if I don't like you
I'll say to your face up like listen bro
you need to calm down
I don't like you I don't play office
politics I just do what I do you know so
I say I'm never going to be a c-sharp
developer because I just the type of
environment you know
yeah like traversing media is it onyx
like those fucking guys they make mad
money like who was mad at him for that
you know what I mean like they're using
YouTube to promote courses that they
make and they make a lot of money I'm
talking about that leaves some million
dollars you know it's like Steven grided
you know how much money Steven grant
makes he gotta make at least half a
million dollars a year but what does
Steven grata do he busts his ass he
creates tutorials 24/7 if I had the
opportunity to just set my ass at home
and create tutorials 24/7 you don't
think I would be on the same level
Steven Grider and traversing media and
all these other guys is like I don't do
this full-time
guys you know we got 40 people in here
maybe we got 44 people we got the squad
this is my peoples in here man
yes different grader makes a lot of
money there's people who are you to mean
that they sell the courses like was that
guy Rob Rob Percival whatever his thing
he got to make at least two to three
million dollars a year he's one of the
top sellers on on udemy like those guys
make like you know hundreds of thousands
of dollars a month it's like who's mad
at dumb you know it's like how can I be
mad at them all I could do is be like
yeah one day when I grow up I want to be
just like him you know what I mean like
and the only difference is I actually
come here show I show my progress I show
what I do I talk about my my family I
talk about my baby coming through I talk
about my girl I talk about my family my
friends whatever it's like that's what
I'm saying like you know I'm here I'm
I'm sure my personality I'm showing you
no personal shit I'm not a robot this
channel is not to be a robot this
channel is not to be some weird shit
that you guys want me to be like I'm not
a weirdo I wasn't getting put into the
locker room you know I wasn't freaking
getting wedgies out here like this how I
am this how I've always been like just
because you learn to code doesn't mean
you have to be somebody else guys and
that's exactly why I created this
channel is to show people you can be
yourself be smart do something fun with
your life but you don't have to change
who you are
you know what I mean kick also to man
I hate when people be like ah he's
