riddle with a camera on his hand
they're probably like you know what the
hell you know but what don't you like to
set this up set this up properly how
usually do put this thing here stand all
this car real quick my seat up I know my
job done
Spanish music man oh man is hot
man I think I fucked up because I drank
my pills twice a diva notice so for
those that don't know I basically I take
some pills for headaches right for
migraines it's cool I think
gabapentin which is like it's supposed
to be strong whatever but it's for
people who have nerve damage or you know
like let's say you have a car accident
most of the time they'll prescribe it
for you and they'll tell you hey man
take this shit but it'll take the pain
away but it's like those fucking pills
that
you supposed to take a mate and I think
I just took about mistake sometimes that
you have as a man it'll freakin be
careful of that circle well yeah man
take those fucking pills for you know
the migraines I get really bad migraines
like extremely bad likes so glad that
like you know I feel like my heart is
about to explode is usually like a pain
in the back of my neck it starts from
the back of my neck and this comes up I
didn't have like some type of dirt or
like nerve damage or something in the
back of my neck and I mean I was
supposed to go back to how you call this
a neurologist to figure it out but only
been to one and I kind of once they gave
me this pill and worked I kind of just
left it along I never went back
so maybe I Polly some surgery or
something
but you know trust me man that's it it's
super painful people who have migraines
people who have nerve damage then trust
me guys you don't know what the fuck
that shit feels like it's like it's like
fucking I know it's like pins and
needles on your brain so it's fucking
hard
wait a minute I think I fucking with the
best shit but I don't know whatever
fucking having to work right now what's
cool about my job is that I'm like 12
minutes away
12 15 minutes away depending if somebody
slow in front of me I could get there in
12 and somebody is fucking slow then
it'll take me 15 minutes but it's not
that bad okay all right today's Friday
kids I don't know what you guys is doing
it for today right
I hope of you you guys are actually
doing some work and encoding out here
you know cuz you have to bust your ass
man this shit doesn't come to everybody
you know success doesn't come for
everybody man
and when I say that I don't think I'm
like successful but I think for somebody
who is self-taught and actually out here
on his own never had any help from
anybody I pretty much did it by myself
so for somebody like me I think I did
pretty well that's why I created this
channel soon
you know I want other people to do the
same thing and I want other people
suggest bootstrap and just like start
busting ass out here and just really go
hard you know get to actually become
successful in a field that is so
welcoming for everybody like you could
be from wherever it could be from Mars
yeah it would be from them by way it
will be from wherever the hell you want
to be right I don't know how you came
from it you could still make a good
living on this thing and what's cool
about is that it feels like you never
stop learning
so this always going to be some type of
excitement like you're going to be
excited by new technologies new
programming languages new frameworks new
libraries that people come up with and
even yourself you start making your own
libraries and your frameworks so to me I
think that's extremely valuable like you
can't you can go wrong
traffic oh yeah man so I just have to go
hard man and like I got told you guys
man
check the tutorials that I have go on
the you know go under the courses that I
give you guys like today I'm releasing a
video of called Steel's new my sequel
course amazing that but now you guys got
to watch the full review that I'm making
on it so that'll be released later on
six o'clock seven o'clock at night
I'm trying to figure out what's the best
time for me to release videos sometimes
I release videos I got sang in the
morning and now school that would will
give me a couple of views and a couple
of people will get to see Gators there I
go that lunch grades there they they
watch the videos now sometimes some
people say that the best time is like
three four o'clock well I don't know if
it's 3/4 cup because I think three four
o'clock to be good for four kids you
know like if you're the okay just came
home you know all your favorite
youtubers is dropped in the video I
think it's going to be successful like
that but for like an adult or working it
though somebody who is like over 20 over
21 late what's the best time because I
know
six o'clock seven o'clock that's more
people start getting comfortable right
so
you think about that you like man maybe
they watch my videos when they get home
or you know I noticed that they watching
the lunch breaks what was the best time
after work you know is it seven o'clock
6 o'clock 9 o'clock I know by 10 o'clock
so it's already too late every time that
I released a video by 10 o'clock it
barely get anything so it's hard you to
realize
try to figure out safe
there's no quick drive to work early in
the morning extra sleepy Oh that'll be I
work too
God knows when yesterday I was there too
like almost silent o'clock I left out of
that I got 646 question man I hate being
I worked I think I don't like stayin I
work that late that's too many hours
the weights 25
especially for me I feel like I get
tired
most people thing like oh we just
sitting down you're in front of a
computer or whatever but man the way how
I figure this thing now is like I feel
like you're lifting weights which are
great that's how I feel you know this is
always a problem there's always trust
especially when you just launched a new
website there's always fucking stressful
situation
what is like man that's out of a good
times just chill relax oh you know most
of the time people want you to take
lunch inside so you could be a
people be in front of you computer if
anything happens like this annoying like
I love clothing I just don't know if I
like working class
my boss my supervisor like everybody's
super poolman like the company I work
for they're super nice people and so I
really enjoy that
only part I don't like it how does it go
in going to work quick even though I'm
12 minutes away I really do not like it
because it's like without a deal with
mad people there's a whole bunch of
situation that can't happen and like
most of the time what I want to do is
call I don't want to see people I don't
want to talk to people these days that I
wake up tired
my head hurts I wake up freaking without
no energy and all I want to do is I okay
I go on the computer and code but I
don't want to get up and my freaking
adults are working to do all this extra
to have meetings and like discussions
about hey should we use this type of
menu or should we just use a sliding
menu like a lot of dump shit that I
don't care
it's like just giving PSPs gimme
designed and how to make the same
what
life's not that easy is
it's my exit
it's pretty quick man I guess all the
reasons why I like my job
because it's super quick like I live
right here
I live for support exits away from my
job you know if I lived in the city I
will have to go to work in the city is
an hour trip on the train you're dealing
with fucking 30,000 people at a time
fucking people pushing people fucking
crushing you man I hate that shit that's
why I don't know I'm telling you I'm not
going back to the city like I don't care
man
prick your Facebook could come down Mark
Zuckerberg could come down and be like
yellow we want you to work for us I'm
gonna be like now I'm not trying to work
in the city I don't like the city
environment I just don't like it
you know like I'm one of those people
that just want to live like in a small
town you know enjoy their lives get to
know everybody get to know my neighbors
and shit like that but I don't care
about like
working for a big company belle-isle
work for this company that I like I
don't care about that
like to me that's not that it's not
going to give me no happiness at all
what happened is going to come from
actually just me being free me being
able to work second hours me being able
to just spend more time with my family
being able to just talk to you guys a
little bit more are you to mean getting
to create more cool projects like
holding face calm like that's why I care
about like I don't really care about
anything else besides that I don't need
a company to navigate me and say hey I
know how to code I don't need it I don't
even tell me nobody to come and say
you're a good developer is like I know
the developers I can create anything
that I want there's a big difference
like once you get to a certain level
like back in the days all I used to do
with just the front is just to HTML CSS
JavaScript but I was limited because you
can create the design you could create
the views of a website but if you don't
you you're not dealing with the back end
you're not dealing with the PHP unless a
PHP Ruby nodejs whatever you decide to
choose right if you're not dealing with
the back end then what exactly is it
that you're building you know you're
just building a freaking mast you're not
building what's behind so that's how for
your body when it comes to HTML CSS and
JavaScript you know because I just felt
limited I was there for like three years
man just believed converting pages for
me
EMM yes that's what I was doing it's fun
it's easy but at the same time it's like
that's not cool what people own for
websites web application that's just a
few layer you know you gotta have the
user the case you want to have database
migrations you want to have all of us
and you want to have control of all of
that so you go actually call yourself a
developer and I say hey I'm just a
front-end developer if you only do it
back end you know I'm just a back-end
developer because I don't know
everything time you can't just stop good
at all I know it's just this one piece
of the whole fucking
I'm almost getting to work as you can
see the little ducks to little geeses I
don't know if you guys can see it
hopefully by my job there's a whole
bunch I business pull me like you know
our cluster hire this wildlife there's
like this ducks there's freaking pieces
they're fucking what else is out here
this rakul was theirs
beers beers what else what else have I
seen this Possible's there's a whole
bunch of type of birds look Wildlife the
wildlife they just chillin out here look
like I just to me that shouldn't eat
like I can't complain like I love that I
love that work alone either you know I
kind of wish I did somewhere else like
another another city but where I'm at
right now I'm happy

videos went and guys listen if you're
going to buy any courses from you to me

see that people are actually using the
link I'm noticing that our people are I
don't know then I using everything just
everybody has already bought the courses
that they need it but yeah man whenever
you buy a course man you help me out you
basically help support the channel you
basically helped me get motivated more
because it's only like an hour dollar so
that I get but then that stacks up you
know and like I told you guys I haven't
even touched not even one dollar out of
that that money or all the money that I
get from you know for support I don't
like all the money still there stacked
up like I just want to save it I want to
keep it there for coding phase calm like
I told you guys I really want to spend
money on advertising it and getting it
out there so all the money that I get
from that and all the money that I get
from the udemy courses I'm saving that
just for the promotion of coding phase
calm because I know is going to be an
amazing project I know where this
project can go and you know I see away
