again man coding fees.com today we're
gonna talk about you know just online
IDs you know stuff like cloud 9 stuff
like coal sandbox a couple of other ones
that you probably haven't heard of no
excuse for you guys to not be able to
code I mean yeah you could do it on your
computer but what if you are somewhere
way you like hey man I don't have a
setup like you know for my Mac or I
don't have a set up for my windows I
don't have a set up for Linux I don't
have a set of four etc right whatever
you use right you could come over here
and be using a and draw a little laptop
you know a Chromebook nowadays you can
use all of that you know cuz pretty much
is code online on a browser and I won't
even lie to you guys
sometimes it might be even better
alright cuz I've seen a lot of cool
letters are popping up now that are
legit like they have like all the things
that you will expect from an IDE and
probably even a little bit more you know
so it's pretty cool I like to see where
this is going
I love Mac books I love my Mac I love
what I have but somebody was telling me
that you know at some point and from the
likes of the things that we've seen so
far from Apple Apple might be switching
up to us so they might have all of their
new products like let's say the MacBook
Pro they're trying to get rid of it
they're trying to get rid of the IMAX
like they haven't created anything for
the Mac Pro and I don't know how long
because it's like most people all they
care about their phones and their
tablets so they're probably thinking
like hey man what if we just make
everything iOS you know what I mean
and of course that will pretty much X
out all the professionals cuz I don't
even know how much stuff can you really
do on an iOS device you know I mean like
a tablet right but nowadays with this
new text editors on the browser's then
that saves you what I dry off like oh my
god
Apple was dropping the Mac OS you know
if they drop it hey we got the you know
text out of their IDs and pretty much
you go spin up your server from there
like there's so many cool stuff that's
happening you know I'm just gonna talk
about it and show you a couple of guys
son this is cold tasty this seems like
the most legit out of all of them to be
honest with you guys because it really
feels like a native ID you could
literally just come in drag things
around you see a file a tree right here
you have your debugging tools you have
you know you're sending some side and
what's cool about this is this is
perfect for uh situation for let's say
you're using you know the Chromebooks
like this is the most perfect one for
you guys okay of course they have a free
version so all of you guys can literally
come here sign up try this out see how
it is see if you like it you know I
don't know this guy's I don't get no
Commission's to these people but this
seems the most legit one definitely you
got cold sandbox the i/o completely free
this is like let's say you want to come
in and create like a quick react app or
you want to create something and share
it with your friends automatically see
like this has to you know a react router
it basically can pull any NPM package
that you could think of so pretty much
you have all the libraries to your
disposal was like yourself to you what
you want to do with it you know so this
was one of the most legit ones - I love
this one because I can create something
here share it to somebody and deco
evening download it or edit it or you
know they could just fork it to their
own coat sandbox so this is pretty legit
ok there's another one which it has free
features right so it's free
I believe honesty this one's called code
anywhere calm you got free one for each
user and then from there everything you
need to get to get started now for seven
dollars you could connect to 50 FTP
server so pretty much you could
literally come in and connect to your
servers directly from here and start
editing your websites from here so this
is cool this is great for people working
on WordPress and and things like that so
it's pretty legit
then you have this other one called
stack blitz comm this one's pretty legit
- you know you can come here and click
on any of this applications and
automatically loads it up for you this
one is actually built to be like vs code
so all the features that vs code has
they have it which is cool cuz it's like
wait on the browser and like yeah on the
browser I think you have vs code on the
browser so they built the exactly like
it even the the styles and everything I
wish they wouldn't had done that because
if you're gonna create something created
original you know you know me I'm I'm
all about originality but you know for a
lot of people they like to see something
familiar so here you go okay
then of course you got the og triple og
rappelled IIT I love this because this
here you have a whole bunch of languages
it's not just the front-end it's not
just JavaScript it's like hey man you
could come here create a new ripple and
then from there choose from any other
languages as you can see Python 3 Ruby
JavaScript HTML CSS JavaScript so you
can literally come here and create a
full web page and even multiple files so
you could come here and create a whole
website just from here you got scheme
you got c-sharp job out react native you
got C closure C sharp F sharp gold
Haskell
Kotlin PHP Python Ruby rust my god yes
six CoffeeScript broy um what else if
you want to try out some testing
you got Jess you got you know the
classical ones you know the old school
ones so yeah man like you can't go wrong
with rebel dieting but rebel die T is
not a IDE this one's right here and and
this one right here they're both ID east
meaning you get you get all the cool
stuff like you know syntax highlighting
and all the cool stuff that you get from
any ID but if you want to create
something here and and do something I
don't know
like a you know just to practice your
code or you know create something like
an algorithm or you just want to
practice your code you know you could
just literally come here and be like hey
you know a hundred times like this is
Ruby so I was like I'm gonna hunt of
times do and then come here put the N
and then put what's good coding face
sobs and that's it there you go
something simple something easy like you
could come here and literally create
something more complex it's up to you
like this thing cook you could create
multiple files like this is not just
like just this coder here you could
create a full application on this
website okay it's all up to you what you
want to create all right guys so I'll
see you guys later
and I just want to remind you guys we're
about to be in 2018 you know for those
of you guys that haven't tried the
website coda face calm and haven't
checked it out learn everything that you
need I'm not here to waste your time and
right now we basically we bout to bring
back to sixty five percent off on
everything you know so three day thing
you know is from today all the way to
the 1st of January on the 1st of January
12 o'clock so over em is gone so I'm
usually going to do this type of
specials like a 65% off probably like
three four times a year
usually it's gonna be in the first in
the beginning somewhere around like you
know May around there another time I
might do it at the end of August and
then I'll probably do it again in
November so it's like four times a year
that I'm doing it so if you're watching
this video and you want to use this code
to get 65% off and go try it out man you
know give it a chance
see if it works for you a lot of people
have been hearing me up the getting job
state you know they're getting into the
industry they're not wasting time so you
know I just come in create content for
you guys in and you know give you
everything that I know you know I can
only do that for you
alright but it's up to you if you really
want to do this and I mean just go hard
and work on it you know this is not
something that is gonna happen from one
day to the other I'm not here to give
you guys false hope and telling you hey
man this thing is the easiest thing in
the world now you have to put in the
hours you have to put in the work you
can't just show up and just do this like
as a hobby it's just they don't stay as
a hobby forever
all right I've seen it done I've seen
people I hate read I'm doing this for
two three years when I've been learning
for two three years he's like bro if
you're still learning in two three years
that means you you haven't been doing
anything it's this video is brought to
you by viewers like you and people that
support our website coding face.com all
