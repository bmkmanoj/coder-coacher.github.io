again Cody face.com your boy is backing
out and did it again we here live with
my little nephew mom so yeah so
yesterday there was a huge how many
wasn't a huge controversy but was more
like people were talking about it like
man you know Joe says you know the the
top technologies that they should learn
is you know react but why should they
learn react you guys this video is
brought to you by viewers like you
and people that support our website
coding phase com go check it out over 20
courses in there that's gonna guide you
to become a developer from the beginning
to becoming a pro you know they got
angular they got this this and that
guys you are right about this you are
right about this because angular is very
popular and still going to be very
popular right but when I say yours the
number one skill to learn is because the
longevity the fact that you get to
create phone applications with react the
fact that you can actually use say for
the web you can actually use it for VR
you can actually use it for like
literally I think people use it to
create the you I of a fridge a samsung
fridge
it's made with react you know what I'm
saying so it's like why wouldn't you
want to learn it you know what I'm
saying plus there's so many jobs there's
as many jobs as angular in the United
States okay
now I'm talking about stuff that I know
about that's here in the US okay I don't
know about internationally I don't know
about you know what's going on in India
I don't know what's going on in China I
don't know what's going on in Europe I'm
telling you from my experience here in
the US and what happens when something
happens here in the US
it's pretty much what's happening all
over the place okay so definitely I will
say learn react right if you can learn
angular go ahead learn angular I'm not
telling you guys don't learning angular
is very important you know for
enterprise if you're looking to work at
you know let's say IBM for example write
something that couldn't came up to my
head right now
right it's not the only enterprise
company but let's say IBM or let's say I
don't know General Motors or I don't
know I can't think of a company right
now but those companies they do love
angular all right they do love angular
because angular pretty much has
everything that you need in just one
framework all right but what happens is
that a lot of people are realizing that
just to train somebody on angular it
takes too long because it's so much
stuff that you got to learn that in
reality is like wait hold on we got to
learn ng this ng that freaking 30,000
directors 30,000 freaking angular core
like this so much so much is that you
gotta learn it I'll try not to curse but
there's so much is out there that you
got to learn that it's just kind of
ridiculous compared to react react you
you know JavaScript you good you gotta
say like you go you that's all you
really need it but like I said just go
ahead nerve react this a lot of stuff
that's happening in the industry that's
around the react so for you guys you
know if it was me brand new developer
and all I have to worry about is a
learning JavaScript all right I say I
don't know HTML CSS now I'm gonna focus
on JavaScript right the easiest way to
continue with your learning is to learn
react because the react only reinforces
the skills that you already know as a
developer you know so that's all I'm
saying okay you can choose whatever you
want you can choose whatever you feel
like you know some people they hate
haven't
right um you know HTML inside the
JavaScript like they hate it right they
hate it with a passion they're like I'm
not doing it I'm not putting my my HTML
inside of JavaScript it's like they so
reluctant against it so there's like it
doesn't matter how many pros you give
them they're gonna be like oh man you
know every book that I've read have said
don't mix your HTML with your JavaScript
and don't put everything in one single
file and it's like yeah that was the
old-school way of doing things like you
wouldn't want to be doing that with
jQuery but JSX is different you know not
saying like it's a different flow it's a
different way of doing things it's
something newer I mean some people say
oh it's XML I'm like Samia I don't see s
XML at all because in XML you all the
things that you could do with JSX you
can't do it with eczema you know saying
plus it's just JavaScript man I find it
that people just fight against it
they're like man I'm just not gonna do
it man I'm just not gonna learn it
because it's like I don't want to put my
HTML or JavaScript on the same file and
it's like you know you're fighting the
future and you know what I'm saying like
if you're creating elements with
JavaScript why wouldn't you want to use
JSX
which is pretty much hey I'm gonna
create this elements no matter what but
the only difference is instead of you
having to use it and say hey go use this
template now you just say eff that I'm
just gonna write it right here in my
JavaScript you gonna say like I don't
need to have a template file I don't
need to have a control of fire I don't
need to have a modifier like that's
annoying the other saying so I don't
know but that's that's what I think you
know but what do I know you get on a
saying like what do I know I already
know anything but like I said guys just
learn whatever you want man all of them
that I could say is I can recommend
something to you if you feel like hey
this is not for you it's not for you
right now you can literally say hey man
I'm actually a freaking I don't know Oh
camel developer like you could be a no
camel developer you could be a Perl
developer if you want to I mean you do
whatever you want and whatever actually
interesting now when it comes to jobs
and opportunities it's a different story
you know what I mean
got my little nephews out here they were
making all that noise hopefully you guys
get the message and understand what I'm
trying to tell you guys and teach you
guys out here so yeah man we just out
here a little isolated Park but it's
pretty cool I'm having fun out here you
know we chillin so yeah man it's your
boy Joe back at it again coding face.com
your boys back and I done did it again
guys learn whatever you feel like you
know I can only give you you know an
advice right I can only try to guide you
guys a certain way that's it but
everything else beyond that it's on you
you got to choose what you feel more
comfortable with you know if you're
gonna hate something you're gonna hate
the job they might you might as well
learn something that you're gonna love
right that's why you learning to code
because you want to start doing
something that's fun if you feel like
react this is horrible for you or you
you just can't stand that you're like
man I can't I can't deal with GSX I
can't have my HTML inside of JavaScript
even Don creating elements with
JavaScript then that's on you you got
what I'm saying like it's like if you
want to call go and use ionic or but
what's the other one a native script to
make applications and you want to use
like something that it's not even
negative go ahead man I feel like react
native is literally the future when it
comes to off
applications so yeah anyways here boy
job back at it again coding phase comm I
hope you guys enjoyed this a little
quick video just here you know I always
try to give you guys good content you
know random content no matter what so
yes your boy Joe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
