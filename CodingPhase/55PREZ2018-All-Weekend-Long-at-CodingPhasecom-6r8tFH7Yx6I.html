oh yeah man we got a lot of new people
in here people that keep saying man
finally I made a life man
digital jazz is in here let me see Cody
face thinking of getting the 2015
MacBook Pro does it make sense to get
the new 215 versus the 2017 the 2015
model has more ports and no touch bar
I'm wondering if this is a good decision
listen get the water from 2015 I have
two brand new one the one with the touch
bar you do not need that man I wish I
couldn't get my money back so be honest
with you I wish I could get my money
back oh because this is not worth it
right like with the same amount of money
that I paid up in like two thousand
something like 2,400 the max-style
2013 laptop the MacBook Pro I maxed it
out basically is not worth it right I
could have literally bought a monster
2015 17 inch freaking super fast you
know I could have upgraded a day
whatever I wanted to so by the 2015 guys
I don't know if you guys saw my last
video I think I'm gonna cut up that part
where I was talking about Dell computers
but I'm like yo you touch it Dell you
catch something automatically right and
I just talked about how cheap even Apple
computers are right now you go on eBay
for $300 you buy an Apple computer and
you're good like it could be 2018 2020
18 2008 it could be a 2008-2009 computer
and that computer is better than most
Windows computers that you're gonna find
that best buy right now
you go in there somebody tells you hey
man I'm gonna buy a Chromebook a
Chromebook is Q is pretty
but that's not a Mac let's be honest
right you might as well spend that money
in buying yourself a nice MacBook Pro
right or even a Mac Pro you know get the
big body if you working from home buy
yourself a desktop you know a laptop is
cool if you're gonna be moving around
personally I don't take this laptop
anywhere I don't even take you to the
couch I don't take you nowhere so and
reality me having a laptop doesn't make
sense you know a saint but yeah go get
yourself the 2015 don't even spend the
money on that oh yeah man ages like you
know what I was on that fought out a
special man there's people who the
people that believed in your boy man to
be what I believed in me you know those
are the people that got I found out a
special man that was a an amazing
special man for fathers man you know how
much work I've put into this West so
many courses tutorials and their
projects oh my god and they just eaten
it

Kangaroos you dig you know losers hit me
up like yo you've good in the hood you
got a hook pass in Australia I was like
all right that's what's up I got a hook
pass
Australia kid I mean how many people
could say that you know I mean we we go
right now and I got the I got a couple
of shorties that heading here from New
Zealand I don't know how we in New York
right now I'm from Dominican look I was
born in Dominican Republic right at
Island ranked third world country
walking around with no shoes right
walking around in a backyard with it's
like the forest right like that's how I
grew up right move to the United States
move out here
hey the beautiful country of America you
know I love America by the way um yeah
so the beautiful nation of America I
moved out here was an immigrant my mom
was an immigrant she brought us over
lived over here somehow from here from
this little spot in the world of New
York City now I live in Connecticut
which is like two hours away but going
back to the story you know how I do so
go back to the story somehow your boy is
hot in like Australia and New Zealand I
got the shorties hitting me up like yo
with the crazy accent yo I love that
accent by the way please don't hit me
with the accent you know then you
ceiling accident got you boy oh I love
that but yes so we hot in Australia I
don't know how um yeah man we are here
we grinding man I don't know how we just
you know like we made it man we met I
mean they we make it yet I mean we still
haven't made it we still coming up man
is just the beginning I got like 10,000
subscribers 15,000 subscribers going to
16,000 subscribes well until your boy
touches that hundred thousand that hundo
once we touch that hundo we gonna be in
here is gonna be you get a laptop you'll
get a laptop you'll get a laptop you'll
get a laptop it's not a big kumbaya Joe
it can eight yo were free you know what
I mean
listen man there's no point there's no
point of like you know accumulating
riches without giving back in and giving
people stuff because it's like it feels
good man if he's good cuz it's like oh
man like you know you just give him back
to the community and it's the same thing
when you sign up to the website people
this is what you've got to understand
it's like not only are you helping
yourself to learn all this stuff at the
same time you're helping me right to
continue doing this and at the same time
you're pretty much paying for other
people that cannot pay for this at all
there's a lot of people that hit me up
that they just cannot pay for it all
right this deuce that you send me I'm
like yo man I'm in the Philippines
fighting Tigers I'm over here oh I mean
I'm in Cuba right now fighting the
dengue I'm you know guys hit me up like
yo I just had a fight with a lion I'm
from Zimbabwe like people hit me up with
the craziest stories right but the
people that I know that they cannot pay
for this and I know they in situations
where we could help them out I give this
out for free right and that's the only
way I you know it's not to keep it like
no some communist or oh is it socialism
but I feel like we all gotta help each
other out right so it's like there's no
point of me creating all of this content
and saying hey I'm only gonna keep this
to the small circle of people that can
only uh you know take advantage of it
that's selfish right that's the same
reason why I didn't do this thing where
it's like you can literally come in and
say hey my courses are a thousand
dollars each
right you pay five hundred dollars per
month for a subscription in to the mine
into the people they will think of oh
wow
this is so expensive it gotta be so low
so good when in reality you realize it's
like no it's not it's not that good it's
the same thing that everybody else has
they're not really giving you anything
that will make a difference in your life
right but what I said I said you know
what I don't care about trying to just
ooh get gathered like five people per
month right I could say hey man all my
courses is $1,000 and I could get five
people out of the thousands and
thousands of people that come to this
channel into this website five people
for sure per month will sign up right
and that would be like well I $5,000 per
month that you could come in and swindle
those people but what's the point of
that now only five people could come in
and enjoy all the content like I put in
so much hours into this guy's this is
not something that I want just for me
and my friends and me and a few people
to have I want everybody to be able to
learn all this stuff right because I
know out of you know the the two
thousand plus members write a good
amount you know at least twenty to
thirty percent of the people that sign
up are gonna become you know who knows
where they gonna work at right and one
day when they be like 10 20 years from
now
somebody's gonna add some hey man
whether you start and they're gonna be
like oh man I went to this website this
crazy guy called Joe is his website was
coding face.com just from that that
little bite right that little bite that
will continue my legacy on right just
from that right I don't need to be like
oh man we're gonna cash in or everybody
not just that that little that little
bite of like hey man we started here
that's all I need you know I mean like
there's a lot of stuff going on you know
what I mean I tell sometimes I come in
here about a video we talk about things
but there's other stuff that goes on
with me there's like health is not good
right now who knows where I will be at a
year two years ago three years from now
three years from now you know I mean
like I could just die tomorrow right but
was gonna continues the legacy reign is
gonna continue the legacy is gonna have
people like Barbara who's gonna continue
with the community gotta have other
people like Jake who's gonna continue
with cloning face you know this a lot of
stuff that could happen right but when
you do the right thing your legacy
continues and that's what I'm trying to
do right I'm now here trying to become a
million I'm not here trying to swindle
people in
everything that I do I put in a lot of
work yeah I give you guys all my best
content every single time I create
something and yeah that's what we at
right now alright so anyways man is
Superboy job back at it again coding
face.com
and yeah we here we live man we we
enjoying this strawberry colada Dunkin
Donuts you owe me a check for doing your
plug god dammit yes yes over here man we
chillin man we got Carlos we got Barbara
we got digital jazz Kevin Davis oh let
me see who else is in here man who's in
here man who's in here who else is in
here Luis Suarez let me see
listen we Suarez if you wanna be a
member of the website and you don't have
a credit card
nothing send me an email man send me an
e-mail code a face at gmail.com let me
know what's going on we get you in
somehow you know what I mean we got you
in no matter what you know I'm here to
help everybody man
you guys are getting static let me know
can you guys see me can you guys see me
can you guys hear me let me see what's
going on
oh man Michael microphone acting up hold
on give me a second
let me see yo yo yo yo yo
yo yo can you guys see me now let me
know receive the static went away
let me see yeah we good we good now we
good now
yeah man give it a try man try you know
give it a try man listen this is a new
mic the thing is that this thing is
connecting it is a crazy situation right
so because this room has so much it has
like I don't know it has an echo so what
I did was a half a one program let me
show it to you guys let me see if I read
to you guys some people they're usually
interested in things like this they want
to know how are things set up behind the
scenes so I'll show you guys real quick
yes sir you guys in case somebody want
to be doing this in the future so huh
and they wonder how I do it pretty much
I have a focus right all right so we got
an interface that we connect this
microphone right and then what happens
is I have this microphone connected to
Adobe Audition
and then this the monitor input I'm
using monitor input so it's basically
outputting the audio right and then from
there I'm taking this program called
loopback which takes any audio that's
coming out of this program and it's
actually using it as if it was an input
and at the same time I'm processing it
with a bunch of different effects like
if I take out the effects from here you
will hear a bigger difference like this
how this room sounds I don't know if you
guys really want to hear this room like
that you know what I mean so you see so
I was like there's definitely like a
different sound right so what I do is I
come in I put in the effects to just
clean up the the audio now the reason
why my voice sounds like a little bit
like it cuts off um after certain like a
certain frequency is because of this
it's called dynamic processing and
that's because there's a lot of stuff
going on in my house right there's
people walking around as people talking
it's the baby crying there's the baby
hitting stuff that's a baby breaking
down like things if I don't put this
then what happens is you guys could hear
every single thing that's happening
inside my house so
that is how the setup is for what is
livestream okay and that's why the
microphone sounds like this all right
you get it you got it now you get the
little behind-the-scenes you know what I
mean like sprinkle a little something on
top so yeah man all this well be doing
right now I'm coating face calm I hope
that clears up was going on with the
Microsoft the microphone Filipa hack the
mic yeah so it's like a half a lot of
stuff going on man yeah I need to get
some high college I want to get this
whole room full of like studio phone
like that'd be hot right but I just
gotta find like a good company cuz I was
looking on Amazon and there was selling
like for 20 bucks like six little pieces
that were like this size I'm like that's
not what I want I want like the big the
big size thing so I could just tape it
up everywhere cuz I also don't want to
put in like glue on on this room I don't
want to glue it to the wall
so you know because I don't want to mess
up the walls man no I'm not in today
plus you never know I'm planning on
fixing the basement once I finish fixing
the basement as a rat like those audio
problems like the basement sounds
amazing but for some reason this room
has so much like echoing and weird
sounds I don't know it's like though the
walls like whoa oh no Alex the walls
freaking gives a lot of feedback let me
see it
see was girls girls girls girls good so
yeah man we here so there's the code

only difference it's the same thing
so Gino Fernandez is building a react
native app that's cool let me see
completing a react and redux project or
seen a scene in front and positioning
that's cool I hear Black Panther has
their reviews it seems like you got
awesome good reviews making beats cars
backs is gonna be making some beats
let me see when was the last time you've
been to the movie theaters last time I
went to the movie theaters was we went
to go see Logan that was a good movie
that was worth my money I liked it I
liked it it was pretty cool we want to
go see more Logan and my wife he was
still pregnant at that time but right
now I mean we can't even go to the
movies it's like I wanted to go to see
Star Wars but then
I I was like I'm not gonna be able to go
see it cuz what the hell I'm gonna do
I'm gonna go by myself you know what I
mean so cuz we have a brand new new boy
you can't take that kid in there he's
gonna go crazy in there right so um I
wanted to see Star Wars but then I just
say I can't wait too long so I watched
it on Cody and thank God I didn't waste
my money cuz I would have been pissed I
would have went in there like go I need
a refund you know what I mean like that
movie was horrible
let me see what else and that's about it
I mean the movies that I watch I'm
constantly watching 80s in 90s movies
like that's I feel like that's where
movies were good everything else after
that is pretty much shitty even like 80s
and 90s shows that's what I watch if Nam
I'm watching documentaries like I was
watching this documentary last night on
Netflix I forgot the name of it but it's
pretty cool and sad at the same time so
there's this guy who is a traitor right
so what he does is he buys used clothes
used toys use everything right he puts
it in a van
and he goes through the countryside of
like some Czech Slovakian country I
don't know I don't know was the name of
the country to be honest with you um it
could be Serbia could be something I
don't know it's one of those Slavic
countries up there or like what was that
uh Eastern Europe right so it's like
super poor which is my I don't know
mind-blowing to think like in Europe
like people are poor like to me I
wouldn't think that I would be like oh
now it's Europe man it's like people got
money in Europe you know but it's like
people are poor in Europe like really
poor so this guy people don't even have
money to to buy anything right and
what's crazy about it is that the guy
comes in he he basically trades potatoes
they give him potatoes heat raised them
like used clothes he
trÃ©s toilet people for potatoes like
it's crazy all the things that he trade
for literally like potatoes cuz those
people they don't have no money so all
they have is just like you know potatoes
which is what they grow in that area so
it's crazy
let me see project Fox a lot should I
focus on getting front-end jobs are
getting experience before moving on to
back in and becoming a full-stack I mean
you could start applying to getting a
you know a front-end job as soon as you
can like it's the easiest way but at the
same time as I don't forget to continue
learning cuz people get lazy you got a
job you know oh man I'm tired and I've
been calling all day in my job you know
it's like people I don't know reacting
like they freaking lifting up boxes it's
like it's difficult sometimes but as I
grow you still got energy to come home
and study some more so it's like stop
acting up you know so don't get lazy man
let me see I think I should do what I
think I should doing too much I don't
know I don't know what the hell that
means project Fox yeah Jo how do I deal
with feeling excluded and my internship
should I bring it up to them um excluded
mm-hmm is it you're getting excluded by
other developers like that are in an
internship or you're getting excluded by
like senior developers who work there
it's a big difference you know
sometimes they might just be busy man
you know it's hard you know that's
nothing that was watching this this
article somebody added about our IP
junior positions right somebody added it
to the chat room on my community right
on this court and it was a good article
name it made sense the girl was saying
that when she got hired when she went to
the job interview as a junior not job
interview but her job position she
started the first week all she really
was left to do was just be like oh just
going this sit down on this computer and
basically look at the internet great and
that happens a lot of time because
senior developers don't know how to
train junior developers right sometimes
you just don't want to deal with it like
you have a lot of stuff that you gotta
do and then you still have to do your
work right you gonna say so usually
that's the the issues that happen so if
you're getting excluded that could be
one of the reasons it could be like hey
they're just busy and you just gotta
tell my hey man like you know can you
guys cut off some work at me you know
bring me in sometimes I don't know I
mean just bring it up you can bring it
up slightly don't don't be like intern
here you're supposed to talk to me like
now don't do it like that cuz then
people's gonna be like yo we can't deal
with this cake get him out of here yo
they're gonna be like yo yo whose man's
is this come come pick up your man's son
like that's how they gotta be to HR
they're gonna buy your HR come pick up
your man's hit this kid up out of here
like sorry k you know that happens all
the time and if it all it takes one
person not to like you and that's it
you're gone right
so yeah Mike Dunn says just install Ruby
on Rails where do I start I'm new to
coding listen go to my website right now
you literally have 55 press 2018 start
from there man start from there there's
a timeline it shows you everything that
you need to start with if you're looking

like oh I'm breeding and just pass out
Wow word man starting to gulp course
tonight that's what's up man
some fluids man but it's alright it's
just I probably cuz I don't know I move
too quick a sign I don't know you know
how it is man listen I have a lot of
health things going on I don't put it
out there I don't even tell people it's
like this a couple of serious things
going on you know so I was like that's
just how it is but your boy is gonna be
here it's not nothing that you freaking
die from but could be serious let's see
what happens I'm good he was ready man
so let's see Kevin Lopez says yo Joe how
to see any developers not like during
developers the problem is not that
people don't like Johnny developers the
problem is think about it like this you
are a senior developer you have five to
ten years in right the owner of the
company your project manager CEO CTO
whoever the hell wants to put pressure
on you right they want you to finish the
project as soon as possible right then
you say hey I need help I need extra
help because I can't finish this project
by myself so then your supervisor
whoever the hell works
it's a Buffy right comes in and says hey
we're gonna bring in two junior
developers right and then this junior
developers somehow they swindle
themselves in into the company and they
get hired right and then all they know
how to do is HTML CSS and bootstrap
right that happens a lot of times right
so now you're there and you're like oh
man like I need help like I need a lot
of stuff here that needs to get done in
I need extra hand I don't need to be
babysitting right so that's when the
problem between seniors and junior
developers have
it's not really that they don't want to
teach the person it's just that there's
pressure on them to finish a project and
they need the extra help and HR instead
of finding people who are qualified
they're bringing a junior developer who
might not know anything who might just
he just came from a boot camp a boot
camp gave him three months of training
he did one project like there's one
thing that people forget to about boot
camps and what why is my problems like
they work super fast to try to learn
everything and at the end of the project
at the end of the boot camp they have
one project to show for all right so
it's like one major project to show for
right so when they graduate all they
know is just that one project right and
then what happens is they get hired and
then I oh you're this person you know
it's a great developer always on time
this isn't that day you're hired and you
as the senior developer you're like oh
man I need the extra hand I can't be
dealing with teaching somebody right now
cause it's a big difference this
companies are huge rain like they say
somewhat like Google or whatever
Facebook right I always bring those guys
up but there's a lot of companies
besides them that are close to their
level who basically they treat the
developers pretty good well right those
companies they have time to say hey
we're gonna train we're gonna bring in
very bright brilliant kids to be junior
developers right and they're gonna have
three to six months to get adjusted and
become you know in tune with the company
right but then there's smaller companies
or startups or um medium-sized
businesses that they hire junior
developers and they expect those junior
developers to know as much as a senior
developer and then when they get hired
they realized that they just don't they
don't have those skills right so it's
like they need somebody to train them
and teach them how it works in a company
but the senior developer is getting
pressure from the the company the CTO
freaking manager project manager whoever
the hell is above him
to finish the project as soon as
possible so what happens now he has
double work he has the work of himself
he has the work of you the junior
developer because he has to make sure
that everything that you give in to him
and you're pushing into the repo is
top-notch if not you're just wasting
time and you're basically making his
life more miserable so that's when the
problem between junior and senior
developers happens it's not a personal
thing it's more of a man I just need to
get this job done and then you're
bringing in somebody who doesn't know
everything that we need him to know and
we don't have time to train it okay so
that's the problem what's the best site
for a shared hosting I mean I like
namecheap.com they seem pretty cool let
me see John Hayes Joe here is weird the
list of how to follow courses okay very
simple you go to my website you go to
coding face.com right but coding frees
calm right here the third little thing
here there little icon
it says timeline so that's your timeline
to become a developer right if you want
to become a front-end back-end full
stack game development all of these
haven't been added yet right they're
gonna be added this week I might take
this off for now so you're just gonna
see front end back in a full stack so
front-end is what you see on our website
right the back end is like the brain of
the web site okay that's just to break
it down in simple terms now full stack
means you know how to create the pages
that people see and you also know how to
create the backend of the website so you
know the front-end and the backend so
when you come here you click here front
end it says ok and
average person has let's say most people
they do 3 times 5 which is 15 so most
people they they get to do 15 hours per
week all right so that's 3 hours per day
okay and that's usually most people only
do 5 days of the week there's a you know
situations where you're like me you're
like a freak with it where you just you
do it every single day but most people
when they starting off they're only
gonna do it five days in a week and
sometimes they do it even less than that
all right so you say how many hours per
week can you devote you say 15 you click
on there automatically it tells you all
the courses that you're gonna need to
become a front-end developer right and
it tells you at your pace per week it
will take you 28 days okay so in 28 days
that's how long it's gonna take you
right and let's say if you do this five
times a week you take a calculator and
you say 28 maybe I should add that so
how many weeks is gonna take you to so
cuz some people they want to know that
so it's gonna say 28 days so you divide
5 by 28 so it's gonna take you five
weeks so that's a month you know let's
say a muffin I don't know like eight
days eight nine days that's how long
it's gonna take you to finish everything
on this website right and that's just
the front end okay now if you come here
and you go to the back end you say I
only do 15 hours per week it's gonna
take you 11 days so that's two weeks to
learn the back end two weeks that's it
it's not that much but to learn
full-stack which is the front end and
the back end come here and say 15 we're
gonna take you 39 days okay
if you want to know how many weeks is
that 39 divided by five that's seven
weeks
that's uh what that's like on almost two
months seven point eight weeks so let's
say two months is gonna take you to
learn everything alright so that's just
how it is man you know and that's just
the average I'm giving you guys to
average like if somebody comes in and it
really works hard and you say hey I'm
not going to school I'm not working I
left with my mom's I live with my girl
whatever whatever your situation might
be you say hey I'm gonna work forty
hours per week well you do this in ten
days you can knock all this stuff out in
ten days okay
now one thing that I tell people which
I'm also going to add this to the
timeline is that not only are you
learning to code right and you you
watching you're watching somebody
teaching you how to code but you gotta
take into consideration right you
creating your portfolio because you
learning how to code okay you know how
to code right but now it's gonna take
you another month on top of however long
it took you to learn everything to build
your portfolio it's a month minimum
right so each project should take you a
minimum of one week any project that
takes you less than a week that's not a
project that you should be putting on
your portfolio that's being honest right
cuz it's not a full application is not
something that you you actually put in
work you don't want to be showing in
like oh here's a color picker like no
nobody cares you could do a color picker
nobody cares that you could do a
calculator nobody cares that you can do
um I don't know let's go to uh was this
guy's name yes and I like I like his
stuff rez boss thirty all right
cause I seen somebody that added every
single project that he added here
like nobody cares if you have all of
these projects inside your portfolio all
right this is for practice this is not
for you to be showing it off right when
you go into but like you try to get into
the MBA
you don't show people your practice you
practice videos nobody cares about that
what they care about is you making
buckets in a game so there's the same
thing as becoming a web developer you
showing off the the projects that you
did to practice doesn't mean that's
guaranteeing you to get a job that's
only showing like oh cool he knows how
to practice you gotta say like it's not
showing you no hate this person's in the
game this person they should in buckets
you get what I'm saying like anybody
could shoot three-pointers from
half-court by himself right but can they
do it when the game is rolling when
people got the you know they playing D
on him when this you know problems he
gonna saying so it's the same thing as
coding anybody could come in and say oh
let's build the clock in JavaScript
anybody can do that
my nephew could do that my baby I could
put my baby right now to do that right
but can somebody come in and build a
full application and like right now we
we building this on I'm gonna show you
right now there's a project that I'm
building right now and is a course on my
website so we building the Craigslist
application right so this whole web site
itself is done with react right and we
use a react and we also using our react
router okay and not only that we are
also using no J yes so it's like a full
application alright it's a full
application that we are building and at
the same time it's like you learning but
you're building a real application it's
not like you're gonna come in to my
website and be like oh you're gonna
learn a freakin how to build a clock how
to build a calculator
like that takes two minutes that's not
even worth anybody paying money for it
right and that's one of the reason why
West boss has 30 days 30 small projects
that are completely free he does it
completely free for people because those
projects are not worth putting into a
portfolio to share it to anybody that's
like just for practice it's like
somebody who comes in and be like hey
man I'm putting in my resume I finished
the whole freako camp um
freaking map and it's like people are
gonna look at you like like what do you
want people to do give you a pat on the
back as you finish freako camp like
that's not real life experience that's
just you following instructions like
anybody could do that right so like I
say go to my website go subscribe if you
want to if you really want to get real
life experience real life projects
things that people is gonna hit you up
you guys don't know I wish I could put
every single person this email that
sends me like oh my god everything that
that you said it was right when I went
to to my job everything that you was
saying was right I'm freaking oh my god
thank God I found you because I listened
to you to start learning PHP I couldn't
find a job for three months I started
learning PHP I found a job two weeks
after like yeah I'm a self-taught
developer guys I'm telling you guys for
experience I'm telling you guys the
things that I had to learn the hard way
you know I was like hey I wanted to
learn the cool stuff out there on the
internet but nobody's hiring for the
cool stuff on the internet you know
those things like why would you waste
your time learning something like UJS
it's like I'm gonna learn it I'm gonna
build my website in view Jes right and
it's like bro nobody's hiring you for
that it's like somebody in the back of
the office is gonna break
like whoopee effing do you get what I'm
saying so bill real projects man so
anyways sorry yeah I go into a rat real
quick but yeah man that's the timeline
man go check out the timeline I'm gonna
do a video a separate video about that
getting into the timeline and
understanding it question regarding the
discount code is the link for all of
your courses or just the subscription
model is 55% off on the subscription
model right if you want to buy a course
or anything like that you can use the
regular code that we have on the
description which says from YouTube you
put from YouTube on the coupon or with a
coupon code and you get 50% off right on
any course or anything that's on the
website but if you want 55% off the
subscription which in reality is so much
better like people don't understand like
buying a separate course the reason why
I'm doing this description because I
want you guys to get the most for your
buck
right when you think about it when you
most people is gonna come in and they're
gonna finish about four courses four or
five courses in one month right so for
$10 you got five courses how much is
that you basically bind a course for two
dollars
you got one saying like when you do the
math like you'd be like wait what like
I'm buying a course for two dollars I
think you get what I'm saying like dude
those are the things that people don't
understand for like people they don't do
the math sometime like you literally
getting courses for two dollars if you
get to finish five courses in one month
you get to basically buy them for two
dollars and you do the same thing for
like two three months you if you want to
stay as a member you stay as a member
and you cancel it whenever you want
right when you buy it individually you
say I just want to buy it right I don't
want to sign up to no subscription base
I just want to buy of course might be
$15 of course might be $20 that right
there could have been two three months
where you could have done every course
on the website you get what I'm saying
like like business-wise I do it so dumb
right like I don't know how to explain
like it is dumb right like that was like
the whole thing wave or was this kid's
name the clever program is like yo you
have really good courses and really good
oh the content on your website you
selling yourself short and I'm gonna
guess I know that I'm setting myself
really really short because it's like
people are selling one course for 500
bucks right people are selling one
course for 200 bucks you got a brat huh
see he sells it for 200 way less stuff
and way less materials than what I do
right for two bucks all right and you go
to any freaking person that sells
courses or has their own website I'm
literally the cheapest person out here
right and it doesn't make sense but to
me it makes sense because it just I'm
not this is not my income this is not my
thing where I'm like this is mine this
is my business for me to make money I'm
not doing that like that I'm doing it
like yo this is how I get to uh give
free stuff to other people that's how I
look at Cody face.com all the content
that I was doing here on YouTube I used
to do it for free
nobody wanted to really do it so what
this does is like hey I'm paying $10 a
month and it holds you accountable to do
your work I want you guys to succeed I
want you guys to do good and get your
jobs and you know succeed in life you
know get out that job that
you're working but it's like people you
gotta hold them accountable it's like
they don't want to do it if it's free
people who won't do it that's that's the
sad story about it and I people just
don't do it everybody that knows me
that's been here from the beginning you
know you guys have definitely seen
make me do all this stuff for free and
nobody was doing it we was getting zero
views we wasn't getting nothing because
nobody cares about it right but at the
same time as I okay so let's hold people
accountable if I'm holding myself
accountable to do as all of this
projects in and create olives all of
this content I'm holding all of you guys
accountable to do the work to you know
nothing cuz I'm not doing this for me
for me I could be playing ps4 right now
and just chilling like my life is good I
literally make money from other websites
and I'm good I can't well like a little
BS nine hundred dollars from YouTube now
I'm good like I don't need to be doing
my website gonna face that car but this
is my way to making sure that you guys
get to do your work and get to learn
this and then you know five years from
now you're gonna come back and gonna be
like yo Joe you was right you know now
I'm good now my life is better and just
it flows like that you know I mean life
is like that like somebody helps you out
somebody holds you accountable to things
and you get things done you think that
person you know it's like there's a lot
of people that hit me up all the time
like you know man thank you so much you
know I had somebody send me a message
like yeah I watch all your videos and
now I decided to really go hard and
change my life because I saw my kid the
other day and I said you know what I
want to give this kid you know all the
opportunities that I can but if I don't
hold nobody accountable to do this it's
like I'm speaking to the air you know
what I'm saying like I'm speaking to the
war I could speak to the wrong but okay
we'll go go so go learn because this is
actually good for you
the wars not gonna do anything for me
you know what I'm saying like the Wars
not gonna listen to me because the wall

work done man
yeah man see Jones definitely seen the
power that's in here man listen I'm not
even trying to sell so you guys are on
it
we literally it's just what it is right
think about it like this
I'm just something we're gonna do it
right the only difference between me and
you is that I've already went through
all of the stuff that you're about to go
through to become a developer right so
if I can come in and save you the time
and save you the energy of looking for
resources learning things that you do
not need to learn I'll save you the time
of like focusing on real projects that
is gonna get you jobs let's say you won
you get what I'm saying like you good
you don't need nothing else all right
and that's what I'm here for man rashad
Beeler is like yeah I just big I just
built a calculator I thought it was cool
like sorry man you know I was like it's
true dough I couldn't literally right
now I could be playing ps4 I have this
game called Saint Seiya right now that
I'm dying to beat man and I'm constantly
coding I'm constantly creating projects
for you guys and I'm like man why do I
continue doing this or even you saw how
my wife came in and she's like yo I was
like I'm like you're alive and she's
like so like like you don't need to be
on this freaking YouTube you never
say like that's the attitude of
everybody that I knows like I don't need
to be on this thing right I don't need
to be promoting or anything please like
I do it because I know this is it's like
I'm dropping little seeds
it doesn't matter like this a lot of
people is gonna sign up and there's a
lot of people that's got a cancer at the
end of the month and be like oh I'm not
gonna do it
I am too lazy I don't have time but the
people that do finish everything to get
the jobs and do everything and then
continues down the line you know they
get a good job to get to put the kids in
private school they get to pay for for a
house to get to buy their a nice car
they get to take care of their mom they
take care that their wife they care the
kid you know it's like
trickles down man like everything that I
do here is gonna be for a reason I don't
know why but I feel like the long-term
is gonna be like something great is
gonna come out of this right and I know
it right all this work that I'm putting
in I know it's gonna pay off at the end
somehow I was watching I was a fun fun
function right and he just recently quit
his job right he's quit his job at
Spotify he was doing kora for five years
he did YouTube for three years and I'm
like yo I was able to quit my job at
like six months in on on YouTube there's
a lot of big youtubers that are here and
they still working full-time like
there's something that I did I don't
know what it is when I came in my stats
went up like that I started getting
hoping to subscribers even right now my
I just started getting like this week I
got like 2,000 subscribers just brand
new subscribers I was like yo this is
crazy
something has happened there's something
special about this community is
something special about this channel
something special that I'm doing here
right and it's for a reason because all
of these things that I'm doing it's like
I'm doing it like 10 times as fast as
any other other youtubers or any other
instructor out there I was so into
Steven grided the other day and he was
like yo I don't even know how you he
tell he told me straight I'm like I
don't even know how you got 2,000
subscribers I came and get you know I
can't even get all freaking 500 people
to come to my website and that's even
greater that's somebody who basically I
learned react with him in like you know
it's like a lot of stuff that I learned
was from him she was like somehow I was
like I'm like you know it's like when
mr. Miyagi you know what I mean like
it's like you're about to surpass you
know I don't know how to explain it it's
like you know how when Oh Michael is
like you know how can we put it man it's
like you
to surpass the Masters you gonna say
like whatever I'm doing here it's about
to surpass what anybody else has ever
done on this space this space of YouTube
this space of teaching people online
this space of helping people out I'm
already on a trajectory that's just up
like it's crazy you know it's like the
other day freaking naming the other day
like why was it like four or five months
ago like II like the computer got pissed
off at me I don't have like 6,000
subscribers at that time right pissed
off at me because I'm telling him bro
just do content stop cryin all the time
and create content of like what people
want to hear from you
nobody wants to hear about oh you you're
not making you was making 300 grand last
year and now you're making 200 grand
nobody's gonna cry for you nobody's
gonna cry that tear for you you get what
I'm saying like you're not helping
nobody out you're not doing nothing for
anybody so it's like nobody's gonna cry
for that you get what I'm saying so
thinking about him like yo he's been
here for 10 years and I like he can't
even his subscriber count' it's not even
close to my subscriber count' he has a
million subscribers in his subscriber
count is not even close to my subscriber
count when it comes to my website and
the people that just sort of love are
here and the the good things that I've
done to this website is like this my
first year you know saying even like
clever programmer clever programmers
that buys a whole bunch of subscribers
and he's not even close to the amount of
people that that come in and love the
channel in Inked sends me emails like yo
you helped me out so much you've done
this isn't that like we are in a
different space we are in a different
space I told you guys last year when I
quit my job I was gonna go super hard so
I was like we're doing a lot of stuff
that all of these people have never done
we are in a space where nobody has done
before
right it's like we killing it Raina you
gotta say so it's like everything that
we're doing is for a reason
it's just dropping little seeds man
dropping little seeds of like just
helping people out and in the long term
that's gonna come back to me you know
all I want is just the no blessings I
want God to go like this to me it's like

know sometimes we do is live live videos
man and we have fun man you know after
an hour man you can't be mad at me man
we already gave you an hour of content
after an hour this is the hangout time
this is like coding phase after dark you
know what I mean we swipe in we swiping
credit cards in the wrong places we
throwing money out here we we sipping
that lean you know I mean we got that
that Coolatta you dig starts getting
crazy after an hour you know I mean so

Dunn did it again go in there let you
look leave the scalpel inside and let
whoops I done did it again you know
[Laughter]
where man listen guys the code is 55
press 2018 men take advantage for the
ones that haven't tried it yeah I have a
signed up this thing is your chance man
okay what I'm
Joe my friend Dennis jr. says before I
leave out of here man uh Joe my friend
who works in tech said the future of web
dev in the front end not the back end
because all of the tech new technologies
what what hold on Joe my friend who
works in tech says the future what dev
is in the front end not the back end
because all because of all the new
technologies do you agree no I do not
agree um what's happening is in the
front end everybody could create a new
library everybody could come in and
create a new framework everybody could
come in and create a little CSS
framework anybody could do that so if
you think like that innovation is not
it's just people are finding little
things that's a little bit easier than
what the last person did a month ago
that's about it but that's not where the
future is that the future is where the
programming side of the website is okay
so you got machine learning you got um
you know the guys start are working with
big data the guys are working with the
databases you know like that's where the
real innovation is going to be at is
that's where the future is that you're
gonna say so that's just how it is man
do you think WordPress developers real
developers yes but you might get stuck
being just a wordpress developer you
have to also create other projects yeah
man sorry Jones sorry Jones yeah man I
gotta go man I've been here for an hour
inside man you know it starts getting
crazy after an hour man starts getting
crazy listen man okay camera angle yes
as after finishing all the courses and
time I where can I go to pursue more
advanced web development topics I will
say that's a good question if you want
to learn more advanced web development
topics
I think after you finish the timeline
you can find that answer yourself it
sounds like a third back thing to say
but it's actually true because
everything that you might think like
it's advanced in reality is usually
inside of the documentation of any
programming language or anything that
you could think of right um if you want
to become more someone who architects
the structure of a application like you
you could go in and say hey learning
design patterns like there's a lot of
good books there's really not that many
um good courses that you can say cuz
where the money is that is not really
into advanced courses where the money is
that is the beginner course that's where
people that's why there's so many
beginning of course is out there right
but to get advanced like really really
advanced stuff you gotta actually you
know you gotta go out there and do other
stuff man you know I mean you let the
computer guys there's a puppy boy man
look it's so crazy that after I put the
pressure on on a free game II like the
computer guy he actually started doing
content like wasn't that some BS man
like wasn't that some like
listen I cooked the flak of him getting
mad at me and I was just saying what the
people were saying right and I'm like yo
bro you just like you need to stop
crying and do your content like nobody
cares
about that last year you was making 300
grand and this year you're making
freakin 200 grand like I'm not gonna cry
for you nobody here that's in this this
community is gonna be like oh my god you
know that apocalypse went down and you
like the computer guy he lost a hundred
thousand dollars
nobody's gonna cry for that right like
that was the whole thing about it is
like that's how it is
our Louise do you still have the video
which video yeah man
even though the
I gotta chill with the family right so
I'm gonna see you guys later
I'm so happy that you know we got 70
people at a time here live with us and
even you know you know how to hate us
beat you know the haters be like man it
wasn't 70 people in there there was just
70 people in here Reyna apparently just
went down so 67 68 but there was a whole
bunch of people were here just a second
ago all right we have 76 people in here
so it just goes up and now you know what
I mean but at the same time we and here
we live man get the promo code guys
Kevin Lopez what's your question send it
to me so I can answer it what is it Joe
okay so this is question Joe how much
should I expect to get paid as a junior
developer I come from the background low
paying wages so I don't know how much to
expect it depends where you live if you
live let's say in New York City you
could start with like 45,000 to $70,000
depending where you're gonna go work
right you're done when I say your first
job I'm not talking about that's how
much you're gonna make your first year
cuz you could go for a job and make
$45,000
three months later quit that job and go
to a company that pays you eighty right
it happens all the time
right so I'm just saying your very first
job the very first job that somebody's
gonna trust you to hire you they're not
gonna give you or anything above $70,000
right unless you're coming from like a
recruiter if the recruiter sells you as
like oh this guy knows everything under
the Sun this guy's a genius if he sells
you as like top-of-the-line they sky's
the limit you can make $120,000 on your
very first job but is that the norm no
that's not the norm okay so if you're in
Boston you probably get you know a 50
sixty thousand dollars on your first job
alright so you should be good but yeah
so I'm outta here guys
alright see you guys later Superboy job
back at it again coding phase comm you
know what I mean so we out of here Wow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
