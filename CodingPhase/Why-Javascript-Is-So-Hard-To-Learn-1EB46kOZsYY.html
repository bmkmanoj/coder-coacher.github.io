job back at it again man coding face
comm make sure you subscribe make sure
you like this video alright so today we
are serving another question from caller
it basically says why is learning
JavaScript so hard I think for people
who who have all troubles with
JavaScript I think the biggest problem
that they are having is understanding
the basic concepts of just programming
in general right a lot of times people
who are starting to build websites right
so I'll answer in two ways basically
people are are actually starting their
their careers as web developers or just
people who just want to create a website
right they come in and they're like okay
cool understand HTML
cool understand CSS I know that I could
style the page make a little design make
a little change of colors whatever right
now when they come into JavaScript
there's like a wall because they don't
understand the basic concepts of
programming so if you've never taken a
computer science course if you've never
had anybody explain to you what a
variable is nobody explained to you what
a loop is nobody's going to you what a
switch statement is or if an else
statement is right and how does those
things work what is a method alright
which is pretty much a function right so
those little things if you don't
understand those concepts and you have
no knowledge and then you're like trying
to jump into JavaScript it can be very
difficult it can get difficult because
you're like man how do I actually get to
you know start working with JavaScript
right now that's my first point my
second point is you know the Dom right
there's people who come in and they
start messing around with JavaScript and
they think hey I know Java I know
or C sharp and it's like you're dealing
with just the programming language or
just the syntax or dealing with
object-oriented programming which is
fine
but when it comes to certain things like
the Dom you know and when I say the Dom
is you know people don't even know how
to get element by ID or a query select
the Lord little things like that that
you would think in your head is pretty
simple but for some people they they
don't understand that concept right
because all they know is just
programming meaning hey I know variables
I know loops I know if female Stevens
right so that's what they understand so
when they bring those knowledge those
skills from other languages they try to
implement it into JavaScript and then
they'll okay I understand one part of it
but I don't understand this other part
which is the Dom how is it that how can
i you know target things on the page and
by classes and by IDs and you know what
is a parent you know is like a parent
div of another day and little things
like that can get you confused if you
don't understand those concepts then
that's why javascript can become hard
but if you understand it done
if you understand that's what I always
tell people the best way to learn
JavaScript is to understand it from the
beginning
meaning understanding HTML then jump
into CSS and then jump into JavaScript
right because if you're going in
backwards and say hey I'm just a
developer here I'm just going to jump
from you know from JavaScript and then
I'm going to start learning HTML or CSS
sometimes it's not going to work
sometimes that's why you see so many
back-end developers what we call
back-end developers or software
engineers or whatever we want to call
them or programmers or code monkeys but
you want to call the right you know they
people have different terminologies for
this but people were just code or the
more you know scientific calculations
you know if you a guy coming from Python
and you're like man I'm trying to jump
into JavaScript sometimes it can be hard
because you didn't go through the phases
of a web developer of just going from
HTML understanding how the Dom works how
elements work how putting things inside
of a different HTML tag works and
different a jump into CSS how CSS
actually Styles the page and then from
there understanding the the you know the
Dom tree like all of this is done right
so understanding how things work inside
of it is crucial so that's why some
people have a lot of issues with
JavaScript and that's my personal
opinion that's just a little piece a lot
of people gave a lot of good
explanations here you can also check
them out but that's my opinion all right
guys you already know simple job back at
it again make sure you subscribe make
sure you like this video man your boy is
back I didn't did it again Wow ggg-go
many knows you put Joe back at it again
man listen make sure you subscribe and
make sure you like this video man by the
way if you want to know exactly what
questions I took to become a web
developer they right there in the
description it's no secret it's nothing
crazy is no secret gifts that I had is
just pretty much I took the courses
they're pretty cheap they're like $15
beats on specials and just this mess
change your life change your lifestyle
do something fun or something cool that
you could call a career</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
