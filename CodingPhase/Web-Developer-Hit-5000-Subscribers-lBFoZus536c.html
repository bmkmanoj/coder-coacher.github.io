happy you know a lot of crazy has
been happening for the past few months
you know I a lot of people did not
believe in me a lot of people you know
they wrote me off the they stood right
at me they like hey man this guy's not
going away this guy's not you don't got
a low your fan Frank all basically
subscribers you don't have you know
people that really mess with him and you
know we kind of prove them wrong like
straight up is like you know like I'm
super happy about that you know what
people don't know is when I started this
I was going through a lot you know
back in November back in the end of
November
start of December so pretty much it
became like almost like an obsession to
just like hey man every day I got a
record sign or if I have an idea in my
head I just want to share it with people
who are also like me people who are in
those cool people's people cool people's
that like to call it cool people that
like to just mess around with
programming you know like who would've
thought we will get here 5,000
subscribers you know this feels great
like I'm just being honest this feels
great I'm like super happy about it and
yeah man I'm just I'm just enjoying my
time out here man today was a great day
I came to my sister-in-law's graduation
and everything was really you know
really good you know like one thing that
people don't know is yes I got degrees
yes I got I went to college
but it wasn't for computer science it
wasn't for anything related to what I'm
doing now right and then on top of that
I didn't go to none of my graduations I
didn't go to my high school graduation I
can go to my associates graduation
college graduation I didn't go to none
of them the last graduation I've been to
was in fifth grade going to sixth grade
why because I've never had the school
spirit to just like show up in the
graduation I just like I just never was
worried but I don't know like I just
never was with it and just like you know
I just never won but seeing it for the
first time I'm seeing a graduation how
emotional it is and you know even for
myself today hitting 5,000 subscribers
that really just hit the spot because I
was there man but you know like a couple
of tears came down my eye I'm not gonna
lie but it was like tears of joy and
tears of happiness because I was like
happy for my sister-in-law she finally
graduated now she she's going to become
an adult and then at the same time today
I'm here 5,000 subscribers and it just
shows me how many people got love for me
how much I've grown over the years like
you guys don't understand I was just
like you guys
I was literally like I sucked at CSS I
did not understand CSS positioning I
didn't understand you know display:block
display:inline-block I was like what the
hell is this and you know it took me
some time in the beginning and then once
I got I was like okay cool I could you
know design a page I could make a page
look exactly like the design it was you
know an achievement like every year I do
a new achievement you know I was stuck
being just a front-end developer for
like three years
and it was really sucky like in the
sense I'm like I was in a box I was just
in a box in and just doing the same
thing all the time and then I learned
how to work with databases my sequel
MongoDB PHP I learned Ruby on Rails like
every single year I learned something
new which is why I think everybody here
shoot them every year you should be able
to learn something new every year you
should better yourself every year you
should have a new goal like my goal for
this year was to hit you know 20,000
subscribers at the end of the year it's
not gonna happen let's see we still
halfway there you know we still what me
we're like oh see that's
fifteen
is what I'm super comfortable in in the
camera now but in the beginning if you
look at my first video I was just like
man I don't know if I can do this number
one because I don't have the vocabulary
like a lot of people have like you know
they could talk up you know a lot of
 big words and talk for a
long time in front of a camera me I
don't I don't have that I just happen to
be able to know how to code like I know
how to code I'm not great at explaining
all you know what I'm doing when it
comes to code but what's good and what's
not you know cuz I've been doing this
for a long time but at the same time I
was like man I just gotta show my face
out here and be like hey if I can do it
for guy that can't even explain
 right you know if he could if he
could do it he got a good job he he is
really good at encoding why can't I do
it you know what I mean that's how I
looked at it you know and here we are
now we got 5,000 subscribers we're
definitely ahead of a lot of people we
were definitely doing good oh man my
bank accounts getting bigger every
single day which I know a lot of people
has always been telling me man you know
people coming in they're like man he's
always talking about money why because
nobody's gonna come here and give me an
award
whenever I learn a brand new programming
language and I bust my ass at night I
come from work and I come here and I
start learning a new course on udemy
nobody's gonna come here and give me an
A
like oh you won you basically you came
in and you learn a brand new programming
language no nobody's gonna come tell me
that right so if nobody can tell me that
how can I validate myself and be like
you know what man you're doing good
money like that's how I look at it I'm
like that's my Awards that's my gold
medals you know when I look at my bank
account like man I'm good I was broke a
few years ago and all this came
from
coding you know a lot of people are not
even looking at this like a career
because they think this is out their
reach and they're like oh man I can't do
this thing this with smart people this
for data whatever you know you know fill
the blank you know but for me I'm just
like yo I'm doing good I got a good wife
here I got everything that I need like
literally I don't even know what to buy
because you know how when you broke
you're like man I wish I could buy that
and it's like you you striving to buy
that like you know when I was like
yo I used to be like man I just want to
be able to buy all the ps3 on
PlayStation 2 games that I want and then
that's why I know I made it that's what
I know my my basically I I did something
good in my life you know that's how I
was thinking before and now it's not
about that now it's more about like
that's the occupy whatever I want all
right but at the same time would what's
going to be my motivation to keep doing
this thing like some kid actually today
that I mentioned in this cake called
Josh he's super cool I like to kick um
seems pretty smart well-spoken yeah the
kid was pretty legit and he comes to me
he goes like man what's your motivation
because he's seen me I'm recording a
vlog right for you guys about today
talking to yourself on a camera what's
your motivation to do this and I'm like
what's my motivation man I think you
know like straight up this money because
nobody's gonna give me an applause no
one's gonna come to me but I joke great
