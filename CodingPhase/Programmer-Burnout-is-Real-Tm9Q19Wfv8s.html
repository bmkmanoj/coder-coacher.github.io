again man coding face.com your boys
backing I didn't did it again all right
so listen man today's topic is what is
programmer burnout so this guy Richard
Kenneth created this post on hacker noon
you know for medium comm right and
basically he goes over his story of how
he got burned out and what it felt for
him to go through you know being birthed
out of like programming you know
sometimes we all go so hard right
because at first sister this is how
things go guys you guys haven't noticed
it right now you guys have this little
thing this little bug in your ear that's
like oh I'm gonna become a developer I
wanna do this you know this is what I
want to do forever and I just want to
get paid and be able to code an essay
right but with time and experience and
depending on what company you work at
right things are going to start you know
dragging you down and sorry to be
negative but this happens to almost
everybody right so that's why it is very
important to have vacations it's very
important to take time off not to call
it constantly I myself I feel like I'm
getting a little bit burnt down because
I work 9:00 to 5:00 I come home talk
about code which you guys definitely our
goal and teach courses on on my website
coding phrase calm about code so it's
like I'm doing cold 24/7 you know and
even on the weekends I go in 8 to 10
hours a day on the weekend I'm just
talking about code or creating courses
right so at the end of the day like I
almost feel like I'm burning out but
what I do is I give myself breaks I'll
take one day off and then do the same
thing the next day I come in record a
couple of videos then the next day take
a day off you know just to keep
self you know you know same nothing but
you know what I mean so anyways going
back to this topic you know what he was
talking about he was working in the 90s
so it happened to him in the 90s and
he's like yo you know he was
procrastinating you know taking long
coffee breaks going to lunch for a long
time came in late left work early you
know back in the days most programmers
were expected to work late he feared
that he was going to lose his job he
felt tired and depressed didn't want to
look at programming ever again you know
he finally decided to retire at early at
age of 46 which also to live he kind of
like I don't know it kind of makes me
happy to think that you can retire at 46
guys like I think that's fine if you
twenty-something and you work for 20
years as a programmer and you decide to
do something else and you want to retire
listen then go ahead man you know I mean
but at the end of the day back to the
top and like you know sometimes people
they get burnt out you know like it just
happens you know cuz coding is it's like
lifting weights every day what you bring
people think that this is easy this is a
easy job where you're going to be like
super happy or autonomous that's not the
reality of things a lot of times like
the more experience that you have the
more difficult the job is going to be so
it's like the same time so do you guys
feel de like oh I don't want to get the
title a senior developer or lead
developer because it comes with more
responsibilities than I want to give
right
and because I don't want to burn myself
out almost everybody that I know that
it's been doing this for like ten years
and the more responsibilities that they
get the less that they want to code
because we love to code we just don't
like the work environment right
sometimes you create something and
somebody else don't like it or somebody
in your team messes up the code not you
got to clean up their bugs and like it's
a lot of man that goes into this
job and people just don't the like so
minute that you know like you're going
to burn out or some point if you go
super hard like for like 10 15 20 years
you're gonna burn out but for me there's
light at the end of the tunnel
right cuz look I'm sorry but this guy at
46 he he retired 46 man that's not a bad
story guys cuz look at those guys that
work for the city you know those
guys that work for the city I don't know
garbageman or or whatever right those
guys are working constructions or
whatever think about any hard
job that's out there
what type of job besides cops and
besides firemen do you know that guys
get to retire 46 there's not that many
jobs that you know you can say hey I'm
going to retire 46 man most people got
to continue working til they almost dead
at 60 something 70 years old you know so
I mean you know I want to say cry me a
river to this guy like hey you got
something to retire for these things man
you can't complain good this for a while
you did good you know you was smart but
there's definitely you know like I
always say to you guys there's
definitely a lot of stress you know in
this field this is not something that
you come in and you're like oh is
gonna be good every day not every day is
a new problem every day is something
else that you gotta solve there's never
a good day when I'd let's say sometimes
you're stuck working on a programming
language that you hate you know some
people might hate PHP or some people
might hate working with a framework I
don't know what I'm a framework you
filled the blanket right so you might be
stuck in has to work on that framework
for 9:00 to 5:00 and you're like man I
 hate doing this so that's
what burns you out man so yeah it's a
pretty good article and yeah I just want
to show it to you and talk to you guys
about it because this should happen
everybody man that's what I tell you
guys
like you gotta have also a plan B like
programming is a way to basically get
money in to become successful and but
the same time you gotta think about it
you can only do this for so long you
know you do ten fifteen twenty years in
this industry and then that's it like
your brain is done your brain is tired
and you want to do something else with
your life sometimes you become bored by
the technology at the moment like you
see it's cool what he said here he said
that now he uses Python and ain't gonna
sometimes something new comes up and you
know oh you got excited and you're like
you want to get back into it but you
know you gotta have that plan B see what
the hell you're gonna do and you're just
gonna have my ski write something to
escape you gotta say hey I want to join
MMA or I wanna do jujitsu on the
weekends I wanna go fishing I
want to play golf I wanna I don't know
you guys think about your plan B your
exit plan after coding and yeah man I'll
