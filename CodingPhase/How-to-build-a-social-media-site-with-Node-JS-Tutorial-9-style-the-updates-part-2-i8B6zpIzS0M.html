this so we basically gonna give to some
padding here and size so it's like a 20
pixel padding all around so let's do
that okay let me see
so we got the great container we got 0
left to right now that's actually at
that let's say 20 pixels okay alright
and I was looking nice and smooth
okay so let me see oh let me look at the
what we have so far we got the composed
component you got the buttons right here
you know what let's get the icons for
this so let's go to font awesome icons
okay let
load all right now
repost it's like a reply but
we wanted the opposite way
see how long
you
see forward for now let's just take this
copy this okay put this here okay
now let's go back say like
all right paste that there save that and
there you go so we should have two
buttons now okay so let's continue with
this so we got the section here all
right
and what we're going to do is we're
gonna go one byte one
so let me close this up let's open up
update info okay so we got great
container we got inside of it update
info we have a h3 you have any P tag so
let's do this so we go say color let's
put in H text now for this is gonna be P
text okay we're going to say text
transform uppercase font weight let's
say 600 or 500
let's see which one 600 fine okay let's
see let's put in line height of 1.5 okay
fonts
is let's say so
you
now hold on let me see h3 okay we got up
there for h3
yeah so I'm sorry okay it's a little bit
too big
let's do 1.6 still a little bit too big
1.3
you
okay that's not bad
alright now let's say margin-bottom
let's see one rim okay that's fine the
next thing that we want to do is
is fun smaller on the paragraph so I'm
gonna come here
say just copy this from here make our
lives easier instead of typing it so
line-height 1.5 fun size let's say point
a trim okay
that seems pretty good
you
all right I think we need a bigger line
height so say 1.8
let's try to
all right so two is fine so it's perfect
then we're gonna come here and say
margin-bottom
one ram alright now the next
we want to do is the next section which
is close this up these stats so the
update stats is just icon we got a
circle with a like button there and then
it says Sara 23 others and etc right so
here we're gonna say okay we got icon
let's put in icon section okay we're
gonna say icon section and then inside
of here we're gonna come here and take
the icon that we already put the thumbs
up let me copy it from here better okay
icon section let's say like circle
alright so let's do this so right below
update I was an update info right below
up the info we're going to put in what
was it
update stats so update stats then we
have icon then we have what was the icon
section icon section and then we have
like circle like circle okay we're gonna
say height say 20 pixels with 20 pixels
for now let's just say background blue
okay
yeah I think that's fine that's that's
how big it is we're gonna say font size
point for RAM
it's a little bit too small I'll see you
fontsize 0.6 room okay so on the of
these stats we're gonna say display flex
okay so we have everything in order its
display flex for this one we're gonna
say display flex and then we say justify
content center a line items center
okay no just for this one
we actually got to take this and put it
in here okay they also now is centered
now I'm gonna say color white okay gonna
say border-radius
50% now we have that perfect circle okay
now we want to use the same gradients
that we did on this one I mean we could
just get it from here for the send
button just copy it
so we could do it like this was same
background linear gradient remove this
one you don't need it no more safe and
there you go okay cool
now she could see that icon itself is
not is centered but not really so what
we can do
is move it up a little bit we can move
it up a little bit and to move it up a
little bit we're gonna use
position:relative okay so on the like
circle we got that and then we have the
f8 thumbs up okay so we're gonna say
that f8 thumbs up let's say position
relative to that same position right
we're gonna say top three pixels let's
do the opposite way negative three
pixels it's a little bit too much to say
two pixels too much let's say one pixel
there you go now that's what you call
centered so you got the icon completely
centered all right
and yeah that's perfect okay and now the
next thing that we're going to do is
basically I don't know if I should add
if I should add the little heart and the
emoji I don't know if I should I mean
we're not gonna really add that feature
of having you know little hearts so I
don't know let me see okay so we got
Sarah now we're just gonna make this
like that okay let me just get the
colors from here not waste time not
waste your time either
ok so let me close this up
okay let me see what's the other HD
that we have here so we got icon section
that's done we have other users so after
the icon section okay we're gonna come
here and we're gonna say other users
okay so we got other users I say color
let me see do I have that that color no
I don't I'm gonna put this here so I'm
gonna see a very light text okay so see
very light text
all right now
you
let me see okay we're gonna do font size
say point five Ram it's a little bit too
small
say 0.7 okay so point seven Rams okay
we're gonna basically say okay so we
have everything update stats display
flex
okay so we got display flex on this
other users we're gonna do the same
thing we're gonna say display flex let's
say justified content center a line
items Center okay so now we got a
centered all right now for these
comments
like that all right let me put in a
padding around this up these stats so
we're gonna say padding say 10 pixels
top and bottom and 0 left and right
all right
also we have those borders here okay so
let's do that now so let me see
I was it I say border top one pixel
solid the same see you know search input
by very light border okay so EB EB so
I'll say border ok copy this put border
bottom one pixel solid okay cool now I
think this is a little bit thicker than
that then one pixel so let's put in
three pixels it's a little bit too much
so gotta be two pixels there you go okay
now padding should be bigger so let's
try 15 all right the next thing that we
want to do is give this a margin bottom
one rim
you
actually we have a bigger marching at
the bottom so the same let's say 30
pixels
okay now the next thing that we want to
do is basically move this all the way to
the right
okay so now to do this we got to come
here
find out what's the name of this class
or we got comments stats so we're gonna
come here we're gonna say a messy data
icon section icon section other users
and then right below it comments stats
okay we're gonna take this put it right
here okay let me see make sure that's
the same size yeah so we're doing that
now we're going to give this a whiff of
with 100% okay with 100% then we're
going to give this a whiff of 100% okay
so what does doing is is basically
saying this thing's whiff is let's say
20 pixels so then now both of these
elements are basically splitting up 50
and 50 of whatever's left okay now what
we want to do is come here we're gonna
say something like this we're gonna say
wave is 80% or let's say 70 and then the
comments section is 30% of the whiff
okay
I'm gonna say this play flex we're gonna
say justify content flex end oops
flex end okay save that and that moves
it all the way to the right now we're
gonna say okay we gotta flex and now
we're gonna say align items
centered so that's gonna Center it
vertically and then move it all the way
to the right now this one we want to do
the opposite we want to basically say
copy this paste it here but this we're
gonna say flex start okay and there you
go
all right let's put this a little having
like a little padding there so we're
gonna say padding-left let's say 10
pixels and there you go all right now
that looks legit now as far as the font
size I don't know if the font size is
too small maybe I want to bring it up a
little bit so font size I say 0.8 grams
and for this one is 2.8 rims
perfect okay cool now the next thing
that we want to do is work on there's a
section here this text area so let's do
this let's see how are we gonna do this
okay
so let's look at the element so we got
this the comments there's the common
stats we're done with this whole update
stats we're doing compose comments
okay so let's leave out of here let's
make sure we're outside update stats and
here we're gonna say compose comment
okay so we're inside of the post comment
and now we're gonna say display flex
okay so it's displayed flex all right so
you have this play flex now we want to
remove text area see where is it text
area let's say border border none' save
it like that
oops textarea like that okay
so we have no borders okay now next
thing that we want to do when I say
height what could be the height for this
say 40 pixels so 40 pixels high
whiff we're gonna say 100% save that
all right we're gonna say border-radius
say 20 20 pixels okay so as you can see
it makes it into like a perfect circle
right there all right
next thing that we're going to do is
create the buttons here so let's look at
the HTML how to set up so we got button
stain repose button then like button so
text area buttons there you got a repose
button then we got like button okay so
we're gonna say like this and we get the
Box shadows that we had on these ones
all right so
you
copy this I'm gonna say box-shadow
put that in that in we're gonna say
height 40 pixels with 40 pixels
let me say background background same
background white
okay this we're gonna say display flex
you
on the repulse button I'm gonna say
color color should be
I blew so Darkseid
blue okay we're gonna say display flex a
line items Center justified content
center that's to make sure the buttons
is right in the middle okay let's see
border-radius oops
border-radius 50%
okay
your pottery
50% I see what else
give it like a patting space around them
okay so let me see see justify content
space between
you
comment
I say more
left margin' left let's say 20 pixels
okay so we're gonna copy this from here
to this one save that
all right now I'm gonna flip this to be
having the same thing as this so I'm
going to copy this just linear
background okay so we're gonna say
background on the like button is going
to be linear gradient that we put on the
other ones
and then the color is going to be white
so where's color ok color white
okay so because of how this icon is
we're gonna have to do the same thing
that we did before where we had to move
this so what was it f a thumbs up copy
this we're gonna have to see the side of
this like button there's a f8 thumbs up
let's say position:relative and let's
say top negative two pixels see and then
now it's perfectly centered okay now to
make this even more interesting we can
take one of this icons okay so
let me see with this like that but
refresh the page we're gonna remove that
from the text area in the second but we
can actually if we want to do this right
you see how it is like a little thing at
the bottom we can literally go and find
the icon so from which font awesome font
awesome okay
let me see where's the chat chat okay so
this one comment
so we could get that nice a little
swivel thing at the bottom we're gonna
come here we're gonna do this we're
gonna say text area we're gonna add this
to it we're gonna say like this FA yes
comment we adding that there okay now
what I'm gonna do up here come back to
the text area I'm going to say
position:relative and I'm gonna say
z-index of tool now for this FA comment
I'm gonna come here and I'm gonna do
this I'm gonna see if it comment z-index
1 position:absolute and I'm gonna put in
position a relative
for position:relative on the compose
component but the whole area there so as
you can see now this is actually going
behind it now what I'm going to do is
I'm gonna say position no on this one
I'm gonna say top or let's say bottom
zero so there you go so we got that
right now let's put in font size let's
see three rims
okay that's a little bit too big so
let's say to Ram
okay and then now we're going to see
color white
now I don't know if you guys could see
this there you go
see now we got that little swivel at the
bottom
now one thing
want to get the box-shadow that we have
here so copy this from his buttons we're
gonna come back to the text area at that
let me see we're going to add that to
the FA comments hmm one thing is looking
good if it didn't have the shadow they
will be fine but since it has the shadow
it's throwing it off hmm so let me see
think I'm just gonna delete this we not
gonna add that okay so we're just not
gonna add that that little piece okay
this is fine how it is right now make
sure we add the box shadow
Otsu to this
to the like button okay so I is already
there so it's fine
now as far as the box-shadow I think we
could do better than that
let me see because as you guys could see
like the Box shadow is like going down
it's not really at zero so I see was the
box shadow
you
and that's fine for now but let me just
see something I want to try something up
so which one's the vertical the vertical
is the second one so okay so what we're
gonna do is
we're going to say ten pixels on this
okay it's a little bit too much the same
three pixels
I'll say five pixels
now I'm gonna take this copy it put it
on you know what I'm gonna create a box
shadow so box shadow variable so I'm
gonna come here see box shadow buttons
paste that and then come here
I see box shadow buttons copy it from
there go and paste it here fine paste
down this one on the text area we got a
delay on this one's too because we want
them to all be consistent so let me see
you search for buttons
okay box-shadow
remove this from here just add it right
here box shadow buttons
all right so
now as we change it as we change it on
on the variables we can actually see
that the difference for all of them okay
let me move the set aside
okay
of this here so we could actually see
and I say two pixels
they got to pixels is perfect
I see this this will have a back shadow
yeah no it doesn't I don't think so so
we got to add that let's see where is
they sent button to send find out
I mean technically it does it says it
does let me see how long things that you
can't really tell that well yeah it does
have it it's just like the prong is
because because of the color blue it
doesn't show it that well I think that's
fine yeah
you
you
anyways let me see something because
also if you like this color it's not
light enough so let me copy this from
here
see RGB
is 49 173 255 49 173 255
I see where is it was it that we had 49
173 okay so 49 73 that's fine just looks
a little bit lighter but I said that's
good
yeah that's fine all right so we are
pretty much done with this whole section
I know it took a long time well if you
want something to look really good you
just got to take your time with it okay
guys so I'm gonna see you guys in the
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
