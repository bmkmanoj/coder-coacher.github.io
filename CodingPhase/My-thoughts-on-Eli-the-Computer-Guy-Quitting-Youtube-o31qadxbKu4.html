face.com your boy is back and I didn't
did it again alright guys so I apologize
for the light you know first of all but
you could hear my audio clear right
alright so anyways let's get into this
last night somebody brought this up
about he lied the computer guy quitting
his channel and you know at the same
time it's sad and not sad at the same
time basically there's some things that
I want you guys to check out his website
failed normal calm free promo for Eli
the computer guy um basically so he's
he's saying that he's leaving YouTube
but I don't think he's leaving you to
what he's doing is he's putting Consing
first on his website and then doing it
later on like releasing it later on on
YouTube which is something that is
exactly what I'm doing
you know I'm creating better content on
my own website and they're releasing it
later on on YouTube you know like once a
week whatever comes I have on my website
I might release it like once a week or
something like that
certain tutorials I'm keeping it
directly straight on my website it's
never leaving out of there only for the
people that are registered a website
right now what I wanted to do is talk
about some things that he said about the
algorithm and the way how YouTube is has
been working lately you know the whole
algorithm is about what titles you have
and like let's say an example somebody
comes in and they watch a video for you
know Jake Paul and then I talk about
Jake pull on my video and it's on the
title then now because you watch Jake
Paul's video now you're gonna come to my
channel and you're gonna get to see my
video you know as a recommended video
next right now when you come in and you
create content that's completely
different than what everybody else is
doing and
like the herd of people you know it's
like when I come in and I don't do a top
five video top 10 video same programming
languages when I don't do that
I don't get no new subscribers and I
told you guys from a little while ago
you know that's one of the reasons why I
was frustrated with YouTube but at the
same time I'm not gonna quit YouTube
because of it because YouTube is a
platform that if you - wasn't there a
lot of people wouldn't find my my
website or my channel or anything
without the YouTube right without
YouTube basically sending people to me
without other people who create content
sending that traffic to me right nobody
will find me it's the same thing as
elide the computer guy if he like the
computer guy had a website by himself
and he was trying to promote his videos
nobody's going to find him period
I don't unless he's still on YouTube and
saying hey guys go check me out over
there when I'm really releasing the
videos every single day every videos
that you see here you two are
pre-recorded and are actually old if you
tell people that then they're gonna
follow right but let's be honest I don't
know if you guys have noticed but II
like the computer guys channel has been
very still for a long time
like I remember looking at his channel
when I was in IT right when I used to
work as an IT literally I mean that was
a long time ago that was like 2012 2011
I remember looking at his channel since
then his channel has been going down he
hasn't evolved he hasn't done anything
like that's different you know he's
still doing videos you know not to knock
him you know he's still doing videos on
his base man he's he's doing videos in
his you know his canoe whatever whatever
you wanna call it like he's doing videos
that in reality are boring he's not
coming out with something new he he I
don't feel like he's investing on his
channel and let's be honest
all the people that got paid the best
out of every other person that is in Ida
Tech or web development or anything
anything that has to do with technology
one of the people that got paid the best
was Enid the computer guy because he was
one of the first so no matter what he
liked the the computer guy was getting a
whole bunch of views constantly a bunch
of subscribers constantly and it's the
same thing as a lot of other youtubers
here who are touching a hundred thousand
about to touch a hundred thousand or
above a hundred thousand their channels
in reality are going down because now
smaller channels are getting more views
smaller channels are are popping up and
showing that they have better content
than them you know it's no longer they
can no longer rely on the fact that they
were here first
and like this is a big problem that all
these other older developers you know
tech guys whatever you want to call it
anybody in the tech industry that's
doing YouTube there's the problem that
they have none of these guys like to
collaborate that's number one then none
of them none of them none of them like
to collaborate even probably I don't
know ninety five percent of everybody on
YouTube that does Tech does not like to
collaborate because in their head is
like you know somebody's gonna steal
their views somebody's gonna steal their
thing it's like hey dummy the way how
YouTube works is if I put you in my
video people follow you and then from
there now we're in the algorithm now we
now we both get to be put on each
other's
basically are recommending you know
videos and you know what I mean so
none of these guys like to collaborate
right of course you know some I
understand sometimes there's people who
are here who are who are snakes on
YouTube yes there are people who are
snakes on YouTube and I'd like to come
in and steal your idea steal what you're
doing and pretty much mess up your your
whole business alright cuz you got now
you got to think about this YouTube as a
business you can't come in here like
kumbaya and try to be friends with
everybody and you guys have seen
right um but at the same time man do I
feel sorry for you like the computer guy
nah I don't you know who I will feel
sorry for if like something like this
will happen to somebody like deaf tips
somebody like learn Codecademy somebody
like LevelUp cuts those guys are really
legit they come up with brand new topics
brand new tutorials or brand new things
constantly all right they always coming
up with new topics they reinventing them
themselves they they invest into their
channel they create new you know new
intros they create new animations they
create you know they invest into their
own cameras like they do a lot he like
the computer guy got a lot of money over
this last eight years what happened
right I wouldn't be surprised he got
himself into uh into that I wouldn't be
surprised
meaning like in his head he was probably
thinking oh my channel is gonna keep on
growing and I'm gonna continue making
more money and more money and more money
so he I'm almost 100% sure he got
himself in debt with a lot of things
probably thinking in his head that his
channel was gonna keep on making money
like that he never thought about
creating his own website and like
somehow you know even affiliate
marketing like he could have been
selling like let's say laptops or
whatever cameras whatever anything that
he uses he could put that on his his
description and say hey guys if you want
to have the same equipment as me oh you
wanna have the same laptop as me he has
a link to it that's all he had to do it
like YouTube is not supposed to be a
place where you come in and you think
like hey I'm gonna make 30 grand a month
every single year you know like no you
know this this thing was gonna go down
at some point cuz the algorithm is
Google they'd switch the algorithm all
the time they always trying to figure
out what's the best way you know people
like elide the computer guy they relied
on the fact that they were one of
first people doing this and Tom's it's
hard now times is hard times is hard for
me
I can't even curse every time that I
cursed my video automatically earns
nothing which is fine I'm not here
looking to become a millionaire off of
YouTube your business model is wrong you
don't know what you were doing
he lied the computer guy let's be honest
you didn't know what she was doing you
telling me with all the views that you
got all the subscribers that you got
you're telling me
out of all of the subscribers which is
something that I tell people 80 to let's
say 80 to 95% of all these youtubers
that do tech no none of their
subscribers that they have are low you
why because they create general topics
they have no personality people are not
interested in them they look for them
for answer it's like you know it's like
you go to Wikipedia you don't care who's
the guy that's writing the thing on
Wikipedia you just go there to get your
information in your garden and you never
come back to it you might come back a
month later so it's like you you you use
the subscribe button that's like a
bookmark you know you basically bookmark
there and they're your channel you know
ok this guy has tutorials I'll come back
one day you never come back to it you
know what I mean like they this guys
they got 800,000 subscribers a million
down million subscribers they got a
hundred thousand subscribers I got 77
thousand subscribers when they drop a
video they get like 1% of the people
what to watch them
that means nobody there is to know you
right when I drop a video I could pretty
much say at least 20 to 30% other people
come in and watch the video on the first
day and then from there it keeps growing
as people come back to YouTube they go
back to the channel and they see my
videos there and they usually what they
people do and a lot of you guys can
speak on it yeah watch one video and
then y'all keep watching other ones by
me alright most of these people did not
do it when they
he liked the computer guys videos
nobody's doing that nobody's watching
his videos back back to back number one
because he he tried to do a scheme
there's just a big scheme that people
don't understand how YouTube is let's
say right now you know when I do my live
videos those are my most profitable
videos but of course because I curse so
much I don't get nothing out of it right
and that's fine because my channel
supposed to be real I'm not supposed to
be censored by YouTube I don't care
about those you know ten twenty dollars
that I could earn but II like the
computer guy his CPM is so high he used
to get so many good commercials on his
channel that every time that he will
drop a video and his videos are usually
half an hour to an hour or even longer
than that sometimes every single day he
probably made like 300 400 dollars or
even more a day so what are we supposed
to do you know and that's like on one
video we're not talking about like 2030
videos you're talking about one video
like why are we supposed to do like cry
for he like the computer guy because his
scheme is over and no like bro just
reinvent your channel you have all the
subscribers pretty much if you create
good content people are gonna come back
to you have to show who you are nobody
cares about just technology like people
are not gonna come back to that they're
gonna use you as Wikipedia you're gonna
be the wikipedia guy whenever they want
to search something technical they find
your channel okay I watch this guy but
they're not they're going to your
channel every single day a lot of these
guys they think this is YouTube is like
something to be like super technical and
this isn't that and like even like what
was this guy's name a nothing nothing
bad about him but fun fun function his
channel like he needs to do something
else besides just technical videos
because the problem with that is that
we'll let you grow you gotta create he
has like a lot of ideas he I think he
studied theater or something like that
or a film so he has an ax knowledge in a
background on how to make really good
videos and entertaining videos he should
focus on that make your technical videos
and also make videos that people are
gonna come back to it which is something
where to be honest out of all of the
tech developers or whatever you want to
call tech guys i teed developers or
freaking programmers I could say I'm the
pioneer I'm like literally the pioneer
of this of coming in here talk about
technical things but at the same time
not be like so technical that people are
gonna be like oh I watch this whenever I
need it know people will come here and
they watch all my videos my view rate is
amazing like people freaking the the
last you know the way how people leave
the videos is usually at eighty ninety
percent of the whole video that's
amazing a lot of these guys they get
only like a 10 percent view rate 20
percent review rain people watch all my
videos like almost city yen like
literally for a reason because they're
not bored they're not you know I keep
this thing you know saucy I give you the
sauce I give you something good
something that you could be you know
entertained and not at the same time
learn something and not be bored just
because this thing we work in the tech
industry doesn't need to be completely
technical this is YouTube this is not a
school this is not going to a university
this is not for that have you guys
noticed that um when they do those
conferences they barely got like a
thousand views you know like you know
when when they do videos of like
conferences right like I say are react
conf or or like let's say one of those
videos probably react conf get more
views but like let's
confreaks or you know JavaScript
conference in in your rep but whatever
you want to call it right it's a million
conferences every single day why do you
think that there's never any views on
that not because people are not
interested in those topics it's because
those topics are just plain technical I
mean there's no there's no story to it
there's no information I mean this
information but this is is made in a way
where people like showing you a
slideshow they're showing you you know
this is what reactive this is what you
know how component and this doesn't that
that's a technical thing this is YouTube
this is not me to become you know to
have videos are extremely technical you
know it's like you have your website for
that you have your documentation for
that you know what I mean like this is
YouTube people lose interest on that
right so I mean for this whole topic
like going back to Eli do I feel sorry
about Eli the computer guy leaving
YouTube no nobody was watching his
channel for a long time he knows him he
was living off the fact that he was here
before everybody cry me a river' bro
like it's time for you to just call it a
day
and reinvent yourself like if you can't
handle it I'll buy your your channel
I'll buy your channel I'll throw a
couple of you know a couple of thousand
dollars on you you know what I mean I'll
buy your channel by all the subscribers
that you have and show you how to make a
you know how to make that work because
the audience is there people have
basically signed up to say hey I want to
have this type of content but you just
you can't keep their attention you can't
keep them coming back your your topics
are not good that's the reality of
things right and it's not that I don't
like you like the computer guy it's just
that broan like how long do you think
that he was gonna be able to be riding
the wave like just because he was here
for
time it was time for you to invest into
your channel you're telling me that you
with all the money that you made you
telling me that you couldn't go and rent
out a studio and be like hey let me take
it to the next level
look what's this guy's line is the
cannot line is the computer guy but
Linus and those guys what they've done
look at line his first video it was like
in like a closet how come they invest so
much money into their thing it's like
was this guy's name M key mkbhd or some
 like that Marcus whatever the
little black kid he's nice he invests
into his channel he invests so much that
he got his own studio to record he like
he got a legit stuff you're telling me
that you could have gone on that route
and creative reviews cuz that's what
your channel is about - you had
technical stuff you had tutorials you
had our reviews are on certain
technologies reviews on on certain arm
hardware you're telling me that you
couldn't do that bro
you I'll be honest he was just lazy with
it that's what happened when you lazy
with it and you just like okay that's
not good from right now right now I only
have 8,000 subscribers all right but for
some reason my subscribers right I'm
more loyal than yours that you have
almost a million subscribers or you got
more than a million subscribers
alright why is that they only have 8,000
on your video you said that you only got
you created your website only 150 people
signed up for your website what is it
that you're giving them for them to sign
up
only 150 people signed up I created my
website and I have 8,000 people out of
those 8,000 people
900 over 900 people signed up to my
website can somebody somebody answer
that for me like why is that you know
what
like urine you haven't been given them
good quality videos you've been
basically riding the wave of YouTube
giving you a whole bunch of views and a
bunch of subscribers over the years
you didn't invest into your channel and
this is what happens that's simple
I wish you nothing but the best but
there's gotta be a lesson for everybody
here on YouTube right and I call myself
the pioneer of this coming into YouTube
as a tech let you know in the tech
industry I'm really a developer but in
the tech industry coming in with a
different personality come in and be
myself not being a robot just in front
of a camera like okay I'm just gonna
talk about technical stuff on this
strength technical channel no you gotta
be a real person
YouTube is about coming in here and
people filling you people liking it your
topics if your channel is just gonna be
about technical opinions and and that's
it your channels not gonna do good
because nobody I can't imagine myself
sitting down and be like hey I want to
read a documentation every single day
and that's what you guys are basically
releasing right yeah releasing
documentation is button videos just
talked about top you know technical
topics every single day not even the
nerdiest of nerdiest of nerdiest nerd in
the world is going to sit down for that
every single day like they already work
in the industry or they're already in
school like why would they want to sit
down constantly and just listen to
somebody give them a documentation you
know what I mean of a topic or hardware
or whatever it is if I want
documentation I'll look at the
documentation you know what I mean break
things down for people to be easier and
be entertaining this is what YouTube is
about and I already said it from the
beginning
I'm Doug pioneer of this because nobody
else has done this everybody else is
either robot before me everybody was a
robot nobody was coming in here
and dropping who they were that was just
like this is what an IT developer it is
what an IT does this is what function is
all monotone looking like a robot bro
loosen up you know do a little Harlem
shake do a little Uzi real quick like
loosen up man yeah yeah I got a stick up
there man
let that go you know lube it up and
take it out cuz it's time you know what
I mean like it's time for the new Bloods
to come in so you're in coming our way
with cool content you're creating you
know pretty cool stuff and this is to
all the old-timers all the guys that are
been here for over two three years your
time is up let's be honest it time is up
you guys are not investing into your
channels you are doing the same things
like you know I mean like even like look
at Chris Shawn look what I did look what
you know a couple of people who have
done here like we're investing in two
cameras we invest into microphones we're
investing into making the channels
better like this is what we do what have
you guys been doing and you guys been
getting a lot of money and you guys
don't even give nothing back to nobody
which is something that I still don't
understand most of the people that go
and watch your videos are like from
India and like you know Philippines or
South America and you're telling me you
don't have one give you know won't give
away or give something back you can't
just be pocketing you know 30 40 50
thousand dollars a month in your pocket
to make videos on YouTube and you expect
people to cry a rebel for you nah bro
nobody's going to do that you know what
I mean I came into this game giving
stuff to people with less than 300
subscribers paying $300 when I wasn't
even making $300 on YouTube you know I
mean so it's like and I'm still
currently even after eight months what I
make on YouTube is $800
from the views now everything else
that's aside of you - yeah I make a
little something more than yeah but I'm
not here depending on YouTube which is
where all of you guys messed up yeah I
think it's like oh yeah I'm like the
number one guy that is on YouTube and
YouTube is gonna continue sending me
traffic nah bro reinvent yourself take
some time say it take some time off
invest into your your business if you
want to take this as a business invest
into it come on bro how long how many
videos are gonna be doing on your
basement you're telling me you can't
afford to rent a studio you live in a
cheap state you know what I mean like
you live in a steep state I live in New
York City like I can't run a studio yet
and I only got eight thousand
subscribers right now right but you tell
me with a million subscribers
and you can't rent a studio or a decent
loft where you can make it into a studio
you telling me you can't invest twenty
thirty thousand dollars out of those
money that you're making every single
month if your channel falls off that's
your fault all right I'm out of here
simple joke coat coating face.com man
