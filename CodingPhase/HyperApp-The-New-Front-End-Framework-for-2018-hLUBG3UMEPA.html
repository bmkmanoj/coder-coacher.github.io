back at it again man coating face calm
guys let's talk about hyper app I'm
super excited about this framework
it's one kilobyte the JavaScript
language just for building front-end
applications come on man
listen there's a reason why I haven't
been jumping into beauty is bandwagon
because I know there's gonna be
something better out there I rather look
at something that's original something
that's brand new and it's like God came
in you know he just said hey here you go
Joe here's the latest thing there's the
thing that's popping up everywhere every
blogging every single page out there
let's give you this new topic hyper app
guys I'm sorry if I start like this back
but um yeah there's a new framework it's
pretty dope pretty much right now
it has 5,000 stars on github is getting
you know it's getting very popular
nowadays like an hour you know front end
blogs and JavaScript blog site point
there's a whole bunch you know what
sites all are talking about this right
now ready like it it's all over guys
right now what's cool about this is like
I said it's one killer pocket one
kilobyte and that's it that's your
framework I forgot how many kilo
kilobytes it's JavaScript like for react
let's see I was curious yeah you and
your Kb
I just want to you know be clear you
know be clear with things so I want to
look it up before you know I talked
about it so pretty much this other
numbers right so you have you jes 58
reacts 133 k pre acts 16 K which is
really good you know they're all doing
good you know they all do pretty good
but when it comes to hyper app like
literally one kilobyte guys like this
whole library is so framework it's like
super fast I'll show you what's right
I'm just gonna refresh this page you're
going to see this load up on the screen
almost instantly right now it looks a
little bit slow but it wasn't because of
the app itself
it was coping has to load up do
everything I got to do render then shows
up but if it was to do this with our
react page it'll take a little longer
than that guys trust
um but yeah man like this is pretty cool
I don't know what you guys I'm excited
I'm excited to see something new so this
is based on L I don't know if you guys
have her al elm Lang it's another
language that you know compiles or
transpires to JavaScript and but it's a
whole different language it's like
completely different than what you
expect right so it's like importing HTML
so is what it does is HTML Javascript
and CSS all together in just one
language and then it compiles it and
gives you this now is it great I don't
know I've messed around with it but to
me it seems too difficult in the sense
of like to just put a little thing like
a button you got to create like all of
this line like what I don't know to me
just seems too much work for no
reason but I like the idea of a
no functional programming everything
that has I like the idea I'm not a big
fan yet I haven't really played around
with it for a long time but going back
to hyper app I think it is great guys I
think is really great because you know
people are going to jump on this man
people love saying hey I'm on the
fastest framework I'm on the fastest
library and the fact that you could do
JSX to on it I think is great guys like
I will say check it out
take a little time play around with it
is super easy you can read the docs it
tells you everything what you got to do
is very similar to view in well as I
review will say backbone right backbone
is the first one boy this um it's
very similar to backbone so in this
sense in the way how is is set up but
it's pretty cool I feel like in a few
lines you could get something very
productive you only got a I'm planning
on doing a couple of components this is
just my first look at it and my first
you know first little quick review for
you guys just to get you guys excited

things that like once it hit the ground
