create a long CSS so we're gonna copy
this and pretty much come here and
basically call this main mean that's CSS
now we're gonna click here right-click
it new file and then you wanna say name
that CSS right so we're gonna say color
adobe.com
demyx
next explore some cool colors and see if
we find anything that inspires us for
the website
I like this
so mo safety
save
got those cutters so now let's take this
thing let's put this as the background
so body background let's go a header and
then inside the header I say an
obviously good blank let's do no wrong
display:inline-block
see now everything comes and wraps
around right so let's do this
hello right what this is gonna do is
gonna bring it all the way to the right
so now let's give that some space let's
see an apparent padding let's say 20
pixels 15 pixels what this is saying is
20 pixels to the top 20 pixels to the
bottom if it's in pixels to the left and
50 pixels to the right so now I'm the
head of this what we get it you see now
we got a space if you look here you
right-click and you inspect that you see
that the header has a padding on the
left over here
and the right and on the bottom it has
20 and 20 so now it's like it's centered
you see right now let's go and say okay
this is fine let's make this let's make
this thing with
60 pixels height 60 pixels and then
background background color
let's see no colors we had let's make
the background of this this we just
making a square you see so technically
that stuff the logo okay let's say
padding it's like 20 pieces
just leave it like that for now
now the top now we're gonna do a padding
15 pixels about 10 pixels and matter of
fact let's do padding:0 pixels and then
left to right 1 to 15 pixels wait this
one's going here top nav let's do it
right time
let's put it in here there you go now
we're cleaning it up
let's take that underline text
decoration on the vine nine
you see you know we took the decorations
from there okay no let's say over which
is that the color I want this to go all
the colors that I have
I miss the ball like this you see how
nice it looks
all right now let's see family
nice door of attica this door sound
Sarah from there and so we figure out
what fire we don't use
all right so now we got the header right
but let's bring this thing more down
let's see yeah that's nice
why isn't just moving down let's try to
move that down a little bit more just
because we don't have this inline block
all right let's see what I was what
actually want to do tonight okay think
for now the header is fine okay so let's
continue in the next video
all right guys I'll see you in a little
bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
