work for Spotify or Apple music or
google play whichever one right we don't
think hey our manager came in and said
hey we need a website that basically
people can select the best hours from
Rockefeller right and they get to choose
which ones to download so what we're
going to do is we're going to break this
down into multiple steps and we're gonna
say first of all what exactly do we want
we want to select the album so click
album right we click an album then we
want to show the user that he selected
that album electric power so we add a
class to the album is right all right so
we add that class
okay so then that's selected then from
there but that's only vision
it hasn't been British to like to get
because we haven't done a little
JavaScript so then from there what we're
going to do is we're going to add an
array well create an array and then add
the hour we selected so that all right
so add the title albums titled we
selected to that array so we basically
going to create an array and whatever I
will be click is going to be added into
that array all right now
let's see what else we got one two three
four okay so then we have four albums
what else we want to do after that is
done they select whatever hours they
want we have a total okay we are do this
find out the total columns selected
alright and then what else we're going
to come here and we're going to that's
it for the user that's a that's done
we're going to actually click Save
so Save button is clicked alright save
button is played then when it's clicked
let's click show notification with album
well with saved items solo so and let's
see Save button is clicked then when
it's clicked show notification with
saved items sold okay that's it
it seems pretty simple shouldn't be that
hard at all but to break it down again
let's see what happens
you click the button will click on an
album right and then that I will get
selected so we show the user he selected
the album so we add the class selected
so that I would live so it shows that a
little blue background right creating
array then add the almost title we
selected to that array
all right we can do that and then from
there what else find out the total of
the aisle selected and then what else
save button is clicked then when it's
clicked show notification with safe
tires that's it all right so we can move
on to the next step which is starting to
code this all right remember this we're
doing this with plain JavaScript nothing
else nothing crazy just pure banana raw
JavaScript all right so you guys in the
next peg I simply jump back at it again
