again man make sure you subscribe but
make sure you smash that like button man
make sure you do that alright so we're
gonna start with this I basically spent
the last few hours creating this for you
guys for now on all my tutorials and
everything that I do is gonna run
through this so what is this this is a
starter kit so pretty much what it's
gonna have is going to have live
reloading it's going to have sass you're
going to be able to use sass compiled
CSS have prefixes if you don't know what
that is don't worry because I'm gonna be
teaching you that all you need is just
basically come to this link which is
gonna be at the bottom of the video
right so at the bottom of this video
we'll put this link make sure you you go
here okay github jsg modern web
developer starter kit right now when you
come here you're gonna download this
you're going to click download or if
you're already your savvy with github
you can just pretty much you know pull
from this request right so download this
zip right then from there you're gonna
follow the steps
like I said download now from there
install node you click here come here
download it install that pkg for Windows
users all you have to do is download a
thing as an exec execute file then from
there install yarn
come here follow this all this
instructions you install that windows to
stay to Linux the whole shebang right
after you install that then you come to
Adam and still Adam listen I understand
you guys like you to use your own
editors but if you're gonna follow my
instructions listen to me trust me Adam
is the best and at the same time you're
gonna be able to download all the
packages that I have all the that I
use and make my life easier and you're
gonna be able to basically follow along
with other tutorials and this is like
the
I don't know every night man this so
this is what everybody's using like
unless you want to be a weirdo way
 with him or something else then
that's on you
you know what I mean but that's what
everybody's using right now man and I'm
pretty sure this everybody's gonna stick
with Adam because it's just a really
good editor so make sure you download
that right click there download for Mac
or download for Windows whatever you
have after that on the rulers project
pretty much once you download this this
folder you unzip it right so now this
your your go-to place where you're
always going to start writing you got to
start all your projects from here so
what you do is when you come here like
let's say you open up your terminal you
go like this
basically you take this alright you find
out where exactly is it located so you
say ok this is inside the username and
then inside the Downloads folder and
down there right you quite a do what I
do which is I pretty much I go to the
root the root of my my computer and
basically go go like this I go to
anthrax and then from there I create a
project a project folder right and then
pretty much take this folder and just
drag it in there drag it into your
projects folder
and then once you do that make sure you
drag your projects folder you drag it
here to the side so you could have a
copy of it you know you know on your
favorite places right this format
windows you guys know how to use the
windows right so that's when you guys
you guys are you guys on your own I mean
look it up but I only have a Mac sorry
alright so now you come to the projects
inside your projects you go to modern
tasks right clean up
clean up icon all right now you go to
your terminal right and then you're
going to go see the little squiggly line
and that's going to take you to your
room now you click a less now you're
going to see your projects folder so CD
projects now go to your CD modern task
or if you left to the same way as how
sexy a modern web developer starter kit
master and you just you basically type
that here and then from there now what
that does is it brings you inside the
folder right now you inside the root
folder right so now what you're going to
do is pretty much you're going to also
follow this instructions right after you
follow the instructions download it Adam
now you got to install all the packages
down out alright so you're going to come
here select this and then you paste it
there and click enter
alright so what that's gonna do it is
gonna install all the packages that I
own right after that after you do that
then your next step is gonna be okay
well I messed up before that make sure
you have note and everything works and
so you go no V that's B that gives you
version so that means no this note is
installed and then you go MPM SV tells
you okay you got NPM
let me see yarn that's V and it tells
you yeah you have yard right so after
that then you run this that's just to
basically make sure that you have
everything installed now when you come
here you can install the packages
packages is pretty much your no modules
right order the packages that you need
is basically just code that for you to
not write you know somebody created
those libraries and now you using it
right now it doesn't make too much sense
but trust me just follow along
I'm talking too fast or whatever I'm
trying to make this video short if you
need more explanation leaving your
comment I will tell you more on what to
do and if anything at the same time you
got to do some research I can't do
everything for you guys you know what I
mean like I'm gonna show you all the
tools and everything that you have to do
but at the same time you gotta take time
and say okay fine I can't understand
this step what's going on look it up on
Google it's gonna show it to you trust
me everybody goes through this so
they're from day you're gonna come here
and stole yards so pretty much after you
stole yard or you install the packages
all you do is just run yard and click
enter right that's gonna store all the
packages for you know gulping everything
else all right
now to start the server or you do this
NPM start so what this does is it
creates a virtual server for you and
then at the same time now
you're going to be able sorry
Python now you're going to be able to
come here like let's say you wanted to
change this right before you have to
Reese you know refresh this page and do
a bunch of that you don't want to
do so let's say an example want to
change this to blue you type blue click
enter and it changes myself you see what
I mean that's super helpful let's say we
want this white now everything changes
white without you having to click
refreshing check another page most of
the time you will work like this you
know what I mean like you work like that
half in half right now I'm on a 13-inch
laptop which kind of sucks but for you
guys you guys gonna be on your desktop
right so let's say I wanted to do a
change here I wanted to you know Co
something I'll belay
it's going to say brand new code go in
and delete this and be like okay you
know there you go
of course you got to put in the stylus
so like let's say come back to your main
okay this all just a reset this stuff
you guys don't need this all right that
you probably doing because it is for
text and smoothing out your stuff so
okay let's see all right now let's do
something else
P font size okay so see all right that's
it that's pretty much it you know what I
mean like that's what I've built for you
guys this is just a starter kit so you
guys could get your feet wet and now you
could play around with you know all the
code that you know I put on my youtube
channel you know what I mean like
instead of you having to go through the
whole hassle of like installing packages
and finding packages for yourself right
now you guys is just trying to learn
like all this extra complicated stuff
it's seriously the boring part like you
don't need that unless you know how to
code like you need to learn the basics
and for you to learn the basics you need
to start coding but a lot of times
there's so many options and so many
things you know to guess but I all react
all angular oh this and that
like it's to machine and then you're not
focusing on what you need to do which is
just code don't worry about frameworks
don't worry about what what tooling
don't worry about what the new
framework
that's out there whatever it is stop
worrying about that just cold get the
basics in once you get the basics in you
could create your framework you don't
need nobody else's framework you know
what I mean
that's the mistakes that I made so make
sure that you don't go to lesson I'm
basically giving it to you guys I just
gave you the cheat code man make sure
