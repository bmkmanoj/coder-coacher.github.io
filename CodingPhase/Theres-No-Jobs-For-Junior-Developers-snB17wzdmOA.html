again man coding phase calm listen it's
a beautiful day today we actually going
outside you know people tell me all the
time like oh my god Joe went outside you
know they do I don't like I don't go
outside like it was going on well yeah
man
alright so today I'm going to talk about
a few reasons why as a junior developer
you're still not happy right so pretty
much you're probably not hired because
you don't have a very good portfolio and
you're probably like oh I already know
that
sorry guys I'm making a little Filipino
actually I think I'm let it work yeah
let it burn a little bit so you're
probably asking yourself why are you not
hired right now it's very simple guys
you have to actually sell yourself you
can't expect like somebody to come to
your your github and your github page
and be like oh yeah this guy he could do
a little to do that oh he could you know
soar some arrays
nobody cares about this right what they
care about is hey can this guy hit the
ground running and this guy create a
very complex design from you know just a
regular PSD JPEG or PNG can he create
that page that we give up so you must
demonstrate the skills in our our CSS
the skills to show that you're actually
a good developer and you're not just
some guy trying to get into the industry
you got to show people that you're
actually been in the industry for a long
time
even though you never had a job as a web
developer you got to so people yeah I
can do this
you want me to build this page for you
yes so I'll do it you know that's what
you got a book
also you got to be part of the community
you can't expect people to think oh yeah
these guys are great developer and then
you've never contribute to anything you
got a you know so that when they search
a name they who were your name your name
actually shows up as a developer it
don't show up you know Josh Smith the
taxi driver or Josh Smith the freaking I
don't know this the set for Josh Smith
the the security guard you have
to show that you actually out here
meaning you're either contributing to
project or you're actually just you know
have projects out there meaning like you
know you created a cool web page and at
the bottom assess designed or developed
by Josh Smith so when they google your
name those pages show up you know join
hashed node join github join Stack
Overflow put it with your name don't
come in here and and create just your a
fake account of you know Johnny bangs 24
you know no don't use those type of
nicknames work for your account so I
have put your real name put in your your
real information you know that thing is
valuable you know your name is the most
valuable thing that you have and also
that's one of the things that I would
say you gotta work on also in interviews
don't be nervous don't think like oh my
god junior developer I've never had a
job I've never done this before don't
think like that
think of like I've worked before or if
you haven't work you've talked to people
before just this person is just a
regular person this person doesn't hold
you you're history this person doesn't
hold your desk thing this person is just
a regular person who's gonna hire you
here if you don't like me big deal you
know any moment you can go and do
something else you know what I mean so I
thought you got to think now I'm over
here still cooking I know a little silos
think I know filet mignon actually I
think a birthday a little bit but that's
why because I like my meat well done so
to me that's beautiful right there
definitely worth but see definitely
worth but very to others that I suppose
only something that's fine that's great
but yeah going back to what I'm saying
like you have to do your thing on and
when I say that is just cool little
projects that I give me don't just
expect to get higher just because you
did of course on udemy so expect to get
higher just because you apply yes they
need developers but the you know they
not just going to hire you just because
you applied you have to compete with a
couple of people imagine this I have
five thousand people who subscribe to
out of those five thousand people
probably 80% are trying to get incident
in the industry
I lost eighty percent from that eighty
probably fifty percent are gonna go
start looking for jobs at the same time
as you so what does that tell you this
probably about honor 2500 may be 2,300
2,200 people who are gonna start
applying to jobs at the same time as you
so what makes you better than them what
makes you a better developer than them
so that's the question you know what I
mean so
that's what I would say now of course
you can listen to me or not listen to me
it is your choice I'm already in it
you know most of these people will come
here and give your advice and they're
not even in the industry you know me at
least you know that I'm in the industry
and I work you know 9:00 to 5:00 but
what develops where you want to be so
I'm giving your inside to this life so
this type of work this environment so
just take my advice listen to me then
you'll be golden goddess you know I am a
this is a quick video that I wanted to
do anyways guys how much do you guys
later Wow supporting job back at it
again once again guys living like I
always tell you make sure you subscribe
make sure you like this video and always
you know if I put you all also new
course check it out you don't have to
buy it
you could go to udemy.com by yourself
and buy on your own or you could support
the channel click on the link and buy
through there which basically throws me
like a dollar too now of course if you
don't want to it's fine go ahead go
through you bring me calm directly and
you know and just take the courses but
take advantage alright wow GGG you
already knows you boy joke back at it
again man listen make sure you subscribe
it make sure you like this video that by
the way if you want to know exactly what
questions I took to become a web
developer they right there in the
description it's no secret it's nothing
crazy is no secret gift that I had it's
just pretty much I took the courses
they're pretty cheap they're like 15
dollars each on specials and just this
mess
change your life change your lifestyle
do something fun there's something cool
that you could call a career
