at it again man coding face.com
answering questions like always alright
so this girl sent me a message today
asking me hey Joe what do you guys think
about LinkedIn I mean as far as a web
developer should I be focused on
LinkedIn should I try to create an
account up daily for the latest things
of my resume in there and I will say
yeah sure
I mean I don't know any company that I
know of that I mean for me myself I've
never gotten hired from from LinkedIn
I've never gotten anything from anything
but I'm pretty sure that people do
search my name in a suit they do search
my information and they go through it so
by the way I'm over here cutting me I'm
cooking you know what I mean
but yeah so basically I would say yeah
Mike you know go ahead fix it up clean
it up it's always good to have something
clean out there you know when I mean
clean I mean have the latest things
about yourself in there like you know
what jobs you worked at what skills you
have because in reality you never know
you might apply for a company that
actually looks into LinkedIn and that
could actually help you you know for me
yeah I've never had anybody accent hey
what's your LinkedIn I don't ever so
it's not a big deal for me but at the
same time it's like you can't deny
there's some companies that do use it I
just for myself I haven't had the
opportunity to working at any company
that really focuses on lifted yeah it's
always good to have you know your latest
on projects whatever skills you have or
on LinkedIn also make sure you have a
github account people like to see that
you know people like to see that you're
part of the community if you have like a
copan you know create a couple of things
I'm cold pan
create a couple of things on I was a
jsbin you know just to show that you're
actually part of the community you're
creating new things out there you want
to show that you're just not like
somebody who's out here looking for a
check you know I mean I mean we are
looking for a check but at the same time
you want people to be like oh yeah she
she's actually in the community she's
actually taking her time to build
websites she's actually taking her time
to create new content you know and
practice your skills you know the one of
the worst things that could happen is
the same example you are a developer
you've been working at a company but now
your fire now you'd love to let go of
that company or whatever you quit right
basically the worst thing that could
happen is you try to get a job and
basically you have nothing on your
portfolio nothing your portfolio nothing
online people search for you in the back
way this guy says he's a developer but
nowhere online does it show that this
person is part of the community does he
make websites does he make games this is
he practiced whatever you know what I
mean like it's always good to have your
your your content out there whatever
you're working on it could be
programming can be design and it could
be anything whatever you do and you want
people to know that you do and you do
that thing even your social media if you
are a developer put that on your
Instagram is what developer put that on
your Twitter what developer so people
will they search your name it shows up
like okay this is a developer you know
to me and repeating myself but yeah
definitely go go put it on go and go fix
your your Linkedin if you can it's not a
big deal if you can't can't really fix
it or add other stuff nobody's gonna
hold you accountable for that no one's
gonna be like oh my god she don't have a
LinkedIn personally myself I think
LinkedIn is a waste of time
it's more for recruiters is good if you
want recruiters to get your email
get your information then yeah go ahead
put it on lint it you know so yeah I'll
see you guys later
make sure you check out the website
coding phase comm make sure you
subscribe to the video guys I'm
literally right now I'm taking a break
but I'm starting today the jQuery course
for all those people that I've been
waiting to learn jQuery the reason why I
haven't done it because jQuery is so
easy I could probably knock it out in
one whole day literally and everything
that you need is just gonna be in that
course and then of course I'm probably
gonna come in and add an extra project
so because this hard to might want
courses guys I come in
explain whatever topic we're talking
about right show you the basics of it
and then from there I give you a project
right sometimes if it's something more
difficult
like I say like Lara Lara I started
opposite way we basically started
hitting the ground running by creating a
project real quick and there from there
my plan is to go in there and explain
everything in them because when you
dealing with something that's very big
like laravel you don't really or even
know Jess I'm doing the same thing for
nodejs it's like I'm giving you guys a
project before I explain everything is
in depth you know because sometimes you
want to come any want to start creating
things to you're like man why is this so
long why is this boring I'm not building
anything so when it's a situation like
that what I do is I start making you
build something as soon as possible so
like that you could you know be
entertain be maybe you know happy that
you actually building something you know
what I mean and different they're going
there into the more details later on
alright so yeah today we started the
jQuery kits and I'm still working on the
low Jes still knocking that out we
concluded the the realistic that's it
really stay it's done for those of you
guys have been wanting to learn react
and you haven't wanted to get your game
up and on the 5 projects guys the real
estate app is done all right so I'll see
you guys later
go to the website Kota face
come your boy is back and Adam did it
again yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
