back on it again man : face calm this my
bullies back I didn't did it again
alright so we're basically going to
teach you today how to get my sequel for
free especially when you just want to
try out some things right now you have
like a little test app that you want to
work on or you just want to say hey I
want to have fun just a database out
there you know remote that's not on my
local computer right so this is very
simple so you go to Heroku calm you sign
up right now let's say you created your
app for a Roku like right now cutting
face comments being hosted by Heroku
calm so let's say you have your apps
right I'm going back like I said you
click on your app coding phase whatever
you named it then from there you come
here resources and then here you come in
you say hey find more resources five
more add-ons okay and then you say okay
you want to get my sequel they have a
whole bunch of different ones to have
Postgres to have you know they have
mongol they have read is they have a
whole bunch of different right but from
now when we're going to see is the my
sequel so let's do this
clear DB by seaport and then restore
clear the beat now you don't search your
app to learn that you gotta choose so
we're going to click this one color
phase and then continue after that now
you get the option to choose which
database pricing you you are for right
now we want to take the free one right
got a click permission click on next let
it load okay a little second team now
now you got ad to see a database now
what we're going to do is for you guys
that oh like to have stuffing maybe no
windows and user interface so I would
recommend for you that's down
with this sequel procom what this does
is it shows your database in a user
interface it's that simple instead of
you having to blow through the command
line you used to it to here basically
user interface I will show you in one
second right now we come here
clear the we will click here make sure
you click on the database it's going to
take you to the website it's going to
give you this information as I hate you
only got five megabytes in size of your
database right because the three you
know now click on it and you say ok
what's my employee information so now
you're going to username and you got
your password now going back to your
settings because not for you to know
exactly what's the address where are you
supposed to connect to now you basically
come here you come to your config
variables click config variables and
you'll see clearly be database URL right
now your copy this you paste it here and
basically there's the information that
you need so we're going to open sequel
probe and then it goes up obviously pool
pearl right I did this before
basically come in you say okay I want
the host host is where it's going to
connect to so you're going to say here
you go Sophie copy this part after the @
sign right and you can say okay all that
until the slash so this is the website
that you basically connect all to don't
the server now you copy that paste it
right now you have the first thing
that's here after my sequel go home
semicolon was it coded Oh smash slash
and then from there the first thing is
going to come up
until the colon is you're using me copy
it paste it and then from there you copy
this until the outside and that's your
password now here is what you're going
to put the pork the reason why our
sequel pros you 3306 because generally
that's where my sequel is usually set up
at so that's how it usually is on almost
all the servers so go ahead 3306 test
connection connections are feeding
connect now you're connected to the
database right now because this one is
free you're only going to get what it
says here so if you come back to your
dashboard you should see okay there's
the only database that you have current
database size is zero maximum database
size is five megabytes which is almost
nothing right now there's the only one
that you have you can come in and try to
create a new database because you don't
have access to it so everything that you
work on is going to be inside of that so
here we basically you click that usually
shows up like that you choose a database
so you're going to come to the bottom
and choose along as escarole cool
whatever right and then now you could
come here and create a table and say hey
host yes it now you have basically my
sequel you know now you have access to
my sleepover you could connect through
this like directly if you're using PHP
or crystal Lang whatever you're using
