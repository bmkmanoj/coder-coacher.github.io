listen so people been asking me yo what
do you need to become a digital nomad
right it's very simple guys if you
follow the instructions and follow what
I tell you you can become a digital
nomad right it's not that hard
plus if you stay tuned I'm gonna tell
you who else is gonna win another udemy
course man man stay tuned alright let's
get it alright so who I am right I'm a
full stack web developer with over 5
years experience I've been doing this
for a while I actually spent one whole
year of just working remotely so I
actually know what the hell I'm talking
about so I know how to survive you know
without having to go to a job I know you
know alone nine-to-five no I have not
been in Thailand no I have not been in
you know Colombia no I have not been
check Slovakia but I've lived in one of
the most expensive cities in the world
which is New York City with just plain
work from remote work so actually know
what I'm talking about
alright so first of all you got to plan
things up you know do your research
where you live
do your research how much it costs to
live there and do your research you know
how much you're going to earn you know
as far as a job and what are you
actually going to be doing because you
know you need to plan things out you
cannot try to become a digital nomad and
just do whatever you want to do is just
be like hey I'm gonna become a digital
nomad it doesn't work like that
or you know what I mean I actually heard
about this a lot of times where you know
it's like you know kids with a little
trust fund and you know a little baby
here in there and they they act like you
know they actually digital nomads but
they're living off their parents little
trust fund that they gave them
well guys you're not actually a digital
nomad you just a leech somebody leeching
off your parents like come on man
if you 28 30 years old still living off
your trust fund and
actually earning anything back you just
elite right now in the world but anyways
man skills on high demand right so what
skills can you actually become oh you
know I actually digital no man very
simple guys you got marketing you know
guys who do HTML emails for people you
know help them with their SEO help them
with you know how to market you know get
new clients whatever look it up trust me
there's a whole bunch of jobs in
marketing also graphic artists designer
trust me guys there's a whole bunch of
jobs that you could get you know a
little $15 $20 in there you know an hour
survive be able to survive you know what
I mean or even if you're really known
out here and you're very known graphic
designer or just a plain designer UX
designer whatever you want to call
yourself you will find jobs out here
right web development of course the
front-end back-end HTML CSS JavaScript
PHP Ruby on Rails what else
Java C sharp there's some million jobs
out here man for guys who you know
they're really good the skills and you
know they could work remotely right so
then you have dropshipping what the hell
is drop shipping pretty much is like you
know you have products and you're
actually you're not touching any
products what you're actually doing is
you're talking to a a wholesaler or you
know basically somebody who has the
products and basically you're promoting
the car the products either Amazon or
Ebay whatever right something I forgot
to put it out here is affiliate
marketing right so affiliate marketing
is pretty much like let's say you know
somebody has a product and I say I work
for gone whatever Nike right let's say I
work for night right so I work for Nike
I'm I have a product that I actually
want to sell and I'm like you know I'm a
I can't sell this freakin product so I'm
put it online and see who else could
sell it for me so that's not what the
affiliate marketers come in they come in
you know basically promote the out
of a you know either
the sneakers whatever it is guys you
know and just pretty much you they get a
little Commission right so they got a
little 20% 3% Amazon got an affiliate
marketing links but yeah you make a
little something right and able to
survive right a lot of people that make
a lot of money but that's on you that
depends on how you want to do your
business and how much you you're
actually putting in you know how much
work you actually put in it but yeah
then you got applications developer then
you got virtual assistant you know
there's a whole bunch of jobs for you
know virtual assistants like necessary
an example somebody wants you know they
have an excel sheet right and they need
somebody to just keep it up to date with
whatever their items they're selling or
you know it could be a whole bunch of
different situations but you could get
hired to do that little thing like come
on who can mess around with Excel sheets
or setting up appointments for people
like come on anybody could do this right
so that's one thing another thing is
being able to survive in any situation
all right you guys gotta understand
sometime you know life hits you with a
frequent left punching that you was not
expecting you might be in in Thailand
you might just be in Colombia you might
just be in Puerto Rico you might just be
in Florida like and next thing you know
you might get sick out there be able to
survive and know where things is I'm
just like you know roll with the punches
that's a big part of being a digital
nomad sometimes you might be an
affiliate marketer that month might not
be that good you might actually lose
money while you're trying to promote a
certain product or like let's say you're
you have a store on eBay or Amazon for
whatever reason you sent three thousand
dollars worth of proud
and now now that you sell those products
somebody decides to be that gay this was
stolen credit card right now you're lost
out on that money a lot of times
like that happens
you know so being able to roll with the
punches like it's super essential all
right all right so let's go to the next
one understand what you are getting
yourself into understand that not
everybody is going to be able to do this
this is not for every single personality
it has to be a certain type of person
who is just adventurous who pretty much
is like doesn't have responsibilities of
something like tying them in somewhere
like if you have a mortgage that you
don't know Matt it's not for you if you
have something like a car payment that's
tying you down then you don't know man
it's not for you man
you have kids digital nomad it's not for
you because at the same time remember
you gotta take care that kid you gotta
you know put in you know put in those
hours or if you want to be a deadbeat
dad or entebbe mom then that's on you
but sometimes man being a digital nomad
it's not easy so you have to understand
what the hell are you getting yourself
into
it's perfect for single people it's
perfect for people who are straight out
of college and they're like hey I'm
gonna take two three years of just
traveling and being able to survive hey
more power to you okay just do your
thing but understand that it's not for
everybody all right all right so know
how to manage your money man listen I've
heard stories of people stuck you know
that they go to freakin Thailand or they
go to like somewhere like Colombia and
they think hey I'm just gonna survive
with 600 $700 a month I have $5,000 I'm
going to be able to take you know take
this over there take my flight and
survive with this money for a whole year
people think that but then they forget
about
the little things you know because
people want to be going to clubs people
want to be going to party with the girls
people want to be going to you know
letting boys frickin bars whatever you
guys want to be doing over there right
so oh that costs money man there's
gonna be you know women that's gonna be
right next to you the whole time that I
oh yeah maybe I love you this and that
but reality they they're because of your
money and they're because you're a
foreigner right so
oh that's just gonna cost you money
people is not gonna want to be around
you if you're broke
especially in a third world country
they're gonna be looking at you like
you're what the hell you doing here
looking like a bum you know what I mean
so what you're going to try to do is try
to keep up with other guys who actually
do have money I have businesses or they
actually you know trust fund babies man
and you know it's like if you're a
self-made person and you're trying to
keep up with you know trust from baby
you're gonna lose man because there's a
lot of them out here you know they act
like they're they're you know nomads or
there you know self-made but nobody
knows their room you know the real story
are they really making that much money
some of them are some of them are not
some of them I just hate their parents
left them half a million dollars in a
bank account and like now they could
just live it up for the next ten
years and then once that that money goes
away then deciding you know they decide
to go back to the US and be like oh yeah
I was just trying to find myself you
know that's what happens a lot of times
so for you who is a self-made person
trying to keep up in a third world
country like man you're going to see
some some crazy shits out there man
alright so know how to manage your money
man know how much you know things cause
in that country or wherever you decide
to go whatever state you decide to go
make sure to know that hey how to get
things cheap how do you know
extend your money make it last
don't think that everything's gonna be
sweet in the beginning it takes time so
to survive you need money so don't think
hey I'm leaving to Thailand with $20,000
I could survive for the next three years
no because you're gonna waste that money
you know what I mean so make sure you
have some income coming in don't just go
over there just because you got twenty
thousand dollars on you okay guys now
have an exit plan man the last thing you
want to do a man is being stuck
somewhere man last thing you want to do
is let's say you're you're in
Czechoslovakia somewhere and you just
finish you know finish putting in your
last little bit of money into buying
some products and you're like yeah man
this is my last $400 man I've heard this
other guy from from YouTube he made it
with his last two hundred dollars and I
could do it man life is a bitch so life
is gonna throw you some curveballs you
know what I mean why you was thinking
hey with this $400 I could make my money
back things go sour and the next thing
you know you're over there fighting for
your life meaning like literally you're
over there doing you know like
somewhere like in Thailand
you know don't fight to eat you know
I've seen people who have gone to those
countries and then they tell me like war
stories words like yeah man I was stuck
in Australia I had to go work in a farm
I'm like working a farm like bro you was
here chillin how the hell you gonna go
to a third world country to work on a
farm on the field like come on guys man
like you guys got to know how to do you
know do things right man and have an
exit plan man don't do things just all
crazy like that man
all right so make sure you have an exit
plan always have your plane ticket to go
back on your back account no matter what
like it or not you always gotta have
that because you don't know how things
might go crazy especially in a
third-world country or
like whatever are you freaking you do
graffiti in a bathroom next thing you
know you're doing 10 15 years
like type of crazy countries like that
