immutable was a beautiful immutable
something it is immutable data but
there's a special word for it there's
like I forgot the name of the library
but it's basically all react helpers
right I use that a lot what else there's
a couple of libraries that I use now I'm
starting to use this library called
phaser it's supposed to be for you know
what provider may not what the vendors
are in game development and it's like a
game game engine
it's pretty cool pretty legit and I'll
take what all things I'm working on
right now
also I'm also working on watching the
PHP my sequel course again because since
I've been using a lot of laravel and I'm
not quoting that much so you know strong
sequel I'm starting to get really rusty
and with cristal leg you know right now
there's really not a good old om that
you could use so you got to do mostly
your your sequel queries you know we're
just raw sequel and that's like what's
going on right now that's what I'm
working on today you know I'm learning
relearning
my sequel like I already know it but
there's certain things that I want to
just retouch so I'm actually taking the
course again which it kind of makes me
feel like a newbie I'm like yeah I feel
I feel like I'm starting all over again
do you know what I mean
good house for charge oh yeah I don't
care about it we're taking you guys
through this journey of me getting about
charges this way after already left I
already left to work and then I have to
return back because my phone's about to
die and you know how we are now if
you're falling about to die you're like
it's like you're like nervous
like oh my god how am I going to survive
without a phone the whole day I got into
cooking widower learn social people or
computer lots of people are you to talk
to people
Instagram so that's funny now you know
over yeah that that's what's up that's
what's up a little more regret just
enjoy my day enjoy my early morning

look like the neighbors probably like oh
my what the hell is this guy doing with
a camera walking around with a camera
well you know F them because we are he's
doing a big cake yeah but talking about
libraries were like I want to know what
libraries do you guys use like as far as
JavaScript or you know NPM packages that
you guys might be using currently on
your project so if you want to let me
know you know leave a little comment
tell me under on the comments exactly
what I'm really using what frameworks
are you working on what are you trying
to learn right now so I'd add you know
by the time the lunch break Chronicles
start I can come back and maybe give you
guys any topic dependable of what you
guys actually roll in the comments
for the airway so the strangely like my
drive to work is like 12 minutes most of
the time not every single time but for
some time follow
oops sorry I gotta put them on my
seatbelt freakin thing making mad noise
the ant-man yeah I just wanna know like
exactly what iverson gotta answer our
employment we see the State Board for
everything you know we'll use it for Dom
manipulation we'll use it for Ajax we'll
use it for like anything that's in the
front is I hate go ahead go use you know
jQuery but now I was like everybody's
like walking away from jQuery it's kind
of sad it is not like they walking away
it's just they're not talking about it
no more they're not talking about jQuery
anymore so that's kind of interesting
how you know just a few years ago jQuery
was the shit's like it was like the
go-to library for anybody to work in
front end and like now if you mentioned
jQuery people look at you like oh my god
jQuery you know like freaking idiot yeah
man but I don't fall for you guys who
are brand new developers long you know
jQuery is fine man you can't go wrong
with jQuery like people are going to
tell you all use angular use react use
UJS but man
you could do like sometimes as much
 in jQuery than any other
framework meaning like you could do so
much quick you know it's like it's
something quick like you just go in
there you don't have to compile it you
don't have to do anything these load of
jQuery you're good to go
nothing and also yeah anyways guys I
know you guys like oh man
Joe's drive to work every
morning when his phone on his
camera on yes again man that's what I do
that's what I do for you guys I put
myself in harm put myself in danger for
you guys for you to you know man like I
always say where I've got a for you
guys you know I'll do this for for the
love of it I do this for helping people
here on YouTube and just I don't know
it's attaining at the same time like
because like I said like my goal is not
to be here the most technical guy the
best spoken guy I'm not here for that we
know this guy's already going that
I'm here to just like you know talk
about cold at the same time entertain
you guys and be like okay
once you finish they taking somebody's
tutorial will take it so some you know
something corny Han like you just waking
up and you're like okay cool let me see
what Joe's UPS you know that's what I
made the chatter so people we just have
something you know a little Logan's I
feel like you see how girls have the
makeup tutorials and they have the
makeup girls and they got the makeup log
and isn't that but for a lot of us we
don't have that you know what I mean we
don't have to we're not going to be
watching here is going makeup you know
or you know for little kids then I go we
want to watch minecraft or we want to
watch I don't know call of duty
on YouTube but it's like we don't have
that we don't have like people who are
into the fundamental calling who are
just like cool people's people that
you've been I okay cool I hope we have
to see myself being friends with that
person like there's not that many years
of
because helping you either dislike out a
bunch of weirdos or useful I wouldn't
imagine myself being like oh like I want
to be friends with this guy is like well
you're weirdo thing like I'm
just being back here though I wouldn't
want to be with your friend you know
what I mean so that's just not my
opinion like I'm not so far south for
you to locate this dude is cool this
doing like good he's funny he's cool he
has a swag hello Jimmy
and also how awful for him but a lot of
this other goes down here man they're
like robots
we're like you don't have to do what
development so Cory you don't have to
talk to people like
in such a boring way talk like yourself
and be yourself so I'm trying to act
like your college professor or YouTube
like come on man you know I mean guys
ima make sure you subscribe make sure
you like this video man also guys if you
you want to support a channel that's the
patreon in the link or you know at the
same time if you want to become a web
developer or programmer you know
software engineer right there on my
description there's a couple of links
that may need until you know the person
who I am today
the developer who I am today and yes
pretty easy man
not waste any time to stop looking
online for a whole bunch of when
the reality the courses are right there
if you take those courses I'm telling
you I guarantee it you're going to be
good you're going to find a job so
that's on you but the same time look
like I always say it's about putting it
to work just because you bought the
course and you know you left it there
online and you never went back to it
doesn't mean that you're going to become
the web to it you have to put in new
work and then also do projects alright
