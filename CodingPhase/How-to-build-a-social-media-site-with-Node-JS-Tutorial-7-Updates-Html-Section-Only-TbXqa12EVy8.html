the content area is to actually do the
updates all right so first of all we're
gonna take this one step at a time
and just break it down okay we got one
section here okay and inside of it we
have one section right here we have
another section which is the image there
from there we have the header then from
there we have the paragraph from there
we have how many likes how many likes
and how many hearts we've gotten and
from there we have the comments okay and
then from there we have the section
where says write a comment and then from
there we have the two buttons okay so
it's a lot of different layers that we
got to create so let's get started okay
so I'm gonna come up here I'm gonna
close up the content area while the
content area is find the compose section
okay I'm gonna make this in tool let's
see that's fine I'm gonna make this into
a section instead of a div okay so let's
do this make this
section saved that
okay now gonna come here and say section
and this section what I'm going to do is
I'm going to name it let's say updates
okay and here we're going to put in a 1
update so we're gonna create another
section well another div a div is
actually better for this situation we
will say update and call this let's say
update oh yeah update container update
container because technically we want it
to be one container for each update okay
so call it update container okay now
we're gonna have author information so
we're gonna say div and then in here
we're gonna say div class author info
okay we got out there info we have user
image which is gonna be a div use our
image okay user image what else so that
user image we got let's say info which
is gonna have the name and what type of
post it was is that okay they shared the
story whatever so let's just add that so
let's say James doll shared a story okay
so this right here is going to be a link
href which is going to link to james doe
profile so it's that like that and then
here we're going to create another link
which is going to share not share but
link to all the stories so like let's
say you're following a whole bunch of
people right and you click on story then
it's gonna show you all the stories now
if you click on the user is gonna take
you to the users profile okay and it's
the same thing as the user image so
matter of fact let's put this as a
anchor link okay let's do it like that
alright so we got those elements there
what's next okay we got the first
section alter out their info here we're
gonna have div class name is going to be
update image or
let's say media let's put in media
because let's say somebody uploads a
video we will want this to be a video if
it was a photo be a photo if a was a I
call this if it was something else then
and we show something else like a photo
or if they added a link it would show a
link to the website just like Facebook
does it right okay let's see you so
different there we have let's say post
so let's say we got author info okay
then we have live class let's call this
update info and here we're going to put
in h h for a fact h3 let's see how to
become a developer say for example and
then we're gonna have a paragraph which
is gonna just be lorem ipsum so lowering
if some is just regular text but it's
just like a whole bunch of gibberish
it's nothing crazy so that's what we got
so far
now the next element
we're gonna basically
call this area update stats okay so let
me close this down for now
say div class update stats okay so we
got up these stats and
the update stats is just gonna have an
icon so we're gonna say div class icon
okay is gonna have an icon it's gonna
have text so let's see copy this let's
say
other users how the user saw let's put
here something like assess their Sara
Russell and 23 others light
like update
and then we have the comment section so
copy this comments stepped stats so here
we're going to say four comments for
comments okay
now the next thing that we want to do is
create the right common section you just
copy this and paste it here so we're
going to call this compose comment
compose comment
and
we have for like a text field here
you
okay so let's do that now let's say text
area
sex area let's leave that alone for now
text area and then we have two buttons
you
okay so I'm going to say they've class
buttons buttons plural and then it's out
of here we're going to have to buy it
okay so class button let's see what was
it share button or repost repost button
let's dallisa repost BTN and then here
we're gonna put
say like like BTN
okay
so so far guys we have everything that
we need to get started okay and in the
next video we're gonna continue building
the CSS and just put the stylings and
make it nice and pretty the last few
videos we've been doing like 40 minute
videos 30 minute videos so I decided you
know what once we finished with the HTML
let's split it up okay so a lot of you
guys don't get you know overwhelmed with
watching like a full 40 minute video so
I'm gonna try to keep videos under 20
minutes you know sometimes I get excited
I get hype I'm like okay let's just do
HTML and CSS on the same video and then
it takes forever so at least now I'm
gonna try to break it up for you guys so
keeping me in mind okay so let's
continue with this I'll see you guys in
the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
