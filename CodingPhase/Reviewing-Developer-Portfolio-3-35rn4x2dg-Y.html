man coding feels calm your boys backing
out and did it again
alright guys listen we got another
portfolio here from another subscriber
who was like hey Joe
check out my portfolio man check out my
website check out what I got man you
know give me an honest opinion and I'm
gonna just be honest you know like this
this website is definitely you know you
could tell it's like a real real
beginner just built it and I understand
it's probably your first website you've
built and you know to be in a positive
note so that started positively it's
really good that you have your name as a
dot-com man Shaun or roll comp which is
hard it's hard to find you know because
almost every single name out there every
single domain is already taken so this
is really good for when people search
you online they could just say hey let's
search this person oh let me see copy
see if it shows up online yes there you
go it shows up right away
see that's that's definitely good you
you good in that sense cuz you already
got the domain you good King like
whenever somebody's gonna Google you
online automatically your website is
gonna show up that's good for sure now
let's talk about the design of the
website like I would say hey we are
developers sometimes we don't have the
skills of a designer you have to look
online and what other designers do so
you go to dribble comp check what they
and they working with right so even here
you go dribble calm let's say search
portfolio right search portfolio see
what other people are building like
there's a very simple portfolio page but
it looks clean right it doesn't have to
be very complicated you can have
literally like just a blank page where
if you know something like this like
okay got your image it's all white have
like you know if you
profile I understand sometimes you'd be
like man you know these people they have
better images than me I'm just trying to
create something cool you know as soon
as possible I don't have other images
and this and that and you're right
you know images make a website you know
that happens to me all the time to where
I'm like man I want to create something
super cool but I don't have the images
to really create it that's fine you know
you make a great website with whatever
you have you know like this person's
like look at this portfolio you know
there's just like something very simple
you know what they have right that's it
it's nothing crazy it's nothing
complicated you know you could look at
other people's designs and see how to
make things more clear right you got to
look into typography because this type
of font is never good on a website like
you gotta look for sans-serif so you go
to like let's say Google Fonts all right
you come to Google Fonts come here what
you have right now it's called display
font right which is like font star font
like fun and like you know all up in
your face like they're good for a title
but they're not good for your website to
have like everywhere I guess it's never
good to have display fonts like
everywhere like that you want something
nice and classy like you know like let's
say if you wants to pick something for
for your your main title or your main
name you know you come here you look
around find the right the right
combination you say okay maybe I'll take
this one right let's say an example mist
envelope you take that one and then you
will take a serif font all right because
right now what you're using is serif
right but in reality you want San serif
sorry about that yeah so you have a
serif font here and that's never really
good for websites the fonts that really
work good
four websites are sans-serif' like this
like Roboto open sans lardo Roboto
condensed like all of these fonts are
good for website especially for
readability now if you was doing
something like let's say the New York
Times you know then you will use
something like Sarah so let me see in
New York Times let's see what they use
okay let this load for a little bit you
see for them because there's a magazine
there's a newspaper they use serif for
for the you know their funds for the
paragraphs and even their titles but
that's a different type of style that's
because this coming from a newspaper
newspaper they usually use serif fonts
but when you're dealing with a website
like yours you definitely want this to
be sans-serif like if we come here like
let's say this one for example let's
inspect this respect let's say for
family sans-serif see like that it looks
a little bit better if you come here you
start playing around with the font
weight okay let's say at 300 you see
this font looks way better than this one
for the menu alright now there's just
little things like that I understand
like this is probably like one of your
very very first websites like you know a
year from now you're gonna look back and
you're gonna be like oh my god what was
I doing
I mean that's just how it is you know my
first websites were horrible man like
they were pretty pretty bad man like you
go back into the history of it I go man
they look
bad but you know don't don't get
discouraged
you got a lot of good things that are
happening here that are pretty good you
have your domain which is your name you
also have your social media here which
is pretty good you know at the same time
um let me see you got an about page you
have a picture yourself you have a
little paragraph you know you want to
finish this things off to also to this
this background here I think you have it
fixed
let me see see where is it that you have
the background the business card
background yeah you have a fixed so fix
is never good so you take that out and
now when you scroll it stays the same
it's not like fixed to the area like
that always looks bad but as far as the
images to listen I want to tell you guys
about gravity like I don't know if I
told you guys like if you want to mess
around with building sites in and
creating images guys download this I'm
creating a course right now as we speak
on this and I'm thinking about maybe
making it free I mean there's also
people here on you to have it who have
little courses on it but it's pretty
legit man you come here you have grab it
let me see grab a designer you could
download this is completely free is good
for Windows is good for for mac is good
for Linux literally like it's the same
programming all systems I think they use
electron I don't know but I think so
because this used to be for the browser
you can come here and design your whole
website you know put the things how you
want it see how it looks before you
start coding it all right and there's so
many different little tools here
just for the web that in reality this
image that you have in the background
which looks like super stressed out and
it's like super small and it's like all
pixelated you could definitely create a
new image for it right
search gravity was the gravit G are a
vit that IO right use that and create
new images for your website and like I
said fix the fonts for sure here make
some spacing here like give this like a
20 pixels
you know padding from the left or pad
margin from the left like you know
little things like that just gonna clean
it up like I'm not gonna go super hard
on this arm and its portfolio because
there's like it's obvious like he's just
starting you know what I mean like can
we all bend in it's just the first page
you know it takes a lot of courage to
even show you one of your very first
pages like people come in and send you
portfolios once they already good you
know like it's it's easy to say hey I'm
already a good developer and like here's
my beautiful portfolio Joe it's very
easy to do that but it takes a lot of
courage when you're still in the process
of learning to code and still you're
like hey could you check out my my
portfolio what do you think like it
takes a lot of courage to do that so
mess you already know man is your boy
Joe yeah I'm here man whenever you got
any questions send me an email and guys
