coding face.com listen with a quick
review and I'm gonna be honest with you
guys
listen this is a course that you guys
definitely got it take you know it's
been a while since I recommend it a
course from you to me your boy Stephen
Greiner released another great course
stuff that you gonna need you know in
the near future especially if you're
going for job interviews in major
companies as a junior developer you got
to understand this you know in reality
you want to have as many projects as you
can but that doesn't guarantee you that
somebody's gonna be at a home and be
like you know what let's test this kid
let's put him through the fire see if he
burns right sometimes it happens you
know especially when you self-taught
especially when you don't have a degree
especially when you're a junior
developer you're going to this major
companies you know let's say to the
level of like Facebook Google and you
know whatever major company Amazon like
they will test you right especially when
you haven't been working in a lot of
companies for or being in the industry
for a while you know what I mean like
they gotta test you now I've been saying
like hey I'm not a huge fan of
algorithms right and that's because I
really don't think that it shows
everything like let's say somebody could
be really talented and just now remember
things right so algorithms is not really
about how smart you are
can you figure out the most amazing
thing out there no it's about
remembering right if you got good memory
and you go over things you know week
before the interview you're gonna be a
you know you're gonna be great under the
job interview but that's just how it is
all right some people they're really
good at remembering things some people
are actually good on building projects
and you know getting the job done you
know like I said you know you might have
all your projects in my half everything
that you need but they just might be
won't do
it's just like being an a-hole engine on
the interview but you know what let's
bring out the whiteboard and let's test
them
lets you know reverse the stringless
shortest realice what was some data
structures let's see what he does was
disarray let's see what if he goes
through the fibonacci sequence like this
things out there guys that I'll be
honest I'll be like me I don't know why
they doing this because in the job that
we're going to do and the project that
I'm gonna be working on I'm not gonna be
needing this but if they ask you those
things you want to be prepared you know
it just gives you that little um you
know what I mean like if somebody had a
little doubt about you like how this guy
learned online this this and that is
like hey I know all this algorithms I
learned it okay I practiced it here you
go you know and I'll repeat personally I
don't think they are important but it's
a way to test people it's a way to to
weed out you know the quote unquote best
from the rest you know but to me myself
I don't I don't think that is that that
important right now when you go to a job
interviews it's a different story every
company is different you know what
happens to me when I go to a job
interview is completely different than
what is gonna happen to you you're a
junior developer with no experience
learning online
you know you might fall into a company
that they just might be like hey we're
gonna test this kid out so for you to be
prepared I definitely recommend this
course and the reason why I recommend
this course because not only does he go
over a lot of the material and different
type of algorithms out there
the most popular ones the ones that
people constantly ask actually about but
he also explains it like really explains
it like you know I'm not talking about
like you know you know how free cocaine
does algorithms like they don't really
do a good explanation on why this is
important why people need to learn what
this does this whole course itself
it goes over every single step and then
explains it to you in a way where not
only are you gonna be able to do it in
JavaScript because the course itself is
is done with JavaScript he does a lot of
testing with who have just was it which
is good too because it teaches you just
to do automated testing but also the
fact that he teaches it in a way that
you could do it in PHP you could do in
Python you can do it in Ruby you could
do it in any language because you're
understanding the concept it's not like
hey you're understanding the JavaScript
way to do this it's more of hey there's
the concepts that's what you got to
remember how to solve this problem so
this one gets my a1 approval I'm adding
this one to all my videos on the
descriptions I'm also gonna add it to my
list I'm coming out with a Black Friday
list the courses that everybody should
have you know if you're gonna buy a
course those are the ones that you need
and I'm also gonna create a list of the
most popular by sales because I get our
emails from you to me directly basically
with all information which are the
top-selling courses which means is the
most popular ones the ones that are
really out there the ones that people
are really enjoy because you gotta
understand this when they counted class
as a sold item they counted 30 days
after it's not just that first that
first day you you order and you're like
okay cool they counted 30 day year after
because in the account they after the
refund date that is over right so pretty
much people have kept those classes
everybody here knows like hey you buy a
class you could refund it hey you know
what I mean if the class is bad refund
it you know so that's just how it is so
I'm basically creating those two those
two long list I'm a create one that's
gonna be my Black Friday list that
people need to buy for sure and then
a topless that I'm gonna do I don't know
maybe two weeks from now at the end of
the month for something where I'm
probably gonna do this once a month of
showing which one are the top-selling
courses on udemy for that month okay so
yeah man go check this out man go try it
out I'll be honest guys like you're
gonna get a lot for for your monies ten
bucks he goes into everything every
single thing that I've seen in you know
interviews as far as like you know
whiteboards he actually has it here like
I was really surprised you know like
there's a lot of stuff taxi I've seen
stack stacking with stacks I've seen
linked lists I say building tree tree
woof-woof level with sorting with with
bubble sort you know like there's so
many ones like know you know the
Fibonacci sequence this also are integer
reversal max characters are anagrams
like those are the ones that I
personally have seen in interviews you
know and the ones that I could say hey
they ask you this you know a lot of
times you know just to test you you know
what I mean like that's just how it is
so yeah man go check it out they should

this amazing course for PHP like it's
complete man all the syntax is complete
are we working on a crud which is gonna
be creative read update delete it's just
a simple project but it's not really
that simple cuz we were basically doing
everything by hand coding every single
thing no framework no nothing just
pretty much understanding what happens
when you create read update delete with
my sequel and there from there we jump
into the project that I've been showing
you guys for the past like two three
days which is a project where we're
building a base
is a ape is it's a project that connects
to the API of Behance and then pretty
much you could save the images depending
on what you need for your project for
inspiration let's say for example I'm
building an e-commerce website
I search for e-commerce designs out
there and then I choose which ones are
the ones that I'm inspired by so I go
have it like a collage and choose the
best things that I like like let's say I
like the money of this I like the the
you know the top section of this I like
the body of this I like the footer of
this and basically you're gonna be able
to create your own website out of the
designs that you add it to your project
right so you're learning how to deal
with our API you learn how to create
your own website with laravel you're
learning how to deal with migrations my
sequel you're learning how to do
authentication you're learning how to
deal with sessions cookies the whole
shebang guys like it's a super complete
course in PHP 7 it's not like you know
the old school way of doing things we'll
be showing you the most modern way to
work with PHP you know a lot of people
talk bad about PHP but PHP has gone a
long way it's like pretty modern now

80% of the Internet so at some point
you're gonna have to learn PHP no matter
why you can't run away from me you know
it could be on laravel could be a word
person could be on Silex it could be on
a million coding nutter it doesn't
matter at some point in your career
