face.com
all right guys enjoy the beer is coming
off today so enjoy it alright that's the
message I wanted to say to everybody
just enjoy the beer now that's not
exactly what I wanted to say to you guys
but basically there's a message for my
subscribers there's a message for my
competition and we are starting off like
this number one I don't have no
competition my competition doesn't live
in YouTube
my competition lies in you know
universities my competitions lies on
udemy Steven Grider Cold Steel those are
my competition nobody here from YouTube
it's my competition I don't all right
and when I say competition is people who
I look up to people who I want to be
like people who are actually you know
want to get to their level right when I
came to you to my King here completely
to help everybody out and that's what
I've been doing people constantly send
me messages that like oh thank you like
we love your channel oh cool I
appreciate it I appreciate that people
are getting something out of it right
now going to it like somebody sent me
some messages oh people might be talking
about you this and that number one
there's no competition right a lot of
people who are being here for a while
I could call them my sons or people who
just stole the sauce or people who just
been somehow someway influenced by the
sauce right the sauce that I got what
I've been doing on this channel which
comes naturally I don't I don't come
here and plant a video I don't come here
and think oh I'm gonna do this to tour
really I don't do longer I just
freestyle - I wake up one day and I woke
up in a good mood I create something new
I create something bad whenever I'm in a
bad mood I come in and had a bad
lunch break I'll come in and suppress it
to you I come in and share moments that
I have my own company right I just come
in and just share it no fakeness no you
know trying to get viewers no trying to
follow trends no trying to you know be
something that I'm not I'm just honest
and I'm always gonna be me right so
there is no competition because a lot of
people are here because they just like I
want to do YouTube and this and that
they saw a lot of times that she didn't
work for them now they copy the sauce
take my style take take bits and
pieces I see it from everybody that's
why I don't watch no more youtubers
alright
I'm staying away from people the only
people that I watch is the real casa
Darrow his Constance completely
different their minds
I like real tough candy her content is
 hilarious
I enjoy it and I like to watch Christian
because that's my boy I like to see what
he's up to right so that's it right oh
one once in a while I like to see Chris
Hawkes whenever I see in a video that
interests me that's it
everybody else I don't watch because
number one they stealing the
sauce everybody everybody's over here
taking bits and pieces they watch my
videos and oh cool
we could do this we should do this know
create your own shape right now to my
viewers and for other people that'd be
like Oh Joe was now creating courses and
and that's what he's going to be doing
and because he's out here trying to get
money nah I have other websites and
other channels which make me more money
than this channel
right and I still do this every single
day probably I put in like four or five
hours to YouTube alone or related
to youtube right and I'll leave out of
here with two hundred dollars a month
right so it's not here because instead
of money right when somebody left me a
comment like all something like all
creating a course or something like that
I forgot his name
this kid David basically saying like you
know now I'm gonna be just selling the
courses and I'm trying to make money
number one everybody that's here and
that signed up to the site about ninety
three percent of the people have signed
up through the five dollar special right
and I want you guys to be honest right
you're getting a good content right and
then from there when you sign up what I
get from my cut is three dollars all
right so you got a P credit card fees
you gotta pay taxes you gotta pay a lot
of extra right so I'll leave out of
there with three dollars am I trying to
become a millionaire with three dollars
per person let's be honest right the
only reason why I created this and I'm
gonna continue building this is number
one I want to get better as a instructor
I want to give you guys the best chance
to actually be successful right get out
there that's all I really want that's
number one number two I noticed almost
all of you guys have boy go steal coins
have bought Steven Grimes course because
I told you to you know those are the
best courses that work for me right so
what I say I said you know what I'm
gonna create my own thing because
another thing was I started making a
whole bunch of tutorials online but
nobody was doing them right when
something is free and you see on YouTube
you don't commit to it now if you go in
and you spend far out us three dollars
whatever you spent you committing to say
hey I'm gonna come in and I'm gonna take
this course I'm gonna do this tutorial
you know sign up for a reason that's
what I wanted because what I'm getting
back is basically not the money the
three dollars in shame you know what I
mean what I'm getting back is actually
seeing the data of who finish it right
so who finishes it
who's the ones that are actually taking
the courses like that's why I really
signed up for teachable you still have
that data and be able to know who
actually does the work because I know I
have a lot of subscribers but now
everybody wants to actually do the work
people want to hear oh this is how you
do it it's the easy way this is the way
to you know to be successful but nobody
wants to put in the work so the people
that this signup to my website they're
actually doing the courses and people
who were watching my tutorials who
didn't do it
now on the website because they spent
five dollars now they are doing it
because they trying to get their money's
worth right now what do I get out of
this I basically get that when I come in
and instead of me hanging out with my
wife instead of me hanging out with my
son
I get the happiness of knowing I'm
helping people out I'm doing these
videos for a reason people are actually
watching them and doing it and learning
from me that's all I'm getting that's
the reality of it that's exactly what
I'm doing this for I'm not doing it
to become a millionaire I could do other
 I have a music website that makes
more money than three for you
tools that I have here right I don't
make no money from this grant I
have other ways other avenues right so
what I'm getting is be able to hang out
with people like the other thing well
yesterday or the day before yesterday we
hang down to like two o'clock in the
morning you know just chilling talking
to other people who are trying to become
developers so that's what I'm doing it
you know it's like more like a way to
hold yourself accountable
meaning yes you come to this channel
because your boy got that sauce and you
you enjoy the channel but at the same
time I want you guys to leave here with
something leave here with you know a
skill to actually better your life right
so me putting on YouTube for free
only five people five six people take
advantage of it because number one is
free you be like oh I'll come back to it
later right but when you pay for
Holland's $3 whatever it is $10 $25
whatever it is right you basically say
hey I'm committing to this and I'm going
to learn right and that's all I wanted
you know because I know that people do
the course not because it's you
know they're paying for it I was putting
the same content online for free and
nobody wanted to do it right like
there's people who do it the some that
don't do it because it's a commitment
type of thing it's like there's certain
people's even even like right now let's
say an example if somebody will go like
let's say traversing media he has a lot
of views on all his videos he has great
videos of like tutorials out of all
those views who are the people that are
actually doing the tutorials because
there's a difference when you watch
something on YouTube and it's freeing
you like oh I'll come back to it there's
a big difference on who gets to actually
finish the projects I'm pretty sure all
on his head do onyx and courses or his
udemy courses that he has more people
complete them than here on YouTube
people go in and yeah you could get the
views but people on those platforms go
in and finish the courses or finish the
the tutorials so you get more of a
fulfillment of like okay I busted my ass
created this content that's gonna take
me hours and hours to make I'm getting I
and at least I know that people are
gonna do it I didn't want to continue
putting stuff on YouTube like tutorials
and stuff like that
that people are not gonna get
nothing out of it because people are
gonna watch it but then they're not
gonna do the work you know what I mean
like this holds people accountable
because you're putting in your investing
five dollars into yourself you're
basically saying hey I'm putting for
others and it's because I wanted to do
the work I tell people don't sign up for
the course if you're not gonna do the
workers then now you just pay five
dollars for no reason you know if you
want to support me you could donate it
directly to me but it's not for me it's
for you guys I'm Leticia for you guys to
actually start doing the work right now
as far as like you know like the courses
in sailing they're legit I'm
giving you guys exactly what you need to
get hired I don't want to give you guys
anything that's extra because anything
that's extra you're most likely going to
learn it at the job or you're gonna
learn it on your own once you already
have all the basic skills right so right
now finish the HTML CSS they're from
they're doing the JavaScript
future-proof and what I call the future
proof is because it is future proof I'm
teaching you guys everything that you
need to know for JavaScript it doesn't
matter if it's es6 es 7 es 8 doesn't
matter what comes up next right you're
gonna have the fundamentals to be able
to understand everything that's
happening with JavaScript and be able to
start building pages and you could just
get a job right that's the idea you know
and like just going back to the
competition there is no competition for
me I'm not here competing with nobody
from YouTube I literally been killing
the game I came into this game freaking
or running already you know there's
people here who've been here for two
three years and like come on
in six seven months I already got what
they got in a whole year and a half you
know what I mean like there's a reason
for it you know like I'm not worried
about nobody here you know it's just now
I have to you know do it smart be smart
with it I'm
I came into this game go watch my
original videos I came into this game of
YouTube with my arms open and just
kumbaya everything right and then
supporting everybody supporting all the
youtubers and promoting other peoples
and helping them out did that pay
off no because people just pretty much
came in infiltrators came in
it's like hey let me see how I can take
a little bit the sauce take whatever
he's doing implemented to my channel
don't do that that's my that's my
problem
don't do what I do I don't go in and and
make videos like the real tough candy
because that's her style right I don't
go in and just make tutorial videos I
didn't want to just make tutorial videos
because there's people who are already
successful at that and people already
find them by that right and so I didn't
want to do that just be like oh my my
channel is just tutorial videos or I
didn't want to come in and start doing
just coke adding me videos or free
cocaine videos because that's like a
no-brainer you know what I mean like you
you don't have to use your brain for
that like you have no originality
you don't have to come up with anything
different you're just basically going
through a free coke and some that's
already built for you and it's like
everybody here has done it at one point
you know what I mean I wanted to come in
do something completely different you
know be able to hang out with the
peoples be able to reach out people who
you know know me get to know me for who
I am not somebody who I'm trying to be
in front of a camera right now saying
you know and then like I said man a lot
of people just been taking a little bit
of this a little bit of that a little
bit of this and a little bit of that and
putting into their channels and
I'm like okay I'm supposed to just be
like cool great everybody everything
that I do people go and change
it just a
just a little bit just enough to not be
exactly a smash it and then just run
with it
you know what I mean so that's cool and
then I'm supposed to be happy about it
nah man just start being
original and like I said my only
competition because I already proved it
I already proved down
I'm already killing the game when it
comes to YouTube YouTube
I am a youtuber right I'm not a web
developer when I come here I do what
other major youtubers do like reach out
touch people's you know get them
invested into a channel that's what I do
a lot of these guys they don't do it
right they don't they don't have that
that's why their channels is just this
steel everything still so then they
start taking my sauce and then they see
a little bump and then I all wait so if
he's doing it and it works for him let
me try and then they start going up and
oh this just started working out so
now let's switch up what we do and then
let's just follow what he does you know
what I mean so that's my only problem
guys you know and I know the viewers
yeah like man we don't care about this
you know but like I say this channel is
about me this channel is about me
helping other people me sharing my
moments when I'm happy my moments when
I'm sad my moments when I'm upset my
moments where I just got a vent and just
let it be out you know that's what this
channel is about
no no so that's the thing man you know
that's all I wanted to sing number one
there's no competition I already passed
every single one of you and it's proving
go back to every single person's here
every other youtuber and watch their
very first month watch their very six
month the first six months in their
YouTube careers compare them to mine's
compared to what I've done here in seven
months
alright that's number one
there is no no competition at all
already past yeah now it's just a matter
of time of the algorithm to just you
know get that extra boost
once that extra boost goes like this is
a wrap you know what I mean like it just
happens right people are gonna be even
more mad and you're gonna see how people
start changing the channels how they do
things on their channel more and more
often because of whatever I do for some
reason it works unfortunately
unfortunately people don't don't want me
to be out here but it's going to work
because people can relate you know what
I mean it's like I mean I'm just a
little ass channel here right and
somehow I got multiple you know major
developers I'm not talking about you
know just freaking guys who are coming
up out of nowhere I got major developers
hitting me up got the view Jes developer
and the creator of you pissed I'm just a
regular youtuber right pissed for no
reason which means I'm affecting him
somehow right that's cool because it
shows the power that my channel has we
have should I even say these people
let's just say there's a couple of other
big youtubers who send me emails they're
like we love what you're doing you know
you know hopefully we color collaborate
get something working but I'm not gonna
put their names out there yet until we
record the videos right just so just to
get people pissed off right
you still get people even more pissed
off they're gonna be like wait but this
person has 300,000 subscribers why is he
recording with him that only got 7,000
there's something that I have and
something that I do on YouTube and I do
it pretty good you know what I mean
like I'm here for a reason people like
mush it for a reason kid you know so you
know what I mean like I'm making an
impact people were sending me emails
like yo they just saw your video and one
of somebody's courses like in somebody's
class for NYU somebody told me and send
me an email hey one of my professors put
your video well now we'll go you know in
our class you know one of my dreams was
to go to NYU and somehow I'm getting
played and my you like I don't know I
came from the bottom I didn't have no
money to go to the private school I
didn't have no money to go get the right
education and I have no money to even go
to college a four-year college I had to
go to a community college and different
community college I had to go to a City
College like I came from the bottom and
somehow I'm still there in spirit
you know what I mean I got people that
that wants me to show show up to a bunch
of meet up saying you know go do talks
yeah tell me out of the competition here
in YouTube who are getting that I'll
wait you know what I mean like I'll sit
there I'll be like that I have had a
video from scarce straight I will swing
for you at the dope you know what I mean
like it's not gonna happen they're not
getting that I'm doing something good
you know and I coming here I'm not even
you know I come here with the -
 little curtain the
shade this is my this used to be a
workout room but as you can see haven't
been working out you know like got the
the messed up closet door in the back
and somehow no-shave a t-shirt
and we make an impact right so
where is the competition my competition
is at unity the the guys who I look up
to Stephen grant coal steel right
there's no point of me coming here and
act like there's anything for me here on
YouTube as far as like other youtubers
because I I proved it a lot of people
 even the people that don't like
me they watch my channel because I give
cent videos where they throw
shade or they sing little things here
and there one like yeah that's true
and then like let's just other guy his
name's something whatever is 360 write
something 360 it's like I have no
problem with that do I don't even know
him somehow a while back somebody was
telling me you're they talking on
your own his whatever has a
Facebook group I go to the Facebook
group I'm like hey how you guys doing
who's talking about me and then prove
the guy wrong then from there somehow
I guess 360 block me from the
Facebook group which is hilarious I'm
like cool
you know what I mean like so there's a
lot of fake here you know it's just
hilarious to me you know what I mean
like there's people who just
they just don't like because there is a
certain sauce the sauce is not for
everybody you know what I mean the sauce
is not for everybody and it's not meant
for everybody you know the game is not
to be told the game is to be sold you
know me
so they could hate unfortunately people
got to see my face no matter what I'm
right in front of their faces I'm right
next to their videos they're like man we
don't want to see this Kay no more how
can we block them how can we get him out
there's no way
I'm like the People's Champ you know
what I mean like we here we're not going
away we're doing good we're doing a lot
of positive we're killing it with
the courses right now a lot of people
signed up at three dollars a pop it's
not that not that bad but I don't know
calculate 700 times 3 I think that's not
bad for my first month you know what I
mean and I'm doing this how I used
to be doing it before we're giving out
free courses no matter what so now we
can afford to continue giving out free
courses all right so isn't this is just
the first month so it gotta hurt them
they gotta just you know like they've
been doing this for years and they can't
get half of what I get when I drop a
video people will have almost a hundred
thousand subscribers and they drop one
video they get the same that I get
I only got seven thousand which means
the view rate compared to mine's
is the same and they got a hundred
thousand so imagine once I touch that
hundred thousand get that you
know that that video that video award
the YouTube award is gonna be like here
sir yes your YouTube or
you you basically killed it you did it
before everybody here I'm just gonna be
like I told you so
all right and then there's not gonna be
no more kumbaya
you know sucks for the other new
youtubers that might come later on but
then i'ma refer them to what happened
when I was her helping out other
people's out i'ma just be like listen
man I'm sorry
I might seem like a jerk I can't help
you promote your channel I can't help
you you know put you on my site on my
video I can throw you any viewers
because of what has happened from
before I help people out and then in the
back stab or talk or
no coming here and just take the sauce
and so unfortunately for them in the
future you know we won't be able to do
that collaboration but what's cool is
which I haven't told nobody I'm
branching out to with other youtubers
major youtubers now talking about guys
who do code because my channel is about
me and helping people out but at the
same time there's other people with
large audiences that sometimes they
think about it that I go they want to
better themselves and they want to do
something else so I'm gonna be the
introduction to like you know
programming and what development just to
get them in here
because there's people will think about
all minutes for smart people this for
this and that now my goal is to bringing
as much people as we can to this
community and just you know walk around
with that flag code and face just like
that no I mean so let's get a man right
it's Saturday man I know I hate out with
the a little quick rant a little quick
explanation you know rather be
transparent with people and tell them
the truth tell them like hey how much am
I making from the five dollars three
dollars credit card fees taxes three
dollars alright so right if you guys
think I'm gonna become a millionaire
with three dollars then you know there's
something wrong with you you know like
if you think I'm here because if I'm
trying to sell courses okay I guess with
three dollars off I'll come here I'll
get that Maserati for next year with
three dollars three dollars a person you
know what I mean so yeah
five hours a day after work come here
hang out with everybody come here and
chat come here on get her coming here on
discord come come everywhere right and
basically for three dollars come on like
we gotta just be honest here man like
sometimes I look at people I know it's
like 99% of my views is like we know
what you're doing Joe you good you don't
have to tell us night but I like to just
be transparent you know what I mean I
rather be transparent and tell people
what it is so when some idiot comes in
and be like oh you're just trying to
sell some courses do become rich
then you guys who watch this video
Yahoo explain to him like he makes three
 dollars if you gotta become a
 millionaire with three dollars
you tell me especially when this
community is so small like it's not it's
not it doesn't make a big difference
like if I was like a video game channel
right who has millions and millions of
subscribers then yes at $3 you make a
lot of money but seven hundred people $3
each
that's like not that much trust me all
right
so anyways before anything I just hang
out a little bit on the chatroom I want
to see who's in a chatroom right now oh
we're discord everybody gotta jump to
this core now
got your boy snugs man got your boy
snugs man shake that boy out man he's

I don't know that's a real last name or
I don't know say Salada
we're missing who else is in here
Erika miles Erica what up Erica
you missed the beginning let me sum it
up
number one there's no competition
YouTube I looked at everybody compared
to every single channel every single
channel that matters compared it to
mine's their first six months is nowhere
even close to mine's where we are it's a
whole different game right we're in a
whole different level right I now like
to show off but now we're here now it's
time to show off and you know shut some
people down you know cuz that's what we
do a man like and then number two it was
if some people think that I'm trying to
like become a millionaire from
selling courses and this and that and
that's not true the idea behind is
people basically finish the courses when
they have to pay for it right so I'm
putting in a lot of hours into this so
if I'm putting a lot of hours I want
people to do it right now when it's free
on YouTube people be like oh I'll get
back to it and did they forget about it
but when you come in and you say hey I'm
gonna buy courses because you're
dedicating that you want to learn how to
become a web developer so that's the
idea behind it right so and I make three
dollars out of every course so I'm not
trying to become a millionaire for three

see what else what else well got your
boy flamin here man it's good to see
flame flame is one of those people that
I like seeing when he comes here because
he gives an honest opinion when I was
seeing him you know this something he
disagrees with me and this sounds that
he agrees with me right
but at the same time he's not an asshole
with it you know what I mean he still
comes here shows love you know for a
while he disappeared he you know I will
see him some places else you know
somewhere else
and I was like man what happened to
fling man you know I was like I like
seeing his comments here because I've
been dropping some cool videos where I
know he would have disagreed with but at
least we could have a conversation you
know what I mean so I like it when he's
here and I taught it to everybody you
can come in and disagree with me I don't
care you know we're just gonna have a
regular conversation I'm gonna give you
my points you're gonna give me your
points and that's a kumbaya and we just
hug it out that's it they is not
that serious it's cold you know
what I mean it's like I'm not gonna
 kill somebody because it's like
you were supposed to use an h1 and you
use a stool I'm not gonna argue
for some like that you know what I
mean I don't take this to the heart

why Joe is one of three people that
knows the coca-cola secret sauce oh let
me see who else the thing here man we
got j-roc J roster oh we got a lot of
people in here a lot of new people we
got 57 people in here you know this is
great guys look we got 51 people I want
everybody here to give this a thumbs up
give this a thumbs up just so other
people could find a channel just going
under view click a thumbs up it's gonna
cost you nothing is free guys it's if
this a thumbs up just because just
to make sure that other people get to
find this channel you know it's good
let me see who else is in here we got I
met mad must so C Mon Susie that's how
you say um admit I'd met I suck when it
comes to like Middle Eastern names I
stuck you know I met ah
it's like a certain way to say I met I
met I can say I'm sorry
I suck who else is in here
who else of course boy snugs also else
bees look like a caveman
Erica Myles is like yo is nothing wrong
with the tongue Claire does man
you know Jeffrey said even if intentions
were to become millionaire what the
courses was the problem is that stealing
or playing the lottery I can call it
jealousy man yeah now those people there
are definitely jealous of course but if
I wanted to sell the courses like a
higher price that's what I would be
doing you know what I mean
if I wanted to become a
millionaire or whatever just make a
higher pay that's what I would be doing
I wouldn't be charging $5 right in the
only reason I'm charging $5 is because
that was the minimum that I could do
right so if now what I left it I got $2
and some like that
cuz I just want all my subscribers I'll
be honest I don't care for the people
that find my website nothing that don't
care but if they pay full price whatever
but then my subscribers the people are
fun from YouTube I'm happy if they just
pay $2 $3 I'm fine with that because
then that covers the how you call it
covers the the fee $100 that I gotta pay
for for that website it cause $100 to be
hosting all that right so it's not
free so I'm still paying for it you know
what I mean but yeah man Eric it's like
you know thanks for the thanks for the
recap I know I'm a little late on the
messages but I'm reading it everybody's
message I'm actually I'm actually
interested in era what everybody's
thinks about this video or what I said
or whatever you know if I'm gonna buy
the big bottle of brand I want to

something right now

without money in your pocket man you you
know what I mean like you gotta have

let me see who else
was this in here dance puppet dance
finally you changed your icon dance
puppet because you keep having girls on
your icon man and you a grown-ass man I
always find that weird where we do
got the best community right now
let me see let me see let me see who
else is in here
no no way mid or not didn't break up I
didn't see that I don't think they broke
up there's no way they broke up and I am
Petty said me Dorian and Christian broke
up I don't think so
there's no way they look so good
together who's my favorite youtuber well
I will say there's a lot of fake people
here and that's the thing I don't like a
lot of people because they're fake
the channels are fake they don't give
your content or they don't give you
that's original they copy from other
people but I'll give it my top three I'm
giving my top today I'll give you I give
you Chris Hawkes I will put him on my
number one because he has good content
he talks about that other people
are not talking about like he don't go
on other people's channels and see oh
everybody's talking about this content
let's talk about that content you know
he don't know he don't do that so I
like his content is original he gives
his own opinions he's like me he curses
on the videos because it's just more
genuine it's just like how you feel you
know so I like that by him in the
beginning I had a little problem with
him because he didn't do
how you go - collaborations but then I
realized now that I feel like now I'm in
a position like him and now I realized
why he didn't want to do a collaboration
with me at that point right because now
I understand he probably got burned by
uh somebody else or he saw other people
copying his or other people trying
to take his audience and like that
so now I realize why he didn't want to
do it so I gave him a pass right and I
like his content you know definitely we
got who was I like level up touch
he's legit his content is really
good and very clear and very clear to
explain things and then my third one
would be uh I like Christians channel to
see what he's but doesn't think I'm in
the fence with Christians channel when
it comes to web development because I go
more to Christian for the vlogs and the
things that he does on the daily or what
he's he's doing but I don't go there for
like the web development side because
more most of his his things are more for
like people who are getting in and like
I'm more of a senior developer already
like so I don't know I go there because
of him
of what he brings in to the table which
is a vlog of a web developer and I enjoy
that right so I like his channel let me
see who else that's it that's my top
three you know there's a lot of other
people that like but if I had to pick
three I'll pick those three cuz they're
doing something completely different
than everybody else and of course the
real casted arrow and tough candy that
will be like my top five you know but
yeah
yeah I don't even know I didn't know
that that him in Midori broke up sorry
sorry Chris
I mean it I didn't know see now I gotta
watch his videos I haven't watched I was
catching up on his videos this week but
