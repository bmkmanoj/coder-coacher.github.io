joke back out of the game encoding
face.com your boys back and out and did
it again alright today's topic is going
to be hey Joe
I'm trying to prepare myself to become a
freelancer now 2018 what should I do
what are some tips that you can give me
well first of all you know start
cleaning up your your LinkedIn page just
start cleaning up your your portfolio
just polish it up right polish it up a
little bit if you learned a couple of
new things in the past two three months
post it up online right share that to
the world right if you did some some
cool project that you're very proud of
share it on your portfolio you know I've
noticed people who who have like really
good skills but then you look at their
portfolio and they don't have all the
things that they know for some reason I
understand sometimes we're busy we're
building applications with building
things out there and we don't have time
to you know keep on updating our
portfolio every single time and that's
fine I definitely understand that but
you know whenever you're gonna start
getting new clients you want to show
them like the best of the best you don't
want to show them something that you
think eight nine months ago and you're
actually a way better developer now and
you know like let's say you did
something in in March right but you know
you did a whole bunch of stuff between
September to December and like a whole
bunch of new projects like shuttle
shoulders or new projects man don't just
wait so like last minute be like oh you
know what maybe I'll clean up my my
portfolio maybe I'll start you know
polishing it up like nah man start doing
as soon as you finish that project
post on your portfolio like okay I just
finished this this is something I'm
proud of you get what I'm saying also to
man
you know start looking into getting
contracts contracts are very important
right look online for freelancers
contracts for freelancers contracts for
web developers because a lot of times
you know we forget about this like let's
say somebody comes up
you let's say word-of-mouth you got a
new client right and that new client
comes in and he wants something like
let's say a website right something that
you could do with WordPress or if you
want something more complex something
you could do with laravel all right put
everything in the scope right put
everything in a contract where you can
say hey man I'm doing this this website
is gonna have user authentication it's
gonna have some categories for their
blogs etc whatever it is right but keep
it in a scope write write it down in a
contract that ya both agree and say hey
this is gonna cost you know two thousand
three thousand dollars to get done I'm
gonna get it done in three weeks or
however long you you think is gonna take
you keep that in the contract right
because there's people out here who be
you know scope where's the scope
creeping like that actually for one
thing and they pay you for for that
thing right and then the next thing that
you know they're like hey man could we
uh can we add a forum can we add like
you know some comments functionality can
we add you know like a dashboard where I
could see all my Google Analytics on the
back end and it's like you know it's
gonna take more time but you're not
looking to pay more so you know keep it
in the scope man so get ready for 2018
because you're gonna bump into a lot of
clients like that all right now another
thing too is start looking in the right
places man like let's say for example
you find a a good website out there
personally I think for somebody like me
if I wanted to get back into freelancing
I will go to Larry Jobs Larry Jobs has a
lot of different companies posting you
know remote jobs that they need
developers to to work with them you know
doing Larry Bell and that's what I tell
you guys like especially if you like
International if right now I got a lot
of people from England you've got a lot
of people from you know South Africa I
got people from Nigeria Philippines like
guys you guys need to start looking into
those type of websites
Larry Jobs was a remote remote jobs okay
I think that's the name of it removed
jobs okay that I oh no check on Stack
Overflow Stack Overflow has a nice
remote area where all the jobs there are
remote start looking into those websites
man and start applying like just because
you think like oh man it says three to
five years I'll be honest with you guys
a lot of this companies don't know if
you have three to five years if you have
a portfolio that's legit it doesn't
matter it's like people look at people's
portfolio and see their skills and
realize that I hate we could hire this
guy you know sometimes it's not about
how many years you've been on if you
know how to present yourself in a way
where you look like a professional you
know what I'm saying
like you don't have to be just like one
one year you know what I'm saying
so yeah man so it's crazy
that's what all muffle got lost right
there yeah so definitely look into that
man try to try to get you know get your
skills up you know show your skills and
find the right places man you got to do
research for 2018 man like I'll be
honest you can't expect things to just
fall on your lap and just feel at all
cool like life is gonna be easy it's
just not you know what I mean like you
just have to put in that that time and
put in those hours of doing research
finding the right websites finding the
right clients oh you know fixing up your
portfolio cleaning up your LinkedIn you
know doing networking sometimes you know
just networking is better than anything
else out there you don't sound like
sometimes you could go in and actually
you know find better clients then you
will find on any website just from
networking you know somebody might
recommend you that you didn't even know
that they had connections to like let's
say an example you get our connection to
somebody who owes multiple businesses so
now you have that client there right you
have that client where pretty much you
could be like hey I'll do one of your
websites if you like it I'll continue
doing more websites for you and now from
there on you could charge for
maintaining it you do the website once
and then every time that the person
comes in and say hey could you change
the menu $45 just to change the menu
like I do that all the time to people
you know hopefully none of the clients
that I have look at this it'll be like
something that takes two seconds I mean
I out $45 you gotta say like yeah this
is your time it doesn't matter if for
example if that that thing that they
want to change only takes you 10 minutes
hey man I don't charge by minutes I
charge by hour so anything between zero
minutes to 60 minutes give me you know
45 give me 60 you get what I'm saying
like depending on the client you can't
hit people in the head either but you
gotta know who you charge it you gonna
say like you got to know who-who
to charge and how to charge those people
because let's say you know somebody who
who was actually it's a small business
they don't make that much money
you're not gonna hit them in the head
because it's better to keep them there
let's say somebody that you maintain
that web saying all they give you is
twenty five thirty dollars an hour
that's fine
keep them there because those people
always come back but let's say somebody
that it's a big company and they they
come in and but are we gonna pay you $60
an hour
cool the charges $60 an hour but they're
only gonna hire you that one time hit
them in the head
those people you gotta hit them in the
head automatically because you know damn
well they're not coming back you know
there's people that they just they're
finding you know different developers
for different situations like let's say
an example they have one area which is
actually in in JavaScript rank for
example it's a they have a dashboard and
angular and they hire you to do some
changes on angular most likely they're
not gonna hit you up for like a year two
years after that so if you only gotta
get that one job from them make sure you
hit them in the head right charging them
accordingly and be like hey man I know
this is not gonna be a repeat business
so pretty much this hot how much I'm a
charge eighty five dollars an hour you
know what I'm saying like you gotta know
how to do this how to run your own
business over for 2018 man especially
when you're doing this thing freelancing
like freelancing is it's like you know
it's like back in the days and medieval
days where people get to barter things
to be like hey man I got a goat's ear
can you build my website like people is
gonna come up to you with crazy ideas
like that like hey man look at how can
you build me a Facebook with $300 like
some people is gonna try to hit you with
that you know so it's like it's up to
you to decide if you want to take those
jobs but yeah man those are the things
that I could say for 2018 my tips for
2018 like if you gotta get into

never be working for a company or
freelancing if you're going to be making
the same money every time that you
switch up on careers or switch up
blowing on different companies like you
need to multiply that it doesn't matter

2 multiplied by by 3 you got to multiply
