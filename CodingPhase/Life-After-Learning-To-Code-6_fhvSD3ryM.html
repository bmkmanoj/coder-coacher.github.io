coding Frank's calm listen I want to
welcome you guys to my course I know how
to code now what what happens after you
know how to code what happens when you
you know you work so hard over the past
few months and you're like okay cool I
know how to code I know HTML I know CSS
I know how to basically take a design
build a web page I know how to go and
create some interaction with the
elements on the page with JavaScript I
know how to mess around with the backend
I know how the whole ecosystem work
right what do I do now basically that's
what we're gonna go into all right life
after learning to code that's what this
course is about I know you guys are
gonna get a lot out of this course
because I'm basically going to give you
guys everything that you guys need
everything from the beginning to the end
alright just to make sure that you guys
get it to have a very successful life
after you learn how to code because
what's the point of learning how to code
what's the point of you know becoming a
really good developer if you can't get
nothing out of me really all these hours
are supposed to pay off right but they
only pay off if you do the right things
and if you have a plan before you throw
yourself out there all right so you have
preparation we're gonna talk about the
projects that you need the portfolio how
you portfolio you're supposed to look
we're gonna talk about your github we're
going to talk about social media pretty
much you want to be part of the
community and you want to show that to
employers and future clients all right
now we're talking about choosing the
right lane which one should you go
should you do freelancing should you do
company work should you do remote work
like which lane should you work on right
which lane should be your first step
we're definitely gonna go into that
we're gonna do pros and cons of both of
them and then from there we're gonna
have a section for each one
okay so pretty much we're gonna talk
about freelancer lane
you know sites to find clients - for
freelancers how to charge for your
services and many more things that are
going to be added to that section all
right then we're gonna talk about the
company link where to find jobs dealing
with recruiters they won't do a research
on the company how to pass the interview
how to get the best salary salary versus
benefits because this is very important
this is one of those things was like hey
who cares if they're gonna give you
$100,000 worth of of money but in
reality with rent with all the payments
that you gotta pay it and everything in
reality it's not almost it's almost
nothing you're making the same amount of
money as somebody who lives in you know
middle of America getting $40,000 a year
just because it says $100,000 doesn't
mean your quality of life is gonna be
better so we're gonna go into all of
that right so another thing too that is
very important is an exit plan what is
an exit plan and why do you need one
right just because you learn how to code
you because you love this doesn't mean
10 years 15 years 20 years from now
you're going to be loving the same
things alright so you always gotta have
an exit plan for everything doesn't
matter what you do if you were musician
you need to have an exit plan what
happens once you you don't have that hit
song alright like those are things that
you have to have in the back of your
mind and there's a certain way that you
can set yourself up for so having a
successful life after coding you know
because yeah you could code you're
always gonna be a developer but at the
end of the day you don't know what's
gonna happen five years from now ten
years from now 15 years from now 20
years from now but if you have a plan
something set up then you're going to be
fine alright cool alright so at the end
we're just gonna have a last video which
is gonna be a conclusion all right now
like I said this is gonna be videos May
4
seven minutes to 20 minutes so might be
even longer all right so you're gonna
get a lot for your money the money that
you're gonna spend in this course you're
definitely gonna get everything back
because in reality these are things that
you know it's like an insider I'm like

where I've been from the beginning as
self-taught I've made it to the top
