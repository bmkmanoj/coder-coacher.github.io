here with Dave Chang we had a little
technical difficulties but now we live
you guys can definitely hear us and
we're gonna be here with chili mints
so yeah Dave so what you were saying you
you starting like in 2013 and basically
um you drop one video your friends were
like yo man you got to drop that
knowledge online man now I guess like
they're just saying like I cuz I had a
like I'd like a good mix I guess like
some of my homies are like non-technical
other ones are like I would a lot of my
colleagues at old companies so I guess
sometimes just like you know you got to
describe random things or like like
what's this mean should I like get more
memory or something or get a faster
processor so it's just like explaining a
bunch of this stuff and they're saying
yeah you should just make a video so I
tried it out I think the first one
surprised me a little bit it got like a
thousand views or something I'm like oh
dang that's kind of good and then I
didn't think much of it but slowly I
just started like thinking like - well
like put content up on here it's like
useful stuff that happens to me and my
friends so I would just like like start
uploading more and more and I try to
keep it like a balance between like raw
tech stuff maybe some more life stuff or
like career stuff but yeah so people
seem to enjoy it so far so I'm happy to
do it and it no it's just like the least
I can do to help out you know no that's
not that's hot man it's like me too it's
like my first video is kind of funny is
just like me like talking about like I
don't know I like Matt uncomfortable
because you know like the first time you
record you're like super uncomfortable
number one to me I was like man I just
don't want to sound like super nerdy and
like like I don't know my voice might
sound good or like whatever I was like
man even if I'm gonna do this so I was
just like I'm gonna make a video about
why people should do and get into like
what develop and it's like it's like
super awkward
I feel like looking back on it I was
like so
if cuz that's not really Who I am I'm
like I'm like you know it's just I'm
listening to the damn like damn man this
is crazy this is my first video people's
gonna come back to three years from now
and be like there look at his first
videos like he's masked if math scared
of the camera and stuff yeah that's all
good I was like the first time I had to
edit something I was just like looking
feeling so awkward like it's a little
better I been like never be a hundred
percent used to it but it gets a little
even this like live stuff like usually I
like edit record my stuff I don't go
live very often so it's like people are
listening real I'm just a little crazy
where began the you know the the live
they sang right now it's rare right this
is rare moment right now for the
hypebeast this is a rare moment for you
guys right now
Limited Edition we-well yeah they've so
long I mean when do you start coding I
mean when was the first time that you
started getting into this thing
ah dang I like I was dabbling it first
time I think I took this C course you
know I was like 10th grade or 11th grade
high school so there's like I think
there's like a couple classes my highest
well not too many my highest was pretty
standard like chemistry biology like
whatever and then there was one program
this one guy was teaching like I think
seeing in Java and I took it and I just
when like in high school went way over
my head I remember like I couldn't like
finish I just didn't get it I like it
was tough to fathom back then actually
like had my mom help me on like all this
homework because she's like my mom's a
software computer science well so she
used to help me and then like I don't
think I still got it
and then I just unaware my apply to
engineering school and then that's when
I started kind of slowly started like
clicking because I was doing it like
24/7 in college but I first got exposed
to it in high school just very little
bit but I didn't like it didn't like
click back then it's just like this this
stuff's not hard I don't really get it
so that was my first taste of it and
College was when I first started
realizing like you know what it could do
what all the stuff kind of meant how it
flowed together and all this stuff so
that's cool man it I mean let's talk a
little bit about that I actually heard
that in one of your videos that your mom
is actually into you know software
engineering and you know like she knows
this stuff it's like how how was like
that you know not to go too deep into
your personal life but how was that like
you know it's like I find that like so
cool it's like hey your mom got
superpowers okay you know what I mean is
like mom is out there some ways like
clicking it it's like I got the dig yes
it's crazy when I think about it but
actually it's still like I don't know
it's like she's still like like my
parents they keep like the professional
personal stuff a little separate so I
don't really like I've never seen her in
the workplace it's just like as a side
thing all I happen to know how all this
stuff works so it's always surprising
when I hear it
but it's really like not she didn't
bring it like back home or it didn't
like force it upon me or anything like
that it's just like oh you could check
this out you might like this like my dad
is like he's into pharmaceutical stuff
so he was saying like oh you should be a
doctor I'm like I don't know if I'm to
be a doctor mimosa try this programming
thing all right give it a try but listen
like there wasn't like a big influence
of that or it wasn't like she was like
oh yeah you got a like learn about
computers all the time she's just like a
pretty standard like Asian mom maybe
like studying that stuff so like yeah I
wonder because I'm like I just had a son
and I'm like man I want him to start
coding like right away I'm like listen
man if you take this toy and you put
this toy here that's like what happens
what's the if statement on this kid he's
like seven months he's just like looking
at me like okay that you know but I'm
definitely
I don't know I'm definitely trying to
push my son into it but you know how it
is when you push somebody into something
to probably be like I just yeah yeah
exactly I got pushed into like I'm sure
you got the same I got pushed into mad
stuff like mm-hmm I think played the
piano
that like stuff like yeah that's like
the ironic part like they push you and
then you don't like it and somehow you
might find it yourself and then it like
clicks you know so pregame and I mean
how long you I mean when will you say
your career as a developer start ii like
what year i mean i know you went to
college and graduating i mean how long
was it before you had your first job as
a developer yeah like i guess first real
i have like i guess and i look back on
it it's pretty standard like went to
college got a job after i think i
graduated end of 2009 so my first like
full-time job was tooth out like early
2010 like february 2010 mmm that's
already eight years or something but or
that i had some like internships i don't
think they count it's like really small
busy work like I think when I was a
sophomore in junior had like middle
internships I I guess I was still doing
a little bit of coding but internships
like so different from a full-time job
you're really not held accountable to
too many things so those summers I was
like just learning a little bit of web
development like learning I think what
some where I learned sequel the other
summer I did like some MATLAB app stuff
mmm good Oh MATLAB yeah remember those
days yeah I think 2010 my first job was
the first time it was more like I guess
professional like we had some deadlines
there was like performance reviews we
got a like right like production level
code or whatever so yeah I think like
that was right after colleges when I
when I started so it's been about eight
but eight years for me I guess mm-hmm
well he is not as that's good man I mean
for me I started dabbling into it like a
fourteen like just copy pasting you know
pages you know looking at the source
code of of a page but I
really get into I got like sidetracked
to like probably 21 22 around there so I
will say like in reality since 2012 like
I will say after 2012 that's when I I
really became my god call myself a
developer you know I am I'm more self
taught I actually went to school for
programming in systems first degree and
it was more like IT stuff like I have
one C++ class which the teachers didn't
even want to teach it it's like the
teacher is like way is like we gotta do
C++ but it's like you know it's a really
old language I don't know if you guys
really want to learn this I'm like wait
this is C++ it's like you're supposed to
teach it and the guy is like okay
whatever and then all my other classes
were just like connect this printer
connect this a network administrator
thing like I hated windows from the
beginning of time yeah yes I don't even
know how I went to school for random
were to school for communication design
cuz I was like you know what I'm just
gonna become a web designer and then
when I finished school I started going
to internships I'm like man I hate
designing like you know what I mean this
is like this such a long process before
anything even gets through that is like
I Riley just freakin go back to what I
was really wanted to do which was like
coding so from there I just started
learning on my own online and just you
know started going hard alright so you
did that like well you you did that like
after work or you just did that at
nights like umm yeah it was like in
between work and then at some point I
quit my job and what I did I was like I
was literally like a bum for like six
months like I was still living with my
mom's I was probably I think like 24 I
was living with my mom and I was like
man I just got somehow making like I
can't go into an office to be an IT
worker I don't want to be a designer
because I hated it so I was like man now
I just gotta somehow do it so then I
just started like going through every
resource that you could think of online
just to learn all of this stuff but at
the end it worked
you know it wasn't that hard you know
now looking back at him like this was
pretty easy pretty hindsight the
hindsight we like sometimes forget like
all that time it's well yeah yeah so
it's like also too I mean for you I mean
you went to school you would you studied
computer science or alright my school
yeah they called it electrical Computer
Engineering it was like ECE was like the
acronym for it but it's pretty much it's
like a huge it's like a very general
major at my school and then you could
kind of pick and choose the different
classes and kind of specialize so some
people did a little more computer
engineering some people did a little
more computer science other people did
more like circuits electrical stuff but
they purposefully made it like super
broad and then you just like everyone
comes out of it a little different it's
like how does that people get the same
degree on paper but everyone kind of
knows different things so it's really
based on the classes we took at least
for my program is very like open-ended
so mmm I did it pretty basic computer
science courses like just like
fundamental stuff like nothing - nothing
too crazy back then so that's cool right
so I mean as far as like you know
because a lot of the people that are
here Oh most of them are you know
self-taught developers and I you know
wanted to pick your brain I mean you
know to give them like a look into it
like you know for somebody who actually
went to school you know did the whole
engineering courses and you know as far
as that like do you feel that um
like how much out of your that your
degree do you think like you got your
money's worth because it that's always
my thing like when like when I went to
school I probably I think I got like 30%
of like good courses that I could say
this is the things I could use till this
date and then the rest was like
psychology of freaking English 101 102
103 but you know what I mean yeah yeah
yeah I think like I don't know the this
same they like made us do
like electives and stuff because like
every semester you can only take so many
engineering courses you keep like
because if you take too many Oh problem
they're too hard so you probably like
warranty very well but yeah it's
definitely what what you chose like
makes a big difference I think I
probably got like 40 50 % like looking
back on it I probably wanted to take
like different classes like stuff I
learned after school like I realized oh
that was a good class I could have taken
in school like there's one class on like
networking like I have really like basic
knowledge on like how networks work but
there was like a cool class I remember I
just never signed up for it called
networks there's one like with compilers
some crazy stuff yeah but like like
honestly like some of my friends they
love the academic vibe they can like
stay in school they stay there graduate
school get a PhD postdoc whatever you
can stay there just take class after
class after class but after a while you
there's like I think people all feel
comfortable like alright I can kind of
be productive now and then they just try
to learn everything on the own electing
their work in the workplace and stuff
but I think the major part of school is
like it's risky because you gotta like
I'd use your time as best you can but as
long as it leads to like it's like a
good step at least as long as it gives
you like one step towards something else
whether that's a job or enabling you to
do something else I think it's worth it
like I don't think it's useable to think
it's like 100 percent efficient it's
never gonna be like 100 percent amazing
like academically there's gonna be like
no takers
take advantage of it as best you can and
it should at least give you one more
step into some sub direction or
something that's what I think so yeah no
I definitely I myself I'm thinking about
you know at some point I'm probably just
gonna go back to school either online or
I don't know maybe if I find like the
right school close to me to go to a
computer science degree now because for
work related but because I feel like at
some point like in the future I would
like to be like you know teaching
somewhere you know at a college or high
school or something
and just to have that deer is definitely
gonna help me out even though I've seen
a lot of people that told me as I came
in if you have like a 10 year 20 year
plus career like a lot of professors do
some of the professors not all of them
some of the professors don't even have a
degree they just like hey man this is my
solid resume after 20 years I've worked
at this company this company's company
and it's like you go through the whole
process you could probably get in I know
from my mom is a teacher and my dad's a
college professor so it's like they let
me know like a couple of the tricks
behind the scenes well yeah man now
that's cool man and I I mean right now I
mean what do you do you do more software
the the web do you do
iOS Android right now it's pure software
now so like I just do saw web web
programming like pretty pretty standard
stuff I'm not gonna it's not like too
crazy I think a lot of the tough parts
or like other aspects of it but like
like non-technical aspects but I think
right now I'm just writing software it's
all web-based the stack is like Java
pretty like standard like language but
yeah I can go into like details of the
stack or anything it's just like web
programming you know pretty standard
stuff there's like a ton of javascript
tested in all these different browsers
there's like data you got to manage
right now I focus more on kind of like
the application like product building
and they're all this infrastructure IT
stuff is kind of handled for me thank
God cause it's like I work at like work
at a like medium-size kind of not big
but like medium sized company now so
there's a much more division in teams so
there's like oh you guys handle that
feature you guys handle that you guys
handle infrastructure you guys handle
security I think before I was working at
a couple startups where you got to kind
of do everything so I got a little bit
of a taste of that it was small but now
it's big so I just work in a little bit
more of a silo it's more
after all it's like a little slower but
it's cool and then yeah it's like just
web programming so you go into like more
details about that if you want you know
you know especially I mean you guys have
a with the Java back-end I know a few
more friends that they have in their
companies they work with Scala so I mean
it's pretty close to like Java but um I
haven't had the chance to work in any
company with a Java back-end I mean how
is that I mean I'm more like a Ruby on
Rails laravel yeah rails is cool I use
that at my last job - I think Java is
more like it's built to be used by like
I think originally was built to be used
by enterprises right I think Ruby on
Rails is more like you got to really get
in there know what you're doing you can
like customize things a lot I think
Java's are much more like deliberate
verbose it's a compiled language so I
think it's almost like I call it like
design for dummies it's like you got you
got like a thousands of people working
on this project you don't want like a I
know a thousands of people hacking away
at Ruby or something it's kind of like
job is a very safe like well-documented
you know you can't mess it up you know
it's kind of just like we've got a
thousand people working on this what's
like the safest thing to do if you're
like a company managing like a billion
dollar so you gotta spend it on all this
software just like try to make like safe
safe and stable decisions so if you want
to be like safe stable no no weird stuff
happening then like job is a good bet
because it's been around so long you
know it's easy to learn it's like you
can't you can't mess up too badly unless
you really try hard and then yeah it's
uh yeah it's like I think it's just like
good it's really accessible you know you
could be a beginner or maybe a little
more advanced but still you can get your
job done with it so I know there's some
other languages where so you got to be
pretty like maybe high level to get into
those language mm-hmm like but yeah I
think Java is like a safe consistent and
it just works so that's why they chose
it
now that's cool man definitely I mean I
myself am like sometimes I've dabbled in
I pretty much have dabbled in every
single programming language out there
like I've touched every single one of
them as I came in but you know it's cool
because it's like at the same time is
like you know what's cool about Java
that I think a lot of people sleep on
it's like there's so many jobs and so
many opportunities like you could be
doing like software and you could be
doing web you could it's like a old
general-purpose language and like it is
pretty solid like if you go to a company
that they're using Java you know from my
senses it's like that net it's like one
of those languages that well frameworks
or programming languages like C sharpen
and you know Java where it's like you
know this companies they they're not
there to play games it's like everything
is already set up or for you especially
how you just said like you know there's
different teams which is great I'm
pretty sure you you've done a couple of
freaking startups where it's like
there's like three guys and those three
guys gotta handle this massive company
of like doing everything one guy does
the front end he does the back end he
does the databases is like you know it's
so much better when you work in a team
where it's like okay everybody has a
specific role yeah yeah yeah I think
it's good like to have well if you're
like if you're like three people there's
only like so much you can do and it's
good to like dabble and like all the
languages I agree that like if you're
for like job prospects there's that
there's always gonna be stuff that like
you know shines a little better or like
you know having Java your resume is
definitely gonna get you past a couple
filters from recruiters or something
like that but I think like for me like I
when I started web programming I was a
little I was working like a little bit
more like a silo and I didn't like it as
much actually my firt when I first
started I was doing like mobile apps
like iOS stuff so I didn't really worry
about the backend too much I was just
like you know writing the app making
sure things look nice like getting all
the design nice but I wasn't happy with
that at first because I didn't know how
the whole
thing works like - I think if you want
to get that big picture idea you got to
build like something from scratch but
even if it's small but building like
every single layer from scratch up and
like from like like starting up your
little Linux machine the cloud all the
way to serving like react code like
everything that whole thing if if you
just try that once like doing it all
yourself I think it's a good experience
so after I did that for a few years on
my guard it's a little crazy I'm I'm not
at least I know how the system works so
I can go back to a silo would be a
little more comfortable because like now
it's like I don't want to worry about
like Linux administration all that
security stuff I can just write code and
I'm chill but it's still good to go
through that experience at least once if
you haven't done it before I think so
yeah that's really good that you brought
that up because I was just making a
video about this yesterday where I was
telling people basically out there alive
- I was telling people like hey man you
can't be scared of the back end because
a lot I have my own website where I have
my you know my own courses and and I
also recommend people to udemy courses
that I have worked for me things that I
see that I know could work for people um
and I was like you know looking through
the data because that's the best thing
about having a website you know
sometimes when you have YouTube you
can't really find the all the
information that you want that's the
main reason why I made my website so I
could find out what people wanted you
know what exactly is it that they want
to learn so I notice I'm like I have
over 2,000 members on my website and
then on the website I realized that it's
about 80 percent eighty to ninety
percent of the people just focus on the
front end like for some reason they just
bypass like whatever is the back end
they like I just don't want to touch it
and it's like you have to know the back
end at least or want back in language
and build one application from start to
finish just how you say everything from
building it yourself setting up your
database setting up your migration
setting up or the whole process of you
know let's say a digital
Oh sing a droplet right or AWS go
through the whole process so you can
understand what's going on because when
you go to a company you get hired you
might come in and be like hey you're the
front-end guy but you need to know what
happens with the back end what exactly
this guy's gonna do how he's gonna send
you a REST API and how he's setting up
the database so you have to acknowledge
you don't want to be there and get
higher and be like I've never seen the
back end all I do is HTML CSS and
JavaScript is like they're gonna look at
you like you crazy it's like it's better
it's better to be prepared than to be
like oh now we got a train the guy the
new guy you know what I mean yeah yeah
yeah I totally totally agree like I
think JavaScript or front end I think
it's more like it's it's like more most
tangible so I think it makes sense that
people gravitate towards it first I
think like that's what you see and like
that's what you can like learn and I can
actually like make a change see
something different so I think it's good
to like just give people a little taste
of stuff but yeah I agree like if you
want to be truly effective like back in
or front end like even you got to know a
little bit of front-end
- if you want to write like effective
back-end it goes like both ways it's
like you can't ignore if your back-end
person can't be like oh yeah like eff
JavaScript that's left slack you have to
like appreciate all of it so you can do
your part well you know it's like get a
taste of all of it so I think that's
what like the most effect that
developers do they really have a good
like control or sense of how it all fits
together so they can do their part but
the best so yeah man and also - I was
gonna ask you me what are you excited
about like in now 2018 like what what
have you seen like in the industry now
like you know framework or language or
any sod project that got you excited um
this is cool yeah yeah I mean these days
a lot of stuff is trending I got to read
up on read up on it more I mean I've
been like a lot of my friends are so
into this AI stuff I've been like I took
some of the classes online I'm not like
a master at it I mean I
a couple classes I took like a Coursera
one but we'll see I think like it's I'd
be interested to see like how people can
really make like some of these new
technologies that are they're still like
prototype right now like truly effective
like like maybe like cryptocurrency like
I don't know blockchain is going to be
the next big thing with everything but I
can see in the future where our
currencies digital somehow so like I
still don't know what it is because
right now there's like a mix of stuff
like you got some really cool
cutting-edge things that people want to
prototype and talk about like AI and
blockchain and all this stuff but then
you still have a lot of legacy stuff
that I think isn't going anywhere like
web program you around a lot last time
and it's not gonna go anywhere it's like
always gonna be like that so like that
paradigm actually hasn't changed like
you see all these new JavaScript
frameworks come out they do the same
thing to be honest like all the way back
from it's just different ways of doing
things
my opinion is like back when jQuery came
out now you got react but it's still you
know the code that runs in the browser
it talks the code that makes connections
and talks of code that talk like runs in
a server so mm-hm
I'd be interested to see like how this
like existing paradigm because I don't
think the Internet's going anywhere I
don't know if it's gonna how its gonna
maybe work and integrate with some of
like the newer stuff people are just
prototyping because my current company
like we have like a small machine
learning team but they work in like a
very they working like in a silo like
their stuff doesn't they kind of work on
their own like everyone else does their
thing is integrated talks with each
other and then there's always like these
data scientists on machine learning
they're just kind of like dabbling on
the side almost like a little research
project so I think eventually if that's
a really seamless integration in the
future where it's just like more like
bread and butter that could maybe be the
future or some of that stuff that's just
like baked into how things work but yeah
I don't know the stuff changes this
stuff takes a long time to change I
think we think it changes pretty fast
but I think I'll still take a while so
we'll see
you know I really like that what you
said there with you know with like
frameworks is like you know this thing
has been around for you know God knows
how long I started with jQuery then you
know you got backbone then from there
you got ember you got angular you got a
whole bunch of different frameworks and
you know sometimes people they focus so
much on what's trending and you know
it's like I find myself that and and I
find that a lot of the more experienced
developers is like you know I'm not
really following the trends I come in
and use the one that is better for the
job or but the better tool for that
position is not like oh man you know the
Harry Potter framework just came out
yesterday and we have to switch
everything turn everything off guys you
know turn the lights off Harry Potter
just got here we got to go to Harry
Potter Jes calm and we got to download
the latest thing in and now we got to
switch up our whole code bases like no
it's like it doesn't work like that the
real world doesn't work like that's like
you know the height miss of the Internet
this is what I call it all the time I'm
like yo the Internet is like people come
in ready blogs comments on YouTube and
people be like everybody got a switch to
view everybody got a switch to Elm you
got a switch to this and as I bro
it's like in the real world it's like
all of those frameworks literally do the
same thing you know they have different
little things that are a little bit
different but they all achieved the same
product at the end of the day you know
so it's like you can't focus so much on
like the trends more of like hey start
focusing on building things this is
something that I tell my subscribers all
the time is like stop worrying about
trying to learn every single framework
that's out there start building projects
things that you can show for and be like
hey man I did this even if it's like you
know angular one I see people that come
in but yeah I'm doing this amazing app
in angular 1 and it's like you
understand how the framework works and
you want to say how the front-end works
so now you could come in and pretty much
pick up react or pick up view pick up
whatever it's out there depending on
what job
you know requirements might be but you
need to know how to build things it's
like you don't just stay there and what
I call - and you know it's like tutorial
heaven where is like you just constantly
Torrio's and and you know it's like
everything is perfect cuz it's a
tutorial but you gotta build real
projects to really understand how things
work yeah yeah yeah no I totally agree
like also those frameworks are like
there's always gonna be trends in the
framework I think but you know you go to
any like you go work for any place like
maybe if you're starting all this stuff
yourself or you're like you're building
your own website you got a free like
green pasture you can you can make any
technical decision you want but that's
usually if you're just you or your homie
working but if you go work in any
sizable codebase you're gonna have to
like yeah adapt to what they design and
that's also one of the big points of
frameworks that people forget about a
lot like framework it's a certain way of
doing things but the other thing that
accomplishes it like it makes everybody
at least follow some kind of pattern or
scaffolding right you can't like have a
hundred people writing their own flavor
of JavaScript you need at least like at
least react is there so people are the
mindset like alright I gotta write this
component I got a right you know these
actions or whatever you know how react
work just like more like rails to like
people like you know talk smack about
rails a lot but I think you know it's
easy to understand there's only very
limited ways you can make changes so
it's like a perfect framework to like
have an organized codebase in a team
like you don't want people just doing
whatever they want you want to like
organize the actual developer and like
people forget like a lot of this stuff
is designed for a developer process and
that's a really big problem when you got
like five hundreds or thousands of
developers it's an easing when you've
got one or two but when you've got like
a lot of developers you need stuff to
like control control the development and
make it sustainable for the future so
that's another thing frameworks do so
just kind of learn one like learning it
well and then you'll pick up the other
ones real easy like you said so yeah
yeah no definitely a
because it's like I'll tell you like
this quick story yeah I remember like a
past company I used to work on uh
basically there was this this developer
the whole codebase was in Perl which
Perl is super old and I got hired to
pretty much come in and switch
everything from Perl to PHP larvell
right so we hired somebody who was like
a pearl expert to help us on the
transfer but then this person did not
want to learn laravel so this person
just literally came in with all the bad
habits from Perl of like trying to put
code and the same Oh like let's say on
the same page trying to deal with stuff
with the database and it's like there's
something called the MVC framework buddy
is like that's why we switched it is is
like he's supposed to follow along so we
could all the whole code base should be
as if somebody wrote it like one person
wrote it shouldn't be like you could
tell which pages people did like that's
how you know they did a horrible job you
know what I mean yeah yeah that's not
this dangerous you know it's kind of
like I think my I'm the same experience
a couple companies there's always a
couple developers that I call them they
go rogue yeah uh-huh you just like do
whatever they want and like you know
think like what's best for the team
they're like I I think I should be
though this way so I'm gonna do it this
way that what they do is they kind of
like make it unsustainable for everyone
else
I think the person there's always a
person like in every team every company
that does that it's like probably like
you know you know they have a little bit
of an ego whatever it is yeah that's
everywhere it's totally true like
hilarious when the funny's situation out
of that situation was like one day we're
literally looking at the code and this
person is like looping over the columns
under on the database to find out the
name of each column and it's like Jesus
Christ like laravel has something for
that why are you doing this manually
it's like on every single page so we had
to code like at least like 20 pages that
this person did over again because it
was following the laravel way and that's
why I love Ruby and rails cuz it's just
it just makes you focus on like okay
doing like this and everybody knows
what's going on you can't just come in
and do a crazy loop an imploding an
exploding loop to just be like hey man
I'm smart you know I hate when people do
that one they be like you know make
something that was easy
make it look difficult for no reason
like oh yeah I just I saw something that
was already solved out there as like bro
what you doing yeah yeah that's what big
that's probably like I think a lot of
people that just get into software do
that you just try to over complicate
things I think like after you do it for
awhile extinct
I guess some people have been doing this
like for decades you know but it like
simple is always better like I like I
like Ruby Ruby on Rails too I used it
for like a while and it's just like the
patterns are so straightforward and like
it's pretty close like you use it in a
professional setting you do a couple
tutorials and you can jump in and like
you know make some good changes so yeah
like you know there's always gonna be
people that like don't like it one way
like you you'll need somebody that it's
like yeah I can't stand Ruby or Ruby or
Carrillo's like why do like I just it
just sucks alright yeah a lot of the
people that go straight to like just
calling stuff crap like they're a little
you got to be careful of them because
they don't even open mind
yeah that's crap Java's crap I always
get scared of those developers a little
bit yeah exactly I know it's like you
reading my mind I come here and I tell
people all the time it's like be careful
with what you see on the Internet
whenever you see like a random comment
somebody that you never seen before and
be like Ruby on Rails suck is like
somebody just comes in with a microphone
is like reveal real suck and it's like
just leaves no explanation no reason
it's just like that's it you know what I
mean or it could be any programming
languages like yo like yeah even know
what you're talking about is like and
then what such as for junior developers
they come in they see it on the comment
and be like oh man maybe it does suck
out without even knowing or even trying
it you know
yeah yeah it's dangerous place guy
beside the internet you know it's like
you can there's gonna be a good meat
like for the same thing there'll be
someone that loves this old I hates it
so I guess I think for me it's like I
like to read a different blog post right
you'll for every good blog post you'll
find one that's hating on it so it's
good to like get both perspectives like
people have like a ton of it random
experiences out there so like I'm sure
like it one one situation it was like
the wrong thing to do but in other
situations it made a lot of sense so
it's good to like because I I think
every single like language or framework
you decide to use is like a matter of
circumstance of like what you need like
what's available what other people know
like all the stuff so and sometimes
there's stuff you can do that you can't
help it like there's like this old score
remember there's an old school you
yahooo like there's no front end
framework all like Yui yeah yeah we like
the new like this is all cool and
then it's like it's kind of being
similar to like there's like modulized
components like handlebars all like the
same same JavaScript stuff well you know
yahoo is like not existent anymore it's
like deprecated so like sometimes you
can't help it sometimes it's like okay
now you got to change cuz yeah kernel
horses you can't do anything about it
but yeah yeah definitely man I was
surprised you bro why you I that's like
that just brought me back to those days
man it's like this thing you know
well people say you know I hate on view
GX of UGS it's not that I hate on it
it's just I've seen things like this
before where it's like they come in and
it's like super trendy for a year to the
the frameworks that I've seen that have
stuck around are usually the original
ones that came out with an idea that was
like radical and like completely changed
the industry you know backbone with
backbone came out it changed the
industry where angular came out it
changed
the industry till this day these people
are still coding in angular 1 this
company's they're still working on
angular 1 legacy code you know what I
mean
but there's a whole bunch of of
frameworks that used to be hot at that
moment in between those frameworks and
it's like they're gone you know what I
mean so it's like the same thing I tell
people now I'm like you know what out of
my experience over the years that I've
been around the one that I feel that is
gonna stick around is react because
number one is the first one that came
out with you know all of this components
and the way how it how it does
everything especially when you you mix
it up with our Redux like everything
just makes sense you know what I mean is
a to me is the perfect way to debug an
application it's like less errors
everything works on it and it's like you
are seeing somebody actually put in like
a UI interface made him react for a
fridge you get what I'm saying like
length so it's like nowadays is like you
pretty much take that and put it
anywhere as long as you can use the web
base or some type of browser based on
technology you can use react anywhere
it's like thing you got react negative
you got that whole ecosystem it's just I
don't see you stopping you know what I
mean yeah yeah I definitely see a whole
bunch of frameworks coming out taking
ideas from me and try to make it better
but it's like the original is always
gonna be like the first one plus
Facebook is behind it so it's like you
know having a big company like that it's
like you know a whole wait yeah holds a
lot of it holds a lot of weight yeah
like I've been using a little bit of my
recent job and I think it's like good I
just kind of learned it like like less
than a year ago but yeah I think for me
like it's like pretty easy to get in
like there is a ton of react Redux code
already in the codebase but it's like
very easy to follow it's intuitive I
think it's like a good like like
potentially like first frame where
people learn and I think it's like super
popular so yeah I'm like all for it like
I don't have too many strong opinions of
like all the latest and greatest
JavaScript but I think yeah reiax been
working you know I can go in and make
changes which is already a good sign you
know but yeah like that's cool man and
um I was gonna ask you as far as you
know not to go too much deep into your
or your own company that you work on Oh
as far as the company is a more like an
e-commerce is it more like a service
because I always you know people ask me
like man I don't know what type of
company I'm gonna end up working is it
gonna be like an online store is it
gonna be like you know or freaking over
is it gonna be a post mate this is gonna
be like some cool startup you know if
you can you know just pretty much just
like uh just a quick summary just like
it is it what type of company is it but
I currently work at I can tell you just
work at a Squarespace it's like oh it's
like a company that lets you build
websites easily so it's like if you
don't you don't know how to build a
website you can use their tools to help
build it's really similar to WordPress
Shopify Wix the pretty much any tool for
like just like you know our grandparents
to think of web you make tools to build
websites so like super web focused I
wouldn't really say it's ecommerce it's
just more like maybe call like a web
platform like you can use this too it's
like a tool to build other stuff so I
guess that's where the web platform
comes from overloaded word whatever but
like that's the gist of my current
company so it's just like heavy on the
web stuff which is good and like
everyone is kind of like like split up
between like product engineering
infrastructure and then within product
people work on different like features
and parts of the business but I think
every single job like you know we all
know these days so like every single
company needs software development
capacity it could be like a nursing home
in the school a big bank hospital it
could be your college it could be a
Google
like from every single level there could
be a little bit of software involved
which makes it pretty specific like if
your company is heavily on the web you
know you're gonna do a ton of stuff like
Squarespace is just heavily heavily like
operated on the web right but like not
every company is like that you can have
like this big like supply chain company
that does import exports from like China
or something and like they just handle
all this inventory and they need a
little bit of software to track all
their stuff or it's like you need all
the internal like management software
for Hospital like all like this drug
immigration scheduling like so like I
think there's like a different way your
software's got to be used which dictates
a lot of things like perhaps it's like
only software to facilitate a business
operation right and that's just like
making sure your supply chain works or
making sure like Amazon gets its
deliveries or like your software could
be geared a lot towards the consumers I
think there's a big difference there
it's like a lot of web programming is
geared towards consumers it's like
you're building an app so people go to
your website they download your app and
it's like consumer focus so you're you
you're worried about like what like the
average person likes to see it's like oh
they like a big button or they like like
that logo so you're worrying about
different problems and then sometimes in
a more business environment with your
writing software like for Walmart
delivery then that's you know I really
can't you don't really care about the
end customer you just care about like
the raw operations business so um and
then that can be that same example can
be applied for every single industry
from a hospital to a bank so I mean
there's man there's like so many
different use cases for software that's
why it's pretty fun like if you like one
thing more than the other you can like
do that like if you really like pleasing
customers maybe you should work on like
the next Instagram right or like some
app like that if you're really like
business minded you'd like to think like
what's the most efficient way to do
something maybe you go work for like a
small biz
let's try to help them out with their
tools so they don't have to use like
Excel or something so yeah no I
definitely always tell people all the
time man like there's so many
opportunities out there you know you
know wherever there's a business there's
an opportunity there for a developer you
know because you always got to think
about it like that like what you know
like especially now like everything's
connected to the web everything needs to
be you know some type of system needs to
be set up either for inventory or
keeping track of deliveries it could be
anything you know what I mean so there's
always gonna be opportunities for for
developers and people that that program
and learn to code and like for myself
like I always find myself leaning
towards like like e-commerce for some
reason because most of the companies
I've worked for have been like either
set of products or you know selling
clothes or you know I was working this
company called Oh 39 dollar glasses com
selling glasses um but I always find
myself that like now running away but
this certain type of jobs that I myself
which is something too I tell people you
gotta know which which like division of
you know programming is gonna make you
happy because you might get a big check
somebody might be like hey man we got a
hundred ten thousand dollars here for
you and then you might say oh this is
great but then you get there and you're
like miserable at the company you know
what I mean like I had a opportunity
with Viacom or like I don't know like me
two years ago right and basically after
they told me what my job was gonna be I
was like oh my god I can't I'm about to
throw myself off the window like it
would have been just me creating nothing
interview it like you know I wouldn't be
able to see anything my whole job was
gonna be working with JavaScript setting
up of advertising between videos you
know like on websites like MTV comm vh1
so my whole job would be just pretty
much making sure that that code doesn't
have a bug
so I was like I can't do this I was like
okay thank you for the offer you know
it's like I appreciate it I thought I
was gonna be doing like you know stuff
like on MTV's I oh yeah I'm gonna set up
the the pages is like okay you know uh
freaking 3:16 is coming up and I'll get
to build their page now it was gonna be
like literally just working like a coal
monkey here make sure this ads never go
down I was like okay I can't yeah like
that's good like it for you man like I
think the same like a lot of people
underestimate that kind of stuff there's
a lot of like you know crappy jobs up
there and like you I think everyone
needs to like optimize a little bit you
know for quality of life you know you
mean that stuff is like priceless
they're just having like extra time or
sanity like you know money's not gonna
make up for like you going like insane
so yeah like some there's crap there's
like so many jobs everywhere not all of
them are really glamorous I think every
now and then like you're not gonna get
the perfect job but you just gotta like
it's up to everyone to like strike the
balance it's like alright do I take a
hit now cause like I really need a job
maybe I take a hit like everyone has
like a little personal circumstance but
yeah I'm glad I think everyone needs to
like take into account like all the
other stuff to like not just programming
you might gotta like live your life and
just make sure you're like chilling so
yeah you know I was watching one of your
videos where where you was talking about
I don't know if it was Amazon that you
went for the interview and like you get
it didn't pan out I just found that
video so interesting because so many
people don't talk about that you know
what I mean like so many people they
they think like this world is perfect
and it's like everything's gonna go your
way and it's just like nobody wants to
talk about that side cuz I myself have
gone through situations like that like I
remember you know my very first
interview was all on tumblr and like
literally I got embarrassed like I was
not ready I don't
know how they got me in there like they
should have vetted me out from a long
time like literally do a phone interview
before they even bring me in but it was
really bad and I was like I'm pretty
sure yours wasn't that bad but it
because it was my first integrals like
man now looking back at it I was like
man that was pretty bad for me and like
later on I went to something similar you
know through all you know I was like
going through the Facebook you know
recruiter it's like everything when it
seemed like everything was going good I
was like go like this oh man your boy
back to your Facebook you know what I
mean like once we get that stamp you
know cuz there's certain companies that
even if you don't work there for that
know you could literally just get that
stamp and for some reason it's like a
badge of honor you know what I mean yeah
so it's like you know like man I'm so
excited and then you know second
interview didn't go through I was like
damn like yeah did we've all had that I
mean I bombed interviews I think I
remember a couple in college I was like
I think I remember one specifically I
went to the Career Center it was like a
Microsoft first-round interview they
asked some question about like an
elevator and I just like blanked out
I like bombed that I couldn't just gonna
think you know it's like embarrassing so
it's like personally embarrassing but
you just know like then you're like not
prepared for this at all but I think
everybody I think everybody will go
through that so it's not a big deal it's
like it just happens in like but yeah
interviewing is the whole separate thing
man it's just like there's no perfect
way to vet all these candidates there's
the system that doesn't really work too
well and just like stressful you know
it's like yeah you know I think I think
the whole process of like interviewing
it is pretty crazy because it's like
sometimes you know this question is that
be like in my head I'm like I'm never
going to be doing this that you're
asking me you know what I mean like this
certain situations where they might
actually like some crazy algorithm like
or like hey can you bubble sort this
thing and it's like
like the job that the job position where
I'm gonna be working at has nothing to
do with none of this stuff you know I
mean like this ain't situations like
where I feel like if they will focus
more on on the position that the
person's gonna be working on instead of
making it more like an old general
purpose type of thing of like this is
the test that we give everybody under
the Sun doesn't matter if it's a front
end or back in or you know UI or just
like whatever I feel like a lot of these
companies they have like a set thing
where they pretty much is like the the
accessing questions to every single type
of person and I feel like you know
sometimes it is good cuz weeks out the
people who are are not that good and but
at the same time I feel like it lets go
of people that are really talented cuz I
remember there was a this guy who I
think he created he created homebrew
right and he was like he was pissed off
at Google I'm like he's a yo i frickin
created homebrew like everybody who uses
mac even you guys use freakin homebrew
and everything on my interview you guys
make my life miserable is like yeah yeah
most positive false negatives I think
people like I know like my current
company they just give I companies do it
just cuz it's like to try to their best
to get that same baseline filter for
everyone so like some people get above
it some people get below it there's
gonna be false positives and false
negatives but I guess like they did the
math and it like it overall still works
or something so they just keep doing it
but yeah it's probably like a lot of
good people like don't make it like a
lot of people just don't interview
Welbeck's we're smart people but I still
think there's a certain level of like
preparation you need to do for them and
it's like alright if this is what it is
you at least owe it to yourself to like
you've got a CREP to a certain extent
you can't always go off like concluding
your merits you know like you I worked
at base look like a few I do whatever I
want
you can't like okay like you can't do
that forever your whole life
you know so ya know cuz that happens
that happen so much man where where
people just go in and it's like you know
what man
is like we got this test but I feel like
I don't know I feel like whiteboarding
is such a waste of time but um you know
every company is different you know what
I mean every company has different goals
that's another thing too you know
because sometimes you might come in and
you might be getting hired for front-end
possession but they looking at you as a
talent that could maybe later on could
jump to the back end or could jump to
other technologies so you have that
broad you know broad knowledge then they
look at you be like okay this person we
could bring him in and put him in
different teams at any moment you know
what I mean and yeah so it's pretty cool
man
but yeah man I think if anybody has any
questions man let me know we got your
boy Dave Shang in here man I really
appreciated that you came through man
because you know I've been trying to get
this thing going where it's like I wanna
I want to be able to have the community
more more closer because I feel like all
of the developers here on YouTube are
doing something positive something good
for for the community and I really want
like more collaborations because at the
same time I look at other other genres
of youtube and I see how it works for
them you know because it's like there
might be people in your audience that
might never see me because of how
Google's algorithm works you know what I
mean it's the same thing from my
subscribers some of them I have probably
never seen you because Google has never
shown your channel to them you know what
I mean so it just helps out and at the
same time it's cool to pick each other's
brain and see see how other person
things and you know we all have similar
situations some of the ideas you know
it's just also to build builds
relationships you know what I mean and
that for sure for sure yeah thanks for
inviting me
like really appreciate it it's like yeah
man also Big Joe CSS
a question for Dave since I know he used
to do iOS is the job market for
self-taught iOS developers as practical
as is for web developers what developers
like what is the job market like for it
can you get into it I see yeah I think
like mobile I think mobile definitely
isn't as hot as they used to be I think
like there is this time period where
like iPhone first came out Android came
and reforms came a real quick after then
like mobile developers was like a really
big thing at that period I think now
it's still now I think the trend is like
it's still popular but now it's more
like a requirement rather than a very
popular to do so every company is gonna
need a web developer and of course you
need like your mobile app to go along
with the web app so I think these days
is a little more dangerous to just feel
like I only know like iOS or Android I
think better to maybe start on web or if
you've already done a bit of iOS also
get up to speed so your level of web is
probably equal because I think these
days it's like there's always going to
be demand for mobile development but
it's not trendy as much it's just gonna
be another like everyone's got a habit
so I think it's less likely is less
practical for somebody to hire like a
pure iOS developer they want to just
hire somebody that can like you do iOS
now okay now you do the Android one or
and now you update our web page
something like that a little more
versatile so yeah that's what I think so
yeah no I agree with you on there
because you know I remember like a few
years ago you know even like I don't
know maybe like 2011-2012 around there
like iOS developers were like so hot
like so it was like so high under man
was like man if if you just know the
basics you're hired like I've seen a lot
of situations where it's like I have one
of my friends who are
talking about Amazon he works at Amazon
or mobile department but he told me
literally like yo he didn't know nothing
when he went in when he like he just
pretty much you know they just said hey
have you tried you know iOS or Android
and like he knew somebody there and just
that's eight that they hide him you know
what I mean in freaking I've seen also a
couple of my friends too
back when I was starting into web
development they were just like you know
man I'm gonna start doing all freaking
iOS apps because that's where it's hat
that's what that's where it's at right
now but now I see them like kind of like
looking for jobs more often than you
know then myself I feel like it I don't
know I feel like web development is like
more study work currently you know it's
like there's definitely a lot of
opportunities in iOS and mobile app
development period but I just don't see
it as much as it used to be like even if
you search on lynda.com
there used to be like so many jobs for
iOS developers constantly now it was
like it kind of like simmer down a
little bit yeah yeah so I mean that is
what it is like I think I'll going waves
but like it's just not there's still
gonna be jobs for but it's not gonna be
like because I think while that kind of
stuff is trending every company just
thinks they need a mobile app which
sometimes they probably don't know is
where it make sense to have a mobile app
like if you're doing eager if you're
doing ride-sharing yeah you got it you
gotta have a mobile app put like during
that time it's like every company like
needed to have a so you don't need one
man just make a website like I said no I
don't mean like a mobile app so you know
I remember a few years ago where every
website would we like force you soon as
you came in if he was on a mobile it was
saying download our mobile app is like
Google said you know what guys stop
doing that that's annoying people like
now you they took that whole feature off
it's like you might as well just make
your website responsive and you're gonna
get good search results that's a
I mean so the last question before we
let you go I know you're probably tired
is early in the day you just woke up um
so somebody jasmine says how do you cope
with stress at work deadlines and non
technical managers and so on
oh thank like so yeah I've been in a
couple different my current work isn't
too stressful but you'll be in a lot of
different work environments the first
thing to know is that like every company
treats developers a little differently
right like I've heard stories about like
like big banks like Goldman Sachs they
treat the developers pretty crappy like
you just got to get stuff done and then
I think more technical companies like
Google or Facebook they really like they
love their developers like here are 20%
of your time do whatever you want here's
like free everything so I think first
like the company you choose every
company like perceives what the
developer does for that company a little
different it could just be a means to an
end or it could be like the developers
the bread and butter of the the company
so first thing before you even get
yourself into the weaves you gotta kind
of pick the environment like my
company's almost like a cultural thing
like how they perceive developers but if
you get yourself in a situation where
it's like you have non-technical people
that you've got to answer to their jerks
I think the best thing to do is like you
have to like put all your concerns into
stuff they understand so like one of my
friends was a developer for like a very
business centric company and like if he
tried to explain like his problems are
as stressed in terms of tech they just
wouldn't get it right so he had to do
like he got explain it in terms of money
so people get it he's like if you don't
let me refactor this part of the code
you will you're gonna lose like a year
of development and that's like five
million dollars or like like they just
kind of like you have to kind of
empathize a little bit with the people
better like non-technical right
everyone's a little different you could
be a business person worrying about
dollars or you're like a product person
working on design but you got to kind of
sometimes click the
into their language so they can kind of
get it it's like if I design persons
yelling at you to like make up button
different you got dick alright well
that's actually really hard based on how
we built it like I got to do all this
stuff so we can do all this cool design
later but yeah that's like kind of
worked for me in the past you guy that
you can't always discuss things in like
the pure engineering terms you guys like
see where other people are coming from
because they're coming from a totally
different perspective so you just gotta
put yourself in their shoes a little bit
and then try to explain your problems
yeah no I definitely agree with you on
that you know I've sort of talked about
this in different videos it's like you
know my last company pretty much the
developers were like literally saving
the company
basically as an e-commerce site but we
pretty much saved the company but we
still didn't feel like we was getting
you know like I was just do like we we
didn't feel a certain you know we felt
like a certain way about it and that's
one of the reasons why I quit from me
and even after that currently right now
I'm doing full-time YouTube I'm doing my
website you have all other websites that
I basically may get income from and I'm
good you know but one of my friends
tells me hey Joe you know this is a job
that I know man they they're pretty
close to you listen go to to the to the
guy just go to the interview man like
you know you're gonna fall in is gonna
be a great place soon as I get there
we're going over or resume all the
things that I've done this this and that
and the CEO comes out of nowhere and
says hey I see you do a little freelance
I see you do a little YouTube on the
side um you know we usually want our
developers to just focus on us you know
all their work that they do is pretty
much just on our company and then how
you call it's like you know we want you
to rest on the weekends and that was
automatically like a turnover I was like
okay I don't care how much you gotta pay
me but you know I was like no thank you
it's like I appreciate the opportunity
I was like yo listen I'm not gonna work
here as like this is not I didn't say
like that says I you know I really
appreciate that but I don't think that
yeah I will be a culture free for this
company you know it's like sometimes you
just gotta like find out which one's it
is that that worked for you you know
what I mean because now money not the
name of the company none of those things
is gonna make you happy unless you you
feel good in that company you know what
I mean so for you guys you guys gotta be
careful with that and just make sure you
you you do your research even check out
glassdoor.com check out what other
developers say to figure out which one
is the right place for you yeah that's
super-important you like you caught that
early you know like if you know if
they're not active about that you could
just be like a terrible likes it pretty
quickly before you know it so the eggs
and the last question and that's it we
out of here guys um basically Tyler
Brennan says I have a question for Dave
hey Dave when when you was learning
which you know now what resources do you
use I think like I got pretty lucky I
think like for school it was just like
all the curriculums and textbooks and
all that stuff and I think anybody that
wants to get into some curriculums you
can kind of dig for them like like like
Harvard MIT all these crazy schools you
can actually look at the curriculums and
at least see the textbooks so it's like
it's not as good as taking the classes
like but it's still kind of like a
guiding light and then I think one good
thing that helped supplement if your
software is I had like one manager and
my job in California where he's just
like yo man like read all these like
books and like I think the books are
good compliment I don't think they can
like it's just like I wouldn't solely go
off what books say but you got a I think
each book is like good to learn just
like the details of any language or
framework and also good to learn about
people's opinions like reading blog
posts like I would read a lot like
there's pretty much there's like two
types of reading one type of reading is
like reference like this is how Java
works like you
like no one can dispute how Java works
right but then you got to read all the
subjective stuff so you can form your
technical opinions like read like read a
post that Mike hates on react and then
read a post that loves react and then do
both of that and then you can like
formulate your technical opinions better
and like make your own decisions rather
than just like going with the flow or
whatever so yeah every yeah I think
reading is playing number one nice um
and I mean I just heard you say kind of
funny so you originally from New York or
you from i from I grew up around Boston
I went to school in Pittsburgh then I
worked in California for like four years
and then four years ago I moved to new
okay welcome back to the East Coast all
