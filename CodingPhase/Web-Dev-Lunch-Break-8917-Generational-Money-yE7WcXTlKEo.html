back out it again man
coating face calm your boys backing out
and did it again alright we in here
random we live joined us live
it also live we're not really live we're
we're actually pre recording my web
developers lunch break so all my lunch
breaks I come out I talk about a topic
either talk about development or how
life is going how things are going for
me it all depends right
so today's topic is I'm good
that's my solid gray so my topic is I'm
good for today so my job we've been
working on
you know redesigning the whole website
and building it from scratch building
you know given your Styles right new
Styles new components getting everything
more modern more secure and that's what
we can look to now my personal life I've
been creating courses for you guys a lot
of people are loving the courses a lot
of people they loving the courses so
much that even on the free courses they
donated money because they enjoy it guys
you don't have solutely it's up to you
if you want to donate those on you but I
do appreciate it now somebody's finally
asking me like oh Joe you know what do
you do with your money what is this
experience is doing with your money that
you're going to from YouTube or from the
courses into our be honest with you guys
I haven't spent 19 $1 that's just money
that I'm just leaving there for a rainy
day and also to for when I take my
channel to the next level and my website
to the next level where I'm going to
start strong basically promoting I think
you guys I was thinking about doing like
a parody commercial to like Tai Lopez
videos that he does on YouTube I'm
thinking about doing something like that
similar to that but it's going to be
like a parody about the same time I'm
going to meet other people like the
honest truth over a lot of shit like you
know you don't have to work at FedEx you
don't have to work at you know at that
bullshit retail store you don't have to
go work at Macy's you don't have to go
work at Foot Locker like right after
high school like none of man just bus
yes I'll help you out I'll tell you
where to get the right courses way to
learn the right information that you
need to get then yeah that's my my
commercial it's going to be my
commercial like hey I'm out here man I
changed my life you can change your life
and you could change the life of others
because you know when you're financially
stable not only are you changing your
life around but also changing the life
of other people that are around you you
cry the motivate your friends you could
help out your your wifey your kids to go
to a better school you could help out
your mom you know a lot of people never
being able to buy a house you can
finally get your mom a house you can
finally enjoy you know vacation time a
lot of people don't even have vacation
like they work full-time and they don't
even have vacation time like they'll
have like a day or two a vacation or
they'll have seven days of vacation but
it's not really vacation all you're
doing is staying home because you can't
afford to go anywhere so that's what I'm
trying to do that's what I'm trying to
basically get it to that point where I
can help other people and learn how to
code and at the same time just help them
take it to the next level
No instead of just a few people enjoying
this in this economic boom that's going
on and we could actually make it happen
for everybody now a lot of people think
like oh the market is going to get
saturated no you have to understand this
right now I have seven thousand
subscribers out of those seven thousand
subscribers eight hundred signed up for
my website right and now because they
don't want to support my website or they
don't want to buy any other courses that
I have known is not that the idea behind
is some people can't buy and some people
they just not going to buy because
they're not really that invested into
this right they haven't bought any other
udemy courses and they haven't putting
those hours that they supposed to
because I don't care if you go in and
you spend all your hours on tea tree
house or you spent all your hours on or
freako camp I don't care how you do it
just become a developer and put in those
hours all right my way is you to me
because you to me works for me and I'm
the type of person that I learn by doing
I learned by building projects I don't
learn by you telling me hey this is CSS
this is a CSS property no I don't learn
like that I learned like hey this is a
CSS property that we use to make a
rounded corner all right the little
border radius you want to check that
little circle or at the end of the
corner it's called border radius that's
what you use that's how I learned right
so that's what I want to do for people
that's what I want to help them out take
it to the next level but you have to
understand this only 1% okay out of
7,000 how much percent is 800 oh no
let's say 10% of people sign up to the
website or 10% of the people that are
subscribed to me they actually buy
courses or they actually put in hours so
you got to think about it like that
that's exactly how the world is you know
a thousand people are going to sign up
but only one well only 10% of them let's
say 100 of them are going to actually
want to become developers it's like
people go to the gym every day they
signup to the gym that I oh yeah
and then fitness here here's my hundred
dollars to sign up but do they follow
through no right so for us the ones that
really want this in and really want to
become developers they really want to
change our lives I really want to get
you know get this money that's out here
so it won't be so one-sided
you know because you think about it
money gives you power
you know money helps you out to support
a candidate like you know equal final
let's say an example if Barack Obama
didn't have people who have money behind
them he wouldn't have been able to
become president right so it's the same
thing if people don't donate to you know
a candidate they can't they can't
support that person so like how you
think those big guys like you know I
forgot this guy's name sign cats like
those guys they help out in every single
state to choose a Republican and sorry
I'm going to politics but it shows you
that how much power they have because
they invest into those candidate and
they change things around them so let's
say us minorities which it sounds are
using our word minorities because
minority in one country like that's
bullshit you know I mean like yeah this
a lot of Caucasian or white people in
America that's fine they got here first
alright that's you know that's fine at
the end of the day in the next 10 15 20
years the majority is going to be the
minority Latinos or you know Hispanics
Asians
fucking blacks whatever the minorities
are going to be the majority right well
we have a long way to go and we have
another way to go that's going to be
like 20-30 years we don't even know
we're gonna be alive by that time so now
that we hear we are alive we gotta make
something happen we gotta say hey we
want this generational money alright and
I'm sorry too actually you know just am
i I'm talking about just a minority I
don't want you guys because I have a lot
of Caucasian white guys and white girls
who watch my channels like that's great
I love you guys too but yeah also know
you know there's a generational money
you know a lot of you guys don't come
from money right but there's some of the
people out there who do come from money
meaning like hey their parents money get
passed down the grandparents money get
passed down and keeps passing down but
for a lot of the people from you know
minorities they don't have nobody
nobody's passing anything down to them
you know because you have to think about
it in like only 3040 years ago people
couldn't even vote you were black you
the people who didn't even want you to
vote right people created ghettos and
created all these areas that in reality
it was just to fuck up those communities
right but it's not because they can't do
better than that is because that's how
the system was set up and it's not
because of white people or you know or
the people are alive now it's people who
did fucked up shit back in the days so
it takes some time to fix that that
problem and I understand it does what me
myself I've never been the type of
person to blame anything on anybody if
you know if we come from nothing
somebody in my generation not my
generation my mother's generation or
mine
grandfather's generation they fucked up
you know right because they didn't do
something that will leave something good
for us in the future
so now it's our chance I feel like
that's how I feel like right now I came
from nothing
now for me to leave nothing to my son
would be like a responsibility in this
world right so it's like I have to leave
on something in this world and give us
something good and say hey son I busted
my ass my whole life working I want you
to go to the best schools that you can
and I want you to you know become
whatever you want to become but be the
best at it but here you know what here's
a hundred thousand dollars that you
could start off with a lot of people
start off with a hundred thousand two
hundred I've seen people are I got a
friend of mine who his parents left over
$800,000 fuckin trust fund like look at
fuckin Donald Trump Donald Trump started
with a million dollar loan a million
from him but what he says my father lend
me a million dollars tell somebody out
here hey let me a million dollars we
can't get that right so we start from
zero so what can we do for our kids
let's give them the opportunity right
and right now technology is hot we don't
know how long this is going to last so
if you don't get interest now you don't
know what's going to happen there's
people who who got into the you know the
dot-com bubble too late they got in too
late a lot of companies already came out
Amazon eBay fucking Google AOL all those
companies already came out so when new
company is like Net Zero like goals and
all this other bullshit companies that
came after them it was too late for them
right so they lost the opportunity right
now is the same thing for you guys you
guys have a great opportunity to become
developers and be financially stable and
lay people here in the US if you want
like talking about money because it's
something that it's sad and for some
people it's upsetting so some people
that be like oh yeah I don't want to
that I have you know a million dollars
in our bank account while somebody's
here at McDonald's you know wasting his
life and he will never get a million
dollars in his life right so people are
like talking about that but we could
also just make changes I'm gonna get on
one man we can actually set this up and
be like man just live comfortable
there's no reason for you to be
struggling when you know you can pick up
a skill that's gonna pay off you know so
that's all I'm saying I hope you guys
understand me I didn't want to go too
deep in this this web developers lunch
break I just wanted to be honest with
you guys right you know what I mean like
just tell you guys what it is super hot
right now I believe the problem I'm
sweating right
it's hot let's turn on the AC
I'm trying to cooled off a little bit
let me get back here
and yeah man
sinister agent
so that's my plan my plan is so you
don't show people that you can do this
and it's time and like you don't you
know some of us are going to become
millionaires some of us are not going to
become millionaires but we can leave
something here in this world leave
something that say hey we left a mark we
can leave a mark here in this world and
say hey this person this person came he
will see her to created something
amazing something useful for society a
website might change somebody's life or
application might change somebody's life
