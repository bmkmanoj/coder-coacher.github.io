at the same time I wouldn't have the
luxury to be able to hang out with you
guys all the time in you know just
create courses and on top of that just
to let you guys know you know tomorrow
I'm dropping a new video which is it's
gonna be like a new series called
success stories where I'm gonna read out
emails of people that send me their
messages like yo Joe thank you for
everything that you've done I listen to
you I got a job in two months I listen
to you I got a job at seven months you
know people have like different stories
different backgrounds you know some
people are still working at their own
companies you know they're applied to
other jobs but at the same time they're
successful because the other guy a
higher pay the other guy switched up to
the other team some people will hit me
up like oh I'm a designer and then now
I'm actually working as a developer
thanks to you everything that you did
you know so we love giving back you know
what I mean cuz you guys give me so much
so yeah man I just want to say thank you
guys and I'm just excited man oh oh I'm
freaking excited I don't want to curse
cuz there's no point of cursing I don't
need to curse I'm a grown-ass man now I
need to come down with the curse you
know I got a kid I'm living life right
now man you know it's like life is good
life is great life is beautiful you know
when you're down think about those
moments that you're about to get in the
future like people don't know like I was
at the bottom bar
I was a romance ninja let's just say yes
I was a bomb-ass ninja here but it was
crazy it's not flipped it around man and
all of you guys can do it what I do here
is motivate you guys what I do here is
show you guys the way that helped me to
just becoming a developer and like you
basically learn from my mistakes
instead of you coming in here and doing
what I did it took me almost a year to
become a developer because I was trying
to master everything and trying to do a
whole bunch of stuff and then I'm like
nah there's a better way if it took me
five years to get to where I'm at to get
to the level that I got to I think most
of you guys and probably all of you guys
can do it in a year and a half two years
you get what I'm saying so just learn
from me man learn from me you know don't
copy the sauce get your own sauce that's
what I tell people get your own sauce
you don't have to do what I do man it's
obvious but you know just do what you do
putting your own sauce into it and
you're gonna be successful man life is
good
you know those moments that you feel
depressed those moments that you feel
like man why this person has this why I
don't have that why I can't succeed why
is it that every time that I'm about to
do something good something stops me
remember this man this always good
moments man like you know I really like
I'm out here man like this is beautiful
man like I love the weather I love when
it's nice like this like I'm chillin you
