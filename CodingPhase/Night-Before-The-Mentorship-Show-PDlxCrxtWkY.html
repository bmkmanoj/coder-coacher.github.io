let them know Joe is live right now they
go check your phone man check your phone
man notification game I was in the
middle of JavaScript hyper app that's
what 84 said you know 84 what you think
about that what you think about the the
hyper app course man I mean the
restaurant one all right
like I just finished doing a couple of
videos right now I finished doing the
slider that's gonna be pretty
interesting cuz I know a lot of people
always ask me oh how do you do a slider
how do you keep track of the state this
this and that and it's like man I'm
giving all of that to you on this course
man you know and it was cool about it so
JavaScript man like we're not doing
nothing crazy we're not doing anything
that's outside of this world we're just
doing JavaScript you know if you want to
get better in JavaScript you gotta
practice your JavaScript okay kids
waiting here man
I know I got the Manchester honey
somebody probably be like Joe we show
you with that hoodie
two days ago listen we here man
I'm home when I'm home yeah i lucky I
even got any clothes on this could be a
whole different type of show man if I
get comfortable you know Joe comes
through with with the white beater and
just like straight boxes you know what I
mean so be be thankful you seen a hoodie
right now okay you know what I mean how
you live and didn't get any notification
how the hell you know I just want
I mean and even get no notification you
was just checking yours like oh let me
check your boy Joe's channel real quick
but yeah the missing what 84 me a
success 84 music says Plus this
JavaScript anyways is more just learning
the hyper app syntax yeah exactly
he says honestly I like it because it's
forcing me to think different leave a
more advanced language for my level yeah
yeah that's what I'm saying like I think
that's what it really helps people out
because you gotta think about it like
this when you're doing of course right
and people are teaching JavaScript they
teach you like stuff from JavaScript
that's so easy that you be like oh it is
how my job is gonna be and then you
realize when you start working in a
no-shoe nobody prepared me for this
nobody showed me this advanced things
that you got to do with a raisin in
dealing with data ahead
you know immutability like nobody talks
about that like some people they do but
they give you easy examples like they're
not really you can't learn like that you
know to me so that's what I'm saying
though like I'm trying to help people
out show them a little something
no beard man we in here
so hurry you know right now I got caught
on on League of Legends guys so this
whole livestream is gonna be me just
playing League of Legends while talking
to you guys they're reading the chat

Silla a few lessons later I was like
okay this is cake I get it yeah man yeah
I mean I was talking to milk stars and
milk starts was talking about legal

their work they're not practicing
they're not doing the projects and
throughout the week you getting
eliminated you're not going to the last
stage it's that simple
so people gotta take this serious I mean
you know this to end tonight you'll be
like oh yeah it is the Internet but last
thing you want to do is look like a
quitter online you know I mean like and
not saying it for anybody from before
but you know just don't give up man like
there were people who who were not the
best developers last semester last
semester last season they were just
regular people you know what I mean like
the best ones there were this kid Tommy
and and Mack right there was a top tool
you know they the one that had the most
experience and it showed you know what I
mean but at the same time you know it's
like all you need to do is just show up
do the project do the best you can
this is not a competition of who
finishes first who comes in does the
best design no it's not about that it's
not about that at all you know what I
mean so just show up and just you know
get your work done that's all I want to
see for people why are my messages being
deleted damn it yeah you can't curse on
YouTube man they don't show it no more
man back in the days they will let you
curse they will let you do whatever you
want in the chat room that no long
happens anymore like you can't curse you
got to keep it pg
where we got a couple of people's coming
up for tomorrow man a couple of people's
you you guys might know some that you
might not know some you know some of the
people that they they're you know they
they they're the show love they
subscribe to the channel they see this
opportunity and they really want to take
it you know I'm not saying I'm like I'm
like the bill gates of this thing but I
can help out some people you know what I
mean like I can come in and and just
take it to the next level just give you
some real advice without being fake and
without lying to you you know that's why
I think that that this this show is
going to give to people like
yeah what I'm saying kids so who's
working on anything right now
anybody working on projects like you
know I told people the other day I was
like I made that video work I said man
we need to you know not learn so much I
mean now focus so much on learning and I
said it to for the mid-levels and senior
level developers and somebody it's okay
as if I was talking about them like for
junior developers like oh if you don't
learn you know as I gotta know what you
doing this and that I'm like brother
the problem is when when you actually
you do more learning than coding right
like when you're beginning you're
supposed to learn a lot you're supposed
to really go hard but at the same time
you supposed to be building projects
you're not supposed to be learning
constantly without building anything
it's like cuz then at the same time so
all you're doing is just following
videos you know what I mean like
learning from the videos and then put it
to practice that's all I'm saying you
know I'm not saying to stop learning
because even to this day I'll keep on
learning you know what I mean like
earlier today I was like looking over
some stuff from all goldang I'm trying
to improve my golang you know I'm trying
to get nicer cuz I know the basics but
I'm not advanced you know I mean like
I'm thinking about creating a course on
ongoing but I'm not advanced
how I am in JavaScript you know like I
can go in and teach you break down the
things that I told was hard in the way
how other people you know that was
teaching and that made it hard
I could definitely teach it to somebody
else like way better you know but at the
same time there's more more to it than
what's already there you know what I
mean so that's all I'm saying
get what I'm saying kick ya now you
definitely got to continue learning
everybody's sick up in this crap man
Joe clicking like the life I think my
life depends on it
that word man I'm trying to survive in
this game and I'm trying to I'm trying
to get back I don't want to get back to
being addicted to the game but I want to
be able to be nice
you know like play one game per night
I'll be fine
you know take it slow now I'm not trying
to become a master
nothing I'm trying to be the very best
but never war leader legends I wanna
stay
oh that's crazy I'm just learning this
moves man this is crazy like I haven't
played League of Legends in I don't know
how long in a long time
like it's crazy to me they change the
whole game like not the whole system but
just like there's certain things that's
different like sorry characters are
doing different moves and stuff like
that like that's pretty cool if I've
been bumping that new a boogeyman I
don't know man I can't really mess with
