knows he'll boys joke back at it again
man coating face.com
you dig alright guys what up let me know
what God was I mean I was popping what's
going on in the world how's my viewers
how's my my peoples are you guys doing
today
just only hit chillin for short man bout
to go get my little you know what a
turkey sandwich that I get everything
and you know you know what I do yeah man
 is crazy just checking up on you
guys
like I don't even know today I have no
topic so today I'm just gonna answer
questions I guess from you guys what
other questions you guys might have
today I don't even have a topic so you
know so let me know what you guys want
to know what what questions you want me
to answer what you know what advice I
want you what you want me to give you
what exactly wanna hear today
let me know let your boy know I hate
having to park over here because number
one there's no no service
that's number all right so there's no
service and then on top of that I gotta
be like right in front of the people
from from the the store talking and
you know what I mean while they're
probably looking at me like what the
hell stop back I'm a man I still got a
little guys I'm sorry
no yeah man you know one thing that I
want to get this car I want to get like
God you know tinted windows
that's for sure I'm gonna get the tinted
windows for this car for sure maybe at
the end of the month or something but
yeah let me see what questions you guys
have today what you want me to answer
commander Joe oh man
my question is do you think do you think
I should freelance web development if
you should do freelance web development
I mean yeah if you could get clients
then yeah of course but I will say for
the first very very first job try to get
a job where you could actually work you
know what I mean
let me open up this windows so I don't
die in here yeah
yeah you should definitely do freelance
but like I said just your first job try
to do it do it in a company man because
you're going to learn so much from
working with a team and working with
other developers like other developers
are going to teach you cool things that
you didn't know cool things that you
didn't learn online you know because
this only friendship that you only learn
from doing it amongst other peers and
 so let me see
the balling chronicles no I'm not
boiling boiling is when I you
know create coating face comment body
boiling cuz we all got to be doing good
and what I mean but it's just the
beginning
it's just cool for me I think you know
some people go man doing is just trying
to show off
out here I'm not even trying to do that
I'm trying to show people like man you
know from where I went in the past few
years to where I'm at now you know and
all of that shit's done by just
coding you know cuz that's another thing
too man
like you know how you got
celebrities right and this is something
that's happening in the United States a
lot of people are leaving math and
science they're now trying to study that
they're not trying to do that why
because they see Kim Kardashian live a
very good life you see Kanye West
bowling now and doing all the you
see rappers living a lifestyle
that a lot of people wish they could had
they could have it and they're like you
know what man why the hell am I gonna go
to school when these people they make
money doing this dish you know girls are
 stripping in the strip club and
they making money but what if there was
a girl right who was out here buying
brand new Louis Vuitton bags
buying a whole bunch of but doing
something positive like from code or
doing something positive from having her
own business like then girls would look
at them but I oh I want to be like that
you know what I mean I don't have to
show my body and it's the same thing for
other guys that you know when I was
growing up I wish I had that I had like
somebody that I could relate to and be
like oh man this guy is like 28 29 years
old you know and he's doing his thing
he's also you know supporting
his family is a nice person good
things are coming to him I want to be
like that you know what I mean so if I
had died I died
coin when I was young man I thought I
would have been coding since you know I
would have never stopped why would he
just continue since I was a little kid
you know I think that's what the message
that I want to bring up I want to bring
out the message of like hey man you can
come here and live a very good
lifestyle and like be comfortable and
just bringing you know being smart to be
cool again you know what I mean like
that's my goal my goal is not to be like
try to show off or anything like that
because that's not what the channel is
about my channel is to be like yo man
this is the good this and this what
I'm you know just a little bullsh is
that little perks that I get you know
but what about those guys that are in
 you know at Google getting
$300,000 you know to me like how do
those guys live like those guys don't
even want to put their personal
life out there because they're
bowling now look at you know the guys
that are creating cool web services the
guys that created slack the guys that
created our Trello
those guys are regular guys they don't
put their you know their
personal life out there because there's
like a it's like a weird thing in the
like in the world where it's like if
you're doing good you don't want to tell
people that you're doing good
or you don't want to show people that
you're doing good so then what that does
is it basically it doesn't gravitate
people towards that career that they do
it like if there's a doctor who's out
there just bawling out just
hanging out with celebrities or
or just going out and
amazing vacations more people want to
become a doctor it's the same for
like web development like this guy's
here even on YouTube who they're making
a lot of money and they don't even
 show people what you could get
so it doesn't even motivate them it's
like for me I'm the type of person I'll
get motivated by by having an easier
life have
a better life for me and my family
that's what motivates me and then some
people don't even want to show that so
at the same time as like you know they
don't get to see that they don't get
you
like that's my goal my goal is to
motivate people and just coming here but
like man
take the courses even now look
it's funny even now I got a couple of my
friends who headed me help and they're
like yo Joe could you teach me how to
code man like I'm like what the you
as we're doing three years ago when I
when I did the switch when I decided to
start learning how to code I told
everybody I was like yo son you have to
get on this yeah I gotta learn how to
code you got to learn how to do
something with technology doesn't even
have to be learning how to code only you
can go and take on a training
for high collars for solar panels those
guys are making like $90,000 and plus
you know installing solar panels like
these people who they're not made to
work in front of a computer right you're
just your body your brain is it doesn't
work like that you're not going to be
able to sit down for X amount of hours
of just like sitting in front of our
computer so coding it's not for you now
if you're one of the persons that want
to be more more active and you know and
you like to be in the few you like to
get your hands dirty study to become a
 you know how is it something
energy I forgot the name of it renewable
energy is something like that
but solar panels naren's install
 solar panels that's just 90,000
dollars you know and I think that's
where I'm gonna be turning my channel
more into I'm gonna create coding phase
but I want to also make it where it's
like not just about coding I feel like I
want to make this channel more about
technology-based like you know careers
and technology things that could help
you out with technology guys who are
making robots guys who are
learning machine learning all of that
stuff I feel like I could make this
channel about that and that's where I'm
going with it
you know what do I think about Tesla
Tesla is good man if you look at my
Instagram doesn't let them guys follow
my Instagram coding phase Instagram coms
that are scrolling face the same way as
this channel my Instagram you're gonna
see a lot of personal like you know
you're gonna see that our own a whole
bunch of Tesla
 stocks so I'm definitely a
believer in Tesla
a working Python right now problems
myself I finished the course before
starting the web development course
yeah just finish it Python is great it's
just hard because they're not like
they're not hiring everybody for Python
you know because those are things like
sometimes you want to learn something
that's cool it's like me like I spend a
lot of time learning react native but
there's not really jobs out there like
for react native exclusively but you
can't just go for like search or indeed
react natives there's not that many jobs
for it or even crystalline like there's
not that many jobs for it but you
getting some type of joy out of it and
you learn a lot you know so yeah go
ahead and learn Python that's what you
know makes you happy
yeah man sometimes yeah if you light it
I don't know sometimes it's good if you
lied a bit you know and sometimes it
could be bad but I don't know it it
depends on the situation
if you mix web developer machine
learning stuff on the channel that would
be great yeah I think that's something
that I want to do I want to bring in
more technology-based topics to the
channel and I just want to be able to
bring in more you know more different
you know different opportunities for
everybody where it's just not about
coding not just coding I want people to
just be able to just make a living from
technology you know anything that has to
do with technology and everything has to
do with coding at the end of the day cuz
if it's done with technology it has to
do with coding at some point so it makes
sense with the China named coding phase
but yeah man
how do you ask for a raise I don't even
know to be honest which I've known I've
never really asked for a raise in a
company most of the time whenever I want
to get an upgrade I want to get more
money I just leave the company that's
being honest with you guys I've only
been there I go to a company work there
and if I feel like I could get more
money somewhere else I just leave I've
been out okay guys it's been great
working with you guys till we give them
a two-week notice and then I'm gone I'm
not attached to any company I'm attached
to to myself that's what who I'm
attached to you know I like the people
there but the company itself you can
never get attached to it because then
you're gonna pigeonhole yourself but
yeah man
bro IQ doesn't mean anything man I know
people who who they had a more like
 special ed when there was little
kids and you know like that doesn't mean
nothing cuz then later on they make my
money and they're mad smart the
IQ test doesn't really mean that much
I'll be honest with you but yo anyways
