building this website
I mean it's looking good right now
there's definitely a couple little
things I might want to fix here but yeah
let's continue with this we got a long
way to go
okay so let's continue alright so first
of all let's find the icons imma see so
the noting number I actually want to put
in the border to be two pixels okay just
to make a little bit thicker all right
making a little bit thicker let me see
what else maybe three three pixels yeah
three pixels is fine okay bring this
down a little bit make it to three
pixels okay they gone now it's looking
more compact okay we're gonna move this
to I say seven pixels to the right let's
bring this up some pixels to the top a
little bit higher let's try a little bit
more 10 pixels to the right okay let me
see how it looks on all of them take
this here put the active on each one
okay yeah I think that looks good so we
got one that's gonna be one day Jay
another one is gonna be two digits
I see so we got that
I think maybe I should do it to one
digit just one digit and then depending
on how much it is then I'll do something
like this where I'll say if it's greater
than nine notifications I'll do that
nine plus okay so it just tells them
like hey there's more than nine okay so
that's fine so instead of doing like
doing a whole bunch of different numbers
like you know three digit notifications
like if it's three digit notifications
like that's ridiculous you get what I'm
saying okay so let me move this down a
little bit all right see sort of right
let's just put that seven seven pixels
is fine yeah okay now you know so just
get something here because it's just
bothering me let's just make the
background blue already like the design
okay so you just put that in just for
the hell of it just to get it done so
let's put in for the background off the
messenger what is the dark side blue
lights are blue say search background
ptex
Darkseid put this here background for
the messenger now that's cool having
that blue background there now we we
sort of get how this thing is gonna work
and I was gonna look let's make sure we
start working on the content area so
this area right here so let's do this
okay let me see how I set up the HTML so
we've got content area okay we got
search-header so I'm gonna bring that
down then here I'm gonna come create a
div and then I'm gonna say content okay
let me see content container matter of
fact let's switch this up the names
doesn't make sense so I'm gonna change
this content area to content container
and then in here I'm gonna name this
content area now for this we're gonna
change this wherever it says content
area we're gonna find and replace so by
doing command F okay fine with says
content area we're going to change it to
content container okay find/replace
there you go
save that and everything is working
exactly how it was before okay so we're
gonna have this right here called the
content area not the whole section all
right now we're going to have a status
section so there's what we write our our
statuses right
okay so what do we have here
right let's see let's call this compose
compose compose section okay so that's
what you gonna compose your status okay
now let's start breaking things down so
we have an image we have a text area and
then we have three buttons okay so let's
do that now first of all let's do the
the text area
let me just don't like this text area
okay then we have the image which can be
a div div and then use our image
okay copy this and let's paste a couple
of times so we have user image let's say
photo okay photo button okay photo
button a video but in and send button
okay all right now let's see what we got
here so that's what we got so far okay
we're going
same thing that we did for the text the
input field where we basically said
something like this where we gave me
like a max a max with me see where is it
search-header K along ok search box okay
so and I do this copy it from here okay
we're going to basically not paste it
there cuz we need to paste inside of the
compulsion so compose section I'm gonna
say oops my fault that's not the the
part either so let me see the worst uh
the beginning of this so this is
search-header inside of the content
container we got compose there's a
compose section okay and then here it's
what we paste us in okay save that
all right we are going to give this text
area we're gonna say text area text area
we're going to say with 100% let me see
what's going on okay so that's fine
okay now I want to see why
okay there's 600 pixels
that's 630 okay so for this
and 630 let me see I gotta put in the
border was a box sizing border box
that's why what it needs so throughout
the whole the whole website we're gonna
add this to make sure we we basically
keep track of this we're gonna do a star
I'm gonna say box size in border box
that's just to make sure that if we say
hey we want this to be you know 600
pixels it has to be 600 pixels no matter
what even if we include border even if
we include padding no matter what we
want each element on the page to beat
the exact width that we give it instead
of trying to you know compensate with
the extra size okay now let's go back
down okay we got text area we're gonna
say was a ptex text field okay so I'm
gonna say color text field save that or
matter of fact where is it not this this
area here we're gonna say like that put
in background okay border none' border
radius I say 4 pixels okay then the
compose
section is gonna have a padding so it's
gonna have a padding of top of let's say
20 you know say 50 pixels topped and
bottom so let's say 0 left to right top
and bottom 50 pixels
okay see this a little bit too much let
me calculate how much we really want
like 35
okay so 35 35 pixels top and bottom okay
now oh we got to go to UI faces
you
you
you
okay copy this you can take any images
from there take anyone okay so let me
see we got composed section we have user
image and then we're gonna say
background URL and then paste this in
semicolon we're gonna say height I'll
say 60 pixels width 60 pixels okay so
this is it
alright has the image there now we're
gonna say background position Center
center then we gonna say background see
it was a background color position
repeat no-repeat background sighs we're
gonna say cover what else we need
background position repeat size cover
that's about it I think for now I should
be fine
there you go so we have two image there
now the next thing we want to say we
want to do border radius we're gonna say
50% so it could be a perfect circle okay
that that's the perfect circle for us
okay and we look at the size of this
image how big is it so let's say 42 so
we want this to be 42 or even better
let's just say 40 40 pixels
forty pixels going to say border we're
gonna put in five pixels five pixels
solid and color is going to be white
okay now we're gonna come here we're
gonna make compose section to be
position:relative okay let's say
position:relative we're going to see the
user image is going to be
position:absolute when I say top zero
okay now we're going to make sure we say
left zero we're going to see how much
you give we gave padding on the
container so 35 pixels so from there to
there 35 pixels so let's say top it's 35
pixels okay now
we want to make this negative 15 pixels
okay
we're gonna say 20 pixels
and I think that's fine even though the
thing was inside I kind of don't want to
put it inside like that I want to put it
like in a corner okay and I want to make
sure that when we start writing
it'll be like it'll start writing like
up here so that's putting a padding
okay so on the text area we're gonna say
padding I say 15 pixels on top 14 pixels
on on bottom and then we're going to
actually see left to right let's say 40
pixels it's a little bit too much so
let's bring it down to 30 yeah so 30
pixels is fine let's put in font size
say to rim it's a little bit too big
let's say 0.5 mm okay
put in a height put it here height
maximum height is going to be
let's say 75 pixels okay so 75 pixels
let's make this a little bit smaller 1.2
RAM text okay I think there we go
we're good for now as far as that now
let's focus on on this here okay focus
on under under buttons the circles good
stuff okay so let's do this let's see
what we got so far we got photo button
video and send so let's get that from
font awesome you know what it's putting
a lighter color you know let's put this
girl let's give some girls some shine
okay
we always putting guys let's put some
some girls in the forefront okay making
nice get some nice colors there you go I
look sweet
looks nice okay now what is going to
font awesome to get the icons
now the icons that we need our photo
video and airplane
okay so photo you know why let's put in
the retro one just to be different used
to have a little sign different and I
haven't the same thing okay copy
scum here photo okay go back
search for video
copy this from here paste this right
here just give it a little space you
know just make it nice and pretty
okay now let's look for airplane
air plane or send I don't have a little
airplane paper there you go paper plane
let's copy this for me here okay
okay cool
now the next thing that we want to do is
we're gonna make the the buttons right
so let me come back down here with this
user image so right below it we're going
to create buttons okay we gonna say
buttons and then let me add that so here
so we're gonna say buttons or button
button sounds better well nope no s okay
and what we're going to do it okay we
got button now we're gonna say padding
let's say five pixels all around we're
gonna say font size
phone-sized I say 1.5 rim okay we're
gonna say let me see what we have
what's the image okay so here we're
gonna do a gradient on this button and
we also have to do a box shadow so let's
do that now we close this windows that I
have here let's say box shadow generator
you
I'm gonna say zero-zero
okay you see if I could copy the box
shadow box the box shadow that we
already did and that we already used we
can reuse this again see if I copy that
can I paste it here no let me see if I
can maybe I could tweak it okay
something missing messenger or is it
button paste is here okay we're gonna
say I just realized something
so all these buttons we have to put
inside of another div call buttons okay
so now we could have more control of the
elements okay so we got this I'm gonna
create another class inside of this it's
just gonna be but in this one we're
gonna turn it back two buttons okay save
that all right there you go
we're
see display:inline-block okay
now the buttons we're gonna say position
position:absolute I'm gonna say write
zero so you could start at the right
okay exactly what we want and we're
gonna say top or let's say better bottom
bottom zero okay so we got bottom zero
alright and let's start moving this up
let's say 25 pixels okay bring this down
a little bit let's say zero there you go
alright now we're going to say we're
gonna make this these buttons each one
of them we gotta make a border radius
okay
50% so it could be a perfect circle
oops border radius save that and there
you go we have a perfect circle okay
we want to do is we want for the button
to be to have some space around each
other so when I say margin margin left
say 15 pixels okay let me look at this
how it looks the icons are too big so
let's make them a little bit smaller
let's say zero oops
say one okay and then we're gonna give
our a fixed height so let's say
something like this let's say 40 pixels
with 40 pixels okay
now will we
do is we want to say for the button say
display flex okay so you got that kind
of copy this we're gonna make this to be
this play flex on the top okay now I'm
gonna say a line items center justify
content center and there you go so it's
always gonna be centered all right now
we're gonna say the background of each
button is gonna be white okay there you
go we want to flip this this button
around so let's say in here we're gonna
say like this Missy what's the name of
the icon f8 paper plane FP paper plane
we're gonna say transform roll
Tate Missy alright and right here we're
gonna say ten degrees okay let's
continue let's say 90 degrees it's a
little bit too much 70 degrees 60 say
fifty fifty degrees okay all right now
we need gradients okay so we're gonna
come back to the gradients I say
gradient CSS generated gradients okay
I'm gonna come here double click here
okay and go back to the variables I'm
gonna say light side so you can see this
a grading that goes from light to bottom
so that's what we didn't want to do
we're gonna copy this I'm gonna say
light side blue and dark side blue okay
so to do this we're gonna come here
paste out there and then here we're
going to paste the dark side
copy that and there you go
okay now the direction should be from
top to bottom okay yeah so there you go
we're gonna come here copy all of this
okay
let me see what else you gotta come here
what says what was the name of this send
button okay so send button and just
paste us in okay so let me see
so we got also so you got to put an end
because send button is not inside of
this element it's actually a class that
has that it's a button that has that
class okay so the next thing that we
want to do where is it send button
there's something that I wanted to do I
can't remember all right cool
oh yeah so we want to turn this to a
darker color and this is gonna be white
so let's do that now so we're gonna say
color white color white and then for the
color of the font of all the buttons I'm
gonna say color and then I believe is
the H text that's the color for that so
let's do H text okay cool
let me see what else
smaller than that buttons is looking a
little bit too big remove the padding ok
so remove the padding the size size is
fine just a circle itself needs to be a
little bit smaller so let's put in 35 35
now let's put our 40 40 is fine now
we've got a more
a little bit more so I'm gonna come here
and move the buttons right 15 pixels so
yeah we're pretty much done as far as
this part we're gonna move on to the
next video
alright guys which is gonna be this
section down here which is actually the
updates alright guys so I will see you
guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
