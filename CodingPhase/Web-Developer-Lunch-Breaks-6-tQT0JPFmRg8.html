man coding face.com listen your boys
back I didn't did it again okay all
right man I want to see what's up with
you guys man today we're going to start
something different you know I'm gonna
do you know my web developer lunch
breaks like I usually do but this one's
going to be shorter and this one I'm
gonna be answering questions you know
whatever questions you guys might have
go ahead ask me anything that you want
man
I'm here you know I'm open down more
open yo gotta go to get it yo down more
open go let me know that was goes good
we got new peoples in here okay you
Schwein what up how's everything boy
your boy Joe is in here man guys let me
know any questions you guys might have
I'm here what's the story for today the
story for today is everybody that's here
needs to make sure that they fill out
the survey guys come on man there's
5,000 of ya only a hundred of you guys
filled it out which means you know like
I know it's better chances when nobody
fills it out so like whoever actually
does fill it out gets to win but at the
same time it's like if you guys fill out
the survey I get at least I get more
more information right more information
from you guys and like that could make a
you know all better better channel for
you guys but it shows for you you know
better a better series and also make
sure you check out the survey go to my
channel there's a video call something
giveaways you know 5,000 celebrating
5,000 subscribers so click on that video
on the description I have a survey it's
gonna take you two seconds just be like
okay yes yes no whatever I like this
it's like eight questions you know
it's not like a census like a census
survey I'm not asking you how many kids
you got in your house I'm all I'm asking
is like very simple questions but yeah
man how about you guys you know if you I
want to ask me anything let me know I'm
here okay so
segi says I want to ask if I have to
learn PHP symphony or angularjs first um
I'll be honest I don't I mean Symphony
some people are you still using it but
if you're gonna learn any PHP like um
framework it has to be liable like
that's the industry standard now
everywhere you go is PHP laravel
nobody's using anything else no code
ignitor no um buzzy there was one that
was called slim people were talking
about a few years ago nobody's using
those everybody's on laravel now
so even Symphony I think Symphony is
part of a laravel framework too so you
don't really need to learn it just learn
larva that's it that's what you got to
focus on plus that's where all the jobs
are right now as far as angular j/s if
you want to learn angular you can it's
not gonna hurt you trust me
the thing about PHP and the thing about
angular is that a lot of people don't
want to work on it meaning like you know
seasoned developers don't want to work
on PHP seasoned developers don't want to
work on angular because this other cool
frameworks out there so for you guys who
are brand-new developers that's I go a
no brainer like you have to learn those
because that means that there's less
competition for you guys and you know
like you could actually just relax and
just go over there you know and just
like start applying
couple stomach freakin jackets annoying
but yeah man so let me see what else
while the questions you guys have
how long have I been coding well I
started at the end of like I will say I
I first started dabbling into it but
when I was like 14 years old but you
can't count that because after 14 years
old I never played around with it ever
again until 24 25 so you know what I
mean so yeah let me see so I would say
like wow I'm 29 I'm gonna be 30 at the
end of the year so five years checking
in from Santo Domingo can okay I need to
go back to the are man lying to me and
Santo Domingo gell okay
man is a vampire I went to bed at 3 a.m.
we woke up at 12:30 your boy Matt it's
out here man
man I gotta go to freakin England man I
got so many people in England it's never
funny
I got a touchdown my peoples and you
know the Western out there and London
London town you know okay let me see
hi everyone I've been watching a few
videos we'll introduce to you by airing
in beta and Chris Jones videos Thank You
serese I really appreciate it I really
really appreciate that you know airing
in beta and Christian they they love the
channel to the same way how I love their
channels and you know like I really
appreciate that you know once in a while
they mention my name in there you know
it feels good you know for to get love
from your peers people who started at
the same time as you basically you know
like we all started pretty close to the
same time but yeah man let me see what
else let me see
so you will start with new tutorials one
more people fill out surveys no I'm
actually starting a new tutorial today a
very fun tutorial you know like people
been asking me Joe when are you going to
teach us you know full-stack you know in
a technology that you know a programming
language that it is going to give me a
job so today I'm gonna start my first
tutorial on a full-stack meaning I'm
gonna go from 0 to 100 and I'm going to
create a trending store meaning
something that you could show to your
you know your future employer and say
hey I created this page you could use it
for your project so I don't know if you
guys have heard of
bate b8 PE basically a bathing ain't
bright the clothing line so I'm going to
create a store while we are we're going
to create a store for bait all right and
yeah and we're basically going to get it
out there we're going to well imma start
today I'm gonna start with the basics of
HTML basically building the page
breaking down the page into layout and
then I'm gonna give you guys two images
I'm going to give you guys the design so
you guys can look at it and see exactly
how we're going to build it we're also
gonna do some JavaScript are probably
going to use react so you're going to
learn react at the same time and then on
top of that I'm gonna make it in laravel
so you're gonna learn larva at the same
time too so basically you're gonna see
how a page is done from ground zero to
the end and I'm gonna explain it really
really well like I'm gonna do this thing
in a very professional manner where I'm
gonna have slides explaining things I'm
gonna have you know just everything I
want to make it I've been looking at
everybody's tutorials everybody's
courses on udemy the people that I
really like like you know see Frank
Rider you know cold steel and I'll be
honest I'm gonna steal a little bit of
everybody of everybody style the people
that are respect meaning I'm gonna take
the professionalism that they use on
their videos you know the way how they
take their time to actually go in there
and edit the videos like there's no
mistakes there so I'm not going to make
no mistakes I'm gonna have good slides
so you could know exactly what we're
building how we're building it and why
we building it so it's going to be
pretty cool also the reason why I want
to do this and take it to the next level
because from looking at the serving it
seems like everybody that comes here and
filled it out they
of my advice right but the thing that
they chose that I need to improve on is
the tutorials so this tutorial I'm gonna
go all out I'm gonna make an amazing
tutorial on this and yeah I'm gonna make
it as if I was gonna sell it you know
like I'm really gonna put in my time on
this and then just give you guys the
best tutorial or you know being full
stack PHP that I can give you of course
like I said you know this thing isn't is
going to take time meaning if you don't
see a tutorial if you don't see two to
three videos every day on the tutorial
don't be surprised
there might there's gonna be one at
least one every single day but don't
expect to have the whole tutorial the
whole course in one week because this
this thing is going to take a long time
meaning it's going to take at least a
month of just like making videos every
single day do you know so don't expect
this thing to just be like hey like you
know some people when I was doing the
the Rakhi stack and trying to teach it
to you guys some people will be like oh
man you're doing one video every two
three days and it's like bro I'm doing
this for free like I'm taking all
my free time to do this and like you
guys don't understand how long it takes
you to make tutorials these things are
not easy because you got a planet you
gotta explain it you got a code it so
it's a lot of
you're rocking a football jacket you
already know man bring out my brazilian
Brazilian African jackets man so why is
Larry Bell so hot oh why because it just
it has all the tools and all the
features to make your life easier
what you could building in there well
back in the days people will have to
build it you know from scratch you have
to be authentication you will have to
build migrations you have to build so
much things that you know even sessions
session management system a session
management system and it's like all in
this year if you were to code it from
scratch it's gonna take you forever
right now of course the problem with
frameworks is like let's say right now
you start using larvae like you could
become a nice terrible developer
but if you like right now after you take
this course you're going to learn
lerigot you're going to learn PHP you
know just just enough to make you
dangerous and just enough to get you a
job but you have to understand this
you're learning the framework you're not
learning to build it yourself meaning
everything that the framework is giving
you you don't know how to do it yourself
from scratch so for you to understand
those concepts like creating a user
authentication dinner with sessions and
all the stuff you have to build it
yourself at one point like right now co
hire you if you know lerigot and you
know how to do it whenever i co hire you
right but later on as you become a are a
developer right you got to take your
time to learn all those concepts by
yourself meaning learn how to code or
user authentication dealing with
sessions and and all the stuff that you
do with larva - the framework you got to
learn it on your own time basically just
to do it manually so you can understand
how to build things
because at one point you know you could
use the framework but what point there's
going to be a problem that you're going
to hit and you're going to be like oh
what's going on the frameworks start
working and it's because you might be
missing the concept of how to build it
yourself it's just the same thing as
bootstrap or any other framework out
there you know but I mean that's what I
did a lot of stuff that like you know
from even from JavaScript I didn't know
how to do in vanilla JavaScript I know
how to do in jQuery and then I found a
job and I learned those like other
concepts later on you know but at least
I had a job and that's like the same
thing that I tell you guys you know once
you're already dangerous enough to just
start making pages and start making cool
 start applying and then as you get
paid you know to learn more advanced
stuff at least you're getting paid to
learn the advanced stuff at your job
don't just wait and be like oh I'm gonna
or say hey I'm gonna try to learn every
advanced thing now before I get a job in
Psych no bro like get a job first so at
least you're getting paid for that
training that you put it in you know
what I mean so yeah yeah there's
definitely a lot of jumps of PHP in
Atlanta for sure it's 30,000 a year good
job for my first web development job
yeah I will say yeah because you got to
think about it like this you're gonna
get hired you're going to stay at the
job for you know a few months in reality
if they paying your thirty thousand
dollars what they're gonna do is make
you do little easy right if you see
that they're givin you a lot of
technical work a lot of difficult work
be like hey I need a raise because I
know what what this is worth now for you
guys that never had a job you just gotta
take whatever you get like I told you
guys my first job was like I was getting
$14 an hour fourteen fifteen dollars an
hour
which is close to that 30,000 that
you're talking about I didn't go in when
I oh I'm getting ninety thousand hundred
thousand of our first job that's not
true when I started there wasn't no
situations like that you know right now
companies are desperate you know like
people are getting hired like you could
lie you could pretty much lie your way
through an interview like god I've seen
it done plenty of times um a lot of this
or boot camps
I don't even like to mention
boot camps that I've done so many videos
on it but um even the way how to give
the training on how how to go into an
interview and and ask for a higher
paying all the stuff in reality is kind
of tricking the employer because a lot
of those people are not worth 19 you
know 90k they're not worth 80k then our
70k because they're brand new developers
they don't know anything it's like you
get paid with you your work you're not
gonna get paid a astronomical number
you're not getting no you know
football numbers just out of nowhere
you gotta get freaking you got to start
at the bottom and a lot of companies are
becoming smarter because of that they're
like you know what man we're paying a
lot of this new people coming in a lot
of money and they're not even ready yet
so yeah thirty thousand man take it if
they giving it to you thirty dozens
just take it look at your job get your
experience and then start applying other
places that's it
best skill to learn as a new web
developer the best skill to learn is to
be able to make any design that somebody
gives you right that's one right so if I
give you any design you should be able
to recreate that into our living page
with HTML and CSS if you can't do that
then you're not ready to become a
developer now basically to become a
front-end developer right
now if you're leaning more to the
backend the most essential thing that
you gotta find and you got to learn is
basically sequel learning my sequel
learning Postgres I mean once you learn
sequel you know Postgres you know my you
know my sequel you know Maria DB like
once you know sequel you already know
all the other little management
databases software that's out there
right let me see
I've noticed that PHP jobs I'll also
want you to know JavaScript run when
they ask you hey they want you to know
JavaScript is just to understand
JavaScript do you understand what's the
Dom do you know how to do little things
with jQuery if you're going in for
back-end developer they're not expecting
you to go in there and be like hey this
person knows everything you react and
everything in the front like no they're
not expecting you that to know specially
if you're like a brand new developer
like all they want you to do is know the
basics but you got to choose one thing
that you're gonna be really good at so
you are going to be really good at the
front end or you're going to be really
good at the back end right now
so become a journey develop I have a
unlearn I have to learn Photoshop or
illustrator no but it's very convenient
to learn Photoshop it's like yesterday
like I'm doing this tutorial for you
guys today and
pretty much I had to go in there and
remove the background of the images that
I'm gonna give you guys right
if you don't know Photoshop then you
won't be able to do that right it took
me like an hour to to basically do all
the designs and and take the background
of the images and all the that I
wanted to do to prepare for you guys but
if you're a developer that don't know
how to do that then now you gotta hire a
designer you know so at least if you
know a little something then yeah just
know the basics of Photoshop understand
what layers are that's it
for tents fantastic yeah just man if you
work your remote manages you know be
grateful man 30k man you working from
your house
be grateful get your experience and
start applying for other places too what
is a full stack web developer full stack
web developer means you are somebody who
knows the front-end and knows the
backing now you don't have to be a
master in the front end and you don't
have to be a master in the back end what
it means is you know how to dabble into
both of them you don't have to master
any of them when you're a full stack web
developer I've seen people who are full
stack web developer and they only know
the basics of both you know but when
when people really care about this can
you do it can you go into the front end
can you go into the back end do you
understand what's going on in the page
and the server do you know how things
are being loaded in the front page let's
say okay hey Joe my name is Addison I
just started getting serious about
coding I just wanted to say you're one
of the people that really gave me a push
to start yeah man I want you to you know
take this thing take this opportunity
and just go with it man right now
there's a lot of jobs guys and the
economy is up so the best thing I will
say for you guys is try to get into a
job now right away you know like take
advantage now you don't know what's
going to happen a year two years from
that you know a year two years from now
businesses might not be booming how they
are now and they might not just not they
might not just be hiring brand new
developers they might just say you know
what we can't take that risk
to hire a brand new developer so then
you lose out because you know oh man I
should have done this two years ago and
now I'm gonna tell you yeah you should
have done it now you know okay call this
face very exciting project actually
looking forward to it
let me see how often will you release
the episodes I will release the episodes
once a day sometimes if I get to do like
four videos in one day I'm going to do
two a day because I'm going to be honest
with you guys
this is my plan my plan is all the
videos that I'm gonna do from now on are
gonna be more professional that's one
and number two they're all gonna be
recorded on Sundays because like I said
I'm gonna have a baby soon I'm gonna
have a baby soon and I think it wouldn't
be fair for me to come home from work
and then start doing videos and start
going to my computer and setting things
up like it's not going to be fair for my
girlfriend's not going to be fair for
the baby so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna do all my videos on Sundays and
then I'm gonna basically schedule them
to come out once a date once or twice a
day throughout the week depending on how
many videos I record now of course I'm
gonna do my web developer lunch breaks
that I always do with you guys here and
yeah and maybe once in a while I might
do a video or like on a Wednesday or
Tuesday cuz I want to bring back my
podcast you know bring your new gassing
and you people to come to the show right
but I'm not going to do videos every
single day I'm gonna rerecord them on
Sunday and then from there release them
throughout the week I love your
dedication channel thank you man thanks
Orlando was good I'm doing the nodejs
full stack I will stop in the front end
and do some more bootstrapping cinema
before going to node yeah I would say
you could do that too you know like I
told one of my one of my boys so I'm
actually mentoring you know privately
basically I told him hey you know take
the coats coats course right the web
developer boo can
as you do one in one video right follow
what he tells you right and then at the
same time have another page where you're
recreating what you just learned there
and by implementing it in another page
so like that you're doing it twice
you're basically watching the video and
then copying whatever on code wasn't
 the web developer boot camp the
course tells you and then on the same
time once you're done with that then you
go to your page and you implement that
into the into your page
make sure y'all give your boy a like man
so Google cut and I'll show us to other
people's man what's up dang without
without without kit how to get freelance
clients man talk to you know find out
look that's what I used to do right so
like I say this a restaurant around
where you live and you know that
restaurant doesn't have a website talk
to the owner be like hey man I'll do
your website tell them I build your
website for free right build their
website for free and tell them hey to
maintain it I'm gonna charge you you
know fifty dollars an hour you know all
the time you know restaurants they need
new changes like oh I need to change a
menu price or something whatever
so you just charge them even though it's
going to take you two minutes to do it
even like hey man I get paid by the hour
so even if it takes two seconds is fifty
dollars so in the end is going to pay
off or you could just start building
relationships tell one of your friends
one of your friends has a business or
you know somebody who is trying to get a
website tell them hey man I could build
your website for cheap
what's up my boy 84
get up.get man 84 man I need to invite
men to the studio man your studio is
looking legit son I like it
yeah but when they say learn JavaScript
guys it's like this it's the basics
meaning do you know what the hell is
some variable do you know how to do
loops so you know how to do if
statements do you know how to do
everything else do you know how to do
switch do you know how to do filters do
you know a little bit of es6 that's all
you really need you don't need to become
a master of JavaScript to learn jQuery
you know at all because all of that
stuff is going to take time
no course is going to teach you
everything that you're going to learn
from JavaScript I'm being honest with
you guys what you're going to learn in
any course that anybody gives you is the
basics and gets you to think on how to
solve problems with JavaScript that's it
that's all that anybody can do for you
because this is something that you have
to adapt your brain into thinking like
you know how would the the program run
how is it that the compiler is going to
run how is it that the browser works how
is it that computer works all of that
stuff is going to take your time you
know trial and error that's it
Brian g-man without--without what up
what up guys so coming from C++ and
Python or C mail CSS doesn't look like
programming it looks like memorization
what do you guys think yes Clarence I
agree with you
HTML CSS is not programming at all it's
about remembering things so it's like
hey you know like let's say an example
you know the page has a background right
so it has a different background color
so you got to think of in your hand
right oh how do you change the
background color you go on Google search
change background color you will find it
on the CSS it says background color or
background and you will see that you
have to put a hex on hexadecimal always
a hex color or whatever exact single
color right so it's all about memory all
the stuff is about memories about also
googling and also looking at things
online the best resources that's out
there is HTML rerun with it
HTML references that il and CSS
references the i/o you look at those and
you're always going to find the answer
to any problem that you might have with
HTML and CSS but it's all about memory
it's just about remembering how to do
certain things like once you figure it
out one time I go yeah that's how you do
a drop-down now you know how to do it
for the rest of your life you know
what city are you from Joe well I'm from
New York man raised in New York born in
Dominican Republic I live in Long Island
and yeah I'm in the outskirts I'm in the
outskirts of New York man I'm in the
suburbs kids sorry guys I I'm super late
I'm just reading everybody's thing you
make me making me want an SUV now your
boy Chris Sean without what I would up
think you got a Prius I mean it makes
more sense for you you live in
California you basically driving around
constantly so a Prius will be good for
you you know you'll save money me I just
I said it
you know I like my SUVs I like being
comfortable you know I like knowing I
got space you know like the ceiling is
not like right on top of me the window
is not right next to me
I can freakin move this thing all the
way back I got space I'm good you know
so that's why I like it without without
without wood or wood up Josh what up
hTML is the pay structure yeah that's it
programming is easy man
so you're going to do another mentor
session this summer I might do it but I
don't know like I told you guys I'm
having a kid so I can't just you know
neglect my my first kid like I'm gonna
give him time so like I said I'm
recording all my videos on Sundays and
then releasing them throughout the week
every single day I'm releasing one
