PHP framework took because now it's
about time all right
so pretty much what you've been learning
so far is the syntax of PHP so you learn
the programming language of PHP that's
what you did this whole time all right
you learn how to play around in the
views you learn conditionals you learn
functions you learn objects you learn
you know classes you learn all the good
things all right cool but what do you do
with that right we learned here that we
can actually come in and basically use
PHP files as a way to route our users
throughout the pages okay we can come
here say hey index is the home page
about is the about page projects is the
projects page contact is the contact
page all right that's a very very simple
way of using PHP all right and all the
little conditionals and low variables
that we did that's like super simple
that's like you know baby took now it's
time to take a series all right because
when you go to a job interview they're
not gonna ask you just like oh do you
know PHP they're gonna ask you hey do
you know how to use our MVC framework
and what exactly is MVC framework you're
gonna be like what the hell is that so
pretty much is model view controllers VC
is a way to structure your code because
what we've been doing is just coding you
know just for the hell of angels okay
here's the classes this we're gonna put
inside the classes folder in reality you
don't really do listen in a job
everything has to be in a structure
because there's going to be hundreds if
not thousands of files so there has to
be a structure to it okay so this how it
works
let's say a user lands on a page right
that triggers a class that basically is
the controller okay
the controller says hey this person
landed here and landed on this route
let's say google.com slash about right
when they land on
route which is the URL basically it
triggers this controller inside of this
controller we have multiple functions
for every single situation so I can come
here and say hey when they do a get
request show them the page which is the
view alright when they are about to show
them the page we need to get the model
which is dealing with the database all
right when we deal with the database
here we pass it back to the user on the
view and then the page loads all right
so we haven't really gone too deep into
the databases because I really wanted to
do it with the frameworks so like that
you could actually see it in action
better ok alright so now that we got the
data from the server right and we got it
from the model we pass it down to the
user and we display him whatever we need
to show him it could be a blog post it
could be a stats off the mba it could be
whatever the the website it's about we
show that to the user
alright and then now the user basically
he sees the page filled up with
information and I'm gonna give you a
very good example of this so I'm gonna
search let me see
blog let me see I want to search some
blog on Google let's say your popular
blog I don't even know was a popular
blog ok let's just say dropbox.com okay
when we landed on this page this
triggered a controller right and more
precise of it right it's probably a
class and then inside of that class
there's going to be methods inside of
them remember methods are functions so
when we land here that triggers the get
method right and then from there it goes
to the server goes in the backend it
triggers the model the model says hey
this person landed on this page they
want to get all the post alright cuz
right now we're seeing all the posts all
the latest post
so it basically says okay show them the
top five latest post right and put them
in order by the day
okay so then now it brings it back to
the view and then on the view it
populates all of this through a for loop
okay so think of the data that's coming
back from the server as an array and
there from there just on this page and
loops through it through every single
one okay same way how we do with loops
that's exactly what's happening here
alright and that's it that's pretty much
it now that's MVC okay in a very simple
way to explain it now of course we can
do this manually and write all of this
data I you know what happens with the
data what happening for the controllers
what happens with the view we can do all
this stuff manually right but what
happens is we start writing spaghetti
code we start now going the best
practices doing the best things that you
know the latest thing says we all have
our own way to code right but what
happens if we are in a team we need to
have a structure to say hey guys we're
actually going to follow the structure
that this framework has for us and we're
just gonna do it the way that they do it
okay so like that we could all speak the
same language how do you guys think that
there's teams all over the world right
working on the same project like let's
say Google and be people in India right
and they speak in their language and
they're still working on this project
there could be people in Japan speaking
in Japanese and still work on the same
project this could be people in
Argentina and speak Spanish and work on
the same project and every single one of
them knows what's going on and
understand the code because they follow
a convention of a framework okay there's
a lot of things that we can build on our
own but a framework does it for us it's
already coded it's like let's say yes we
could build a routing system yes we can
build our own erm but why
what we spent all that time what we
actually have to build a product right
if I have to build a website why would I
have to build something from scratch
when it's 2017 and we already have all
those tools you know there's people
that's been here for twenty thirty years
already building websites why would I
have to waste my time rebuilding
something that somebody did years ago
already right and I could just use that
code that he created to build my
application so this is exactly why
frameworks are very important okay now
we're gonna go into this we're gonna
talk about the top frameworks for you
know for PHP okay so first of all we're
gonna start with the big boys so you got
laravel Maribel's number one this is the
one that we're going to focus on on this
course and then you have other ones that
I'm gonna show you in a little bit all
right the beauty about laravel is that
it's very simple the documentation is
very easy to understand they have
amazing examples like let's say you
wanted to do something with database
right getting started automatically you
see my sequel post-grad sequel a sequel
server like it shows you where you got
to change it where you got to put in
your password like super simple like
nothing crazy let's say you wanted to
work with something in the view with
blade there's a templating engine which
we're gonna talk later on this is very
easy like it tells you exactly what's
going on extending layouts like it's
very easy very open and it just makes
your life so much easier because now you
can focus on the product that you gotta
build instead of worrying about hey
what's the best way what's the best
practices how should I do this how
should I make sure that my my
application is secure how can I stop
sequel injections all right how can you
stop that right blade already has it
Larry will has all of those things for
you
okay so you don't have to worry about
that it's the same thing as Symphony
Symphony is another one which pretty
much lerigot is on top of symphony right
is a framework that's using Symphony the
framework to actually work so it's
pretty cool then you have CodeIgniter of
the PHP framework that is very popular
out there in the community so you can
see you got 15,000 likes lon
having stars on on github which is
pretty popular man like you don't know
anything that's above 10,000 stars is
popular it means a lot of people use it
all right now the next ones that we're
gonna talk about our micro frameworks
okay there's three that we saw here our
full stack frameworks what they mean is
they have everything that you need you
know like I said from sessions to
cookies to dinner with api's and what
database is dealing with everything that
you need as a web developer there's
something there for you so you could
save time instead of you coding it from
scratch you know and this is not to say
hey guys don't code things from scratch
it's more of like hey if you're you have
to build a project a product for a
client or for a company they don't care
about you coding this yourself what they
care about is getting this product as
soon as possible outside and get people
to use it all right yeah you could go in
there and try to build it yourself
create your own framework but that's
something that you should do on your own
time that's something that you should do
for you to become more knowledgeable on
on basically in the language but to be
honest with you guys when you go to a
job you're always going to be using a
framework it's gonna be very rare that
they gotta tell you hey we want you to
build this from scratch unless it's a
special situation you know like this
situations where you building something
that has never been done ever right that
means that you have to build a from
scratch that's completely different you
know nobody's gonna ask you that as a
junior developer I'm being honest
nobody's gonna access too
thing that has never been created
especially as a junior developer this is
something that you know as you will
start getting older in your life and
also two more experience you know you
get bigger jobs and more things that
you're gonna be customized
but for now you're a junior developer
man like they just need that extra hand
all right now let's go into the micro
frameworks we got Silex we got lumen
we got slim let me start it up with
Silex so Silex is a framework by the
creator of symphony and you're probably
thinking in your head why would I use
Silex if they're symphony is a
full-stack framework it's like why do I
need to learn this well is it something
different okay let's say you have web
applications web applications we're
talking about full websites you know
website where somebody logs in they
register the saving data you know they
come back to the website you gotta keep
track of the sessions you gotta keep
track of their cookies you gotta keep
track of all those things all right
that's a full-stack framework you're
talking about for web applications now a
micro framework is good for situations
like let's say somebody has a video game
right they have a game on Android let's
say the game is flappy bird right flappy
bird today decided to go multiplayer
okay every time that the user scores and
guess a little faster or a little
farther than he did before it saves it
to a database we're gonna need to build
a full website for this no man all we
really need is just an API that we could
basically connect to from the android
game so how are we gonna do this instead
of us having a system that's gonna be
super bulky because think about it like
this every time that you have more
classes and more classes and more
classes it makes it bulky right it makes
it more heavier you want something to be
light so when we do
requests wait it says okay connect to
the database as soon as possible send
back the database to the user on the
Android phone as soon as possible
ASAP okay now something like laravel you
know Coronado Symphony they're very
heavy it's like it's like you have a
little fat boy and you're like hey man
take this down the block in two seconds
and it's like the little fat boy is
still trying to make it and he can't
like that's how it is all right he's not
gonna make it in two seconds so he needs
something light something that's just
pretty much just there to connect to a
database and send back data to the
Android or game that's it so that's why
micro frameworks are really good we're
gonna say something like this like a
situation where there's a supermarket
every single cashier there needs to send
back the data at the end of the day
right to a server in the back of the
supermarket how are you gonna do that
you're gonna create a full website for
that no you create just a small API to
connect to the song cashiers and then
from there at the end of the day they
click done and when it's done it saves
it to the database of the supermarket
that's it right this is super easy super
light and that's why this frameworks are
good so like I said we have Silex
by the guy that created Symphony we got
lumen by the guy that created laravel
and we have slim by the open source I
forgot who was the creator of this but
it's it's pretty much yeah it's a couple
of people you know and it's like it's
open source a lot of people are a part
of this team and yeah it's like it's
super easy super lightweight so I hope
you understand a little bit more about
why frameworks are important right
because this is why we're gonna focus on
now on this course from here on is
basically we're gonna use laravel which
is the most popular framework out there
and basically it's gonna give you the
biggest chance to get a job as soon as
possible because one thing about laravel
that's special about it
is that lateral comes from the world of
you know Ruby on Rails Ruby on Rails is
like the gold standard when it comes to
frameworks okay so when you know laravel
it's as if you know Ruby on Rails - the
only difference that Ruby on Rails is on
a different language but besides that
it's pretty much the same so not only
can you use this you can also use other
things like like I said Ruby on Rails
very similar you can also use Django
which is very similar to Ruby on Rails
then you can also use something like
Adonis Diaz which is extremely similar
similar to Ruby on Rails it's pretty
much they're all copy each other is just
being translated to different languages
so when you go to a job and you be like
hey I know Larry well it means you know
the MVC right and you know how to you
know if they use in whatever language it
is that they're using you could learn it
as soon as possible because you already
have experience with Larry Bell okay
Plus this like a lot of jobs out there
for Larry okay constantly I see jobs for
this so yeah and then you have lumen and
the reason why were you gonna use
looming is because since you're already
gonna know and you're gonna be in the
same path of Larry Bell we're gonna use
looming to create a very simple api's
okay keep things very light very easy so
yeah man I'll see you guys in the next
video I hope you guys enjoy this and
yeah we'll see you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
