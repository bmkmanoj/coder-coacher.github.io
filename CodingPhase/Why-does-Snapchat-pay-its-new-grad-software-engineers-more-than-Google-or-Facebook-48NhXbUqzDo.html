at it again man : crease comm missing
why does snapchat p is new grad so when
Jimmy is more than Google for Facebook
now this is a question from quarter like
I said I'm answer questions for Korra
guys and yes that's the new segment clip
show
alright well this is my personal opinion
this is why I think they they actually
pay more money than Google and more
money than Facebook
number one snapchats a new company they
know that if they want to grow they need
to bring in the top talent right a lot
of the new generation the new developers
you know young teenagers guys who are in
their you know early 20s they know about
snapchat they know that everybody's
using it they know that you know this
potentially so now what's now chest
doing is basically saying hey guys we're
going to pay you $20,000 more than
Google twenty thousand dollars more than
Facebook to basically just bring them in
you know really those guys in and say
hey get in this company there's going to
be a big future here for you guys and
they're not only that not only are they
paying them you know twenty thousand
dollars more but if you live in another
state they pay for your relocation you
know you can't be mad at that oh you
know if somebody comes to me and tells
me hey we gotta pay you twenty thousand
dollars more than the top companies out
there plus we're gonna give you another
$10,000 to relocate to our city why
wouldn't I do it you know so that's my
that's my answer to it that's my opinion
that's why I think they actually pay
more than Facebook and Google+ you know
you got to think about it like this for
a developer who knows that Google's been
around for over 10 15 years they got to
look at it in the net okay I want to go
to Google because
number one but if I get a little money a
little something extra to pay off those
you know college loans your student
loans that they have they might just
choose snapchat all right so yeah simple
job back at it again man coding face.com

much I took the courses they're pretty
cheap they're like $15 beads on specials
