you already know simple Joe back at it
again coding fees I done did it again
alright how we used to do it back in the
days right
every morning we used to release ones
video in the morning talking about
different topics and web development and
programming in general all right today's
topic is there's no high paying job
without hard work
okay so this goes to everybody who
thinks is like man you're gonna get in
easy oh it's like I'm gonna put in one
hour a day and you know I'm gonna do
only three days three days a week right
you're gonna take two years to become a
developer if you take you know that road
that path of being lazy you don't
understand this man I understand a lot
of you guys got jobs got families got
you know girlfriends boyfriends
you know people that want more attention
one more time from you and that's
understandable but if you want to get
paid a lot in this world you have to
work hard right even if you start your
own business tomorrow that business is
not gonna take off unless you work like
full-time or even like maxed out
after you go home you're still working
because there's your business right
that's the same thing as what
development web development programming
whatever you want to become you know you
easily could fall into a place of like
let's say for example you can say oh
yeah I know HTML CSS and then from there
you get a job in a small little
ecommerce company what they have you
listing products and editing a few
little pages let's say you know you you
work in there for two years and the
maximum you can make is like $45,000
right and I'm not saying that's that's
bad that's perfect for the first job
that's perfect for the first job and
going in there for like you know a few
months three to six months right but
that's not the goal that's not the place
where you want to end up at right so you
have to work hard right you know people
keep on asking me Joe like when is it
I'm ready to call myself a developer
you're really a developer when you can
build any website that anybody can throw
at you right you can become a front-end
developer and say hey all I do is
basically to the front end you give me a
design and I build that you could be one
of the guys in the backend and basically
still with the databases deal with you
know the Linux servers dealing
you know maintaining the system making
sure everything's running making sure
that when you get high traffic you know
the frickin website doesn't crash you
know you could be one of those guys it
will be DevOps if you just literally
just work on on the freakin servers and
that's it aw yes all day that's the only
job you know but all of that comes with
hard work man and that's the only way to
do it man if you think that you're gonna
get there by you know half-ass me just
like I'll do it in my free time it
doesn't work like that
yes nobody that's that's popular nobody
that's famous nobody that's a rich
nobody that's successful in any type of
field doesn't do it without hard work
unfortunately you know sometimes you
might be lucky and somebody might put
you in positions that you could actually
you know potentially become something
but at the same time it still revolves
around hard work and somebody could come
in and say hey this is my cousin he's a
great developer you guys could
definitely hire him right but then once
you're in there for a week and they
realize like yeah you suck and you don't
know what the hell you're doing and you
don't really love to do this and you
don't really you know keep up with
things your asses out
I've seen people get fired in the third
week of a job you know
they work there for the first week which
is just pretty much not doing anything
which is just like showing people oh
here's here's the the lunchroom here's
the you know there's the office for HR
this is your map project manager this is
where you go here to you know smoke your
cigarette you know that's the first week
no matter what job you work at you can
work in a factory you could work
wherever you act the first week you
ain't doing no work the first week is
like it's all the BS of like I'll make
sure you bring your Social Security make
sure you bring your ID make sure your
brand is dis and that that's how it is
in every job no matter what cuz you
gotta set you you know you gotta set
yourself up but then the second week
that's when you show hey does this guy
cut it all right so I've seen people get
fired on the third week is that okay
that came in the first week they showed
them around the second week those like I
don't know this guy it might be the one
on the third week on Thursday they tell
you on Friday like hey man you know what
I don't think Little Billy is kind of
cutting so Friday they call you to HR
and it's how you hate man
you know we really appreciate that you
came to and you know you came here every
day on time and you know it shows you a
hard worker but I don't think you're you
know you don't fit the culture of the
company whenever people come in would
that be it the culture the culture is
just pretty much is like we don't want
you here right so that's what happens
man if you don't work hard and you don't
really you know step up and level up in
this field even if somebody puts you in
and say hey this is my cousin this is my
friend there's my brother if you don't
cut it you're out of here all right so
nobody gets put in positions without
actually being good at something I mean
and becoming good at anything is just
about but really just like working hard
working hard and actually coming in and
you know showing that you can do your
work but how do you show that you can do
your work the only way is by knowing
things and the only way you're gonna
know things is by working hard at your
house learning all of these things like
you got my website right I see people in
there that you know they come in they
register they're like oh man I love Joe
man I love everything that he's saying I
love everything that he does they do
like not even half of the HTML course
and then that I augment so you know it's
been a few days I'm gonna come back in
like two three months listen if you
don't do it now you're not coming back
you know I've had people hit me up what
I tell can I get a refund you know
because you know I don't think I'm gonna
be able to spend the time that I need to
put in right now guys if you cannot put
the time in now you're never going to
put in that time you know stop bringing
up excuses of like oh I got family
members coming over and I got people
doesn't that you can cancel my
subscription that's great go do it
somewhere else
but don't quit man just because you see
like hey there's a few little things
that might seem difficult guys every job
that's out there ants knows little oh
you know those are little problems where
it's like okay it looks difficult but
then once you get past that you're God
you got honest and so it's like why are
you giving up so early in the game don't
give up man like straight up don't give
like there's so much more out there man
you know like once you get past the
beginning stages you're gonna be fine
trust me this thing is so repetitive I
mean I'm not telling you guys say let's
build software you get what I'm saying
like we're not building software we're
not building freaking this is not
electrical engineering you gonna say
like this is web development like people
come into this thing with their eyes
closing somehow get jobs like this is
easy so y-you can't do it you get what
I'm saying like stop thinking in your
head that something is difficult right
even if it is difficult at first you got
to understand how are you gonna get paid
top dollars if if you're so quick to you
know so quick to quit like you gotta say
like how are you expecting their legs
you know you could work at McDonald's
McDonald's don't need don't need you to
use your brain at all right you could
work at UPS you don't even need to do
anything I had UPS all you gotta do be
standing around you know you either
doing deliveries on the truck if you're
a little bit smarter than the other
other guys who go actually go in for
their licenses and going for the
training because people are sometimes I
don't know what people think sometimes
like you know as human beings nowadays
I'm like man it's crazy people don't
want to put in no work you know this
reminds me of one of my friends who who
went to the Navy right when we was all
in high school he decided to go to the
name
so he went to the Navy ended up in Japan
and somehow not as we - you go to the
army you go to the Navy you go to the
Air Force you go to any part of the
Armed Forces you have the opportunity to
become whatever you want but you gotta
put in that work you say oh I just did
the training I did the you know I do the
basic training and that's it I don't
even want to study I don't want to do an
engineering I don't want to do mechanic
I don't want to work on on fixing
airplanes I don't want to do none of the
stuff I'm gonna be standing in a corner
I'm on the side to stand at a corner and
you stay there for six years becoming a
military police to not put in that work
to not put in that extra work that extra
work is you gotta study that extra work
you gotta go out your way to try to get
those opportunities it's easy to just
give up and say oh come on military
policeman yeah I'm just gonna stand here
I'm I'm basically a I'm in the army I'm
in the Navy as a freakin hindquarters as
a standing security guard
maybe you're telling me like with all
the opportunities that's in there you
decide to become a freakin military
police you decide to become a chef you
decide to become the guy cleaning the
floors like that's on you
nobody can get you out of those
positions unless you do it yourself so
you got to work hard you got to study
you got a you know try to achieve
something better than that
and then what's crazy now after six
years in the Navy and pretty much going
to Japan living in Japan for six years
doesn't know Japanese
now you telling me you said listen send
me to Japan sent me to Japan for six
months
like I will learn Japanese like I put in
that work you got to come back with a
skill you get once a it is just people
that are lazy people are lazy people
don't want to put in that work so
there's like going back to that story
even after he comes back he comes back
and then it's like oh yeah now I'm gonna
go to college like why in my head is
like why why why didn't you go to the
Navy then if he wasn't gonna do anything
with your life
why did you go to the name why did your
life come back with zero experience
nothing that you can show for to get
yourself a job out here no skills
why so then now you could go back to the
same level that you was on high school
like that's what you were supposed to do
after high school go to college right if
you don't know what you're gonna do with
your life you might as well go to
college and you know just get a BS
degree there right instead of going to
the Navy and waste six years of your
life and not do anything now
this going back to the main topic
there's no high paying job without hard
work you want to become a lawyer you
gotta go through like a whole bunch of
years of school you gotta go through a
whole bunch of testing you gotta go
through you know the bar you gotta pass
the bar you gotta there's people that
graduate they graduate from becoming a
lawyer you know the degree get into
degree criminal justice and stuff like
that right but they can't pass the bar
so it's like what was you doing it in
school
you got what I'm saying so same thing
we're doctors you want to be one of the
big boys right becoming a doctor
becoming a surgeon becoming you know the
guys that really make that money out
here hey it's gonna take you a lot of
time it's gonna take you a lot of work
you're gonna have to work hard you're
gonna have to study something that
people keep running away from people
don't want to study you know I myself
I'm guilty of one thing right and I'll
be honest me
I hate reading nah that's the truth I
hate reading you know when I was young
now I read more but it's more like
audiobooks and I mean it's not really
readiness listening listen to audiobooks
but when I was young I was like yo I
hate reading I don't it makes me sleepy
I don't want to sit down and have a
stupid book changing pages all right but
now I started getting older I realized I
might go maybe all the things that and
all the mistakes that I did
you know when I was young maybe I could
have read somewhere you know skills on
you know how to become an entrepreneur
earlier right I could have probably
found that one a book you gotta say so
same thing that's here now for you guys
people are like oh yeah man you know
I'll come back to this a month from now
come back to this two months from now
guys if you don't come back right now if
you don't do this now you're not gonna
do it period and then not only that I
listen we are at a time where you know
there's the opportunities that you get
man I consider web development I
consider programming I could say they're
coding technology right I consider that
the Neal you know manufacturing jobs you
know like how it was back in the 50s the
40s you know how you think like all of
this
how you call this generational wealth
became like all this stuff happened
because people you know they came in
they work hard they put in their time
they were working at General Motors or
Ford they were working at even factories
I I'm passing I'm in Connecticut right
now and I'm passing through a whole
bunch of different factories that out
here are completely closed right so
they're like run down but people found
opportunities at that time those people
that were working those factories back
then when money was money right you was
earning $50,000 for $2,000 it's like
$100,000 now right those people were
good people bought their houses they
build the houses for cheap so now you
have generational wealth you keep on
passing that down all right
it's like you know if you don't put into
work you're not gonna get no way man
right so it's like those people came in
the industries were booming back then
right just how technology is booming
right now we don't know what's gonna be
next right so let's say we have let's
say an example we have a good 20 25 30
years from now
yeah good 20 25 30 years that we're
gonna have to be able to make all the
money that we can as far as like
developers and technology right
constantly we keep hearing that
artificial intelligence is coming in and
gonna take jobs and this this and that
right but what if you make all the money
that you need it now
that's your prime your prime what you're
20-30 years old 40 years old right 20 25
years from now
who cares what was gonna happen 20 25
years from that you know why because you
already made your money right you're any
major money where you're like you're
good your kids are good you're your you
know your kids kids are good and that's
just how it works right so it's like
you're losing a huge opportunity right
now and
later on nobody's gonna be able to to
say hey is somebody else's fault no it's
your fault you didn't want to put in
that work man
you don't understand how people don't
want to say how the world works man it
kind of sucks when you're not coming
from a family that that has wealth to
have some money you're pretty much
starting from zero right that's what
happens I'm starting from zero like I
don't have nobody I don't have no backup
I don't have no family members I could
be like hey man let me alone you know
there's a lot of people that they have
those opportunities I don't have those
opportunities right because I'm like
well I'm like a first-generation
immigrant come to this country like I
don't know nobody here my only family
members that live in me in the United
States is literally my mom my sister and
one cousin who lives in Massachusetts
and I never see right so I don't have no
no no backup and a lot of you guys don't
have no backup a lot of you guys are
here you know three four generations
right and then you wonder what the hell
my parents were doing back in the days
and it's like you are the your parents
were either dealing with racism your
parents were either dealing with a whole
bunch of other BS that was there that
pretty much you're at the same level as
an immigrant that's coming in right
there's people out here that hey man my
my parents been here for four hundred
years right your parents been here for
four hundred years but you at the same
level as somebody who just came here off
the boat you have nothing your parents
have nothing your grandparents have
nothing and they ain't gonna leave you
nothing right somewhere down the line
somebody effed up right now
are you going to change that or not
right are you gonna continue that same
cycle where your kid and your kids kids
is gonna continue with that and being at
the bottom and continue with that insane
like damn man my grandfather was a piece
of he didn't do nothing with his
life he spent all his whole life at UPS
didn't even get a Social Security or
nothing
at the end of the day right didn't leave
nothing to me
didn't give me no opportunities now I
gotta start from zero that's what's
gonna happen you know I mean I keep
bringing back the people from like you
know 1940s 1950s right because it's
exactly what's happening now this
industry is booming and you don't know
how long this is gonna last this could
be a good 20 years a good 20 more years
and that's it
but if you don't set yourself up then
you're gonna be one of those people that
be like oh man I wish I would have been
part of the the dot-com bubble I wish I
would have been a part of the Bitcoin
Babu I wish I would have been part of
you know the technology bubble that's
happening right now with so many jobs
and so many opportunities I wish I would
have been one of those people you know
how many people are you know even the
people that voted for like Trump you
know how many people are so pissed off
right now that they're like hey man they
got no jobs they got no future they got
nothing else to live for you know and
this is not black white Hispanic you
know white this is more of like
everybody's doing stupid moves like that
right people come in and instead of
investing into things that is gonna pay
off in the long term they want to do
dumb careers they're gonna be here
module psychology hey I'm a dual
anthropology hey I'm gonna do
archaeology anything that ends up with
ology sounds dumb like it 20 2018 that's
- to be honest with you guys
anything ology at the end don't talk to
me about that that there's no future in
that there's a very selective you you
know like you're not gonna make money in
that man you gotta set yourself up and
you gotta set your future and in a way
where even if you die 20-30 years you
did you served your purpose in this
world you gotta say like I hate the fact
that people live in this world day to
day like what's gonna be your legacy it
was gonna be your legacy you want to be
that same truck driver you want for the
rest of your life you gotta have some
type of goals in your life you gotta
come in and say okay if I'm doing this
if I'm gonna be a truck driver for you
know for the next five ten years I need
to be saving money to be able to buy -
two or three different trucks so I can
actually open up my business there's
people that is not even doing that you
know what I'm saying so it's like even
with this man like you guys gotta work
hard you just gotta work hard you like
it or not it's all about working hard
nobody's gonna come in here and give you
anything
that's how the world works unfortunately
the world is a scary dark place where
it's like hey man there's the Predators
and there's the frame you get what I'm
saying like you want to be a predator
out here you want to be out here
somebody that's finding opportunities
and taking advantage of it right that's
what I did I came into this thing I did
my five years all right I could have
easily been like one of those guys that
that I oh yeah I'm just gonna work in my
company and this isn't that I said nah I
gotta have a five-year plan you know if
I if I didn't have a family my plan was
I was gonna leave to Tynan and I was
gonna live on the most minimal like
amount that I can live invest into my
own startup and investing into my own
company I did that five years ago five
years ago I started following levels on
a dial five years ago I started
following like you know Johnny FD like
probably like three years ago for a DFT
but levels are you I've been following
for a long time right and I said I gotta
make a plan man
I gotta work hard I gotta somehow learn
all of these things and keep on learning
you're gonna say new goals and new
things to do to help me continue staying
motivated on this thing cuz so be honest
with you
coding is boring you know coding is
boring it gets repetitive especially
with web development it gets very boring
but I'm not here for for the funding
giggles I'm here for a purpose I'm here
for hey I'm I'm trying to make as much
money as I can on my youth by the time
I'm 40 I got 10 more years I'm retiring
now you guys are gonna see me how I
actually make this happen
you know how I'm actually gonna continue
making videos on YouTube
till God knows so I can't make no more
videos so I'm dead or I lose my voice
and
even like that I'm still gonna be out
here doing the coding coding freeze calm
I can't even speak I'm still gonna be
doing sign language out here right
you're gonna say like that's the type of
person I am
you know so for everybody that keeps
leaving things for last minute you know
I'll come back to it later you're not
gonna come back to it it's gonna be like
hey 10 years passed and and you're gonna
be like oh man it was a great
opportunity I actually I actually
started and then now you become that guy
now you become that girl of like man I
knew about this before I even popped off
you never said like you know how many
people you hear that you know how many
people even now with the whole Bitcoin
thing be like oh man you know I remember
when I was like $23 okay so if you was
there and you know about it at $23 why
didn't you put freaking $100 yellow
saying like that's the same thing that's
happening now like you see there's
opportunities here why are you not
putting in $23 to this opportunity right
I expected for you to to move up on the
classes man you know this if you look
technically right technically the the
what is it done the life I'm sorry the
line of poverty like there's a lot of
people that earn less than $20,000 in a
year in the United States which sounds
crazy because I don't know how they
survive right
that's crazy to me like $20,000 per year
like that's crazy
alright so let's say you are at that
level right now how can you go and move
up one more level up let's say you move
up the classes right in this world I
don't even believe that much in racism I
know there's people who are racist
there's people who are biased as people
who are they look at you and they judge
you by how you look but the biggest
problems is classism great classes you
get stuck in one class your parents are
in that class your freakin grandparents
are in that class
it's hard for you to move up alright
it's hard you know you end up in in the
same class that your mom was in in
nineteen you know 1943 1964 my mom was
born 1964 right am I gonna stay in that
same class you know to this day my mom's
been here for like I don't know how long
25 years earning the same $38,000 in
here right I don't judge her you know I
don't tell no mom like you could've done
better but at the same time like yeah
you could have done better
you could have literally you know went
back for you being on bachelor's you
could have went back for your masters
you could have went back and did other
stuff you know just for yourself
not for me just for yourself because
sometimes you gotta you gotta like you
know you gotta try to push yourself man
and you gotta understand like people get
stuck here man
how many people this people let live in
the projects right I was watching this
documentary and this family they
literally they were from the plantation
fields and they said hey you guys are
free
hey you guys are free to go get out of
here right didn't give her no land
didn't give him nothing right well
everybody else had an advantage because
they'd been here for 400 years but they
actually had money they had some type of
money right but it's poor guys who are
who this family is so they look down the
whole thing the whole history of this
war family they let them go
that's okay guys go they lived in
Mississippi right they moved to this
land the the freaking basically they
rented out a piece of land from the same
the same master the same master who who
owned them they rented the land from the
same master they owned them and the
master told them you could live here so
long last you worked this land and you
pay me rent yeah now they had some money
in their pocket but now you still you
know under this master the same person
that was still being you up the same
person that was still raping your wife
the same person now
freaking chopped off the leg of your
uncle you're still working for that
person right so now fast forward those
are the things that happen in history
those things are other things that
nobody can deny those are the things
that is reality right but the United
States and America is like people want
to put things under a rug right now
let's let's continue with this history
right so they're from there this family
stay there somehow in the future the
master decided the name of the master
the Masters kids who are now getting you
know the profit from the old of that
land decided we're gonna sell this so
now those people are used to live there
in that little shanty town house now
they got to move from there the only
land that they know so then now is like
early 1900s on like 1901 1902 right now
they basically tell them my hey man
you're gonna you and your family you and
your seven family members yeah gotta
move into this this housings this this
thing that is pretty much is like some
land that the government put together
and you know they put it up with let
paint they put it up with with BS right
and then now you gotta go through the
whole process of like you know the Jim
Crow laws and all the right but
then after you know after a while 1960s
1970s things starts changing up a little
bit it's like a little bit more freedom
more more opportunities but then somehow
people stay there and just like okay
it's a cycle becomes a cycle of like
okay now you have a K and then it's
crazy this documentary is crazy the
people have kids and then now their kids
are having kids and then instead of
passing down passing down like a house
passing down a spot they passing down
the same project apartment to this to
the kids so the kid that was living
there that grew up there now his mom
dies he had a kid
now his kid lives in the same project in
the same neighborhood that he grew up on
right and sometimes you actually stuff
like how does this happen
and then you realize this a lot of
things a lot of things that could go
could go wrong right you get into drugs
you get into the wrong crowd you you
feel like you don't have no
opportunities right but now fast forward
we are in 2018 I'm pretty sure by now
you would think like the family move
move move down and everything no in 2017
the same the same family that moved out
from the Masters land move to a project
and then from there nobody in that
family never really thought about Heyman
at some point we got to change this and
some funny we gotta say we
gotta take those opportunities and try
to work in you know work together
alright nobody did that right and this
person this family they're still there
you know in that side right but now to
bring it back to what we were talking
about because a lot of people are in
situations like that or even other
situations like you know even if you
look back you know like oh they were
also talking about this documentary
about how people came here as indenture
how the code indentured servants right
and that's what people call now and they
trailer-trash right but what people
don't know the history behind it is that
this people were sent from you know from
all of these countries and basically
were slaves to other masters right so
it's all about classism it's not what is
this racism but it's also classism right
you could fall into a class and be like
hey man you're a worker that's all
you're gonna be your father was a
mechanic your dad was a mechanic
your grandfather was you know whatever
right it just keeps going down it just
keeps going down keeps going down right
but it's like you have to take it on
you're on your own to change that right
this is like the golden years guys like
you don't understand the opportunities
are out here are crazy ah you know I was
looking at this thing where there was
something only 2% of all the major
companies like major tech companies only
2% of people are actually black or like
let's say uh but there's like 2% black
and like 3% Latinos and and I'm not
saying this like this is not a freaking
black and power black people power and
Latinos are power white people not this
is just I'm throwing it out there those
numbers right because I'm like yo we can
actually make a change we can actually
say you know what we can now get into
this companies
bring those numbers up right instead of
being two percent in the next three to
five years we could say hey man instead
of two percent let's make it ten you
know ten percent blacks 10 percent
Latinos 10 percent agents that were
saying you know just so even the field
and just make it easier for people that
come after us to you know push forward
and and get out of the same classes
right this always gonna be poor people
no matter how you look at it there's
always going to be poor people because
if there's no poor people what's the
point of being rich that's the truth all
right we need poor people that's that's
to be honest we need poor people to do
the jobs that we don't want to do right
but do you want to be a poor person do
you want to be working those jobs that
nobody wants to work you know what I
mean do you want to be working your
whole life and still feel like I can't
even afford to go to Cancun Cancun you
go you buy a ticket for Cancun for $300
there's people that can't even leave the
country there's people never have even
crossed the Canada it cost you 75 hours
to go take a bus to go to Toronto
you gotta say like and these people that
will be able to do it because they don't
have the money they don't have to the
opportunities people that can't afford
it as crazy as it sound right so it's
like if you're in a situation like that
or you know people like that or your
family members is like that it's like
why wouldn't you try to push forward try
to be able to take yourself to the next
class right listen your goal in life you
gotta have some type of goal you know I
think a human being is like like ants
right there so you know every ant has a
job to do in every end does something
for a queen but the difference is that
we don't have a queen we don't need a
queen but we all have a job to do
right and we all have to set up
something for the next generation for
our life to matter all right if you're
just living moment to moment day to day
now planning your life out
and now understanding how the world
works then you're gonna be a loser in
this world that's the truth you end up
being a loser
and then other people win you know you
become the loser that works for the
winners right and that's just how it
works man
you know unfortunately I wish the world
was perfect and it was more kumbaya and
you know that's all I'm here from here
for kumbaya right but every time I hear
that hear from people like oh I'm gonna
do this tomorrow bro you're not gonna do
it tomorrow
like if you didn't do it today you're
not gonna do it tomorrow
that's just how the world works
something else is gonna happen you
you're gonna freakin crash a car you're
gonna freakin get fire you're gonna your
girlfriend's gonna tell you come on baby
let's let's chill let's put on a movie
I'm gonna give you that wet way you know
what I mean like something crazy right
and then next thing you know what you
was supposed to do today you're not
gonna be able to do it tomorrow you get
what I'm saying like it's a rap you know
so it's like stop leaving things for
last minute and leaving it for the next
day because you're not gonna be able to
do it you gotta say and you gotta you
gotta put your mind in a state of like
we here only for a moment
you know we gotta blink in 50 years is
gonna pacify all right brain now I
blinked it I became dirty literally I
feel like I was just yesterday you know
in freaking high school in a lunch room
throwing freakin milk cartons at people
you know I mean like that's how I feel
right but I blinked I'm 30 years old you
ever saying it's like we're gonna blink
and we're gonna become 40 we're gonna
blink and we're gonna become 50 years
old what do we have to show for you know
what I mean like what is it that we're
gonna have to be able you know what why
are we gonna pass down to other people
unfortunately what we leave here is what
measures our
life meaning you could literally be a
bum in the street and not do anything
for the rest of your life and say oh I'm
all about myself right you die under the
bridge nobody cares
now nobody even knows that your name
because you didn't have an ID on you
your name is John Doe nobody cares about
you right but if you come in and you
become successful and you leave
something to your family and you leave
something for the future you yeah you
are to create something that people say
oh wow man you know Joe Santos Garcia
created this you know you do something
amazing they name a street after you
people know I was like damn who knows
why this thing Santos Garcia Street why
they gotta put Santos Garcia like who is
this dude you gotta sound like at least
you left something cuz then at the end
you you're nothing you know what I mean
like you you just like some human being
that's here for a moment
you don't know saying so you gotta take
this opportunities man and understand
that if you don't move up the classes
you're you pretty much you might as well
just like you just give up on life right
because you gotta understand it's not
about material things it's not about
anything it's about opportunities you
know what I mean like the certain things
that you won't have opportunities
because you're not in that class there's
certain things that your kids are not
gonna be able to have they have
opportunities to do because they're not
in that class I want my son to be able
to say hey I want to become whatever I
want to become and at the end of the day
it doesn't matter because my father
still set me up in a way where no matter
what I do I'm still gonna be successful
there's people out here that no matter
what they do they are still going to be
successful there's people you know oh
there's another story to somebody that
pretty much their parents you know
they own like I think it was like orange
fields and stuff like that like oranges
right and their kids is like oh yeah I'm
just gonna open up like you know a juice
a juice bar right but when you think
about it you're 18 years old how are you
gonna buy a juice bar
how you gonna open up a juice bar you
gonna say like you because of things
that your parents did it gave you down
for too many to open up a juice bar
because regular people out here the
regular dudes or you know people at the
bottom they don't have the opportunity
to say hey mom shucks can I go out you
know I was thinking instead of me going
to college how about you lend me two
hundred thousand dollars so I can open
up a a juice bar people can't do that
right so there's like you gotta set
yourself up to be able to do stuff like
that you gotta set yourself up to be
able to say you know what my son wants
to become a doctor let's send them to to
the best schools my son want to become
astronaut listen to the best schools my
son want to become the president let's
see how we could get him at Harvard you
get are saying like you're now gonna
become the president going to freaking
you know LaGuardia Community College
right it's not gonna happen so you have
to set things up man you're getting
opportunities right now that you're not
gonna get 10 20 years from that you
don't want to be one of those guys
they're like oh yeah man I remember I
started coding for a weekend and I
should have continued you know how many
guys have stories like that you know how
many people constantly they have stories
where they they come in like oh yeah I
have authority to do this opportunity to
do that and it's like why didn't you do
it I left it for the next day like
you know how many people have things
like that it's like right now man one of
my biggest regrets man is you know not
continuing to code when I was 14
you know Mark Zuckerberg continued right
he created Facebook
he created Facebook with PHP it was ugly
cold it was easy cold even like the
social media websites write to me
personally
social media is dead right in the sense
of like those opportunities are not the
enemy you can't come out with like a new
social medium but oh there's a new
social media and this is thriving that
this is gonna be the next Facebook like
none those days over like one say a big
company already takes over that that's
done right so I feel like I could've
probably came up with something great
like that if I were to continue since 14
no I left it alone you know so same
thing for a lot of you guys a lot of you
guys come up with great ideas Jerry
Jerry
one of the subscribers he he sent me a
an idea that he has that's pretty legit
you know and that's four or emts and you
know firefighters that he has an idea
for them and he's learning web
development too literally to build this
this product that he wants to build and
he's doing it the right way because he's
learning it he's gonna build it he's
gonna launch it and see if it blows up
if it blows up then great cuz nobody
else has it now
a lot of you guys have ideas like that
that are good and you have a lot of good
products that you want to come up with
but if like if you don't build it now if
you don't come in and try to build it
now somebody else is gonna build it and
I say one state they build it then
you're just a copy and then you but yeah
you know the copy my idea you know how
many people have situation like that
like oh man you know like they'll see
some dumb you know what they call it the
squeegees or like those stupid
commercials that you see on TV like what
what is it I seen on TV a little
bs like that you know how many people
are probably kicking themselves in the
balls right now and be like oh yeah I
could I had an idea for that thing you
know it's like the guy who created a
back scratcher and stuff like that right
like dumb little products that people
use everything you're saying some guy
somewhere on a basement ready to hang
himself because it's like 30 years ago I
had the idea to do that
you gotta say I was like that's the same
thing that's gonna happen we're here now
Sanada guys there's gonna be like saying
20 years from now somebody oh man I had
the same idea it was like yeah buddy but
you didn't even learn how to code you
did it for a weekend and then you gave
up you don't say so I just hope that you
guys really understand what I'm trying
to do here man I'm not trying to have
you guys just become developers like
becoming a developer is the first step
to the journey right you know even like
what I was saying with this guy John
Samus right John psalmist he did his
thing became a developer made his money
smart enough to invest into real estate
so by the time he decides to leave what
development him program in general right
he could do whatever the hell he wants
John Samus could literally be having a
brand new girl every single day
somewhere in freakin I don't know
somewhere in Asia living like a king you
gotta say because he has so many
properties that he could just get paid
he lives like a king out there he lives
like a king anywhere in South America
anywhere in Europe
you don't live like a king because he
already put himself up in a situation
where he's gonna be good for life right
with just ten years in ten years that he
put in and you know I just started I
feel like I started at 24 right I moved
my way there right I'm gonna I'm in a
space where no matter what I do I
already know I'm gonna be able to earn a
hug
thousand dollars per year no matter what
I do right but how can I take myself to
the next level and say let's try to make
as much money as possible for the next
10 years from 10 from 30 to 40 so be
able to retire at 41 42 and be able to
travel the world and be able to do
everything that I want to do right but
all of that is gonna take hard work
that's something that nobody else wants
to do not putting in that work is not
gonna get you anywhere
not putting into our work it's not gonna
help you out become the person that you
want to become not putting in that work
it's not gonna get you off that class
that you live on you live down here
you gonna saying these guys you know
when you live down here you don't even
matter in this world like you could go
and vote for whoever you want and you
still don't matter you know what I'm
saying like right now we all vote for
whoever the hell we want but we don't
matter because we don't have money to
put into lobbying right you know you got
the guys like the Koch brothers you know
look up on Forbes look on Forbes the I
think it's called a xx the 20/20 is most
powerful families in the United States
they pretty much own everything
everything that you see our companies
down owned by them right when you look
online you see oh this company got
acquired by this company most likely one
of their company just acquired another
company most likely the company that you
work for is part of their companies and
that's just how it is you gotta say so
all of that is generational money all of
that is generational wealth right but
somebody has to put into work at first
right somebody gotta put in that work so
somebody could look down and say damn my
grandfather my grandmother my you know
my great-great-grandfather great-great
grandmother came in
they set up this you know foundation for
us because if not you're gonna be in
that same class man you like it or not
you know my mom said the foundation to
bring me to this country the United
States of America
she already did what she needed to do
she served her purpose
you know that's how it is people have
purposes in this world right my purpose
is not to set a foundation a solid
starting point for my son and every day
for his son to continue and therefore
Nate continues continues continues you
build an empire you get what I'm saying
but that's something so that you gotta
tell your kids you got to break it down
to the kids because all of those things
that I'm talking about nobody broke it
down for me nobody told me about this
this is what I've learned on my own
doing research constantly looking at
documentary documentaries constantly
looking at other people's lives
understanding how the world works
understanding how I walk I was like
looking at my neighborhood and because I
where I live is like a pretty Michael is
like middle class but one thing that I
noticed three families here the parents
are either the father and the mother
three people in this block are u.s. post
office guys right they they work for the
US Post Office and I know because when I
come in at a certain time I see that
they their cars are from the US Post
Office so that tells me that there's a
middle-class right now at the same time
where I live
I could I could drive now and drive on a
10-15 10 15 minutes and not even see one
Mercedes Benz one BMW it's not like how
it was in the lining right Long Island
was playing like 3000 $4000 a month with
all the BS that I had
but that was a like a generational
wealthy neighborhood right this is more
like this is up-and-coming this is
people that hard-working out here right
and I move here specifically because it
was cheap and at the same time it gave
me the freedom to be able to say hey all
the money that I earned I'm gonna invest
into other things right there is an
investment for me moving to out here and
I live in a pretty nice neighborhood I
live in the hills it's just a regular
thing but I observe everybody I look at
everybody I'm like okay I see what they
work I see what they do I see what type
of families they are see you know what
type of cars they drive I see what do
they do just so I could learn from them
and I could learn from other people it's
the same thing when I was living in the
Rhineland I was living in Long Island
constantly I will bump into people that
are in a Tesla constantly I will bump
into people in a BMW in a rolls-royce
right and then there'll be times that I
will talk to people just like your
Starbucks or whatever just to you know
for a little second because sometimes
you got to know how to do things you got
to learn how to talk to people you got
to be able to have that the atmosphere
around you to be able to bump into
people that are in better positions than
you so you can learn from them even from
small conversations and there was like
one guy who I remember I was talking to
and I was like them this guy freaking
has you know Rose Royce and I always see
him on the doughnut shop right where I
used to be getting my bagels and my
stuff yeah I will talk to the guy and
one day I got it out of him right one
day I got it out of him on how he got to
that point right and he just broke it
down to me he said oh yeah my you know
my grandfather he came from Germany and
then he was an immigrant here he worked
hard for a long time there from there he
sent my father to
to school my father became a doctor
there from there my father sent me to
school I went to
what was it Pratt I forgot the name of
the University Pratt I think it's in
Brooklyn
he went to like one of the biggest
architect architecting in art
universities here in the US so he went
over there became an architect and then
from there you know like he became
successful but then all of that goes
back to his grandfather if his
grandfather did not work hard and did
not send his son to become a doctor then
he wouldn't have been able to go to that
prestigious architects school and he
wouldn't have been able to get those
jobs because even right now you can say
oh yeah I went to a John Jay Community
College and I'm an architect from John
Jay you know I'm an architect from John
Jay and either say I'm architect but
you're not getting the same
opportunities that is a guy coming from
Pratt you're gonna say like this is not
you're not gonna get the same
opportunities as that guy it's the same
thing as a lawyer you're a lawyer oh
yeah you went to John Jay from you know
lower Manhattan and freaking part of
CUNY yeah cool you're a lawyer but
you're not the same lawyer as the guy
that sat at Harvard right it's the same
thing as oh yeah I just graduated from
computer science degree but you're not
the same guy that just went to Stanford
you're not the same guy that went to MIT
you're not the same guy that went to
Georgia Tech all right so all of those
things is opportunities right and that's
the only way that you're gonna get to
places is by you know by getting to
those classes you know the worst thing
is when people go oh yeah man
you're freaking you gotta work hard you
gotta get a scholarship listen sometimes
you work hard your whole life and you
never get a scholarship or you get a
scholarship is like a quarter of the
scholarship so nobody like oh let's be
nice and let's give this little kid he
work hard he got really high SATs we're
gonna give you a corner scholarship and
you're freaking to go to harbor is gonna
cost you 300 grand where you gonna go
and find the other 80 grand right so
automatically you get shut down you
can't even go that happens to people all
the time you gotta say feels like it's
just opportunities man you can't be out
here and think like oh man like all this
stuff is gonna happen out of nowhere now
man you gotta put into hard work you
know I'm sorry I talked about this for
an hour you know some people don't
really damn show you your videos is
wrong damn Joe this in that well
sometimes you got to break it down to
people and show them everything like for
all of you guys that being here for for
now you know for since I started this
this frame there's this whole freakin
video from the beginning like you
understand you're gonna get everything
out of this right there's people that's
gonna come to this video and I even
watched the whole video they're like oh
it's one hour but what they don't
understand we drop in Jemez man like
this things that I tell you from
experience right I come in and I give
you guys knowledge that I wish somebody
would've taught me right people is not
giving this stuff out man you know a lot
of times you might see people who are
successful even like you know it's like
freaking I was like watching this this
interview from who was it um I don't
know if it was you know Moscow or like
there was somebody there right and
usually they don't give you like 10
minutes 10 minutes of knowledge right
and it will be like something practical
that you could use but that's it 10
minutes right but you might find
somebody on the inside
on YouTube that might give you real life
experience you know somebody can come in
and tell you listen if you work car
you're gonna be successful now
you got to put yourself in situations to
become successful you gotta work hard
and at the same time it's a little bit
of luck it's a little bit of not giving
up it's a little bit of everything right
the whole point is that you keep going
until you get it done
and you keep going you have a goal you
say I want to become a doctor you keep
going until you get it done you want to
become a developer you keep going until
you get it done you want to open up your
own business you keep going until you
get it done that's it that's how those
guys do it man you know when you think
like oh this is gonna happen just
because you know God is gonna sprinkle
something on top of me it's gonna bring
me a good luck and the little fairytale
is gonna call a little fairy hit you a
little freaking the little one over your
head and become a developer like nah boy
you gotta put in that work man I don't
want to hear people complaining you know
I want to hear nobodies kids complaining
that oh man my father my grandfather
didn't do anything for me
that's just how it is man it's like they
didn't do anything for you so when are
you gonna change the cycle right when
you're gonna start that cycle of not
doing anything for nobody not doing
anything for your family not doing
anything for yourself when are you gonna
stop that cycle
you got what I'm saying like you gotta
come out here in and like just work hard
man I feel bad for a lot of you guys man
to be honest feel bad for a lot of you
guys that come in and ya do something
one day and then you'll be like oh I'm
giving up don't give up man you just
make it happen you know must he
was a genius from young from very early
on he was a genius like when you have
that gift you have that gift you can't
deny but he came to the United States
and he started from zero he was an
immigrant like zero you know what I'm
saying
he could easily say oh man I can't find
a job you knew you was and I'm going
back to South Africa that could've
easily been his story you gotta say but
he kept going until he made it happen
and that's the story behind every single
person was successful they keep going
until they make it happen the guy John
Madden not John matter Steve Madden he
came in and he did the same thing he
went hard he worked hard until he made
it happen
that's just how it is man you've got to
keep on working until you make it happen
but you cannot just give up on the
second day but oh man Joe you know I'll
come back to this like nah just keep
going the whole week do it for a whole
week Jesus Christ you know like don't
give up don't give up right away my god
no I mean but yeah man I love you guys
man everything that I tell you guys is
for your own good you know don't get
upset don't get you know
don't get mad everything that I tell you
is for your own good
it's for my own experiences it's from
things that I've learned and I'm sharing
my knowledge
am i a millionaire no am i somebody
who's super successful no but that's the
beauty behind it you know why because
I'm just like you but the only
difference is with me in a lot of you
guys who are not up to par is that I'm
getting there
you don't say and a lot of you guys are
also getting there getting to that point
where you're like super successful
everything that you do is gonna is gonna
be legit everything that you do is gonna
turn to gold right am i there yet not
not yet but I'm getting there you're
seeing the
progress there's something that Gary we
said the other day there's things that I
like about him these things that I don't
like about him there was one thing that
he said he said I only think I regret is
that I couldn't document my journey and
that's exactly what I'm doing right now
I'm documenting everything and you guys
see the progress you see you gotta look
back and be like damn joke like why you
moved from like you know three to four
thousand dollar house to move to a you
know fifteen hundred dollar house and
you're paying your lesson and you know
you're doing this and that and it's like
that's all part of the plan right
downsize so you can have more money to
be able to invest into other things all
right downside so you don't have to be
somebody with a ball and a chain stuck
to your leg drowning on a on a sea of of
debt its drowning in a sea of of you
know trying to keep up with the Joneses
you don't know saying like that's why I
did it right but at the same time it's
like I'm super good
you know I'm comfortable I live good I
have everything it's just like you have
to do things that's gonna make your life
simpler so you could be able to focus on
other things you know a lot of you guys
y'all want to have like you know I saw
this kid send me a message like oh man I
can't wait to abaya you know I get to
the game and be able to buy myself a
little Ferrari on my boy you you got it
wrong you gotta first make your money
first if you buy a Ferrari the Ferrari
should be 5% of what you earn in a year
you don't know saying that you shouldn't
be buying things that's gonna be half
your whole your whole check per year or
even your whole check in a year it
should be like 5% so when you want to
get rid of it you say oh there's only 5%
you gotta say no or when you gotta pay
it in so y'all it doesn't hurt you you
know everything that I do is for a
reason guys it's like me planning myself
out for the next five years
I told wifey already
though all this things set up coding
phase comm how I want it every day we're
getting new subscribers every day we get
new members to the website every day we
got other things that's happening I have
my other websites that I just checked it
the other day I have this on this
website that's like a music website that
I didn't even know I don't even notice
that I was like getting so many views
there so now I gotta go in and I got a
scale that I got a new promotion for
that website so I could also make more
money it's like if I'm making 2,000 on
that website and I haven't even touched
it since I don't know since 2015 I'm
doing 2,000 a month when I whoop
somebody go I haven't touched his
websites in 2015 let me put in some time
scale this and then make this website
make $10,000 a month right every website
everything that I do is a is a business
right it's a small business you know
it's the same thing that as if somebody
came in it had you know somebody who
sells hot dogs right and then he decides
to open up his own hot dog standing then
he rents out another hot dog stand and
then he goes in and buys another hot dog
stand from somebody who who has a in a
better location that's all the same
thing that I'm doing but the only
difference is I'm doing with working
with what does enemy we're programming
you know what I mean so it's like you
gotta know how to play the game and you
gotta continue you know not thinking
ahead you can make a million dollars in
one business how about you get twenty
different small businesses 20 different
ideas and each one make you $10,000 a
month
watch how at the end of the year you're
gonna be a millionaire you gotta say I'm
already I'm getting there and I'm
getting there and this is just me gonna
be documenting everything that I do here
me
I'm here teaching you guys how to code
I'm teaching you guys how the the
opportunities the opportunities that I
got from web development in programming
period and how it has changed my life
and how I've actually being able to come
in and take everything that I've learned
from that in implementing other things
and even the money that I earned from
web development I invest into other
things like you shouldn't be thinking
like oh I learned $100,000 so I'm gonna
spend $50,000 on on trips and on a car
and this is not no you do that later on
right you take that money and then you
invest into other things
somebody told me Joe what's the perfect
plan and I'm gonna do another video for
this but the way hard thing is your
first year should be you shouldn't buy
 right you gotta go in you're gonna
become a developer you're gonna get your
first job you're gonna earn some money
is gonna be something be Seng it's not
gonna be $100,000 per year it's not if
you're lucky
god bless you right but most of you guys
is not gonna happen like that right your
first year you're gonna hit 6070
thousand and then from there what you're
gonna do is the whole year you don't
spend on money you pay off all of your
debts right you pay off everything so
you can start it on zero all right pay
off everything don't buy nothing then
your second year you splurge a little
but you give yourself a little something
because now you got no debts now you you
good right your third your four of your
fifth year that's the money that you're
gonna be saving to be able to move on to
other things either to open up your own
business to either open up your own
digital agency if you want to continue
with web development open up your own
application your own startup that's how
you gotta do it right it's a five-year
plan some of you guys are gonna be able
to do it faster than five years some of
you guys are gonna be able to do in two
three years and the only reason you're
gonna be able to do that is because
you've already learned from my mistakes
and mistakes from other people things
that I did
that took me five years I know a lot of
you guys can do in two to three years
because now you you are armed with the
knowledge and the things that you see in
the possibilities that you can become
you get what I'm saying like I didn't
have no no nobody on YouTube that was
telling me what to do nobody was helping
me out nobody was giving me advice I had
to learn to stay in the hard way you
know what I'm saying
I had to go in and learn skills that I
did not need to learn i frickin worked
on things that made no sense you know
when I tell you guys focus on the things
that you need to learn just to get your
job that's what you need to work on stop
working about worrying about you know
learning things there's our oh this
looks cool you know like it's like
people that want to be wasting the time
learning with you like I'm being just
honest with you guys
learning of you jes is a waste of time
and there's a lot of things out there
that it's just a waste of time you guys
lick sir elixir is also another waste of
time like this barely any jobs for those
things it's like why are you gonna waste
your time when you could have been
working or something that would have
gotten a little guy in you a job
in two months you learn PHP you would
have got a job by the end of the day you
gotta say so those things nobody was
here on YouTube telling me that like all
those new youtubers are popping up now
like all these people like they wasn't
here when I started right there wasn't
here when I started they were you know
people were talking about other stuff
and they were just like making videos
that's a big difference between making
videos for things that I like and making
videos for things that you guys need all
right a lot of youtubers make videos for
hey this is what I like and I'm gonna
make videos like this cuz I like this
and I have fun with it cool but it's not
giving value to you guys because it's
not what you need it's more of this is
what I like
you got what I'm saying I hope you guys
understand the difference between that
so anyways when I'm
out of here hope you guys got any got at
least something out of this man what I'm
just trying to help you guys out
stop being lazy work hard if you want a
high paying job you're gonna have to put
in that work man that's the truth you
you're not gonna be able to to get these
jobs by you know trying to take the
shortcuts and doing easy things like
that man like to be honest with you it's
just it's not gonna happen
you know those jobs that you could get
training in one day they paying $9 an
hour cuz it's training for one day rate
that's what you need it but jobs that
you say hey this is a year-long training
this you know two three years of
becoming a developer like to become a
real legit real legit developer like
that's why you get paid that much
because you put in so many hours nobody
else is gonna put in those hours and
that's what you're gonna get that money
you're gonna say so yeah Tuesday April
yeah no you're gonna get it just listen
just like I said follow follow my
timeline follow the timeline that I gave
