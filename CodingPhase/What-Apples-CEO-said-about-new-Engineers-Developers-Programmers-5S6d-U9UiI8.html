again man coding face.com
listen guys make sure you subscribe make
sure you like this video man so the top
of us today is basically I saw this
video from Tim Cook he's a CEO of Apple
right and he basically said you know
what
you know why this not that many female
engineers why does not that many female
developers and I agree with him his
answer is there's no required coding
class there's nothing that interests
introduces them to basically you know
the most basic side of coding you know
just regular stuff like functions you
know I mean I've seen some math classes
where they teach you a little bit like
you know a little bit functions or how
they work but not in a programming way
they don't come in and say hey guys
today we're gonna learn JavaScript or
you know something super simple I hate
you guys we're going to learn today Ruby
which is the easiest programming
language in the world right so they
don't come up with a class that is like
a required class in any college or any
high school or junior high school you
know sometimes we take classes where
like Oh poetry or you know I
don't know like environmental
sciences and like little like
that right you know even though science
is great whatever but I remember taking
a course where it was like the whole
course was about talking about Guppies
and you know the ecosystem which is
great and then I'm like yeah but what
about you know coding what about how
things are made we're living in the 21st
century and it feels like nobody knows
what's going on and I'm talking about
the general population it's like the
user products they use iPhones they use
laptops they use
phryges or anything is their fridge
which could be connected to the internet
nowadays right or they're using alexa
and nobody understand how these things
are made what if they had introduction
sub coding or introduction to computer
science in junior high school what if
that was a requirement don't you guys
think that there will be more girls
interested into it because the problem
is that if nobody shows it to you
there's no way that you're going to be
interested on this when you grow up or
when you're like an adult if your mom or
dad is not a developer or have any type
of background in math and science most
likely you're not going to be interested
in this because you don't see this as a
option for you right so I think if more
girls were to go into a class where they
were required to just take it we're not
talking about some advanced class or
people we don't want this to become
calculus like you know some people hate
going to on you know algebra and then
jump into calculus and they're like oh I
hate this I hate math and this and that
right we're not talking about that we're
talking about the most simplest thing
right the most simple things of life
let's create a variable let's create a
function that adds two numbers let's
create a function that prints our name
like little things like that can
actually spark an interest in somebody
and tell them like hey let's build a
small little website let's build the a
small app you know with nodejs
and I guess the email Tron or something
I was like what uh you know Raz where's
the raspberry pie assumption with the PI
little thingy sorry I'm freaking it's
just wanting to say that but yeah and
just create like a robot that just moves
an art something that's going to catch
their interest and be like oh man maybe
I could do this maybe if I continue
studying this I can actually become an
engineer maybe I can learn and
you know I think this is very important
you know so I definitely agree with him
on what he set here and I'm gonna put
this on the description I want you guys
to take your time and also look through
it and yeah watch the video it's pretty
cool I like seeing Tim Cook I know a lot
of people be like man he's not Steve
Jobs and that's fine he don't have to be
Steve Jobs he's Tim Cook you know like
there's a reason why he's up there's a
reason why he used to work with Steve
Jobs like this guy he's also the man
it's just you know he has a different
vision for Apple well anyway that's
another video all right guys so I mostly
