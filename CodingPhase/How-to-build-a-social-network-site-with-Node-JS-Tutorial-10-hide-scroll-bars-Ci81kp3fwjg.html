as like the basic styling of this whole
middle section okay this whole content
section I know it took forever but if
you want something to look beautiful and
people to be like wow you have to put in
that time to just make everything
perfect okay now the next thing that
we're going to do is we're basically
gonna make sure that this thing never
goes beyond the size that we want okay
and we want this to just scroll on this
middle section alright so let's do this
so first of all what we want to do this
text area this whole common compose
compose comment whatever we are going to
basically come here where says updates
and we're says update container okay so
there's the updates container okay let
me see and we have to update so of the
container let's come here and copy
everything that's in Saturday okay we're
gonna paste it a couple of times okay
copy this from there to the end of it
okay and then paste this a couple of
times
let me start I'm putting some some
comments so here I'm gonna do this I'm
gonna say and single update because I
know some people they get lost they're
like wait what's going on I'm lost in
the HTML so many things in here too many
nested HTML tags okay so what we did
right now was just copy and paste it and
so you can see now as we we continue to
add other ones this is how it's gonna
look
alright it looks pretty cool it looks
pretty legit to be honest with you guys
I'm very proud of myself and I'm proud
of you guys for actually making it this
far okay now the next thing that we want
like I said this is supposed to be a
floating app this is not supposed to be
an app that when you scroll the elements
continue growing with it right like we
want this to be a set height a set with
so let's go to the main that scss let's
go all the way to the top until you get
to the app container okay so here we're
gonna say overflow heading okay so once
it gets to the the set height that we
have here if it goes over that is gonna
hide it it's gonna not let it grow
beyond that okay
we're also going to come to let's say to
this area where it says hold on right
click this to the content container okay
and it comes to the content container
and we're gonna basically come here and
do something like this we're gonna find
a content container or is it content
container we're gonna say max height
let's say 900 pixels okay
so the maximum height of this container
is gonna be 900 pixels anything beyond
that it's just not gonna show okay is
gonna be hitting alright now the next
thing that we want to do is find the
next spot which is right click this
let's say content container okay
cousin container and then the content
area again so this content area we want
this to be the height 100% of the height
- 53 pixels so let's see where's the
next content content find what was it
synth area that's what we want content -
area
fine okay we can't find that okay so we
don't have nothing for that let's say
constant container okay so right here
we're gonna come and we're gonna put in
content area okay now for this content
area we're going to do some CSS trickery
okay
we're basically going to use some CSS
trickery to be able to basically show
that this area Scrolls okay all right so
let's go to the content area here all
right I'm gonna say con - container and
then we say content area now this
content area we're going to basically
set the box size in to be content box so
there's the default that comes with
every browser content box right we use
something called the asterisk to see
everything is going to be border box
meaning if we want this to be 400 pixels
it's always gonna be 500 pixels it's not
gonna be anything bigger than that okay
that's what we had for every single
element on the page but for this to work
we have to use the default of the
browser which is content box so I'm
gonna do this and I'm going to say with
100% okay and that's
now we're gonna say height is going to
be what was it calc calc I believe what
was a 100 percent - 53 pixels okay let
me right click this make sure that that
go that went through so content area
okay so that's their the highest
calculated okay the next thing that we
want to do is we want to say
overflow:auto now as you can see we try
to scroll where our mouse is not working
now to fix this what we're going to do
is we're gonna say something like this
is gonna say max height instead of max
height let's put in height so let's say
height is going to be of the constant
container 900 pixels and now as you can
see we have the scrollbar right here but
to make this nice and clean we don't
really want to have a scrollbar there so
what we're going to do is we're going to
add a padding so we're gonna say padding
there 0 top 15 pixels to the right zero
at the bottom and we're gonna say 7
pixels to the left okay save that and
what that does is it moves everything
accordingly to the right spot and then
the the freakin scrollbar is actually
not there is there but you can't see it
because it's hidden so it's over here
somewhere so now we are actually good
where you can actually have a scrolling
section here
what a user can just scroll I say okay
cool
growing as if it's an application all
right so that's what we want to do all
right I know it seems a little bit
complicated but it's just box model guys
I want to have this perfectly so I think
we need like one more pixel so we're
gonna say set let's say 7.5 pixels
think we need one more full picture so
let's say eight
okay that's perfect no that's what you
call pixel perfect kids
okay there you go and yeah so we pretty
much done with this content area now the
next thing that we're gonna focus on is
here the messages all right so I'm gonna
see you guys later see you guys in the
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
