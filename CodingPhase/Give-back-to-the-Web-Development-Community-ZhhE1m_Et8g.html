just want to keep it to themselves you
know like all the knowledge that i'm
giving you Gus is stuff that I learned
over the four years you know that I've
been doing is four and a half years over
five
so it's like I'm giving without

other ways other contributing to open
source projects or contributing with
money contributing with just support you
know i'll comment he in this give me or
comment you give to other people like

it just basically tells me him and I'm
doing starting right you know what I
mean like I'm not just spending my time
while wasting my time on in front of a
camera for no reason you know there's
people out there who who enjoy this
content as well they will take something
positive probably
like you know honey I see Omar video
scaling 100 100 likes something like
that right and then there'll be one
person who just dislike it which makes
no sense because there's nothing that
about the video to even dislike you
don't know that mean but I kind of I
kind of know who it it it's like some
trolls I that I know that on the
internet is trying to freaking you know
trying to bring me down and you know

about giving back stop holding a
knowledge man if you know something
share it to other people don't be like
oh yeah it took me two years to learn
what development or learn this is
whatever its kills it is right it took
me two years to learning I mean took me
this long so the next person they have
to go through it and they have to go in
spent two years so no man is like why
would you want to do that to somebody
else you know what I mean just because
you share it hard for you why would you
want somebody else to go to the same
shape for me the founding I'm like you
