again coding face.com
listen a lot of people have been asking
for this so I'm gonna give it to you
guys thanks to your boy Michael Z we're
gonna give you a couple of things how to
install no GS and the starter kit and
pretty much you can use this to any
system that I create any starter kit
that I use you can pretty much use it
for those right so the first thing you
want to go to is no js' comm make sure
you download either the stable or you
know depends if you really want to be on
the bleeding edge you can download the
most current one but I will say download
the stable one the one that's
recommended for you usually the one on
the left
alright make sure you open the file
there from day going accept everything
it's gonna install it as a program
clicking store
all right might take a little while okay
click finish' next thing you want to do
is go to my github so you want to go to
github.com slash coding phase comm or
you could just google me like that
get help coding phrase you will see it
automatically the one that says started
kit 2018 now there's an example you can
pretty much any start a kid that I use
you could pretty much use it like this
thing started the same way now I'm
showing you the starter kit 2018 you
could use it for the hyper app starter
kit you could use it for the fazer GS
starter kit it doesn't matter they all
pretty much doing the same thing all
right so you download it or you could
clone it but for now what we're gonna do
is we're just gonna download it okay
make our lives easier gonna put this on
the desktop so you don't lose the file
right currently opening Visual Studio
code even though I say hey use atom you
could use Visual Studio code you can use
sublime you could use brackets it
doesn't matter whatever you want to use
personally I recommend atom but for this
quick example we're gonna use Visual
Studio code pretty much extract it okay
they was open up with vision via studio
code as you can see inside of it there's
the project all right now there's a
issue that a lot of people are having
right when they I'm basically unzip the
file alright they come here and they run
the terminal all right so let's say they
say npm install we're gonna show you a
little something here we're gonna change
to the desktop all right and then from
there go into the starter kit folder
there right there most people will say
npm install on that one alright but
you're gonna notice there's an error and
that error is the error that everybody
keeps bumping into alright you have to
make sure you're inside of the folder
alright because think about it like this
there's a folder called starter kit 2018
master and then inside of it there's
another folder called starter kit 2018
master so you have to go inside of the
starter kit 2018 master for some reason
this how Windows work like when you
unzip it this happens so that's the
error that people are having all right
also make sure you're downloading a
stable version of nodejs and if you
follow the steps you're going to be fine
alright guys what we're gonna do is I'm
going to show you right now you see that
there's a folder inside of the folder I
know it doesn't make sense but that's
how it comes out when you unzip it
alright so you have to change into that
same directory as you can see starter
kit 20
tene - master and then inside of a
started kid 20h team - master and then
run npm install everything's gonna go
through all right you have all your
packages pretty much everything is fine
there right there what you're gonna do
is you're gonna say npm run watch then a
Windows gonna pop up as you can see
another window popped up and that's the
localhost 3000 now if for whatever
reason on your computer doesn't pop up
just go manually to localhost 3000
that's it if you see that page that
means it's working and everything is
good all right guys you should be fine
