again coating face calm your boys back
and nod and did it again listen guys so
I just got this message from this girl
an amazing girl unicorn you know we love
the unicorns out here man
definitely I love girls who code man for
real
I really do I'm here to support you guys
but yeah so she tells me hey Joe
I'm thinking about moving to Seattle
because there's more opportunities over
there is a better community also too I'm
thinking about going to a boot camp and
everything seems fine and I'm on my way
but I found this video which is called
the grid right and it's about service
called a grid or something like that and
I'm just you know it's about artificial
intelligence building websites and I'm
scared because now I don't know if I
should continue with this career like I
love to code but what's gonna happen I
mean am I gonna have a job in a year
from now two years from now three years
from now and I'm gonna tell you this yes
you're gonna find a job a year from now
two years from now three years from now
five years from now ten years from now
20 years from now you're going to find a
job I can guarantee that right because
people are getting so scared about
artificial intelligence guys this
artificial intelligence is not even
intelligence like seriously I'm not even
lying to you guys pretty much the grid
is just if-else statements right you
choose what type of website you want you
basically upload the photos I'll blow to
the content and then the content gets
put in different areas accordingly so if
you have like let's say you have for for
post right before blog post it shows for
blog post if you had three it breaks
down the page into three columns right
if you have six posts right if you have
six posts it break
down the column the column seen in six
different basically shows six different
grits right six different columns inside
of the grid so all is doing is just
pretty much putting if statements if
this post gets put there I'd do this if
this post has an image show this that's
all it's doing the more images and posts
that you put into it the more it changes
now let's say somebody came in and coded
this thing Andy they programmed it guys
this thing is not in challenging it's
not like hey you could talk to him be
like hey build me a website that has a
big image and does this isn't this it's
not like that guys it's just a frickin
program it's just a regular program that
is like if we come in here I could do
the same thing with PHP or nodejs
it's not intelligent stop worrying about
this people are thinking like AEI is
gonna come in and take their job guys
you guys are gonna be working for
companies you guys aren't look I'm
preparing you guys to work for companies
I'm not preparing you guys to become a
little web designer from the corner who
does you know a little music video music
websites and little things like that or
for artists in the local neighborhood no
guys I'm not preparing you for that I
don't want you guys to do that because
those those niches are done you know
what I mean like if I let's say I have a
rock band or I have a a pizzeria right
in reality all I have to do is go to
soil as a Squarespace and just create a
website that takes two seconds to do
upload an image put a little tighter to
it for my number on it that's it I could
do the same thing with Wix Wix does the
same thing now you have to understand
Wix is not for businesses Squarespace is
not for businesses those things are like
for like super beginners those websites
are for people who you know how a friend
of yours always comes to you and like
hey
mean I have this idea to build this
website you know where I'm gonna sell
you know sucks I'm gonna be selling
sucks great they start the the website
they put up three socks they sell one
sock out of the three socks and then I
uh
that's a I'm not gonna I'm not gonna
make no website I'm gonna drop this
because this business is not gonna sell
it's not gonna do anything for me this
happens to people every single day right
so when you you go to these websites
they help you create website start
simple and just easy to do all right but
they're not for a business right when
you get higher you get hired by a
business as a developer you know this
are like side projects you know how many
people have asked me to build little
side projects for them and I'm like man
I just send them I send them to Wix and
I send them to to Squarespace and then
this times that they'd be like oh I
don't even know how to do that man can
you do it for me I'm like okay cool I'll
do for you for 300 bucks $300 just for
me to upload the images and upload their
their titles and their paragraphs that
they have already read so I'm making
money for no reason because I'm not
coding anything I'm not doing anything
I'm uploading it for 300 bucks that's it
you know what I mean now you're a
developer think about it like this man
think about it like this you are a
developer you are a creator the 8i is
never going to be as smart as a human
being people are gonna say oh yeah but
there's gotta be so much of machine
learning and this and that
not everything right now I could come in
and create a brand new bagel right if I
asked that machine hey how does this
beagle taste does it have reasons it's
not gonna be able to answer me that
right and the reason why because
somebody has to program me and tell it
that right so you always got to think
about it like this somebody's always
going
have to program certain things into it
right so that's gonna be your job as a
developer if it was together you know
and I don't think that's gonna happen
for now our generation is not gonna deal
with that it's not gonna come it's not
gonna come to a place where it's like
hey man it's 20 is 20 47 and in 2047
and now machines do everything for us
when it gets to that point you know how
how old we gonna be we're gonna be old
by that time if you're smart enough you
should be retired I'm not planning on
being a developer by to the time I'm 40
years old that's like my my last year's
right I've seen this done for a lot of
developers where they come in they make
all the money in the world right in 10
15 years and that's it they done they do
something else you're worrying about
something that's like so far ahead in
the future that is not going to happen
and you gotta understand when you're a
developer you build things so you're
your imagination your creativity is
always gonna be there you're gonna be
the one creating the AI you're the one
that's gonna be adding new things to the
AI right that's how you got to think
about it don't think like oh man I
should stop learning to code because you
know the a eyes are are here
Terminator came down and and you know is
where's the space now I forgot the name
the name of the AI from Terminator guys
don't worry about that at all like you
gotta think about it when you work for a
business everything is customized they
never gonna use something like that the
grid they're never gonna use something
like Shopify like real businesses
they're not gonna use Shopify they're
not gonna use Shopify tonight I use Wix
they're not gonna use Squarespace the
real businesses do everything custom
because everything has to be customized
to tailor to that business you get what
I'm saying so you are a developer a
creator the master of the AI
the AI is not the master of you so don't
let it stop you all right guys listen
