calling face man listen we gotta
starting very simple man we're gonna
start with something great something
amazing how Donald Trump says we're
gonna build Netflix right it's just
gonna be something simple or clone it's
just it's not gonna have all the
functionalities that Netflix ass maybe
later on we'll add everything that
Netflix has to it but for now all we
want to do is just basically have a page
that looks like Netflix or something
similar just for you guys to learn the
basics of alright so we're gonna start
with this we gotta go to Chrome and we
gotta go to our EPL that IT rapidly
right right here you're gonna find
basically different languages you got
Python Ruby JavaScript HTML CSS
JavaScript scheme c-sharp Java there's a
very good place to start just to play
around this would you call a playground
just for you to come in you know Seth
stop some code and just play around with
it you know you're not gonna create a
full web site out of this but here this
is where you start cuz you don't need a
text editor you don't need anything else
just come to the web site and you know
you go to HTML CSS JavaScript click
there and then you come here so they'll
take you to this page pretty much right
here you write your code and then here
you have different files so let me
introduce you you know how you have you
know for every image you have something
like jpg or Die j JP e G or that gif or
that bitmap whatever it is right or
let's say your Microsoft Word you know
it's usually being that DLC X or that
txt
that's your file extension so when you
write on something for HTML as you
we just you know something that HTML
usually your first page that you create
you name it index.html and then pretty
much you write down your code here
alright so let's say an example when you
click run whatever you put here is gonna
show here on this side of the page right
so then we introduce you to the most
simple side of things so let's say you
know how you start with a sa rang you
have your introduction your body and
your conclusion right well in HTML you
have here HTML tag which basically says
ok inside of this this is a document
alright now inside of this document in
your head it's like you are basically
your introduction so here you have your
title you have your your body and then
in the body you just have your content
whatever you wanted to put there you
know what I mean now so let's say an
example right you come over here I want
to name this my first one thing that you
got to learn about this thing is that
you basically put everything inside of a
tag so like right now let's start this
from scratch
taco see HTML which is my document has
they had inside the head I have a title
inside the title I actually have two
text that I want the title to see
so my first page
now inside the HTML tile or the HTML
document pretty much you have your body
tool click body and inside your body you
have your text so let's say this is my
right so now it shows up here right
that's Cory so this is just a beginning
this is the first introduction on what
hTML is and what it looks like you know
when you go to any page the same example
Netflix right you go to Netflix inside
of here whatever you see there's a code
behind it when you click right click and
you say hit inspect and some of here
they have all the code of what's going
on in the page so right now we're gonna
start with something very simple but at
the end it's gonna look very complicated
anybody who doesn't understand this and
I sees this for the first time they get
overwhelmed they're like oh my god the
source code there's so much things to
learn but pretty much your only gonna
learn like four to five different tags
and then after you learned those five
tags you reuse that every single time
all right so you got your HTML which is
your document you have your head where
is basically like your introduction and
then you have your title inside the head
which is a title then from that you have
your body that's when you write your
content whatever it is images anything
that you put in it actually goes right
there right so this is the first
introduction to just HTML and what it
looks like the next step I'm gonna break
down what we call the box model it's
just pretty much just breaking down
things into sections you know if you've
never drawn anything before you know how
art class
or anything like that it is very simple
is just making squares and rectangles
and I'm gonna show that in a little bit
all right
see you in a little bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
