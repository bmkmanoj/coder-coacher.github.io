my people in you know Australia
Philippines China my people was in Japan
this for my people saying Malaysia my
peoples in the warehouse Russia South
Korea hey man this is for you guys
late night I should be sleeping man is
this one o'clock in one what am i doing
up somebody tell me what what you doing
up gentlemen we done did it again man
listen man I just wanted to hang out
with you guys Wiley's and go 15 minutes
in you know see what you guys is up to
you know we here we live each summon man
I just finished doing so many videos for
Ruby on Rails guys listen man don't
sleep man like everything that I'm doing
is for your benefit is not for my
benefit like I'm so tired
but look man I'm here I'm trying to get
you guys jobs I'm trying to get you guys
ready for the world I'm trying to get
you guys ready to be able to go and
build whatever you guys want
right anything that you guys could think
of you could build it all right so
that's why I actually come in and
created this this course on Ruby on
Rails I also did the laravel course if
you guys haven't checked it out the PHP
courses we did that you know this week
we're gonna do a lot of new content for
YouTube because I know it probably feels
like man Jones only talking about the
courses that he's promoting in this map
but at the same time as like it's
because I want you guys to do it you
know what I mean like because I know a
lot of you guys's I'll be honest a lot
of you guys is like yeah I've been
dragging your feet to do things like
okay it's like cool HTML CSS is easy
javascript is a little bit hard but when
it comes to the backend is like a lot of
you guys is like dragging your feet
I wanna do the backend I just want to
focus on react I did a little focus on
JavaScript guys that's like the easiest
route you could take literally that's
like the easiest route you could take
and say hey man I'm just gonna do the
front-end trust me I did it I went
through the whole process of like two
years without touching the backend
I was scared of touching the back in the
backend had the cooties that's how it
was for me like I I just didn't want to
touch it I was like nah it's like I'm
comfortable with HTML CSS and then once
I started getting nice with JavaScript I
was like oh I found my element I'm good
you know what I mean but you know as
time goes by and you start realizing
that hey man the back end is where
everything it's at you know what I mean
like that's what a real programming
actually happens and you know I was like
that's what a fun is that you know plus
the fact that you get paid you know 10
to $15,000 more than a front-end
developer you know that should be
actually an incentive for people to
actually want to learn it but yeah man
Adam Perron says how do you keep
yourself to stay motivated I know so
much motivations are in summer jacket on
school and only getting four hours of
sleep because of work I don't know man
it's just for me it's all about you know
challenging myself and and seeing the
things that I can't do you know what I
mean like to be honest here on the web I
already have done everything that you
could think of I don't think there's a
like an application out there that I
haven't created yet so if we want to
talk about that and you know I'm bored
with that but that's why I started doing
my youtube channel because I love coding
but building websites and all other
stuff is like repetitive to me and I got
been doing this for like five six years
so now the thing that motivates me is
when I get an email from you guys but I
owe you I got a job Oh Joe you were so
right like I went to this into you and
you was right like everything that you
told me like you know you don't even
know
many people come in and tell me the same
thing like yo man it's like I started
going to interviews and everything that
you say was right and it's like yeah
because I'm a self-taught developer like
everything that I already been through
it's the same thing that I come here and
tell you guys about like you know what I
mean it's a no-brainer everything that I
tell you guys is because it's true guys
is like I don't come in here who wants
to come to you to you know get hated on
a freaking you know Co all types of
names freaking people backstab you like
all type of things like who wants to
come to YouTube every day and do this
for the hell of it right no company
because I'm trying to help you guys man
constantly you know if it was like you
know I'll be ups like is getting to a
point where I'm like at some point I'm
gonna be like hey guys you know don't be
mad about this but we're about to go
like you know super left-field because
you know I've been this is what I've
been doing this whole year I've been
telling you guys what you guys need but
not what people want right what people
want is for me to see hey guys let's do
Python let's do just JavaScript let's
just do view GS right that's what the
people want I'll be honest that's what
the people want but it's not what the
people need No you know things like I've
been actually going against the the
river the you know the avalanche of of
stuff that in reality doesn't really
make make sense but online for SEO
purposes for you know you know for money
reasons it makes sense you know I mean
like I will be you guys don't even know
like me coming out and showing you guys
moving around
is like to be honest is like it's like
going against everything going against
everything out there because right now
what is hot on SEO when it's hot on on
Google on YouTube you know it's ready to
just be like hey guys
Python is the best Python is to think
that where you guys gotta go and at the
same time it's like my channel is about
what development you know what I mean
like I feel like sometimes channels mix
match each other like in the wrong way
cuz it's like are you targeting what
developers are you targeting software
developers are you targeting you know
full applications developer you know app
developers like sometimes people come in
and mix match things like they do like
that
top-10 programming languages of 2018 and
it's like who is the audience that you
actually telling that to because
somebody that comes in and say hey I
want to become a web developer and
somebody comes in and tells me hey yeah
I should marry copling and you're like
wait but that has nothing to do with
what development you get what I'm saying
this is like yeah you know what it was
like the same thing as Python it's like
Python is great for what it is it
there's so much potential with Python
but for the jobs as a web developer you
know I put myself in this box of web
development I'm not putting myself in
programming my channel is not
programming phase my shadow is coding
phase and there's a web development
channel you get what I'm saying you know
sometimes we I wish like people will put
that on the titles like hey man top 10
programming languages for software
developers top 10 programming languages
for web developers top 10 programming
languages for you know I've developer
game developers because it makes more
sense like a new developer a junior
developer one of you guys comes in and
you start searching man what programming
language has to start learning
this year and somebody comes in and
tells you hey man you gotta only thing
that you had to learn on right now is
literally just no TS you learn HTML CSS
JavaScript that's it that's all you have
to touch and it's like that puts you on
instead of you being able to get 100
percent of the jobs that's out there you
puttin yourself on a 20 percent number
right you're like okay I only get 20
percent of the jobs out there instead of
being able to get the full spectrum
right you know this Ruby on Rails this
dotnet there's a PHP there's freaking
this even you know there's a few Python
out there you know it's the no G yes
this what else is out there for what
development you know like this so many
so many different like variations of
stacks that you can learn and just make
yourself you don't have to be a master
of all of them but be able to go in
there and understand how web development
works and then now whatever company you
know you go to and they don't you hey
today we're doing what development wave
you know the Harry Potter framework who
cares because you already know the
fundamentals of what development how
everything works how to build the
application how to deal with migration
is how to deal with database good stuff
like sessions cookies like you know post
requests get requests put patched the
lead destroy like there's so many things
that you could be learning but if you
put yourself on this little box of like
I'm just gonna focus on the front end
and I'm just gonna take the easiest
route which is no Jes is like it doesn't
make sense guys because you're putting
yourself on in a little box that you're
basically putting yourself in a little
box compete with every other person
who's out there and it's lazy you know
because that's when it comes down
a lot of times it's like you're thinking
hey man like oh you know I barely have
the grass have a grass name in in
JavaScript it's like how can I jump from
JavaScript to PHP how can I jump from
JavaScript to Ruby how can I jump to
Python how can I jump to whatever
language out there in Java right how can
I jump to those languages when I should
try to master this one just JavaScript
what happens is you miss out so much so
many jobs right you know imagine this
like I said there's a huge pie the whole
industry has a whole bunch of different
jobs right and each stack has a slice of
the pie all right if you go in and you
say hey man all I could do is no - yes
because it's JavaScript all right you're
putting yourself in a little a little
hole that all you could do is just eat
that one single pie know that one single
slice the pie is humongous you get what
I'm saying
when you're looking for a job out here
you know you want to be able to have
more opportunities instead of just being
able to get one opportunity you gonna
you will you really want to be able to
get every type of job out there because
you are what developer you're not just
an OG s developer a ruby developer own
PHP developer you want to become a web
developer you don't want to become a
freakin no genius Avella Python
developer or JavaScript developer like
you don't want those title you want to
be able to say hey I'm a web developer
you know what I mean those are the
things that is gonna make you great you
know a lot of those guys that do like so
right when you know and that's one of
the best parts about you know going to a
school like when you go and take
computer science a lot of those guys if
they had the right training and
to the right school or the right
professor like those guys are not
limited to just saying hey man all I
could do is it's just you know Java all
I do is Java now those guys are software
developers you know if you're a software
developer it doesn't matter what
technology is in front in front of you
you could just come in and start
building stuff you know and that's one
of the reasons why I tell you guys man
you gotta open up your horizons you
gotta you know try to stay away from the
people that pigeon-holed you into one no
thing you know like all the things that
I give you guys you could go and follow
my timeline right as a self-taught
developer you don't have to buy not even
one course for me you don't have to do
nothing like the timeline is there for a
reason
so you could go in there and literally
find the best courses of each one go
online you don't have to sign up to my
site right because everything that I
tell you is just for your own good right
take that list of things go one by one
even on YouTube
if you wanted to you can literally go on
youtubing and try to find which are the
best youtubers who do tutorials online
for free and find each one just follow
the timeline one by one and you will be
good you know I mean but you cannot be
out here thinking like man all I could
do is just HTML CSS and JavaScript like
guys are gonna get stuck man you gotta
be you know and that's another thing too
man
when people come in and give you an
advice and then I hate man in San
Francisco they give him one hundred and
twenty thousand dollars like some people
that come in and have problems like they
don't even take the job I've seen this
done like somebody sent me an email like
they was given him a pretty decent
amount then we get her like sixty five
thousand dollars to start this guy has
never worked in his life as a developer
I looked at the portfolio that he had in
to be honest you know if he's seen this
right now I'm sorry I'm sorry bro but
for sixty-four sixty-five thousand
dollars and your portfolio if it's true
what you told me that then basically
they want to hire you but you're not
gonna take it because you want more
you've never worked in your life as a
developer you wanna say like people are
giving you a chance going there knock it
out three months do what I did
I went into a company for three months
and then I almost tripled the amount of
money that I was earning at that company
in three months you got a saying so I
said if you so desperate for $100,000
and you feel like you you could get it
I'm being honest if your portfolio is
not that great and somebody's offering
you $65,000 and all you have is like a
few projects from like cold steel you
haven't built like for applications you
had like a little beginner course on
react and you don't even have anything
that has to do with forms and react and
you've got the opportunity to get sixty
five thousand dollars starting like bro
that's why some people end up without a
job you gonna say like some people end
up like no I could find a better one
and then on top of that you live on like
a no smaller city you don't live in the
major tech hubs so it's like you pass
that opportunity you might be out here
waiting for another three months without
being able to get a job like it happens
you know people you know people think
like oh why do people have issues too
you know finding a job and this and that
a lot of time is not that man a lot of
times there's people they want more than
what they supposed to get you know what
I'm saying
I don't know I wish somebody would've
give me 65 starting the first job I took
because I want to look I went to a
couple of comfortable companies I went
to tumblr I went to another company they
both turned me down
I was now ready to even work out those
type of companies because it takes time
it takes skills you gotta ace the the
the freaking the interviews you gotta
have to write projects like there's so
much stuff that you gotta have all right
I have my first job was like I was only
fourteen dollars an hour and I took it
specifically because I said what the
hell am I gonna do am I gonna be in my
house sitting down waiting or suck at
the perfect job just to say oh I'm
waiting for the perfect job now I'm
working I'm learning and I'm earning
money you know gonna seem like a lot of
you guys are out here sitting down in
your house you know now working just
studying and studying and studying when
you have an opportunity to get a job and
still study still build a portfolio
still get nice and people are paying you
a decent amount of like my first job was
thirteen dollars like thirteen something
and the reason why I did it was because
I needed to go in and get that
opportunity alright three months and I
quit
three months I was like yours piece I'd
say yo piece I already got a job I don't
need to be here you get what I'm saying
but that's how it is that's the type of
person that I am man
I'm humble I was humble since I came in
people come in with what this grandiose
you know I had it to love like I'm
supposed to make $100,000 because it
says here that you know some people are
getting a hundred thousand dollars like
bro like yeah you could get a hundred
thousand dollars but you don't live in
San Francisco you know you you're living
like like Savannah Georgia saying
you know what I mean you're living in
like you know Louisiana somewhere under
a tree you get what I'm saying it's like
those states those cities are not paying
that much so it's like if you got a 65
and then you start doing the research
and you start looking at most jobs in
the city that your friend is giving
$45,000 and you got 65 with an okay
freaking portfolio two projects from
coal steel and one freaking react
project from YouTube like and you got 65
K opportunity that means they trust in
you that means they're giving you a
chance man you're telling me like hey
you just throwing that away like you
know how many people out here wish they
could get that on their first shot do
you know what I mean and it's like I
hear all the time like man that this guy
stand there making a hundred thousand
our guys yeah and this guy's going to
the NBA you know what I mean it's like
that's like some dude that is playing
ball right that's playing boy in college
he's playing boy he's like a doing no
crosses just little dribble a little
shot somehow right he doesn't make it to
the NBA on the first round right but he
has the opportunity to go play let's say
China right they pay him and I paying
him twenty million dollars like the NBA
but they'll pay him 1 million dollars
all right he shows up shows that he's
nice with it the next year he's drafted
into a freaking major team and then
people be like oh how did he do that
he just never gave up he started working
he started you know progressing in this
world and making his his skills you know
finessing his skills
to be the one saying you know I'm not
saying that Louisiana is back but I'm
saying let's say you you I don't want to
throw this guy's location at play
let's look at a map right now let's look
at a map in the United States right now
let's say this person is I'm gonna show
you a little side arena because
sometimes people will do the research
and then you know they F themselves up
because they think like a man other
people are making $100,000 bro like this
is not you're not living at the same
thing let's say this person is from from
Lafayette Louisiana
all right Lafayette Louisiana laughing
yeah Louisiana's not even one of the
major cities of Louisiana right it's not
one of the big cities there's not Baton
Rouge with ninety warnings it's like one
of the cities on the side right it's the
same thing as me I'm never Connecticut
but I don't live in the major cities of
Connecticut I live like one of the side
road cities of Connecticut you get what
I'm saying like you know so for me to
come in if tomorrow I come in and like
hey I've decided to go work at a company
yeah I go to a company I'm like hey man
my last job was paying me $100,000 and
I'm expecting to get paid $100,000 in
Washington Connecticut people's gonna
look at me like I'm crazy because that's
not what they pay in that area you got
I'm saying like you might be lucky but
if you leaving it to luck then that's on
you you you live you know in a wild
world you know what I mean like you live
in this crazy world where you think like
the world it's nice like that
you know I mean sounds like you got a
little your research and you gotta be
appreciative your first job is just your
first job you know what I mean it's like
it's like you're walking into McDonald's
and being like hey man you know I heard
I heard they paint managers you know $20
an hour them the manager on McDonald's
is gonna look at you like yo bro like
you wallet you gonna say me they're
gonna look at you like you're bro you
wallet like you want $20 in McDonald's
without putting no work without we don't
even know if you can even flip a burger
just because you came in here with a
t-shirt that says McDonald's you think
you gotta get payment manage your money
it doesn't work like that
it's your first job man like why why why
wouldn't you why wouldn't you just take
it it's your first job no company has
responsibility they don't owe you
anything they don't know your diaper
Tony they don't owe you you know it's
like you're just getting in the game you
get what I'm saying like this the
problem people they just getting in the
game you know a lot of people that go to
boot camps I see this all the time man
they go to a boot camp they lie to them
they tell them hey man you could get a
hundred thousand dollars plus you know
and then they go to job interviews and
they came and passed a job in to use you
know I mean so I'll be just like you
people are crazy in this world man you
know I'm gonna do that send me that
email man listen don't get upset man
I'm just being honest with you live like
me personally looking at the portfolio
looking at your work look at other
things that you you've done if if it's
true that they given you the opportunity
say
because me personally I wouldn't offer
$65,000 at that level that you're at
right now
and that's just being honest that's like
the hard truth of things you know
unfortunately have to be honest with
people you know sometimes if you're
nobody's honest with you then you know
things don't go right but I rather
somebody tell me the truth like if you
go if you go right now assets for
example to any major company or if that
portfolio with those projects they're
gonna be like your bro like how did you
even get past the for the phone
interview you know what I mean like you
gotta you gotta have like
top-of-the-line stuff man if you really
want to get those top dollars you know
like you gotta get that top dollar
website man nice design or no mistakes
on it everything you know responsive
like you want something legit but you
know we gotta we gotta stop with this
whole ego thing man we gotta stop with
this whole ego thing of like I'm nice
you know I was like I came in and I put
in I put in two hours and like yeah you
put in two hours and just like another
10,000 20,000 people who went to college
went to boot camps went to online
schools like but what makes you
different from them you know you have to
really start thinking about things like
that
but yeah man
yeah I don't know what my antennas
acting up man my my internet is acting
up for sure I could see it going up and
down
if you look on Google search the average
salary for developers around 65 is this
information true or valid true and valid
yes it is true it is true which is some
don't wanna they don't want to face you
know what I mean like people don't want
to talk about that people don't want to
say hey man you know people are making
like sixty five thousand people are
making forty five thousand a year in
some parts of this country I don't know
what the Internet's acting up man
it's I think because I was like
uploading something

that's what I'm using right now I'm
using OBS is it Danielle or Daniel I
don't know was the opinion Pluralsight
Pluralsight is cool Pluralsight is just
what it is
Watterson says can you learn programming
and then jump to freelancing without
working the job yes you could definitely
do it you definitely do freelancing like
a lot of guys do it like most of the
developers from from like you know other
countries like India Jamaica Philippines
a lot of those guys haven't worked in in
