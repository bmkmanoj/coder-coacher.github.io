could give you food but I here you go
here so forth right cool you got food
now how about tomorrow
how you gonna eat am I gonna feed you
again no so for that I rather come in
and teach you how to fish right okay I
taught you how to fish but now that you
know how to fish
doesn't mean that you can only fish in
the same lake that I take you it doesn't
mean only facing the same beats that are
taking now with that example I'm gonna
talk about the question hey guys this is
your boy Joe back at it again man coding
fees.com your boys backing out and did
it again yeah we're here
alright so today we're gonna answer
somebody's email right now this is a
very good question because a lot of you
guys probably feel the same way and a
lot of you guys are thinking the same
way and I don't know why I want you guys
to take this I'm gonna bring this
example from the beginning and I already
said this before okay pretty much so
this kid hit me up with basically he
wanted to know like Joe you know this
new project that you're building sounds
pretty cool I want to do it I want to
work on it and it's great I'm happy for
it right but he feels like you know
dirty a hundred two hundred three
hundred people are also going to do the
same project and it's like if they're
all going to do the same project how am
I going to eat how am I gonna make money
because they're all building the same
project guys understand this when you
take a course when you're learning
something new you're learning the
concepts you're not going into the
course and say hey I'm gonna take this
course and reuse it and put it in my
portfolio not every situation is gonna
work like that yes you could take this
example put it into your portfolio or
apply into something but you're learning
concepts you're learning concepts you're
learning new ideas you're learning to
use new tools for your career
right it's not like cookie cutter where
you could say hey I'm gonna cut this and
reuse this and this is gonna work every
single time no it doesn't work like that
guys I'm teaching you guys how to fish
all right I can teach you how to fish I
can take you to the link but that
doesn't mean you always gotta go back to
that same lake I hope you guys
understand what I'm saying with that
right I'm teaching you how to code I'm
teaching you how people make money but
that doesn't mean just because we did
this project this is the project that
you need to continue to make money right
because those are the problems that a
lot of a lot of people that create
tutorials they sell you that dream where
it's like hey you take this course you
take this class this specific project is
a specific way it's gonna make you a
millionaire know what you're learning is
the concepts of how to make money
because if you don't know how to make
money who cares if you know the skills
right if you know how to code but you
don't know where to find a job who cares
it's like you could code in your house
know how to code but you don't know how
to find clients then how are you gonna
make money you know what I mean like
that's the same thing for this project
this project is about how to use your
skills that you already know your HTML
CSS JavaScript and some of you guys are
more advanced in that some of you guys
already know the backend how you can
make money creating small services out
there put it up online launching it on
the domain
put it in a host servers like Namecheap
GoDaddy etc and make money right the
reason why I'm telling you about this is
because I've done it and it works with
right now doesn't mean that because
we're doing a crypto project like a
cryptocurrency profits type of project
means that that's what you need to build
no you have to do your research you have
to take this course and understanding
and learning and be like ok this is what
we did for this project right how to
calculate the profits right it's a small
little service
now we got a launch it does it mean that
you have to build the same thing know
what you need to do is understand all
the steps that we took to build this
thing and launch it and say hey you know
what I worked for like your boy Jerry
your boy Jerry he comes here there's a
very good example he's learning to code
because he wants to create a service for
the ambulances and in the fire
department
he wants to create a service for those
people because he knows what they need
so he's learning to become a developer
because of that because he already has a
good idea for that right it's the same
thing for you guys guys you telling me
you've never been to let's say for
example God to go get you your driver's
license right and you gotta ask a
million questions when you get there and
the person that's in front of you it's a
complete a hole and you're like I don't
want to deal with this person they gotta
be an easier way how about you with the
skills that you have and everything that
I already taught you create that right
or how about hey I'm over here and you
know and a piece of shop we are waiting
for our slice of pizza right this seems
very simple and very stupid we're
waiting for a slice of pizza that's 20
of us waiting for a slice of pizza right
everybody got an order instead of us
waiting on the line how about we sign in
on a website or an application and then
from there you call us want to go to the
register you know what I'm saying
instead of us using like you know how
you ever been to Applebee's and
Applebee's give you like a little button
that flashes whenever your your food is
ready or your tables ready
how about we do that for all night on a
website where any any company could come
in and be like okay everybody who's
waiting online go to this line go to
this website the QR code scan this QR
code and now you're signed in and etc
and now you're waiting online without
having to wait on line
you can literally be outside smoking a
cigarette hanging out with your friends
talking you know talking with your
friends come up with a service that's
gonna make people's lives easier don't
expect that my project is supposed to be
the one that you're going to reuse for
your projects or your way to make money
because then that will be me selling you
a dream no I don't do that I don't want
to do that for you guys man this is not
about me telling you guys this specific
project it's the one that's gonna make
you a millionaire
I don't do that guys I don't tell you
hey use this project this is the one
that is gonna make you blow up this is
the one that is gonna get you a job I
don't do that but even when I tell you
guys the five projects that will
guarantee you to get a job because they
will guarantee you to get a job because
they all have different difficulties
that if I'm an employer and I'm hiring
somebody and I see that they have a real
estate they have a portfolio they have a
digital agency they have a restaurant
they have our e-commerce I know this
person can literally build anything that
I throw at them especially if they got
the front end and the back end you get
what I'm saying but that doesn't mean
that just because I tell you that those
are the only projects that you need you
need to put on from your outside and
it's like I'm teaching you the skills
man it doesn't work like that where I
could just grab your hand bring you into
a job it doesn't work like that let's be
a realistic guys you have to put in your
part I can't hold your hand bring you
into a job I give you the skills I show
you the things that are going to make
you a better developer give you like a
leg up above everybody else was going
into jobs but you have to also use your
brain I'll keep bringing this word out
use your brain this certain things out
here that should be like a requirement
like I don't know like that should be at
the bottom of every course or everything
that I do is like minimal requirement
using your brain that's it
you know what I'm saying and I know
probably somebody like mad but I'm new
to this I'm just
learning this guy's this is not science
this is just logic you get what I'm
saying like this is logic come in again
what I'm saying like come in create the
project learn from what I'm teaching you
from there reuse the skills that you've
learned and apply to your own idea this
is not about me telling you this
specific project is going to work for
you no because that's what I'm telling
you guys one of the things that I send
the main video said hey if you need a
large team or you need a lot of time to
build an app you already failed because
it needs to be a small app something
that you could test it and see if it
works if it doesn't work you leave it
alone and you try again with another
application if you see let's say you
create something for healthcare system
healthcare system doesn't give you
enough traffic you leave down you work
on something else like you find the
right needs you try create something
quick if it works then you're scaling
you get what I'm saying like this
project that I'm building is not the
only project that you're supposed to
have on your portfolio you get one on me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
