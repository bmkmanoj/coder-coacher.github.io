again man coding face.com you boys
backing out and did it again once again
with another portfolio review we're
gonna go over this kid Marva Ramirez CA
which I believe that's what Canada
pretty much it seems pretty legit
is very simple there is a cool design
very original F noticing a design like
this so this is cool
basically you screw as soon as you screw
it shows you a whole different section
of the website he has a a cool
background here and moving around a
little quick animation ain't got the
little Superman pixelated thingy it's
cool also too he has like a you know in
about a paragraph about him you know so
that's good you know
so I'm guessing he's like a designer
slash slash developer which is great man
you know says he does CMS theme builders
or WordPress often the C and Python so
it's pretty legit so there's other
skills that he has he's comfortable HTML
CSS JavaScript jQuery WordPress
comfortable you know Ajax angularjs PHP
my sequel says less comfortable with C
C++ Python Ruby on Rails and Postgres
that's pretty simple right let's see oh
you got another thing here cool so let's
say you got projects alright let's see
this I see his projects I like this it's
pretty clean looks pretty dope turn on
to life I see alright gallery is cool it
shows that he could use api's and he
know how to use it so that's cool let me
see what else he got the public
it's a CMS
I don't know about this one I don't know
about that one if I will put that one up
there
well barbecue smokebox calm seems like
this is a Webster that he built this
seems pretty legit seems like a real
business and they still open
you know guessing stove it's the dot-com
still working so this is cool I like it
definitely like it where I wouldn't mind
that right now all right let me see what
else what else is in here
we're Tree Service Tree Service I gave a
tree service stumping services about us
pretty cool so this is cool like you
know sometimes I tell you guys right
yeah
you don't have to have like a website
for like let's say nike.com or something
like that like this is a grill life
cases like you know what I mean like
these are services that people have like
you could literally reach out to
companies like this around your
neighborhood your area and reach out to
them but I hate let me build your
website you don't have a website let me
build it now
most likely they pay them for this right
because it's pretty Lee James pretty
pretty good right but you guys as a
branding developer you could go out
there and reach out to companies and but
I hey man can we you know can I create
your website can you know whatever right
so you could have something that's real
on your portfolio you have like a real
calm like he has here that shows like
hey this is actually a real business
that he built this website for okay so
this is pretty cool
JavaScript drunky
see look it's working
yeah I don't know I think that the
sounds are a little bit off can't hear
anything
let me see jQuery HTML doulas and good
old to do that
good old to do let's guys I mean it
looks nice looks nice and clean you know
so that's cool but definitely I will say
it's better to have more projects okay
so there's projects coming soon that's
fine so he's working on MongoDB Express
node.js bootstrapper Ruby on Rails
projects coming soon
that's cool all right so far what I can
say about this for 40 years I liked it
it's definitely something cool he shows
his personality he shows he has like
what it takes to be a developer
he has like real businesses that he's
actually worked for and/or like created
websites for so that's pretty cool shows
me that he can use api's with the map
you know the load jQuery to do this I
don't know if that's even needed there
the drumkit I'm a little bit like I
don't think that's needed there either
and I would say have a little bit more
projects more real projects in here but
besides that everything is good it's
pretty legit Freddie smooth you know so
that wasn't nothing crazy about this it
was pretty sore so I actually liked the
fact that you could go left and right
and you know it'll switch for you or you
just come in here like that click at the
top it's pretty cool I like it so yeah
man there's another review by your boy
Joe back at it again alright man coding
freeze calm there's a pretty good
website I mean there's really not much
to say to it you know because the
website is pretty legit the only thing
that I will say is half more
projects in there like real-life
projects and that's about it besides
that it seems like you already know what
to do it's just probably you just need
the extra time to add more projects but
besides that the portfolio itself looks
fine you know what I mean so I'll see
you guys later make sure you go to the
description below guys the only way to
support the channel is either subscribe
to my website you know or when you click
one of the udemy links you know we get a
little something back but yeah man you
already knows your boy joke back at it
again coding face.com you boys back in I
didn't bid it again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
