back at it again man country's calm
listen today's topic is very simple you
know
listen everybody here is talking about
all my Mexican business Mexican dad you
know Donald Trump this Donald Trump that
but let's bring it back to technology
and let's bring it back to make
something real ok so he under us
everybody knows this nobody wants to put
in the work and some of you guys are
guilty of that too and you know it come
on don't lie but we all want to get paid
a lot of money we all want to have fun
while doing it right and here in the US
it has become a thing of like everybody
wants to be the next Kim Kardashian
everybody wants to be the next
Karrueche everybody wants to be the next
so I don't know whatever art is whatever
you know LeBron James whatever all
basketball player football player
whoever's out here getting money just by
playing ball or being actress or being
an actor whatever you want me to say
basically celebrities right so everybody
in the US they want to become
celebrities everybody wants to be famous
well everybody wants money but nobody
wants to put in that work now what
happened there a lot of people goes to
school to basically study things like
philosophy psychology oh you know music
theory I hope unto that in the real
world out here
someone get you know money don't get you
anywhere so to say that um basically I
have this article here we're basically
Tesla is looking for engineers in Mexico
because the demand for you know engineer
in the u.s. is really big but then
there's not that many it's not how many
supply of the you know engineers in here
I don't like you know compared to other
countries where you know you gotta NBA
go to China you go to Japan you go to
Jeremy you know there's a whole bunch of
people who studying you know math and
sciences here in the US nobody wants to
study that we all hate math and I'm
guilty of that too
sorry um but yeah and to me it's just
funny that you know people will be like
oh my god we can't we shouldn't be
hiring nobody from other countries and
to come here and take our jobs and
listen that and to one extent I agree
with them there's enough people in the
United States to be able to work any job
here in the US but the problem is that
there's not that many people that are
qualified there's not that many people
who want to put in that work everybody
wants to get the easy route so in in
that situation this is what happens you
know and a great American company which
can be even called Tesla an American
company when you know Elon Musk is South
African so if he is that an American
company I don't you know what I mean but
cars are made here in California a lot
of the pieces made all over the world
like very iPhone and everything else in
the world you know because of free
markets but this is you know it just
always brings it up like hey nobody
wants to put in that work so there's not
that many engine easier you know even
for what developers this you know
there's a high demand for web developers
but can all those jobs be filled no not
really because nobody wants to come here
and put in to three months of busting
their ass on learning this day and it's
like I tell you guys you know in moving
I do Lord the rock East at and I create
all these tutorials I notice Lee I get
like this video alone probably will get
no no a thousand maybe a couple of
thousands of views but then a tutorial
which is you learning something and you
having to put in the work most people
won't watch it nobody wants to put in
the work they want to know what's the
easiest what's the easy way to get money
what's the easiest way to get a job
what's the easiest way to get promoted
on a job but nobody's looking for the
real answer which is just do your job
plus yes and you're gonna get there you
know and also be smart because sometimes
doing all the work doesn't mean that's
gonna guarantee you something you have
to use your brain you know it's like
well plenty of people who basically
after breakfast plenty of times online
and see commas I got a computer science
it isn't that I can't find a job I mean
bro like where are you looking for like
if you're looking for a job and you
can't find it on your area go to the
next town find it over there or go to
the next that you find it over there
because the jobs are there if you you're
not getting a job it's your fault
to be honest with you the jobs are
really right there and companies are
hiring people that are not even
qualified because they like okay cool
this person Mosul Oakville HTML CSS and
then we're just gonna hire them directly
to you know a company and it's like you
know don't learn once they get here
don't learn in the next two three months
we'll give them training but they're not
even qualified a lot of the people you
know let's he'll always bring a boot or
boot camps but a lot of the people that
come out of boot camps are not even
qualified and then some of them do get
high high paying jobs and then once they
get there the company basically is
taking up a risk of like yeah this
person's gonna come here we're gonna
train them for the next three to six
months you know the boot camp gave them
three months we're gonna give them
another six months of training here
learning small projects you know for the
long term this person to stay here with
us do people really saying learn orally
but a lot of these companies are taking
a risk because there's not that many
people who are qualified to take this
job so
you know reading the same whereas I hate
like a whole bunch of engineers went
over there enough nothing like that
Alfred American Republic and when you
say hey I'm an engineer or I'm studying
engineering or I'm doing something you
know like I say engineering or architect
or anything we'll make massive sides
people you know respecting that
oh wow this person's engineering or my
son is starting to become an engineer or
something like that right here in the US
I don't even see that I don't really see
that at all from people like being smart
it's not it's not cool that's one of the
reasons why I made this channel was I
came and you could still be cool still
coming here and with the swag you know
what I mean like hello with the swag and
just do you but still be be smart and
still do something positive you know I
mean like you don't have to be a
basketball player you don't have to be a
Instagram guy you don't have to be a
bartender you don't have to be a
stripper you don't have to be a drug
dealer you don't have to be a freakin
bad school play don't have to be a
football player well you don't have to
be X whatever you feel it right all the
voices that everybody wants to be here
in the u.s. you don't have to be that to
live a comfortable life because most of
the people who live comfortably there in
our basketball players they're not
Instagram dots they're not none of those
things they're just you know the regular
guy the regular dentist or the regular
doctor who just you know he makes a 300
400 thousand dollars a year you know
drives a little Tesla um has his kids in
private schools chillin while you know
some of us is how here trying to be a
basketball player so I want to be a bowl
of on and play ball that's what I want
to do when I grow up I just want to play
ball
and in reality man you up your knee
you up your ankle your career is
done you didn't go to college you can't
do nothing we have for Plan B now you
over here at Walmart you know
so I made this video because there's
like you know people are gonna talk
about oh we shouldn't hire people for
outside of the country but it's it's not
that we should hire Louis that we have
to now because nobody else is studying
this this topics this this degrees is
all the skills that you need for the new
economy which is technology and yeah
that's a big problem us anyways guys
