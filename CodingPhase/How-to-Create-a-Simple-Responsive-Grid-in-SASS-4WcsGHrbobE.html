basically create a grid system something
simple something easy you know what we
were doing here before what we had you
know the column d4 and all of that stuff
we're going to delete all of that so if
you still have it they're deleting the
reason why I don't have it is because my
computer crashed I don't know how well
not really the computer that Adam
crashed and it saved everything but I
wasn't recording so just basically
anything would be low here just delete
it right so all you have is this the
counting area and cell your accounting
area that is CSS you have that idea of
console area everything below it delete
it that's it and then we're gonna come
to main we're going to put import grid
now don't save it yet because it's gonna
give you an error right now here
basically put underscore grid that s CSS
all right and then here we're basically
now come back to me save this all right
put grid above content area and then you
should be good all right now we're gonna
start by basically declaring a few
variables so there's the variables that
we want to declare we want to put it
here and let's put a comment you're
gonna say grid system all right so what
we're doing is we're doing how many
columns are gonna be in the grid what's
the max width of the columns a well max
width of the grid itself from there we
have breaking point for a small breaking
point for medium breaking point for
large screens and breaking point for
Excel for me it's just you know big
screens you know I don't know 4k TVs and
all that alright now let's go back to
the grid and let's
I had a couple of classes okay so we're
gonna go to grid is CSS we're going to
basically put in new classes one is
going to be called container which is
gonna be your with 100% in there
margin:0 auto right now definitely we
have container after we're gonna say
something like row after and we
basically gonna add a content just an
empty space and then from there we're
gonna say display table clear:both and
the reasons why we're doing this is
because we're going to be using a lot of
floats so floating left floating right
right so whenever we use those we need
to clear the container around them right
so what we're gonna do is here we're
going to add this this selector right
and we're gonna say okay basically any
class or any element out there right
we're targeting any element that has the
class of call - right and we're saying
hey padding:1em with 100 percent minimum
height one pixel display inline inline
block right something simple so whenever
you say call md six or five or whatever
or if we come here call large six
we're basically targeting all all of
those that that match that requirement
of Cole - right
so now the next thing that we're going
to do is we're going to basically work
with the breakpoints now this is media
queries guys this is just to make
everything responsive all right now what
we want to do is we're going to come
here and put in media queries right so
what we're doing is we're saying media
all right and then right here we're
basically putting in the variable of
small alright breakpoint small so
remember the variables what we're doing
is we're taking this line here and
pasting it there
we're using that that variable to
basically you know put it here so
instead
was having to change it everywhere else
we just change it here in the variable'
it's for whatever reason we wanted to
say hey small starts at let's say 400
pixels automatically this would change
it here all right so let's come back
here put this to zero all right now what
we're going to do is for this break
points more okay and we're gonna come
here and we say hey container is with 95
percent max width is whatever the the
grits max with so if we say here on the
variables we said to a hundred pixels so
that's as big as the container is gonna
get okay
now for this what we're going to do is
we're going to loop through every single
one of them from one to the number of
columns so we said we wanted to have 12
columns all right so now here what we do
is we basically say okay while we're
looping through every single one and
saying okay this is one and then it will
change the tool don't change the three
and it's the same things to testing here
all right remember we was doing this
before manually was saying okay call MD
- 4 equals 2 with 100% divided by 12
times 1 but I was actually doing it like
this which was something like what was a
let's say four times four hundred
divided by 12 plus percent that's how I
was doing it before but this is actually
a more easier way for us to get started
for this grid now let me save this right
here I'm gonna run MPN run what ok curly
nothing is happening
all right now what we want to do is we
want to come here
copy this and paste it and say medium
all right so we set medium and then
after medium we're gonna come here and
change a few things so instead of SM
we're gonna put MD for medium and we're
gonna do this one more time we're gonna
say call LG and we're gonna say large
all right copy this one more time and
then from there what we're gonna say
here is Missy bring point lodge put
expel and then we're gonna put here XL
now we save that as you can see our grid
is not working now if we come to the
index page and we were to do something
like this something where we say hey for
MD this is 4 for 4 right let's say we
want this to be call large 6 so
basically you want it to be 50% of the
container or the screen when it's large
and then let's say for this SM we want
this to be something like let's say 8 8
and here we're gonna say call MD let's
say 4 that's fine we're gonna say SM so
SM we want this to be at 4 now as we
start moving the screen you start seeing
the containers change you see
so now we have more control of it now of
course you can also come here and say
something like this like okay calm Excel
Excel we want it to be at three or let's
say to copy this paste it here now or
refresh this it is how it is so large
that's all no this is extra-large this
is large this is medium this is small
all right now you see what I'm doing
here this is just basically we just
created a grid that's responsive and
super simple it is it wasn't even that
much lines right like it was like let me
see and we could probably even condense
this even more put this into mixing so
it could be even smaller than what it is
right now
but it's fun it's just something simple
a simple grid for us to have and then
basically we have the variables here and
yeah that's about it kids so I'm gonna
see you guys later
yeah subscribe make sure you check out
the website man : face comm there's a
quick tutorial we still got more to do
but yeah man we here man
coding face.com your boys back and I
didn't did it again you dig</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
