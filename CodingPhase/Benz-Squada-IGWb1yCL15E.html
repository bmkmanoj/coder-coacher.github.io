nothing you're like one of the best
things in the world and this is
motivational purposes only motivational
purposes only
are repeat motivational purposes only
you know when you are here man
I would definitely suggest to you guys
like just really really really really if
you're gonna buy something you want like
something quality spend the extra money
man you know sometimes we we cheap you
know what I mean I got out of us we're
cheap I'm cheap as hell I'll be honest
man but
like nothing beats quality man
nothing beats quality nothing beats the
way people treat you like you know so
whatever I just came from from the
freakin how you call this the dealership
and with their little sign let's just
let's just say we how does future say
 up some commas right now but you
know when you're a regular out here you
know they treat you with respect
you know and I enjoy that you know I
mean like I'll be wondering I mean you
know for those guys like the big ballers
you know I mean you imagine being like
somebody like Elon Musk like I'll hear
like anything that you want you could
get like your name ring bells you go
into places and people with it oh my god
you know must this just came in you know
what I mean like people worry what you
eat oh man
you know must just order the freakin
cheeseburger from she's worked deluxe
now that cheeseburger they called it
that you know the Elon Musk deluxe you
know what I mean
but I just be wondering sometimes like I
live a comfortable lifestyle I'm not
rich
I left comfortable but what if you are
rich well if you like a big baller man
like people treat me good you know what
I mean
but what if you have like millions and
millions of dollars like yo you must
feel like a god oh saying you know what
I mean like that's where a lot of times
you see like those people that they do
like crazy stuff like you ever seen this
guy wasn't the guy's name um what's the
guy's name from the Kardashian damn
Scott Disick yo Scott Disick walking
around like he's a god you know what I
mean like that dude is a home and that
dude is like yo like no matter what he
does it's like he's like y'all you know
he's an a-hole
yes I keep that do it is like I don't
know
because he been so privileged his whole
life like he don't know what a struggle
is you know what I mean and there's
people like that like we just passed me
wifey and my sister-in-law we just
passed like an area here in Connecticut
where it's like the minimum household
income is like five million dollars
that's the average and like you start
seeing crazy houses so this is where my
my dealership for Mercedes Benzes is
located in them and it's very close to
my house but I live in a regular house
you know but every time you come over
here you got to go through this like
amazing neighborhoods were you like man
you feel poor as hell you know what I
mean but I love it you know I love being
around that I don't know why it just
motivates me like right now I want to go
home I want a cold
I wanna go and freakin build another app
long stat I want to release my course I
wanna you know reach out to a whole
bunch of other freaking companies so for
them to take my courses and sell it on
their platforms like it's just
motivation man motivational purposes
only
like you gotta be out here man like you
guys don't know
you know what I mean like I'm just a
regular dude like ain't nothing special
about me
you know like
but what is good I'll be honest like you
go in there man once they know your name
already like they know you at the
dealership that like hey how you doing
mr. Santos what can we help you with oh
you want something to drink
you sit you down in the comfortable
chair the chair that reclines back gives
you a massage if you want to you know
what I mean like it's crazy so I mean if
I get that and I'm just some bum ass
dude I'm just some buff man stood out
here
like that's how consider I'm like yo I'm
just I'm bummed compared to the dudes
that be going into that dealership I'm
like I'm a bum this guy's got businesses
this guy's got you know walk-in and a 5
million dollar home I'm just a regular
dude man but that's motivation man
that's definitely motivation for me man
cuz it's like man I gotta get on my
shake
you know I was like I quit my job for a
reason it's time to take it up a notch
you know I was like so what that I'm
making the same thing that I was making
when I was working full time who cares
whoopty do whoopty do Joe you want a
candy for that you know I mean how can
we say hey man we want to open up
businesses man you know what I mean like
and it just you know like just like I
don't know man I'm not explaining like
you really got to go hard man that's
what I'm telling you guys you guys are
just learning man yeah just in the
beginning of this world in this world of
technology like you got to come into
this thing what a plan
you got a come into this with a vision
you know there's a lot of smart guys
there's a lot of guys martyr than me a
lot of guys smarter than you but what
makes the differences how bad do you
want it these guys that they you know
they know this smart so they don't work
as hard these guys that come in and you
know instead of like blaming themselves
for the things that happen to them they
blame others I don't even when something
bad happens I just like them and the
universe is up but when people
are pissed off things are not going
their way they blame others they blame
other people that like oh this person
didn't do this for me this person didn't
let me get the job this person then let
me get the promotion this person this is
in there like groaning stop blaming
people
you know I mean like just keep pushing
man keep working keep working man you
gotta get it right now you probably
think of man react man the reactors hard
all the back end is hard
whatever is hard alright stop worrying
about that man like straight up just do
it you're gonna get through it it's hard
in the beginning but once you get
through it it's like then you just
chilling you know
what I mean so yeah
but yeah man I don't know every time I
come out here is just his motivation for
me man cuz I always think I'm like man
if this hunter you get treated out here
you know what if whatever I just somehow
we f up the game somehow I don't know
you know I am a big of glitch in the
matrix and like you imagine your boy in
a potato out here hey if I was a cop a
little bit Taylor like you know crazy
that must be the feeling of it people
will be like damn
not the same and we grind him and it's
just the beginning man you know I told
people today like it's not it's not like
I want to be putting out you know when
bad things happen or when good things
happen this is not about drama please
doctor ah this is about coding phase
calm you're living my life you're seeing
all the things that happen to me you see
when people hate you seeing where people
love you know when things go good when
things go bad it's all part of the you
know the process that's how the world is
you know what I mean like you can't I
can't be fake I can't be putting up all
the time
happy videos you know like I come in and
this channel is how can I say it's a
hybrid between a vlog and between
putting informational videos online it's
a mixture it's not just one thing it's a
mixture so it's mixed between both of
them
like we got vlogs sort of vlogs videos
right
it's not funny like oh hey guys I'm over
here in the scenery and I'm in
Connecticut here's the birds nah you
just get like real life stuff that
happens to me and I just share it I
decide to share like a moment if I feel
happy that moment I come in and I'll
share it with you guys
you know what I mean so different
situations but it's crazy though man I
was just thinking in there man
you know people come in and I pee
obviously something somewhere I'm like
how do people freaking live like you
know we passing by this crazy
neighborhood like I'm telling you like
houses many moments like five million
minimum and I'm thinking in my head yeah
how do people make money out here huh
what is it that they do you know a lot
of times it's all money like we can't
but we can put that aside we can put
that under the rug you know what I mean
like the game is not fair you know some
of us come in and we're born into
families that have everything and some
of us like me we come in and we start
with negative 100 you know what I mean
like we start negatively in this world
like when I came into this world I came
in negatively blank there's no money
there's you know I was already messed up
off the jump my parents divorced you
know parents divorced I don't have a you
know mom and dad in the house my mom
freaking wasted money constantly and at
casinos gambling problems income tax
check spent it all on herself a whole
bunch of stuff you know I really didn't
go to a really good school because for
our main reason because I was like man
if I go to like a freaking I was
supposed to go to Syracuse University
right hey by the time I graduated from
there I woulda came out with like a
$80,000 debt so I was like I'm not gonna
do that to myself my life is already on
negative so what I did I went to a
community college as shitty as it sounds
but things work out somehow things work
out because I made it work I didn't go
in there for the education I went in
there to say hey I got an associate's
degree and then I went to a four-year
school and then how you call this I went
to a four-year school there for a
communication design then even after I'm
basically done I realized I don't even
want to do web design I don't want to be
a designer so as I had to start from
scratch again

watched the wet crow quick clean that
off nice and shiny it's all part of the
package
