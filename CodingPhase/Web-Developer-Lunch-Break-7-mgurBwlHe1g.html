back at it again man : freeze calm
listen your boys back I didn't did it
again man I hope you guys really enjoyed
the new video that I just dropped I got
a couple of new videos that are pretty
legit on the tutorial I'm doing it
tonight releasing it tonight you know
gonna show you guys the layout going to
show you how to break down a website you
know just from a design and how to make
into HTML and CSS so that's the first
step then the second step is going to be
doing some JavaScript you know and then
from there is jumping into larvae you
know how to work with the backend and
like I said it's going to be an
e-commerce store basically about bait I
don't know if you guys know about bait
be a PE obey the nate is a japanese
company is pretty much in us fashionable
clothing street fashion but you know it
costs a lot of money
tricking hoodies is like $400 eight
hundred dollars
alright but that's not the point the
point is that I'm doing some new
tutorials yeah man don't so cool shit
lunch break special kids
so go ahead man if you have any
questions let me know I will answer it
let me see whatever I without Friday can
okay segi what up I want to know as a
positive possible to become a full sack
developer with good experience of course
yeah you can become a full developer
soon as full stack developer soon as
you're able to work in the front end
like if I tell you hey Johnny go fix you
know fix this menu change this you know
this words on the page you know make
this page out of this design and
definitely I'll tell you hey also make
sure that saves the users email save the
users information once you're up to that
level yeah you could be a full stack
developer because now you're dabbling
into both sides front end and the back
end you know so let's say cyber sound
says I started using nodejs and Express
how can you upload every images I can't
figure it out well to upload I think
this you got to look at the file system
there's a whole bunch of packages that
people have created you know and most of
the time that's what people use I
haven't really done a file upload with
nodejs
so I want to be able to tell you I
haven't really created a app that had to
do file upload the
I know how to do a PHP which pretty much
is going to be the same thing and like
movie your rails they all do the same
thing so all you got to do is find the
right package Moltar okay cool
yeah the last time I used motor it was a
long time ago when I was first starting
to to learn nodejs
it just seemed like a fucking mess you
know and that's one of the reasons why
I'm not a huge fan of nodejs because a
lot of people create packages a lot of
people create things and since it's
JavaScript anybody couldn't release it
to the world it's like nobody checks it
nobody Jie checks is like you know how
you G check the G you know what I mean
like if you know what I mean like how do
you G check the G so that's like the
situation where no js' it's like anybody
could go in there and it release a
package anybody could go in there
release a library release or a framework
but is it really good I don't know so
the best advice I would say is look into
nodejs file system and basically just
build it yourself because most people
don't even know how to really create a
proper package they just release it and
people start giving the stars and next
thing you know it's popular but it has a
whole bunch of bugs or somebody created
something that was good but now it's
outdated so I don't know feel no js' is
easier than PHP I think PHP is easier
than on Jas
because this so much shit that's already
built to it like you know almost
everything that you could think of is
already built into PHP but when it comes
to no js' you gotta get body parser you
gotta get cookies my package for cookies
you gotta get a package for everything
follow yes all right guys let me see
here you just have to require a sheet
man in no J's you got to require every
single little thing or you have to build
it yourself from scratch and that's like
what I don't like about it you know but
people think that just because you have
the same programming language meaning
JavaScript that is good because as I own
now I know JavaScript from the front end
and then I could reuse that in the same
language in the back end and it's like
no they're two completely different
things
the syntax is similar but knowing no GS
is not the same thing as knowing
JavaScript in the front end you know so
it's like if you're going to have to
relearn a whole bunch of shit to do back
in with John JavaScript I rather just
used a scripting language that was meant
for you know for the backend you know
something like Ruby PHP Python freaking
crystal lang
you know what I mean so but that's my
that's my opinion they already know a
little turkey sandwich developer lunch
break you can't go wrong
and like I said guys I'm gonna start
making this you know lunch breaks a
little shorter than what I used to I
used to be making this uh developing
lunch breaks as like you know 30 minutes
40 minutes and then that's eating up my
whole lunch break so what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna do 15 minutes at 15 minutes
so that when bandar but let me see so
what else people Zach
yeah and your company to use node that's
cool yeah I think a lot of people just
jump on a bandwagon to be honest with
you like a lot of companies don't like a
lot of new companies people just jump on
a bandwagon nodejs is fun but it's not
reliable it's not like I will if I had
to say if I have like a you know for
example a 10 million dollar company a 50
million dollar company I wouldn't put it
on nodejs because it's not reliable
javascript is not reliable that you guys
know that the guy that created
javascript did it in one week and that's
why javascript has so many flaws and so
many problems you know most people don't
know that or they they tend to forget
you know anything that's made in one
week to me is not that reliable you know
once in a blue moon they do a little
upgrade the dollar update to the
language like es6 but
but you know what I mean so besides that
they never update the freakin language
they never fix a lot of shit because too
many companies so many browsers are
already using javascript the way how it
is all messed up and all fucked up right
so they're not gonna fix it so it's like
you literally work in whatever a
language that's flawed at its core is
flawed
a man does God though the guy who
created JavaScript's definitely not God
I got it that guy is just some regular
dude you know yeah man I sorta missing
what's my opinion or already
irelia it's legit man I like it
Oh 84 you check down the new video man
got your little music in the background
I got to put your credits on it man the
next video I got you the next video I'm
doing tonight I'm going to put credits
to your channel and you know who created
the music behind you the background
music so everybody I want you to guys
say thank you to 84 84 music he blessed
us with some good you know good vibes so
yeah man I appreciate it
any other questions guys come on we got
four more minutes and I'm about to leave
anything else you guys want to let me
know yes sir
84 84 with the beats
any experience with asp.net not really
I'm not really a dotnet person dotnet
type of person like I don't know I find
you have to be a certain type of
individual to do that net and like
dotnet it's not for everybody
c-sharp is not for everybody see the
language itself is now for everybody you
know I think I don't know I feel like
I'm in between a hipster in between a
programmer so I'm like right in between
plus I got my own little sauce you know
that I come in to this industry with but
I feel like I'm a hybrid I'm something
new you know I'm like oh no man I'm like
freaking I'm some genetic experiment
that just came into the industry just to
me it all fuck it up do what I do but
you know working in like any company
that does see net out seeing that C
sharp and dotnet man those are companies
that I don't want to be in you know the
cultures in those companies usually be
super strict
they usually be like you know people
walk around like they got a stick up
there you know what
you gotta wear you know a blue collar
and freakin dress up pants you know and
some shoes maybe a little jacket suit
and tie like I like to do that once in a
blue moon but you see me just relax all
day for gain comfortable with the
fitting on I work I take off the fitting
sometimes I'd like to be comfortable I
like to be myself I don't like to be
like hey Jenny because I'm working for
you you own me I don't like to work in
any company like that so when you work
with dotnet is C sharp that's the type
of companies that you're gonna find
places where everybody's a robot places
where everybody thinks they're geniuses
and they're fucking dumb as hell like
like I've been to I went to this company
I should name but there was this company
that wanted to hire me
and one of the persons that was asking
me questions and doing the interview was
like oh man we love your we love your
your skills we love your resume we love
the companies that you've worked for is
that we want to be to be part of the
team and I kid you not every single
person in that place look like a robot
meaning they had the same type of shirt
the same type of pants the same type of
glasses the same type of everything
there was no individuality meaning there
was no personality to them there were
just robots meaning you're gonna go in
there and you're gonna be a co monkey
you know it's just hey hey Josh do you
want me to build this for you tick tick
tick tick tick and just type away your
life all right
me I'm not like that me I like going
into the places where I'm like I see
people with individuality you know
somebody got an earring somebody full of
tattoos somebody wears whatever the hell
they want you know how they are in real
life
I don't
take the idea of going into a job and
you have to leave behind who you are I
don't like the idea of that so that's
what happens with C C sharp and dotnet
and that's why I don't see myself going
there
plus I have two friends of mines one
which I'm probably gonna bring to the
the podcast pretty soon I'm gonna do I
interview him he basically he came here
from Japan and he he worked C sharp and
dotnet for ten years was very successful
he even worked as a senior developer for
a company called Accenture if you have
if you don't know who Accenture is like
they like the top guys right in the
industry like they really you know
they're really up there that company is
legit it's like they're almost don't
know if they really part of Microsoft
but they're like almost to Microsoft
level they even it's a publicly traded
company just think about that you know
what I mean so he's pretty legit you
know so that company is crazy so yeah so
my boy he worked for this company he
David flew him to Japan and he was
working in Japan for government websites
over there so he really knows his shit
but after 10 years of working a c-sharp
and dotnet he's jaded he doesn't code
number he got his money he earned the
money that he needed to earn saved he
opened up his own personal business and
I had some other time like yeah will you
go back to you know being a developer
he's like no I hated it I hated my life
being a developer c-sharp developer and
then it's such a big difference when you
see me and I'm like yeah I come home I'm
happy I I had a good day even though
some days are stressful I'm still happy
because I got to code I got paid to do
something that I was gonna do in my
house regardless you know what I mean so
for him it was different for him I was
like oh man I gotta go in there with a
fucking suit and tie all the time and
and be all fucking you came and talked
to people people rat you I love you
coming late one minute people are
freaking cutthroat like they fucking you
come up with an idea somebody else
steals it and shows it to the project
manager so they could get you know kudos
and and brownie points so yeah man you
know what I mean so it's like it's some
bullshit but that's why the mess was C
sharp and I met I don't like the culture
around it it's the same reason why
people don't like vs code because
there's a culture around it this
Microsoft the whole culture of Microsoft
the whole culture of typescript lake all
those companies that use those
technologies they all the same way
they're pretty much all day one is a
robot you're just a number you know so
well yeah man
hey guys I'm about to go out I'm out of
here man I gotta eat I'll see you guys
later see you in a little while man all
right man I'll see you guys
all right guys
