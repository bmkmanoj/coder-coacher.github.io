at it again man
Conan face.com alright
flipping it let me see if I can flip
so it doesn't let you rotate I guess you
got a roll do it like this right alright
anyways man so we got to basically do
like this we're gonna talk about how
some college students or you know
college graduates people who went to
school for this stuff programming
computer science most computer science
majors you know
a reality man they're gonna hate you
and then I'm not literally gonna hate
you but they're gonna hate the fact that
you who actually get a job without
having to go and get yourself in debt
right or go in and spend so much money
you know just going to go to college
right people hate that you know because
it's like also to people that went to
boot camps a lot of people that want to
put caps they don't want to admit that
pretty much what they pay for after they
graduated from the boot camp they
realize like hey I could have learned
this in my house so pretty much you know
they hate that man they hate when I
see somebody who's self-taught and you
know it's out here game money in the
like man I could have just done this
myself in my house you know they
hate that like it or not I mean I
will hate it too hold on give me a
second heart Karina I need my other hand
yeah man I will take that straight
up like imagine this man imagine you go
to a bootcamp right you go to a bootcamp
you basically spend like whatever amount
of money right twelve thousand twenty
thousand and pretty much you end up in
that and now you're like man I graduated
from this thing I did three months all
that I learned was you know basic HTML
CSS and JavaScript and then from there a
little bit of Express let's say four
nodejs let's say you you went to boot
camp where they're teaching you about
Express right and nodejs whatever is the
the the mean stack all right so you come
out and you're like man I spent twelve
thousand dollars and now I'm seeing
people who didn't go to school pretty
much learn the same in their house
and we're working at the same place why
do I say that because for a situation
that another friend of mine another
youtuber I don't need to throw out his
name out here you know who he is but he
was telling me a situation at his job
where is pretty much somebody's just
hating on him because he got there he's
hired to be a developer for the same
position this other guy's in but he
didn't go to school for this he taught
himself and the other person is just
hating on him like like that used
to happen to me all the time like I'm
gonna tell you guys that is gonna
happen it's definitely going to happen
because especially like let's say even
in situations where is like you know
another kid where I was in another
company and he was like a computer
science major
whatever he was actually a intern he
wasn't even hired and I was
hired and he will always try to he was
trying to always do stuff like you know
one-up me like you know to basically be
on top of
of my shade just to be like oh I'm
better than you are
like I said wait we're basically
competing and in reality you're like bro
I'm not even competing with you
I'm higher your enter
like the do I look like competing
with you I'm already working here like
you know what I mean okay people are
kind of retarded so they want to
make themselves feel better because they
spent four years wasting time and they
went for four years for a school you
know coming out of there - like when I
started working as a developer I was
plus man all I spent was my time that's
all I spent man like that's just to be
honest like you know like all I freakin
put into this was just my time and I
bought a $700 used MacBook Pro back in
2012
that's all I did and it was in
2012 MacBook it was a 2008 it
was already four years old like you know
what I mean I'm not telling people hey
drop out of college and do listen now
I'm not telling you that I mean if
you're waiting in school
just finishing me bachelors is always
going to be good no matter what because
you never know how to work my turnaround
you might become a developer and like
four years later you're like hey I don't
want to become I don't want to be
working for companies and whatever I
want to become a teacher or I want to
become a office manager a project
manager whatever with that degree is
going to help you get there and gonna
help you you know switch careers when
you do something like this I self-taught
you're basically saying hey I'ma be your
 developer like if I don't have a
degree in anything else it means I gotta
go super hard into this community this
is not something that you're going to be
like eh I'm just going to become a
developer and and I saying like I'm
going to be able to switch up later on
ten
years from now like it's not gonna be
that easy because you don't have a
degree so I'm not telling people hey
dropout but at the same time man don't
hate on other people because they're
self-taught if you wanted to become a
developer you know them well you could
teach this yourself you don't need
somebody to come in and tell you hey
here's a certificate from
 Mellon and here you go like you
don't need that you know what I mean you
don't need a bootcamp to tell you you're
a developer you don't need a college to
give you a degree to say hey your
developer is it's more about can you
learn this yourself can you apply
yourself to take the time to learn this
 and build real projects can you do
that if you could do that then you're
golden you're good you know what I mean
like that's all you really need and
determination and not giving up because
when you're gonna um when you're gonna
be learning all this is gonna
there's gonna be that's gonna be on
your way like you know it could be
JavaScript projects it could be promises
it could be Ajax it could be learning
something like SAS um it could be
anything that could for you and your
brain and you're like oh man this
is so hard I can't learn this
 I need to go to a boot camp man
it's not the book ever is not going to
tell you nothing that's different from
doing a udemy course it's not going to
tell you nothing else besides like
learning on YouTube or whatever whatever
the hell you learning right now you know
what I mean like they're not going to
teach you anything different than what's
already out on the Internet
because most of these people what
they're going to do is they got to base
their courses or whatever the industry
tells them whatever the community tells
them so if the community says hey we're
all going to use whatever the
Harry Potter framework that's what
they're going to teach you in that
school and that's the same thing that
you gotta see on blogs that's the same
thing you're gonna see here or videos on
YouTube that's the same thing that
you're gonna see everywhere in the
 world
online that's all the same that
you're gonna get you know what I mean so
it's all up to you and why I made this
video is because pretty much I don't
want people hating on other other
developers man like if you went to
school bro and you date your
four years that's great man you know we
could applaud for you give you a
 applause and like that's all we
could do for you now don't come here and
hate on other people and be like oh
you're self-taught and you're I'm gonna
look down on you and this and that and
it's like you know somebody was leaving
a stupid comment some guy called I think
on door 5 or some like that
late imma give him time
today right this kid hating on
another another person who was here
another guy who who is a viewer of minds
and it's like oh talking all this
 like oh you're self-taught oh I
got a business I got this this and that
you're a slave for another
company doesn't that and I'm like bro I
look them up the guys you don't have no
 business it's like some teenager
talking and you could tell he's
just like a regular college student we
just pissed off that there's
people that surfed or you know
self-taught and they're getting money
like you like it I'm not I'm getting
money out here I'm working full-time I
got a good salary I love my job and at
the same time I make money because of
web development I make money on YouTube
I make money on my own websites I make
money through music so I have a pretty
good income man like mushes diverse if
tomorrow I'm dropped or I got fired from
my job for whatever reason like I could
literally go find another job
the next thing or if I wanted to I could
just stay another two years without
working just stay in my house chilling
because I have a good savings account
because I'm smart
I worked on this
and I always have money on me you know
what I mean yeah man yeah Krishan well
so I was talking about your your
coworker but I didn't want to
you know blow blow your spot out just in
case you know for work reasons you know
what I mean but yeah now people are
 dickheads man like straight up
I'm just saying you know like I don't
want to blow up your spot but yeah not
because that has happened to me
trust me that has happened to me
all the time where I've bumped into
people where they like they feel like
they're above me because they have a
computer science degree and they know a
whole bunch of terminology but then when
it comes to the code and when it comes
to the work when you put them against me
I blow them out the box
why because I bust my ass I called full
time and when I get home I code again
and then after that I start watching
tutorials so I pretty much do code
probably no no maybe 16 hours a day so
if they think they can compete with me
I'll blow them out the box man
you know what I mean so that's why I
made this video for you guys man you
guys are self-taught you're gonna bump
it to people yeah gotta bump into people
like this alright and all I'm saying man
just keep pushing forward don't worry
about it don't pay no mind this
people are insecure trust me guys you
will be insecure too to think that
you're gonna go to school for years
waste your time over there and
then come out and you're going to become
a intern while some guy
who taught himself in three months it's
 higher while you're there
working for free trying to show that you
have any type of skills you will be
frustrated and insecure - you know what
I mean
yeah not that dude a Condor 5 whatever
he's a snake man don't pay no
mind to the door man it's a
little kid he's a little kid that that
pretty much he thinks that talking
on the internet and being pissed off at
other people that are self-taught
because he's going to school
because he went to school and he
had to go do four years
he thinks that he's better than
everybody else like come on man like go
to school and going to school is
just pretty much going to a place and
sitting down that's all it really means
you know what I mean you know as long as
you have two scales man as long as you
have the skills that's all you really
need it doesn't matter I don't give a
 if you come from
 Mountain I don't care if you
come from whatever app Academy
you know what I mean like you could come
from wherever you want to come from but
you know put some respect on on the fact
that people are out here learning by
themselves and most likely no more than
a lot of college graduates and no more
than a lot of boot camp graduates like
this people that surprises me
like that the kid who won the decoding
challenge that I did that kid is not a
 college graduate and his
skills is really up there you know what
I mean like his skills is really updated
he's really good
and what I could put him against any
college student right now and he still
blow him out the box you know so that's
what I'm saying like it's more about the
skills man
yeah man is crazy but I'm on my
 lunch break eyes yeah yeah
forgetting keeping me away from my food
man now I just wanted to show show you
guys some love real quick I'm gonna try
to do like a little 15-minute live
videos every day on my lunch break just
for the hell of it alright anyways guys
yo look out for the podcast guys next
week on Tuesday 8 p.m. New York time man
New York time and you know whenever when
I'm on my lunch break I do my video my
live video yeah watch my live video when
Chris Shawn does his live video on his
lunch break well has gone on break check
him out to it man you know it's like you
gotta have you're gonna be entertained
at least 15 minutes every hour saying
you know anyways guys so yeah check out
the podcast man stop playin
the podcast is legit and the best part
about the podcast is that is basically
you guys are the superstars like I'm
nobody I know that I'm not a I'm
not Mark Zuckerberg I'm not Gary
Vee I'm not nothing I'm nothing without
you guys period
so the podcast is to basically give
shine to the new developers and people
learning that's what I wanted to make
the podcast because okay like let's say
you guys right now all of you guys are
brand new developers right but you go to
a podcast like javascript jabber or you
go to a podcast like Ruby robes or or
any of the other podcasts all of those
guys they've been in the industry for
over 10 years right and that's great and
you can learn a lot from them but I
think there's something that's missing
in the industry which is a podcast for
the people
for the people that are just starting
because you need somebody that you could
relate to I can't relate to the guys
from JavaScript Java or or even the
other one was the one that they drink
I think it's JavaScript JavaScript
drinks or something like that
those guys they all work at Netflix that
will work that LinkedIn they've been
around for like 10 years but if I'm a
brand new developer and I'm like hey man
I can't relate to this guys I
want to listen to guys that are going
through the same</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
