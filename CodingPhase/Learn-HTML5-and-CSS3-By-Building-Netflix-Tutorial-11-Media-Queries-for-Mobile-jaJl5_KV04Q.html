right so this is the issue we was having
the problem is between the whiff and the
fact about you know the problem with the
fonts okay so what we're gonna do to
patch it up from now because technically
we could make a better grade
but to make it look better like you know
like Netflix let's make this wave 300
300 pixels so now you go like this see
now it starts to look more more better
like you know like a Netflix right okay
fixing that now let's do another thing
let's make this a little bit more
responsive so you see how for a big
screen is gonna cover everything well
let's try to do this for smaller size
I'm gonna say a phone that would be like
a phone right there you know let's try
to change it up and say hey CSS media
queries okay this is slow today but let
this load okay
say means caffeine is oops let's go to
the bottom let's go to just styles and
let's say that's still max laughs say
something so what this is saying one of
when the device size is maximum width of
600 which is usually like a fallen or a
little tablet we're gonna basically give
it a different style so we're gonna say
hey video boxes all video boxes with
will be 95 percent and then margin 2.5
percent on each side let's see how that
looks
you see all right now that's the miss
video boxes h4 let's make them for
family of America
wait Andrey font size 30 pixels let's
see how that looks cool let's make this
even better make this 60 now all we hear
this let's put a paragraph right quick
paragraph so let's say a let's go back
to a little Laura their son Jesus Christ
was going to the today
what the hell it's never been to saw
like this is bad
so whatever for the moment is just copy
this ain't just any copy this is just
like an example you know technically you
will have like the description of the
movie
say 300 pixels
I see why the text is going over it
because we gave this a set height so we
said basically okay always be 150 well
let's change that let's change that here
let's say minimum height see so now it
gives a space also let's change this up
to here so let's say video boxes for
desktop anything that's you know that's
bigger than and that's nice let's delete
it
let's hide it just play none so pretty
much it's gonna look like that let's fix
the font size in pixels
oh my fact let's do it
wait let's make this a little bit bigger
see so for that stuff it's gonna look
like that and then so you get some more
to it is see but because we put
display:none on a large screen is gonna
go for every single one now let's put it
here for mobile there's a comment when
you're going to ask come
no comes back so from desktop it's not
going to show from mobile it's gonna
give a little description that's cool
right does have a nice looking at right
now

just a preview man just for you guys to
play around I'm gonna do a a full course

feet wet just so you can see what's the
power of HTML CSS what you could
actually do you know how does people
create this websites of course this more
fine-tuning it you know it takes hours
and hours to do this you know to have it
perfect sometimes you know you just need

can go to websites like you know dribble
calm and get you know get a design from
somebody just you know pretty much take
