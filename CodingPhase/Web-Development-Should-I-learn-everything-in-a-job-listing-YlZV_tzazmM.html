that you're about to see now just make
sure that you subscribe and click on the
little bell because that's the only way
to get notifications like let's say we
let's say we applied to a senior arm and
our job right and we might actually um
embarrass ourselves because maybe might
not be material that like you know
they're gonna like they're gonna like
have what's doing those constant how you
feel about their well first of all mean
any any job that you go to man any job
that you go to they're gonna have their
own ways of doing things so no matter
what they're gonna have to teach you no
matter what what I'm doing from scratch
right cuz even if somebody tells you oh
we do JavaScript we do know GS once you
look at their folder structures or their
projects you start looking at it it's
like everything is completely different
than the last company you went to
because everybody does it completely
different unless you work with a system
like a framework like laravel Ruby on
Rails where you know everything is
exactly where it's supposed to be yeah
when you go to every company they do it
differently no matter what so if they
actually something that you don't know
just be honest and be like hey I haven't
had the opportunity to actually work on
this but I've done a couple of other
projects and this this and that that is
related to that or you just say like I
just don't know it you know I don't know
it well I'm willing to learn I could
pretty much learn anything that you
throw at me that's it you throw them
that that's saying you just gotta say
confident you can't be in this way
imposing maybe maybe I could learn if
you give me some time no you go it's me
give me a week you know what I mean you
learned then just like give me a week
I'll do that you know what I mean one
thing I also want to add is bro the
point is even if it is senior level see
the only thing I was tripping off of
it's because the jobs I'm applying for
it's talking like a hundred in T in
and up because San Francisco pays that
hard I already had like a means of
living if I did go out there which is
only a hour away from me but the thing
is is that they always be like oh we
paying 110 you either gotta have a
bachelor's or you had is a whoopty whoop
you booked years of experience if you
want to get the job but I just had to
ask Joe just to kind of confirm like a
so I just say it and still give it
a shot ya know you still gotta go listen
you're gonna be surprised especially in
San Francisco there's a lot of startups
right a lot of startups so there's
always gonna be a CTO this guy always
gonna be a guy who's even more senior
developer than you you know some guy who
who they really really trust right that
guy just needs four or five extra
developers to work on a website that
he's architecting you're just there to
be an extra hand for him you know what I
mean like he can't do everything
you're just the extra hand I can say hey
man I want you today to work on on this
a REST API that we're gonna connect for
this iPhone application that's your job
right you could go in there if you
already know nodejs you already worked
on REST API you can do that job right it
is not that difficult all you have to do
is just just freakin get it done
you got one say like sometimes we get
scared I was so scared look I was
opposed to be working like you know two
to three months like I hear the stories
of fresh Shawn I hear the stories of the
dreaded death I get so tight at the fact
that I was ready by that time you know
what I mean like I was ready when I was
I got two months in like I spent like
not just like working on something like
part-time I had quit my job and I went
in hard like 16 hours a day almost you
know for like two months I was ready but
I didn't go to a job interview for a
whole year because number one everywhere
that I went to they threw like 30,000
different frameworks on it and I say I
gotta learn every single one of them and
I gotta get nice on every single one of
them before I went to a job interview by
the time I went to a job interview I was
like so like so
freaking good at that time I was like
you when I thought about it none of the
frameworks that I study they even use or
they were using was the regular things
angular at that time that's a jQuery so
I'm like why did I spend so much time
learning amber learning a backbone
learning knockout
I freaking like I learned everything
under the Sun you know that's why I tell
people the time is like yo go online all
you have to do is either choose angular
or react if you're gonna be a frame or a
front-end developer that's it and then
you're gonna be fine and start applying
to jobs soon as you can build any
website out of a design if you can't
build a website out of design out of a
design don't go to no interviews because
you're not ready you're not supposed to
be out there you're gonna get
embarrassed if somehow you scheme it and
you get hired and then they give you a
design you like to what take this this
image and slice it up and make it into
the background like no nobody does that
everybody builds everything from scratch
with CSS so it's like nobody does it how
people used to do it back in the days
but they will take a design and slice it
up and basically take that that image
and put it as the background no
everything needs to be done with CSS now
you know because CSS has those tools
that you can build it on your own any
any design that they throw at you you
gotta say so you have to just be able to
do that and then just know one framework
if you want to become a back-end
developer as a junior developer and
self-taught I'm not that's the bit
that's more difficult
it's a more difficult road but you can
definitely do it if you have the project
right because a front-end of like let's
say right now front-end developer you
can come in and say okay throw me an
InDesign I could build it was that you
could scheme it you could go in and get
hired
you could scheme it when you are back in
developer it's not just that you have to
go in there say I can upload everything
to the server I know how to use AWS I
know how to go in there and set up the
databases I have to connect like there's
so many different things to becoming our
back-end of
that foot or somebody who's self-taught
so go in there and try to do it on this
their first job
it's like suicide you you basically if
you make it alive you like amazing you
got are saying like if you somehow make
it to become a back-end developer on
your first job
that means you was amazing it is not
like you was like some regular dude to
be a front-end developer anybody could
do it you could go in there be like hey
man you want me to build this for you
that's it
you gotta say it's a huge show you um
can I show you a website I made for me
oh my god from uh plants
yeah sure yeah I mean if you want would
you want to do it right now look okay
check this is the design that I did um I
was watching all they hold out of your
videos so it kind of helped me you know
so this is the design or did you build
this website correct okay so you good it
looks legit looks very clean very nice
uh to me personally I think you're ready
you know they're not responsive but on
this semi responsive yeah no it looks
good man
this of course it's definitely things
that you could tweak but listen at a job
that's why you're hired you're hired to
take your time and build it the right
way and add it the extra features but so
me everything looks clean looks nice
typography is good so it's like it looks
pretty legit you know what I'm saying so
as far as far as that is like it's nice
man so it's like you definitely could
get hired now it's just about you
starting to apply to places man you know
don't waste time don't do what I do man
everything that I tell you guys man I
wish I could just you know if it was up
to me I start snapping people up just
wake up like that you know what I mean
like don't do the same mistakes that I
did you know I came in here and wasted
time looking through blogs you
- freaking every website that's under
the Sun cuz I say I want to be the best
you know that's that's like the worst
thing that you could put on top of your
shoulder
that's your first job like ourselves to
developer and say I want to be the best
the moment you put in that pressure on
yourself you're never gonna feel like
you're ready because this guy's out
there that's a million times better than
you this guy's out there that's been
doing this since 14 years old you know
sometimes you want to see somebody that
goes to even a job or a boot camp or a a
college student or even a self-taught
person that you you say hey I'm 24 years
old he's 24 years old he did a lesson
example teen tree house I did same tree
house he did coke a Damini I did coke
Adam II and then you say hey how come
I'm now in the same level as him and
then what you don't know is that this
person was big voting since the time
he's 14 years old you don't know
nobody's history you don't know nobody's
background some people they come in and
say oh I just started yesterday I'm a
web developer but what they don't tell
you is I hate you've been building Java
applications since you was with a thumb
in your mouth you get what I'm saying so
it's like you who is a brand-new
developer trying to get into this
freaking Jota mechanic and say hey man I
was going to go beyond goober or become
a web developer and you decide to become
a web developer right now you're coming
into this field and you're trying to
compare yourself to dudes who've been
doing this since I don't know wing you
get what I'm saying
late don't put that pressure on you of
like I want to be the best but your
pressure that you should have is to say
I want to be able to build a website
builder anything out of a design be able
to be comfortable with JavaScript no one
back in language and no one framework
