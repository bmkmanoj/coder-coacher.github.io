again man coding face.com you boys back
and I done did it again guys
listen here's a tip tip for you guys
looking for jobs out there and you know
just to give you guys a little heads up
be careful with companies man you know
you gotta have a list for yourself as
red flags of things that you could say
hey there's a good company there's good
fit for me you know what I mean like hi
so breaking it down so today I was like
you know what I have I have a you know a
friend of mine so told me hey this
company is has an open position and
maybe you should check it out you know
you might get some money some good money
out of it and they seemed like to be
working on on cool stuff and that's like
cool they have a large team so I said
okay cool I'll check it out I'll give it
a chance you know so I go to the
interview today and then I'm like ok
number one I don't even know if I want
to work right now I'm just going for the
interview just to go but if they have
something that you know that Wow's me
but I okay cool Joe you're making about
8090 grand and young like on your own
house but if you're gonna you know leave
that to work for a company it's gonna be
for something similar and a cool project
cool or people around something that you
could be excited about so I go to this
interview and just to see what the hell
is happening you know cuz in reality I
don't want to work right now I don't
want to work for no company right now
unless is something cool like it Spotify
hit me up right now I'll go work for
Spotify if you know let's say epic hits
me up and tells me hey we want you to
work here I'll go work for it if EA hit
me up like hey we want you to work here
go work for them you know like cool
companies now so I'll go to this
interview and one of the guys that I
talked to on the phone is super cool
super nice we talked we went over the
projects and all the stuff that I've
done and this this and that and whatever
so then today was the in-person
interview go to the in-person interview
and two of the guys are cool
the guy that I've talked to before cool
he already knows everything about me
knows everything that I do knows I could
literally do anything that you hit me
with like right but one of the guys who
just happens to be the CEO is just like
a whole like you know what I mean like
just like a bro I'm not working for you
like like I don't care how much money
there is out there for me I am not
working for somebody like this so first
of all red flags you know starts asking
me about hey I see on your resume you've
done freelancing and I'm like yeah it's
like you know once in a while I might
have like a client or something somebody
hit me up or you know or a friend of
Mines might need something I help them
up you know I've been doing this for a
long time so he's a killer I don't know
because you know we usually like
somebody that's completely focused on us
I'm like yeah that's fine
I'm like I definitely understand you
know you know you definitely want
somebody that is gonna be focused on
here and I was like yeah let's say I've
been doing this for a long time it's
never being a problem anywhere that I've
been to but then he goes into it's like
oh yeah but you know it's like sometimes
this you know there's a lot of times
especially now in the holidays it's like
you know this deadline thing you know
there's weekends and this this and that
I'm like wait what wait wait what what
what wait what what cut cut
cut cut right there bro I am now working
for you on the weekends as sick after
six o'clock I don't work for you like
this is one of the things where
sometimes I just be like I don't want to
work for these people like what do you
mean you want people to work on the
weekends like I understand this a
deadline like an emergency or something
like that you want to help out and you
need something to get done but the vibe
that you giving me it's like hey we want
you to work you work for us 24/7 I mean
like am I gonna get paid for 24/7 you
know what I mean like I'm not working
like that you know there's a half a lot
of good stuff here you know what I mean
like if you come in and you tell me Joe
I'm gonna pay you $250,000 $100,000 for
your services here and $150,000 for you
know your off time then yes I'll do it
but you're telling me like hey we gotta
pay you the same amount that you're
gonna get a salary which means like all
the overtime and all the extra things
that you do doesn't count and you're not
gonna pay for that like your own salary
right so when your salary that means
you're only getting pay for whatever
you're getting you know it's like okay
you getting pay for 40 hours a week
right but you actually work 70 hours a
week
hey sorry your own salary nah I'm good
keep that go ahead and keep that you
know it's like there's the problems man
there's the problem where people you
know a lot of people think like people's
time is not valuable like my time is
valuable my time like I'll be honest
like I'll be pissed off somebody tells
me hey man you know you doing what
you're doing YouTube man I don't think
your focus on us what are you talking
about like I'm not gonna give you my
free time you get what I'm saying like
this people
they got me effed up like I'm not gonna
give you my free time my time that I
have with my family my son I am not
giving it to nobody you have to pay me a
lot of money to do that right you know
people are out here you know and this I
feel like a lot of developers they mess
up the game because you know there needs
to be like a union there needs to be
something out there for developers
because the problem is a lot of these
companies they say hey we paying this
person you know twice as much as other
people out here you know what a regular
person all right a person might be
earning 50 you know 40 $50,000 a year
right we making double with that right
so employers think hey we're already
paying them twice as much we could
squeeze you know another 30 hours out of
them we already paid them that much you
know what I mean it's like no this we
have a skill we have a salad we have you
know stuff that you guys need you know
what I mean like developers should not
be out here begging for a job guys cuz
then they mess it up you know what I
mean like somebody comes in and be like
I just want to get a job I just want to
get a job it's like doesn't matter if
they put me to work 90 hours in a week
and I'm getting paid the same amount
like some people be forgetting that like
hey if you work twice as much per week
and you get him pay let's say 90
$100,000 that means you're making
$50,000 because you're doing double to
work I might as well just do work I
freaking at Macy's and then get a job at
Best Buy
you got what I'm saying like I'd rather
just do both jobs instead of being in
one company working two times it doesn't
make sense man so yeah so I just went to
that interview just to touch just for
the hell of it I'm not looking for a job
you know and I'm pissed off that my
friend told me about this company like
bro lake burley you know you know how I
am son you know how I am son
don't tell me about no company don't
tell me all these people are hiring it
you know they're really good I got a
great team bro if they want you to work
24/7 like I'm not doing that you know
when you work for for freaking any
company out there you worked for any
major company in their freakin rules
they don't tell you or actually like hey
what do you do on your off time like
that's night that's none of your
business what I do in my off time you
know what I mean like he's like oh we
want to know it's like you know like we
want you to work on you know all our
project and you know now especially now
with the with the season coming coming
in whatever the holiday season and we
might want you to do some weekend I'm
not doing no weekends bro
like that's straight up I'm not working
two times for the same amount of money
you gonna have to pay me a lot of money
for me to be doing a weekend I've done
it before and I hated it I am NOT doing
that you know people got me effed up out
here like yo I'm about to touch you look
I'm about to touch on my own from my own
website from my own online things I'm
about to touch like a tea cake by myself
right from my own hard work
why am I gonna give that up to earn 90k
and do twice as much work and be uncle
whenever the hell you want me to it
doesn't make sense you get what I'm
saying so whatever I'm doing I'm like I
just gave him I was like and shocked I
just looked at him like I'm in shock
that you even said something like that
like sir like I am NOT grateful to get
your job like I'm just coming in I'm
like whatever
you know I'm like coming in to see how
it is see the vibe I already got a bad
vibe automatically off the bat it's not
the place that I want to be in you know
any place that
that people want you to work weekends
people are worrying about hey what
projects are you working on on your own
time that's none of your business
that's the truth that's none of your
business if right now I'm working on a
software-as-a-service
that's my own thing if I'm working on a
start-up on the side that's my own thing
if I'm working on um being an instructor
online that's my own thing if I'm
working on YouTube that's my own thing
once it's six o'clock that's it and
clocked out I don't work for you I work
from you for you for nine to five I'm
not giving you any more time than that
you know this times that where there's
deadlines and you have to stay in late
I'm fine with that but if you're telling
me hey man we want to know what you're
working on we want to know you know what
you're doing in you know it's like we
rather have you spend time on working on
learning of the things that we are
working on like if they wanna freakin if
they want to work on let's say uh
whatever framework out there like okay
fine I could learn that I could I love
learning frameworks and new technologies
but I'm not looking for somebody that's
worried about hey focus on our stuff
24/7 and now I'm an I'm an employee I
just worked there that's not my company
I'm no longer putting things on my
shoulder I am NOT doing that because I
know a lot of people don't go through
that and it's like why am I gonna put
myself in a situation where I'm not
gonna be happy yet you know what I mean
and I'm really I'm really pissed off at
my friend man for telling me about this
company like bro you know me you know
how I am you know that I don't care how
much money somebody pays me I am NOT
gonna give you my weekends for you to
pay me you gotta pay me twice as much
than what I'm already getting on the
salary for me to be given any weekend I
don't care if it's for three months of
the year I don't care I'm not working
for you for four
any weekends man so I really appreciate
the opportunity for hand me up and it's
not but bro
don't hit me up with any any type of job
that you think that people's gonna want
to work on a weekend That's not me I got
other cool stuff in my life you know I
appreciate my time a lot and I tell you
guys all this time like yeah when you go
to interviews it's not don't think in
your head
don't be nervous like oh I'm nervous
because I'm going to a job interview no
bro
you interviewing them cuz you the one
that I want to see do I want to work
here you should never be desperate man
that's why I tell people you should
always have savings you should always
have other businesses you should always
make money on the side no matter what
because when you in need of a job and
you're like man tomorrow I don't know if
I'm a live under a bridge tomorrow I
don't know if I'm gonna live under you
know on my car then you have to be
begging for that job so the people at
the job they'll take advantage of you
right but when you go in and you're like
bro I got money I ain't worried about
this job you start analyzing thing and
it's no longer than interviewing you is
you interviewing done you're like wait
what you know cuz there's certain things
that it's just iffy it's just weird I'm
being honest it's just weird like you
can't you can't work for companies that
want to control you only on your daily
basis I was like I've heard of people
having to sign contracts right that they
don't they can't work on any projects on
their own right they can't create a
company besides the company that they
work you know like I am NOT signing up
for that I'm not going to any company
like that you know so there's what I
tell you guys be careful what you do out
there look into the companies and just
you know just just focus man like I
understand a lot of you guys are
brand-new developers and I think this
doesn't apply to junior developers
because when you're a junior developer
it you know
sometimes gonna get really effed up
companies like this but you have to
understand like you know it's like the
first job that you're gonna get it's
never gonna be good
so even you know right now somebody one
of you guys saw me Joe man 90,000 right
now they'll be great right now and it's
great I'll be like yeah that's great for
you your junior developer that you could
go in there you know and make your money
stay there for a year to whatever and
then from there you know move on to
something better but for someone like me
it doesn't make sense like I already pay
my dues you know what I mean like I pay
my dues I'm not I don't need to work for
anybody that wants to control my my
personal time you know what I mean like
that really hit it nerve like bro you
got me effed up like I don't work for
companies that want to be all up in your
business like that that's not none of
your business if I work on on my own
projects that's my own projects what
developer out there doesn't work on his
own project you know what I mean like
who signs up for this type of companies
like guys like this is what I'm saying
like developers must set up for other
developers like who approves this who
are the people that say yeah you know
what you know what I I don't have
nothing else to do I have no ideas in my
own like you know I can't create my own
projects you know and what's funny it's
like what the guy was he's like he's
like yeah he said you know we just this
is the type of culture that we have here
you know we hope that whatever we pay
you is enough to you know keep you happy
and just focus on us and I'm like wait
are you paying people $190,000 or
$200,000 like because that's the only
way that I could see somebody will say
hey man I'm only working on company
projects you have to be a loser I'm
being honest you have to be a loser to
actually sign up for something like that
cuz you're a developer you want to
create stuff on your own you want to
test things out you want to
have ideas your creative person why will
you sign up to something that pretty
much controls ideas and controls you
come on guys but yeah man
anyways guys this is what I'm saying man
I might not be going to work for a long
time I don't want to work for companies
like this you know unless it's major
companies like Spotify EA Epic Games you
know even time one a hurt Time Warner
has a really good environment for
developers you know Facebook I don't
know like a major company I'm not
working for no more smaller companies
I'm not working for businesses that are
startups I'm not working for people that
don't know what the hell they doing I'm
not working for people that don't
understand the process of a developer
I'm not working for people that don't
appreciate somebody's creativity like
that's not me
you got what I'm saying but to my boy
you got me effed up son don't send me
that don't send me companies like that
son don't even mention them don't even
tell them that I'm out here I'm a great
developer don't tell them nothing don't
mention my name - nobody sign like
straight up don't mention my name - no
none of these companies cuz they they
just they're pretty much ish you know I
can't curse on you - no more but there
is right now like don't mention my name
don't mention that there's this great
company out here you should maybe take a
look at I don't care if the things down
the block I don't care if my commute is
two minutes
don't tell me about none of these
companies man you know I got another
interview in a few weeks you know South
Carolina where I might be getting floor
flown out them I'm actually getting
flown out there they just sent me the
email is a really big company in South
Carolina and
I'm gonna go check it out am I looking
for a job nah I'm gonna go check it out
