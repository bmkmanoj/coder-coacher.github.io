again man coding fees.com your boy is
backing out and did it again one more
time guys today we have something
special for you guys you guys have seen
me review portfolios today we're
actually going to review somebody's
application alright guys so stay tuned
watch this now we're gonna do a review
for find that cosplay calm this is
pretty cool I like it I actually like
the idea because you could come here and
you know click on random I'll search for
one and go find you like some images you
know people dressed up and cosplay like
this is funny
know what this guy's not gonna say her
sigh well yeah you could come here click
on random search for other ones I see
what it shows up ok a couple of girls I
don't know why girls be loving this so
much man like so many girls are into
cosplay what's cool about this is that
he also said that he built this there's
our website because his girlfriend is
actually into this so because she's into
this he said you know what maybe there's
a lot of people are also into this and
they want to find that cost me you know
what I mean so let me see if they got
some dragon ball let me see if we find
Sonya okay there you go
some Dragon Ball Z cosplay let me see
surely looking I mean like it kind of
looks exactly like Andrew 18 dope
alright so this is pretty cool as a good
website is a neat audience that he has
here you know and it serves a purpose
now I'm going to be honest the thing
that I will say about this it's just the
user experience like I will definitely
fix a lot of things here like you can
actually make this images popping up
here in a nicer design maybe some
animation showing up when they load up
you know each one of them anime
you can also you know the fact that you
have to tags here like this and the
search button here and the random button
here like I don't know like the user
experience is not that easy like
especially for me when I first came in I
was like how do you know what to do I
was like okay what is this there's tags
here and it's like I'm thinking of
search searching something and I was
going looking for a button up here like
okay where's the search part okay and
then I had to come back down on my way
to search brightness here at the left if
the search party was gonna be anywhere
it should be at the right because when
somebody types something here they're
looking for the button to continue
on the right side they're not looking
for it on the left side because the left
side is like a previous button or a
cancel button like people are always
looking for the right side no matter
what right another thing that I will say
is if you're gonna put in the option to
search for different conventions
I think this shouldn't be here
what should be here it should be just
the search like a search field of the
tags and make it more obvious like just
having it underline under you know a
little underlying border it just doesn't
it doesn't tell me like hey this is
actually a field plus the fact that you
see how let me see like I don't know
like it's just the user experience of it
it's off you gotta work on that very
like this things need to be set up in
another way like this thing should be
like you know a little link under it
with a filter and you will click on
filter and then it will show conventions
it will show the year because this
shouldn't be here on top right let me
see what other pages we have here this
is cool gives them a little about about
it I mean the design the color is Q
isn't it's nice as
it's alright it's just you got a putting
a little bit more love into it when it
comes to you know the user experience
for sure just because I can definitely
know like I know for sure like if you
come in and you create a nice design
nice user experience people are gonna
come in and flock this website because
there's a great freaking calm I don't
even know how how you even got that calm
you know what I mean like find that
cosplay calm or cosplay I don't know how
you say cosplay or cosplay I guess he's
using angular 1.6 which is cool which
also tells you guys you know sometimes
people be like man we've gotta use
angular 2 angular 5 regular for guys
angular 1.5 1.5 1.6 5 like it's still
doing the same job that you are going to
do with you know angular 5 react or etc
right it's still doing the same job you
know what I mean so it's not about the
stack it's more about what you're trying
to create all right so that's definitely
a plus there the dot-com is a good name
the title of it is a good name
everything here's is good on the fact
that it just needs a little work on the
user experience besides that
everything's legit I enjoyed it now
what's cool about this is he went out of
his way and shared it in the right
format right the right platform because
if you're gonna create something like
this you want to show it to the people
that care about this so he came in
shared a on already he's a hey my
girlfriend had trouble finding pictures
of her cosplay on Instagram so I created
a cosplay search engine that lets you
filter by convention year and as many
Instagram hashtags as you like all right
and then from there 912 people get
basically given up votes and currently
right now he has a hundred and one
comments which means it's pretty popular
I'm pretty sure he got a lot of people
coming in here and what's cool about
this this is the right audience so and
when I
there's people that actually do cosplay
and they actually dress up and you know
they come here to the website they're
gonna be like okay cool we're gonna go
to find that cosplay calm and you will
find your image there
all right instead of you having to deal
with other issues of Instagram even
though now Instagram is I think they
adding the hashtags like you can follow
a hashtag etc but this is cool guys you
will come in here and put in multiple
hashtags
and it'll filter it out for you okay so
this is pretty legit now the only thing
that I will say to besides having you
know a little better user experience is
you have to have some type of
advertising here like you having this
website up online and there's no
advertising money you're losing money
right now because this website is hot
people are gonna come in here you know
this thing is gonna show up on Google
search results so you want to actually
have some way to monetize this either by
sharing affiliate links from Amazon
where you could sell your you know that
sell but promote other people's or
cosplay so like let's say somebody comes
in and but okay amazon.com and let's say
cosplay all right now you could
literally take this and promote this and
add it to your your search results right
so you could have it I don't know maybe
on the side you know hey check out this
cosplay or create another page where
it'll be like a blog or you could share
like let's say top costumes for cosplay
you know etc and all of them link him
back to this affiliate link from Amazon
now this is this is great for you you
know what I mean like you could
literally come in and make some money
out of this you know I could guarantee
you could make at least a thousand
dollars per month on this website alone
you know what I mean so hopefully you
you know you listen to me and you know
people enjoy this this type of new
content that I'm creating for you guys
which is you know hey let's start
talking about how can we make money as
developers with the skills that we have
already you know what I mean so not only
are we learning how to become better
developers and we're learning how to get
our first job but hey how about also
making money you know on the side like
just because you have a certain skill
doesn't mean that you have to just be a
worker you who actually come in and
create your own web app your own
platform to you know use it as a
business and if you have multiples
websites like this like let's say this
website is making a thousand dollars per
month if you have four or five websites
like this that's five thousand dollars
per month if you notice that this
website is super popular then now you
come in and you make this website even
better instead of just having just a
search engine you come in and add extra
things to it you know add a store dad
you know add a blog at all you know a a
vert where people who could vote for
which one has the best cosplay and
literally you could take the same API
that you're using and have it show up
randomly so and like let's say you could
search dragon ball right
so when Dragon Ball shows up right and
you search this you be like okay show
one image from the first one that shows
up in the API and show me the the
seventh one or the ninth one right and
let's say this one right for example so
now you have a vote with like who has
the best cosplay or do something like
Pokemon like who's that cosplay like and
have people vote or or write write down
the the right name of the character like
little things like that you start
expanding on it like this is a small
idea that can become a huge idea right
and it can become very profitable all
right so yeah guys I hope you guys
