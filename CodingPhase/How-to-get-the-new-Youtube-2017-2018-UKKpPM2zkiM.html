like it then you know they have to roll
it back to whatever was the old features
that I had right I don't know if you
guys remember um YouTube used to look
completely different back in the days
you know like back in the days you you
was even able to see like YouTube custom
channels back in the days let me see if
they still got it somewhere yeah so back
on these you can go in and see channels
like this or like that you know you
could change your background you could
change the color away it was pretty
legit man I used to like it back in the
days because of that because everybody's
channel was totally different
and everybody gets to actually show a
little bit about them you know their
personalities or see what the person
likes and what the channel is about so
that was back then please Linda changed
it you know to this this thing here this
hideous thing that's here like I hate
this look of YouTube once the change
they just looks horrible but now like I
told you guys I'm going to be teaching

there's a button here that's going to
say try it right and you click try it's

wasn't here before you actually do a
dark thing for YouTube it's okay I want

different see you got the scribe button
