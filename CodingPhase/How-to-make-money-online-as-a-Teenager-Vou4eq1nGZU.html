got another question from another
subscriber another viewer alright
basically he's a young kid I think he's
like 15 14 years old he's asking me yo
how to make money online as a teenager
Joe I wanna learn how to make money you
know cuz a lot of places they asks you
are you over 18 and this happens all the
time
but that doesn't mean that it can't stop
you right and all you have to really do
is talk to your mom talk to your dad
tell them hey Dad hey mom I need you to
sign up for me on this account sign up
for fiber comm ask your mother or your
father created a car or fiber and
there's a whole bunch of different
little jobs that you can do right you're
15 years old
you don't need to have $2,000 $3,000 a
month you can start slow or small you
know you could come in and start making
$500 mark you could start making a
thousand dollars a month from what you
told me you from I forgot something New
Republic is something like that Czech
Republic I don't know I can't remember
sorry
hey so what I would say is go to Fiverr
find little things to do create stuff
here like hey HTML emails I will convert
your sketch to responsive HTML like
there's so many little jobs that you
could do at five dollars and then from
there you've been okay I will do this
for five dollars in if you want me to
review it again it's gonna cost you ten
dollars so now you got fifteen dollars
then you start getting a whole bunch of
little things like that like look HTML
eBay you know how many people need this
stuff like a lot of people my first job
was making this right but I work for a
company alright but for you you can do
this from home sign up as your mom sign
up as your dad whoever you want to use
right a holder brother whatever sign up
is dumb
come here basically do the job you know
you make some money
and if you want to be nice to give your
mom a dad or whoever a little cut you
gonna hate I made a thousand dollars
this month she is $50 for the hell of it
because you gave me your name and I
could use it right now of course you're
building up your own your own customers
because now you have the emails now you
have their context
now when you become 18 you could come
back and be like hey remember me that I
died like hey you could send me your
information I was little that really was
making all of your websites I was 14 15
years old the time but as you can see
I've been doing really good and now you
have those clients right and the fact
that you show young people are gonna be
like oh man I'm gonna support this kid
and it happens but for now you don't
have to tell nobody that you're 14 years
old at all right now the next thing that
we'll say is you can check out
Craigslist calm you can go to Craigslist
calm come here right and then what you
will do is you will go into gigs search
here HTML so you need HTML programmer to
edit okay there's a little bit too much
for a dull website that you can't go and
do that I mean it's up to you if you
wanna do it you know I wouldn't say for
you to do that but there's other stuff
here where you could do a part-time lamp
development you know if you know or PHP
look work on laravel pretty much they
they want something simple right you
could go in look $20 per hour man you
can go and get that job but I hey man
I'll do it for you for 15 automatically
you cut everybody off so the person if
you have a nice little portfolio and you
know this stuff you can go ahead and
basically get the job and work from home
you know from your country now of course
sometimes they're gonna be like oh we
need you to be in a certain hour isn't
that it's fine
keep looking it doesn't matter if
somebody comes in bed tells you that all
that they can't do it or
you know we need you to be on New York
time whatever it is right search on your
area on Craigslist search on your
country for Craigslist search on here in
the United States everybody in the u.s.
uses Craigslist com
so check that out you know there's a
whole bunch of stuff that people look
looking for so long to catalog sell
various items of PV like there's a lot
of stuff that you could do man like
trust me now here's another one you
could go on YouTube youtube.com what I'm
doing right now all right how do I make
money how do I survive in this world you
know besides all my other websites that
I have like what is an income that I
have is YouTube like if I was living in
another country and I live by myself
just from YouTube alone I can survive
you know I make a bar like six hundred
seven hundred dollars a month from
YouTube just from the the BS Adsense
right in another country that's enough
to survive I have cousins in Dominican
Republic who make $200 a month $250 a
month $300 a month right so me myself if
I was a Dominican that lived in
Dominican Republic with $700 a month I'm
chilling I'm good I'm making more than
what other people were making working
full time 40 hours a week just from
YouTube right now here in the United
States I can't survive for 700 that's
right but it's good money cuz pretty
much in reality all it really does it
just pays for my car you know I was like
my car is paid that's it you know what I
mean like that's how I look at it but
for you you live in a Czech Republic I
forgot I can't remember to up but you
live out there is like you could
literally be doing stuff on YouTube
create videos on YouTube create your
Google Adsense alright so you go to
google.com I'm open it up in a new
window cuz I don't want people get my
information from Google Adsense
but yeah you go to google adsense right
and pretty much you come here you sign
up like I said you can sign up as your
mom you can sign up as his dad sign up
as an older brother create a website for
you to get a set that you need a website
with content on it meaning like you need
a blog so right now you're 14 years old
create a blog create a blog about
learning HTML CSS just to build content
right in less than three months they're
gonna accept you right and then give you
abilities to put in advertising on your
website so it's like you know you could
put it on let's say like for me know
this what I do my website right now this
website kobi5.com
is a paid website right there's a lot of
good resources there's a lot of free
courses but on certain pages like the
timeline you know I have advertising
here all right this advertising every
time that somebody pay a lot of clicks
on it I get paid for me usually because
this clicks are are really targeted to
people who are in the tech field if they
click on this link automatically I make
like two three dollars per click you
know what I mean like per click we're
talking about every time that somebody
clicks on it you get three dollars now
imagine if you get thousands and
thousands of people to your website
right like me myself currently I'm
making just from this page um um this is
the only piece that I have advertising
law because this pretty much is free
content right but it's the only place
that that I have on my website but from
this page alone I make about another
three hundred dollars
right because people come here they see
the timeline they see the advertising
here they see something interesting
sometimes I've seen people click on
stuff like my saved a visit a car
dealership let's say then we're looking
for a car Mercedes Benz now
mercedes-benz advertising shows up they
click on there that's $10 for me right
so now imagine this what you can do with
this right like if you really smart I
mean you smart already you already
you're interested in web development so
you gotta be a certain type of person to
be at 14 years old just like me to be
learning these things right so what I'm
telling you right now is you can make
money out here look when I was like 14
15 years old I was making money online
like I had my own website had grand
Boise website I was making money online
and I mean unluckily it got shut down
because I was putting videos you know
copywriting videos but if it was like a
legit website I wouldn't know about
tutorials if I wouldn't know about hey
what development if I don't know about
teaching online I would've just done
that when I was like 14 14 years old I
would have been teaching to kids no I
mean like teach the high schools or
whatever like I don't know if you guys
remember back in the days there was this
thing called Neopets you know like like
little virtual pets downline you know I
think the websites still alive somewhere
but people used to make money from that
I know friends of mine who used to make
money from editing people's MySpace
right so as a kid you could come here
and just really make money if you you
smart within you wanna be like yeah I
want to be on top of my game I'm not
doing look that's what I tell people
don't do anything for free in the sense
of like if you are giving something out
for free online it's for a purpose right
when you're broke and you have no money
you can't afford to just say hey I'm
just gonna get our stuff constantly for
free you can you got to first set
yourself up first before you can start
giving our stuff for free like me when I
started giving out stuff for free here
it's when I was already working I was
already you know successful developer I
wasn't like struggling alright
you know to me so it's easy to give our
stuff for free when you you're good you
know what I mean so it's like right now
you're a young kid it's like building
websites but try to get paid for me try
to find out people that need websites
online people that need a pace to get
edited somebody needs some JavaScript
editing go ahead do it for them but I
hate pay me $10 it took you an hour
you got $10 who cares in your country
that's a lot of money you know what I
mean so take advantage right now for us
and ours is like $10 it's like you know
what I mean like to me I'm not worried
about $10 you know there was a point
where I was worried about $10 when I was
younger but now I'm gonna put in my life
where I'm like whatever
also - if you like fun applications man
I've seen the dumbest funny applications
online
I've seen people copy and paste every
documentation from like let's say the
laravel website and create a
nice-looking application people download
it they put it on their phone and it has
advertising the same thing that I told
you Adsense right it has Adsense on it
and then from there when people watch it
sometimes they click on the on the air
on the advertiser by mistake you get
paid from that you're 14 years old Majan
does you you start making $1500 a month
from advertising just on a phone
application like it's gonna change your
life and people and your family's gonna
look at you a different way and the
things that you you know all the sound
are you spending on in front of a
computer it's gotta be for a reason
people's gonna be like oh you know no no
