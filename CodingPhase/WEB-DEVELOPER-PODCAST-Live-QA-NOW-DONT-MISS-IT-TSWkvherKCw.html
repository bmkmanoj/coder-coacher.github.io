some reason that I go let me know when

alarm clock yeah I could actually be
awake at that time but yeah man so yeah
Julian Johnson says can you answer that
sea shark question on the real okay
so let's see what what questions you
have it says why don't you ever talk
about c-sharp man and MVC framework like
for real that's all I do I work show
c-sharp some love
I also also love no show some love also
and you lemme see sharp
I can recommend others in my company um
I don't know man
I'll be honest I'm not a C sharp type of
guy I was found all the companies that
work on c-sharp to be too strict to
corporate and that was never really like
my style you know like I'm more of like
start out you know a startup type of guy
small business type of guy because I
just don't like certain structures right
so I never really got into c-sharp but
yeah from what I've seen I try to mess
around with a four
or what's the name of this I forgot
what's the name samory
yeah xamarin I'll try to mess around
with C sharp for xamarin I try to mess
around with C sharp for was this other
game and Jan unity right so I try to
mess around with those but I lose
interest you know that's just me I'm
more of a Ruby a more of a python I like
Python I don't like certain things about
it but like Python the syntax right it's
fun
I like JavaScript because I'm really
good on it
I've been doing it for a long time what
else
PHP I don't like PHP I'll be honest I
don't like PHP the language I like
laravel the framework which is different
the language itself is to me is boring
it doesn't the syntax I don't like game
it gets me bored but unfortunately and
maybe in a good sense like right all of
my jobs that I've had most of the time
they want me to do some PHP you know
because I could do PHP and I'm good but
it's not my favorite the things that I
like to do is Ruby Python and crystal
Lang like I like that type of syntax
right so that's what I like c-sharp C++
C Objective C I've never been able to
get into those languages at all I find
them to be very annoying you have to
basically type hint everything I just
I'm not into that I like the fact that
you know you could use it for
object-oriented programming but I'm not
really a big fan of it so I wouldn't be
able to tell you you know but yeah
got your fiance on on your video Joseph
all right I see you let me see who else
is in here man
what was this like Joe's tenth video
today yeah we dropping a video we're
dropping a lot of content but that's the
thing I'm dropping a lot of content as
much as I can I mean if you guys rather
me drop one video a day I could also do
that you know but sometimes it's like I
want to have that connection with my
viewers and and the people that come to
my channel or the people who even
subscribe because not everybody that
comes to my channel subscribe all right
so we know that we we gave thousands and
thousands of views right and now
everybody subscribes because a lot of
people can't take the sauce you know
what I mean like they can't take the
aroma they can't take that little sauce
man it's a little 10 G you know what I
mean so they can't take it
which is fine right but what's cool
about this is that it leaves a very
lawyer in a very cool audience right
it's not just oh I subscribed because
I'm gonna subscribe it's people who
subscribe here who come here to every
video there's people who come here I
could do a video live video at 450 in
the morning right there's gonna be at
least 20 to 30 people there that's gonna
show up they got the notifications
they're like automatically I drop a
video they want to see it so that's why
I love this channel right now people
yeah let me know if y'all want me to
just drop one video a day you know I
could do a video a day take my time you
know not do no live videos no videos
from the car I could just do videos you
know in the studio let me know how you
want it but for me I just love the idea
to just be able to pick up my phone and
reach out to everybody but like hey guys
what's up how you guys doing this
I would call my friends on the phone but
like you know without without word
outside what you doing today tonight
Friday ha ha ha you know what I mean
like say that's the same thing that I do
here on YouTube you know cuz this is
like a channel about coding but the same
time it's not a technical channel it's
more about a developer who is me and
then somebody who came from nothing
that's also me alright and then you see
the progress and you know I just want to
like document the whole process alright
like go from I wish I could if I would
have thought about this a few years ago
when I first started in 2012 man I wish
I would have documented the whole
journey because right now you're getting
the view of the five years or any five
years I put into this you know yes I
know a lot of I got
knowledge from you know practicing
learning how to code doing a whole bunch
of working a bunch of companies
yeah what the process of the beginning
of like you know first month frame my
first month going in and and looking at
 team tree house and I'm trying
to learn everything I'm following what
they doing but I'm like nothing is
retaining and I'm like man I can't
 do this and I was about to quit
I was like I hate CSS like I was
just like you guys I was like I
hate CSS I don't like doing this
why the do we have to do this
because I wanted to start getting into
program and I was like man but I gotta
learn HTML CSS to build a page so I'm
like man I'm gonna go and learn CSS team
tree house didn't teach me and
they're from the other side you know
what let's look what's out there
I tried coke Adam II coke Adam it was
almost the same in tree house where
it's like in the same sense free coke
camp where it's like okay they give you
an example right here type it down
create it alright they show you a little
JavaScript algorithm okay type it down
you create it but nobody's telling you
when is it that you gotta use those
things and for what you're going to use
it right so then I was like man I just
need to see somebody build a website and
then after that I was just
going through a whole YouTube YouTube
YouTube YouTube I found I think learn
codecademy the new Boston who else was
out there at that time there was a
couple of people not that many but
simple programmer but then simple
programmer I don't even remember him
making coding videos it was more like
life type shame and I'm like I don't
need an advice any that's gonna put
money in my pocket I'm broke you
know what I mean so that's how I felt at
the time sure that's a simple program
right so at that time I was like man I
need to just find some way to just
 do this then from there a
friend of mine he was a designer and he
was like learning how to make pie
coalesced like how to create web design
and then he told me oh yeah this is
pretty close oh you to me and then from
there he put me onto that you know
angel thank you for showing me the
and I was like man I'm gonna jump on
this I'm gonna jump on if you know
at first and then I started buying
courses
I got a dictate like a lot of you guys
yeah I get addicted to just black oh man
there's a sale I'm gonna buy this course
I'm gonna buy this course I'm gonna buy
this course next thing you know you buy
like 10 courses and you only have time
to finish what all right so that's how I
started and that's like my whole journey
right and I wish I could being able to
document that whole journey for you guys
and even like the little things like now
I share small little snip is about you
know my personal life like oh my
girlfriend I'm about to have a kid but
it would have been hot in the beginning
when I was like working as an IT worker
in the city and I used to hate and used
to come home I'm like oh man I hate this
 and then I had a girlfriend I'm
like I gotta give time to my girlfriend
but I gotta also you know come home and
learn all this at that time me and
my girlfriend was just you know
boyfriend-girlfriend little kiss
you know yeah it was just more like I
will see her like once or twice a week
something like that so throughout the
week I will try to learn as much as I
can but she will be pissed off at me and
be like oh you know
you're not picking up your phone you
don't call me or I will wait until the
end of the day to call her but in
reality it was because I was working
hard I was trying to learn this I was
like man what the hell am I gonna do am
I gonna go back to being an IT
worker I hated it or was I gonna fold
and end up back in the in the
mall working in the parking lot like you
see how I got the swag I'm gonna tell
you this story right in this how I got
fired from the mall right at Queens
Center Mall right this is hilarious so I
used to work in the parking lot right
letting people in you know let the
people in and then at the end that will
come back give me the ticket I put in
them taking the machine that machine
would tell me okay they've been here for
four hours so that's like twelve dollars
right and then they would give me money
right
so I created I was like you know I
always had the sauce man I'm like man
you're because I'm hearing this
 ass job doesn't mean I
can make a little extra right so they
told me like oh you can't ask for tips
you can't receive tips you can't do this
and that all right so it came down to
Christmas it was like I think like
December I don't know it was 2010 mm oh
I don't remember exactly but I remember
it was like the 22nd the 23rd to 24th so
those days was so back and so busy that
cars couldn't even fit into the parking
lot right so then you know me I got the
sauce I'm in there I'm in my little boo
from like this listening to who
was i listening to at that time I think
I was listening to Kanye West
my beautiful dark fantasy or some
like that right so I'm listening to this
 and I'm like man well I think it
was Gucci man I don't remember exactly
one of those so right so I'm listening
to the album and I'm like you know I got
this idea I'm like I'm not gonna stay
here beginning $8 an hour man I
gotta make this work right so I
created a sign a little sign that be
simply say like it was something
something it sounds corny now to think
about it but it's funny it's like it's
me you know what I mean so I came in I
say you know she also give me a million
dollar tip I would preach no I would
appreciate it no I would love it I would
love it and I'll be happy because it's
Christmas but I'm happy with just 25
cents right so I hit him with the game I
was I came in I say ah hell with the
game already right I came in so there
was like everybody that came by and I
drew a fucked-up Santa right because I
could draw that's not nothing that
people don't know I could draw right so
then I drew a fucked-up Santa with a
beer on his hand and it's like drunk all
right slumped up with his stomach out
and then everybody was laughing so
people will come in and leave like their
tip it'll be like don't pay with $20
it'll be like twelve fourteen dollars
and they'll be like keep the change
you funny as hell man we love
you all right so I'm just dead ranking
and ranking ranking in reckoning bro and
one day I make $600 and I never forget
the shame the dude that was in front of
me he was pissed because people
will come they will go it was the 20 the
20 to the 22nd and then people will come
back on the 23rd and really wanna come
to my side where I'm in the booth just
because I got the sauce just because I'm
sourcing it right I'm just in there
making the best out of it because yes
I'm getting paid a $8 an hour
yes I'm bored out of my mind but
doesn't mean that I can't just make
something bad to something good you know
what I mean I'm always positive I'm that
type of person right so I'm just there
and people just switching lanes so now
then I even go to the other guy's Lane
and my lane started getting poppin like
people started bringing music I had two
girls I was like I never forget this
 there was two white girls right
that came through and I'm like yo I was
like you know I thought I was like you
know man you read the sign right and
then she goes like yeah I read the sign
and then she goes like
it's kind of funny but stupid and I'm
like yeah but you know and then I
started laughing some
I was like man don't worry about that
don't worry if it's stupid man you know
I'm I'm out here sauce in it so she goes
like a word so then she started putting
some music whatever so I got this to
Girl's Day
just and twerking right in my
 booth right so now everybody's
like honking on the horn like ah and
whatever happens that whatever
manager came because the other kid was
snitching and he was like oh he's taking
tips and this and that
so this day I'm still looking for that
kid if I see I'm gonna stray I'm gonna
slap the shadow just because you can't
be a snitch in this world but yeah but
it was just crazy so whatever the guy
tells me he goes like listen man you're
never gonna get to be nothing you're
never gonna get nowhere with this type
of attitude you got to be a hard worker
and you gotta you know keep your head on
the game I'm like bro this
is some ass job you think I'm
trying to make this out of a career
the guys like I came here seven years
ago and I was in the same booth that you

much you make me I'm making $21 an hour
I'm like yo I started laughing I was
like bro not to downplay your
 but I'm not trying to make

highlight of my life all right
and I say this and I'm out so
then I didn't show up for like three
days and then they call me up like oh

there's a moment for you guys this a
moment where you could say hey I'm part
of the community hey um I'm going in you
know I'm hurt I'm not scared to show my
face and black you know what I'm
learning how to code I'm becoming a
developer out here and it's like it's a
process
like you're gonna look back on this and
be like it's like cam you got your boy
cam you got your boy Joseph this dude yo
give them by the end of this year given
by the end of the summer they'll
probably ready the progress in the
process that they're doing right now is
gonna pay off its gonna be like young
wiing here we chillin you know
everything paid off we working you know
that's what I want to see you know with
my goal man now why I can't hear you my
fault
I said December is my goal see they're
having me my first job in the door there
or to have everything I need to be
looking for a job I'm gonna get my
headphones real quick so it doesn't it
doesn't peek see all right let me hear a
little sign yo yo yo
audio thank you good here we go la la
and what I see you what up man you guys
is you know I see people at a time like
they too stiff you know what I mean it's
like they so stiff that if they move to
the side then the back breaks
and you got a little up you got a
dual you know a little dab you know this
should be like an exercise when you wake
up you just gotta wake up like you know
warm am feeling myself today get your
 ready and just hit him with it you
know cuz it's like you gotta get that
and get get that sauce kids you know
just release the stress stop thinking
that life is too too serious man you
know because you might be crossing the
street and just that's safe you guys
like I got my first couple of videos I
was looking back over my was like damn I
look just stiff and dead because I'm not
used to being in front of the camera
like that
like it's one thing when you have
someone you're talking to back and forth
it feels more natural but it's like I'm
just looking at the screen
the am i doing yeah that's natural
though
but yeah I'm getting used to though so
oh yeah I think I think it just happens
you know what I mean like as you keep on
recording though if you guys look at my
very first video I'm like a little bit
of the sauce was in there but it wasn't
- where is that now like right now we're
like super saiyan coding face.com
you know what I mean like this it's
like mad true now right but back then I
was like oh man I gotta show my face for
this I gotta be what the hell
people's gonna look at me like oh who's
this nerd who's talking about code this
and I'm like you know what man I could
just come in here - swag it out do what
I do just the same way I am with my
friends you know feel comfortable get in
this man hop on this pick up his ankles
real quick alright would you want to say
Joseph muffled oh that was funny dude
that was funny oh you heard about this
CSS grid stuff yeah yeah like do you
think that that works a little bit
better for positioning stuff than
bootstrap well I think if you want to do
everything from scratch yes like me
personally and one of the reasons why I
tell people to use bootstrap only if you
know how to do yourself and you know
what's going on is because like let's
say right now I'm working on a website
I'm doing you know I'm doing a agree
whatever I'm doing a page all right when
I use the classes that bootstrap already
uses any developer come in and pick it
up
you know start coding and start editing
and no sigh okay this column started
here this becomes you know for when it's
on large and this is three when it's in
small whatever right so for me that's
where is good because anybody could come
in and pick it up because the problem
about when you don't have structure or
you're not using the framework is that
you could come in and call this the
peaks of class right you just say hey
pizza means for 50% of the screen I've
seen crazy like this well people
will come in be like half of the product
page and you're like what like what the
hell does this mean like half - the
product page and that's the class in
that class is with 50% right so that's
why for me I was still used bootstrap
just for that just for whenever you
working with multiple developers now if
you're working on something on you by
yeah by yourself or you like the senior
developer who makes all the decisions
then yeah I will say hey just use
whatever you want to use you want to use
flexbox you want to use grades go ahead
and use them you know but when it's all
in a large company somebody gotta come
in and set up certain rules I'm gonna
okay we're using bootstrap we're using
foundation or we're using our own grid
like somebody needs to create a grid and
then everybody else follows it like I
think um there's this podcast I forgot
the not JavaScript jabber and there's
another one called the happy hour front
end a front end happy hour something
like that where basically one of the
guys were saying in Netflix what they
use they use their own internal grid
system right but everybody in the
company uses that grid system it's not
like hey I'm using this grid system and
then your
come in and create another grid system
and then you're gonna come in and say
he's using Flex boxes and then the next
person is using the grid CSS grids no
it's everybody's using this this great
system that they already agree to you
know yeah because when you got a big
company website like that you all gotta
be on the same page like every other day
the page is gonna be looking different
exactly and when you like your Netflix
or Hulu or you're a big time corporation
big time company you need to have that
that consistency every day unless after
you know it's been a year or two and you
decide you know it's been a year or two
same layout we want to sprinkle some
sauce and put some new flavor in there
you know yeah I get what you're saying
yeah so it's like I think it's great to
know it it's not gonna hurt nobody
tannoy and it's good because you never
know you might be in the position where
you can actually be the one that decides
what's the gritty right let's say
somebody there's a bunch of let's say an
example right you get hired to a company
and that company has a whole bunch of
senior developers for all those senior
developers are really just back-end
developers right now you're the new guy
who is the front-end guy right and knows
more front-end than the guys who've been
here for 10 15 years right but because
you're the new guy they give you the
opportunity they're like oh what do you
think should we use bootstrap or should
we use something else and then now
because you know CSS grids you could
come in and say you know what we're not
gonna use bootstrap because bootstrap is
bloated I can create a grid for us and
then we all follow it and now everybody
in the company follows it because you're
the guy that made that decision you know
what I mean yeah it's not gonna hurt you
I don't like that happens to me all
the time there's you know a lot of times
even more company people there were
other developers there who are senior
developers but they were more back-end
and they're like what should we use
should we use that that was one of the
questions right where it was like should
we use angular should we use react or
should we
use of UGS because it's also almost like
part of laravel and I was like you know
what we're not gonna use no few GS we're
definitely not gonna use no angular
right because I'm the most senior
front-end developer the one that knows
the motion in front end so that decision
goes on me and I'm like hey we're just
gonna use react period right so if you
wouldn't have known any framework then
you would have had to follow whatever
 goofy is gonna come up with you
know goofy is gonna come up and be like
hey guys let's just going of UJS
and you know what I mean like or they
just follow the sheep's right so
you know but that's what happens you
know that's what happens in in real
environments right but hopefully you get
opportunities to make decisions like
that they ask you like well you know
your to do with all the knowledge here
we just kind of been doing what we can
do that's you need to take that and and
go with it because that's that's good
 to put on your resume to be like
well I worked here I was in charge of
creating this whole new identity a whole
company
ended up using that's that's that sauce
to sprinkle on that on that resume we
got a new guy right here well
padeen was good son was good was good
was good can you hear us live I don't
think he can hear us Dean could Dean
could be let me see
say something Joseph because I want to I
want to see something if if the screen
changes all right I mean now cuz well I
hate when I do this like whenever I
touch something like let's say if I
touch one of your icons if I touch it
whenever you talk it doesn't go to the
camera doesn't go to you right all right
I did have something I want to say
though because talking about CSS and
stuff I felt like I kind of kicked
myself in the butt
because I've enclosed course after all
of his HTML CSS stuff done and I knew
that bootstrap had to do with CSS in
that but I wasn't entirely aware of like
what all it did because I didn't go and
look at it and so I I took the decisions
well you know I still want to practice
the HTML CSS a little bit more before I
take something completely new on and so
I've been going through your course and
I'm up to the part till right I'm I'm at
the part where you stood where we start
making the site so open they get that
done in a couple days but I've been
doing some slice some side projects and
trying to figure out how to do stuff on
my own so I've created things on my own
legally and it's been a little bit slow
for me and then after going back and
looking and seeing what bootstrap
actually was I was just like I
could have done a lot of so much
faster than been done because it's it's
that balance I want to know what all
that stuff is doing behind the scenes
like you always say because it's a
double-edged sword
but I want to streamline some of my
stuff so I can have some of these
projects done because I'm trying to hit
a deadline well my personal goal to be
done by like December it to be out there
and trying to get in the job market but
I but I was like no I'm just gonna wait
because I want to you know make sure I
know this stuff really good and now I'm
just like that would have been helping
me on my side projects though ya know I
think knowing bootstrap or any any
framework like you even mess around with
foundation personally I like foundation
more than bootstrap but bootstrap is
more of like a default it's like what
everybody knows right now you go to any
company and at one point somebody than
hey could you do this in bootstrap like
it's come to that point where it's like
you know like anything can you
build this in bootstrap you know so it's
like you have to know it but what I
would say is I think you did the right
thing you don't need to jump into
bootstrap yeah because bootstrap what I
would say for you is use bootstrap just
for the grid to
use bootstrap for the navigation to use
bootstrap for the modal's for the
dropdowns and all this it's like
number one is super bloated right it's
super bloated is so much code that they
put into it that in reality you you
don't need it like I could make a
drop-down menu with like literally I
don't know we're like three divs and
like three classes and that's it it's
like or maybe two classes and that's it
that's a drop-down in in bootstrap is
different bootstrap gives you a whole
bunch of different that you don't
even need so it just makes you
bloated all right I would just say keep
doing what you're doing if you can build
the pages already how you want it then
continue building it like that now if
you just say hey I already know this
concept and I could do it myself then go
ahead jump to bootstrap because the idea
is bootstrap is to save you the time of
recording a lot of alright but if
you know exactly what's going on then
it's fine you know you can the bootstrap
or any other framework you don't have to
it doesn't have to be full strap so the
only thing I'm still trying to get a
hold on um is positioning in layout
because it's a lot of trial and error
just trying to find get it exactly how
you envisioned it in your mind but
outside of that I mean I feel like I'm
I'm at a pretty decent intermediate
level of HTML CSS not as good I think
once you finish this other course the
one that I did I think you're gonna be
good because that's one thing that I
feel like a lot of courses don't have is
like real life examples I got feel like
this Facebook clone has all the examples
that you need to basically say hey I
want to position this here and knowing
where where and how to break things down
because I sometimes you say hey there's
something on the top and there's
something here to the right right but
then you don't know how to actually you
could say okay flow to the right
and that's it but what if you wanted to
put this in certain percentages of the
screen or or like let's say you have a
little icon like let's say you you know
how when you go to a car right the cart
has to the number of items on it like
let's say it has to the little cart icon
and then it has a circle with a number
on top of it to do that you have to know
position you can't just be like hey I'm
just gonna have this thing and make it
into image no you have to code that so
that's where you know position is gonna
come in as far as like you know or like
design and shape but all of that stuff
is trial and error all you have to know
this is the main thing about positioning
that I tell people you got to remember
this fixed position fixed means it's
fixed wherever you put it if you say top
it's gonna be fixed to the top and
depending on the z-index sorry
depending on the z-index that's where is
going to be where where is going to show
up is it gonna be on top of every
element behind it or is gonna be behind
the screen like you could do a negative
Z index right now that's position fixed
and then position static is the regular
that's what every element is located at
and then position absolute it means it
goes depending on what's the parent if
the parent is position relative which is
close to position static it's almost the
same thing as static the only
differences you could actually say top
10 and then moves down from the top but
it still holds that space or you know
you say to the right and then still
holds you're the same space like that's
the only the only things I tell people
to remember it's just like okay position
static is the regular one but position
fixed is the one that's fixed to the
screen and then position absolute is
whatever the parent is if there is no
parent that is called position relative
then that means the position absolute is
relative to the whole screen and then
that's saying this in one of the biggest
things like I was true as I was doing
reading because I was reading some
articles and stuff like you said that
bootstraps seems to be very bloated and
I know that one of my personal goals as
a developer is try to make things as
short and simple as possible if if
there's a shorter more simpler way to
code something that's what I want to do
versus having a couple big ol long lines
of code just to get the job done because
that's how I know how to do it mmm you
know especially if you start your own
company you're hosting your own servers
and all that stuff
any little spaceman server space takes
up just money I mean definitely
especially when you're doing front-end
you want it to be highly coalesced as
you know like JavaScript you want it to
be uglify and minified you know to the
smallest it can be because even now when
you use something like react let's say
you bundle something up that bundle
could be one megabyte so if somebody is
using a 2g phone or a 3G phone one what
megabyte is gonna take forever for it to
download a yo-yo-yo-yo Kadeem you in
there you know we seek redeems but means
parent Kadeem what up no microphone sign
your live already bro you're already
laughing you're already live right now
we can't hear you no there's no audio
there's no audio right now coming from
you all right we got a demon here breath
we got your boy all right let me see
who's gonna chat room right now hey I
got a I got a question huh
yeah go ahead yeah so I've been working
on your course I've
pretty much got most of the course the
html/css course done I was just thinking
about have you start on the responsive
stuff yet are you gonna yeah I'm gonna
go into that that's something that I was
like you know what I'm gonna leave it
for a second then come back to it
because also to there's like there's a
lot of people who are following this
discourses which also something that I
wanted to tell everybody that's watching
this right now because some people might
come in and but I hate I signed up for
the course and I wanted to get
JavaScript and I wanted to get laravel I
wanted to get all of this courses guys
you guys are going to get that right but
it's also a process I have to build
everything the reason why I put it up
for so cheap right now right it's like
you're pretty much pre-ordering for fat
out us and for the rest of your life is
$5 or whatever you bought it for if you
bought it for $45 that's all the 44
hours that you have to pay forever right
all of these courses are gonna be
complete in the next few months right
but it's a process so I'm going step by
step knocking them up
my advice is everybody that's here
nobody here is an expert yet right I'm
not an expert
nobody's an expert Yeah right so my
advice would be follow the HTML CSS if
you already know the syntax skipping go
straight to the last chapters which is
basically building the site this is
going to reinforce your your HTML CSS
and teach you things that you did not
know because I see a lot of people's
portfolios I'm like if you would have
taken this course you would have been
good all right so I would say continue
to you know HTML CSS finish that then
from there go to the JavaScript once you
finish with the JavaScript if you know
the syntax skip the syntax right and
then jump to the project I have like 4
cool projects that I have for JavaScript
that I owe that we're going to do that
is going to teach you guys exactly what
you need to learn for JavaScript because
in programming this is something that
people don't tell you
you're always going to be repeating the
same constantly the certain
projects that if you learn it once once
you learn that and think you know how to
solve every other project that's gonna
be thrown at you right especially
nowadays so what projects are they one
dealing with inputs right input feels
like you know forms you know dealing
with that right to deal with classes
basically the Dom the Dom elements right
removing a class removing removing
adding a class those things are super
useful because that's what you're gonna
use on your everyday skills right then
you have for another one which is
dealing with api's how to pull data how
to post data like those are the things
that you're gonna need as a developer
for you to get a job right away if you
don't know those things automatically
there's no reason for anybody to hire
hire you period because if you don't
know those things those are the things
that you need to do in a website every
single day all right so that's what I'm
focusing on right now going back to you
or camp they're responsive I'm adding
that this week and then we're gonna
break it down and add everything the
responsive site now what I was gonna do
is I was going to separate it instead of
putting it into just that same course
I'm basically separating it to another
course which is gonna be called learning
how to basically do responsive design
because learning HTML CSS that's fine
that's what that's what the course is
supposed to do now learning responsive
design it's a whole different course
right so that I'm gonna add it to
another course which I'm gonna do next
so it should be done by Saturday so by
Saturday you're gonna have to hold
responsive course because there's
there's so many pieces to it
that I would have been like here if I
make if I add more to this course this
HTML CSS course it would have been like
a seven eight hour long course or more
right so
from my understanding when people start
seeing like courses that take forever
they're like they lose interest at least
when you say hey I finished one course
and then now you're finishing another
one you get that gratification of like
oh I complete what now I'm jumping to
another the next one or if I was to just
put it in in like a full full full
course and say hey hey guys you're gonna
learn HTML CSS JavaScript bootstrap like
the cold steel's course or any costumes
course is great but to me the only
different defect that I has is just it
has too much it's just everything
cramped in people could go in there and
if they only have one hour a day to
finish it they only have two hours a day
to to go in there they might they might
not even be done were there for like two
three months you know what I mean like
and that happens all the time and
then you don't get to retain everything
you know so it's like for me the HTML
CSS page what I'm doing is I'm doing
that page and then from there I'm doing
another CSS project for it so people
could retain that information you know
but I okay I already know what what to
do when it comes to HTML CSS and then
from there let's learn how to make it
responsive right so yeah that's just -
sorry for the long the long answer but I
just wanted to make it clear for
everybody here cuz I got some messages -
where he's like hey I wanted to get you
know I wanted to get started with the
laravel right away and I'm like all of
that is coming but it's a process
I want everybody who's here the main
reason why you're getting a for so cheap
in reality or discourses is gonna be on
you to me right you basically getting a
pre-order you're basically getting
courses as they are created right as
they are created you're getting it right
there in your face oh so you could
complete it with me and like you're
coming along with me on this journey
right so that's what I'm telling
everybody is like all of those courses
are coming in every every day like today
are there like four videos already I'll
put it up you know four videos each one
20 minutes so that's about what like an
hour you know what I mean like you know
you get an hour of basically code every
single day you know if you follow the
channel and you follow the website
you're pretty much going to be learning
if you listen to me every single day at
least an hour to two hours a day you
know what I mean so yeah man we in here
man we live your boy camp your boy
Joseph we got Kadeem and here we get we
gotta Dean's pants
Dean come on man we want to hear you man
with the mic bro you need to go on your
phone you need to go on your phone sign
let me send your email go on your phone
find your phone man cuz we can't hear
you nothing right now
go on your phone you could do this live
through your phone man that's what I'm
doing exactly
you see do this laughs man but yeah let
me see let me see who else is in here I
got a couple of people so I want to get
that new person's take on this yeah
man let me see who else is in here hang
out let me check
we got like 40 people in here I wanna
check who else is in the chat room
though where's the chat room doe okay I
got it
all right Missy we got hockey me we got
Diane we got David who else we got we'll
willful Bushwick who else is in here
but yeah Joe speaking on your course
that going back to the HTML see it says
I was thinking about this uh right like
well I'm following your course do like
another version where I'm just doing my
own spin and using like flexbox to
refactor like a lot of code that I
already did
yeah no that's great that's that's
definitely great I think flexbox is this
is something that if you get comfortable
with it like you know everybody has
their own workflow I've noticed like
I've seen some people they they do a lot
of like sass mixings like you know they
do they use sass to create grades I've
seen people that used CSS grids now I
see people who are becoming more
comfortable with Flex boxes like all of
this stuff is it's pretty much like how
can I say this like once you you know
how to layout things it doesn't matter
what way you decide to do it there is no
wrong or right way it's more of like
whatever you're comfortable you know
what I mean like right now you could be
going through the whole HTML CSS course
and but okay cool we doing this through
percentages right and they're from there
you might say hey I want to refactor
this to you know flex boxes and then two
three months from now you might say hey
I want to try out
CSS great say I want to switch up
everything so CSS great nobody's gonna
come in and tell you hey man you did it
wrong because of this or you did it
wrong because of that because as long as
the page looks exactly how the design is
and also too it works on other browsers
like older ones you're gonna be fine you
know it's like that's another thing too
you gotta keep in mind now every browser
also to like supports flex boxes and CSS
great like especially the like depending
on the company that you work on they
might have certain rules they might say
okay like this is good but we also gotta
make sure that works on older browsers
that's why I mean personally I like to I
don't know I just like to be safe you
know like there's so many cool things
like somebody sent me a link for CSS for
right
and they have a lot of cool things
coming out for CSS for but if I was to
implement that into my code is like we
don't know when - is gonna come out you
know what I mean like CSS for might not
be implemented to all the browsers
before like another two to three years I
mean so yes yes s4 video was pretty cool
but it doesn't really matter how you
build it it's fine let me see
you know things cut out or something
internet went out yeah cut off for just
a second but you're back at least on my
horizon you had to make a switch -
Xfinity bro horizon you're me up
sabotage my yeah man we got you can
aim on air like yeah I know man
I feel bad we got a theme in here
finally I've been trying to get him in
for like man long but then we got no
audio so it's fine but yeah let me see
I'm reading what people are saying in
the chat room Zachary Taylor says yeah
we got you all right okay good good all
right I see I worked it all set up real
quick he has a press L too far - real
quick get the cheat codes so we'll get
there nothing much just got promoted
that's my position
my job oh yeah big belcanto guys are a
starter all right technician I'll see
you in my coding time
not as a supplement grinding yeah man II
gotta get that money men that I work but
yeah so uh let us know I mean how long
you've been doing coda or have you just
been doing this for a while I started a
while back c-sharp
okay c.net so I kind of know the
standard stuff for each loops and all
that application and I'm really trying
to learn application structuring and
stuff like that okay
advanced topics but the CSS HTML I got
down pack okay I got this man Austin
bent pickle kind of make my little CMS
system imagine my customers a little bit
I kind of learned from there from
scratch approach I don't like to use
boilerplate and everything else no
that's good that's good man you gotta
you gotta do a minute and how are you in
JavaScript you messing with the
JavaScript different but I'm learning it
learning it yeah it's programming you
know what I mean like you already know
how to program so yeah it's just about
like I tell people just knowing the Dom
that's saying how the Dom you hear if
you know HTML C says you know JavaScript
yeah more like callbacks and all that
promise mission oh yeah yeah man that's
one thing that's funny man when I
promise this started popping up like a
few years ago and everybody's talking
about promises and I'm like oh man I
don't understand this and like I
remember people would be like asking me
a name in the very beginning right and
like in interviews I was like oh I don't
really know that much about it but you
know I could learn you know I can learn
on the job and you know cuz that's the
thing if you don't know something just
be honest with it like I never lied to
people like oh yeah I know how to do
this now I don't be like listen I know
how to use Ajax with jQuery back then I
was like I was
jQuery yeah haven't really yeah I don't
really know how to mess with like
promises I haven't really had the chance
I didn't understand it that well but
that was like in my first six seven
months right and then from there you
realize Oh promises and like it's
just like okay then the servers waiting
whatever its processes in processing
something since a message back to you
like a console.log where it says
Oh thank you for whatever your
 post and this works that's
saying and now you basically do
something else with your code so it's
like nothing crazy you know when it
comes to promises it's not like you know
but there's so many concepts that's one
thing that people gotta know man you
gonna number one you're gonna always
continue learning because you know every
 six months somebody comes up
with something new that's recreating the
 wheel right a lot of times it's
gonna be in there but like you said once
you learn wow yeah once you learn it
once then from there you're good you
know but I always tell people just you
know be prepared to always keep on
learning somebody else is gonna come up
with something else you know you know
today is reactive you tomorrow is
 Harry Potter framework everybody
jump on it yeah but Barbara's loving
some Kadeem what's up man it's about
time we taking it back for the
woman go ahead Barbara because every
time the any cute girl who shows
up here the guys is hotter is
like oh my god April send me your number
so do it right back to the guys -
that
[Laughter]
that's good
we got you're gonna be a man we out here
max a couple of frameworks and we're out
here matchmaking people all right man
but yeah so what I was gonna say so
these right now with you what you're
learning right now you working on
anything just JavaScript right now any
courses and anything that all questions
aren't really just all our courses
everything from scratch you know from
scratch no read articles no courses yeah
that should be that should be like my
 my commercials like nah man no
courses just coding that's it
that's all we got but I was living it
now it is then so what you from bro
Canada Toronto the six watch out for the
sixth god man he's watching it's been
thick like a city but you feel you you
originally from Canada I hear I hear a
little Caribbean do you have the
background to make it young man that's
what I got man people I'm telling you
man the Caribbean we just got a sauce
man we just that that she just comes out
naturally you know what I mean like
that's the thing man yeah I gotta go
everybody who hasn't been to the
Caribbean at least once it doesn't
matter where you go Dominican Republic
Puerto Rico Jamaica Barbados freaking
what's the other one st. Martin but it
doesn't matter where you
turn to that tobago or it
doesn't matter you're gonna be good you
you're gonna get treated good you're
gonna enjoy yourself you got to go down
there man
yeah I mean I really want to make a trip
and hit up Trinidad and Jamaica
the only islands I've been on out off
the east coast has been like the Florida
Keys but I lived in Hawaii for five
years now I love the island life yeah
man all right that's how it is man I'm
telling you but yeah let me see who else
is in here man oh we got your boy
digital jazz what up he got another job
yeah that's what I was about to say your
boy digital jazz and they caught him
they snatched him up you won't be seen
you won't be seen that way around here
no month is a snap let's say you won't
see him around here you know that's it
the a company snatched him up
you know he's he can't come down to you
know right here with the peasants of
work working let's say he got a job god
damn it they took him away from us
kid got a job too whoo whoo kid oh yeah
a word I'm afraid he don't I'm afraid he
got a job too but I wouldn't see him in
the chatter oh that's true I say boy
times is hard baby mama say yo bro you
gotta give me some time
that's what baby mama pulls you to the
side and pulls on that ears like y'all
you've been coding too much give me some
time
oh yeah man that's what's up man it's
good to see everybody in here man it's
good to see like you know we got a good
community man we got a cool cool
community we got a lot of people that
always come back and people who just
enjoy this you know what I mean like
there's definitely like I don't know
it's a conglomerate you know like we got
people
come here from the beginning they didn't
know anything I get emails all the time
where people is like oh man
I freaking been watching your show since
January when you started and like now
it's like I got a job it's like you
basically took me through the whole ride
and like kept me motivated and I'm like
yeah man that's what we're here for man
we here to just you know motivate to
excited about this cuz it's like yeah
you could code in your house and be like
oh cool I know how to code who cares
but if you make your money out of
you know if you make money out of this
then it's worth it you know like that's
what's know people like don't waste your
time just learning everything under the
Sun learn the things that's gonna get
you the job because then once you're
working in a company you're gonna get
paid to learn things there so it's like
what you rather be doing be learning in
your house for free or get paid at the
job you know and a couple people in the
Gator they've gotten jobs too so yeah
yeah no they all send me send me emails
like yo man I got a job this like so
many people like you know they good now
there's a lot of people which you guys
should be ashamed of yourselves
you guys come here yeah use my channel
and yeah come here
yeah get a job and think I never come
back that's wrong that's not right you
know like that's what uh this lady at
this Python meetup group I was going to
I said yeah like you come in here you
show us your skills so we'll help you
get a job a lot of people get that job
never come back but if anything I'm
gonna come back with a vision
I'm gonna get hit like bro let's do a
project together a tutorial
collaboration yeah we're gonna remix
this get four or five of us on here
dropping sauce and bombs
gyms and all other kinds of I tell
people man just come back man just show
love
you know it's like then I see them then
I see them or on other channels I'm down
I gotta come through impressed I'm like
yo son what up you haven't been on my
channel for many where you been at I
[Laughter]
just plain guys like I don't care man
but it is just funny I tell people man
all the time like come to the channel
enjoy you know find some friends here
there's a lot of people who was in the
the mentorship program who till this day
it's been like what two three months
till this day they still hit me up like
Oh Joe thank you for opportunity and
they still talk to this do you know to
Matt the can like a couple of
 people I'll be hitting up your
boy Andrew I hit him up he's in
Paris with wifey like he's doing a lot
of connections yeah he just went all
around the world right now basically
well all around Europe you know you know
I was wondering where Andrew being cuz I
ain't seen for a minute yeah man we miss
him man I think I think Angeles is
somebody that he could really do a lot
of great things because he knows how to
program he's not like a dude that
doesn't know he knows how to program he
just needs to put in a little time for
the front end and that's saying you know
but that he knows how to program he
knows how to do his you know what I
mean so yeah I mean I'm grateful because
he also created windows version of my
installation of you know the rocky stack
in crystal Lang so that I'm really
grateful about that cuz a lot of people
they look online they're like man how do
you install crystalline in Windows and
they don't know how to do it so thanks
to him a lot of people have been
following his channel because of that
that's a stack I really want to learn I
thought it was very interesting and
after you first mission crystal and I
started looking at I was like oh this
this might be that so yeah that
might be the first stack I end up
wondering once I get to that level and
I've went through like two or three of
your videos on it already
look and try to get a basis and be like
is this what I want to do because I
don't want this hop on because I'm
selling it right now I'm not but now I'm
really liking it so I'm interested see
where it goes nah
it's crazy because I've always been into
Ruby but then one of my viewers sent me
a message oh man
have you heard a crystal Lang and I
didn't pay attention to it cuz I'm like
every month somebody creates
some new on github and you can
respect it because it's like anybody
github has become like Twitter
like anybody under the Sun can create a
project there and then say hey I'll have
five thousand stars come check out my
project right and then you go and check
out the project in the project is
 but I went in there after he
sent me multiple messages I said you
know what man i'ma go and search these
people so crystal Lang is as fast as C
right but it's ringing in a way that's
similar to Ruby which may makes it super
easy to code in and then on top of that
not only is it fast it's like it's like
the wild wild west it's like it's like
you know where where people is going in
creating cool projects and you can make
a name for yourself there's a language
that it might not be popping off this
year might not be popping off next year
but it's already hired
I think it's higher than Java on github
uh as far as the stars like is really
getting you know getting momentum right
now like let me see yeah well you guys
don't know how to program go ahead and
learn crystal like if you don't know
anything don't try to go and jump into
crystal because there's more advanced
stuff like this like for people that
know how to program if you're just
trying to learn how to be a a web
developer learning Chris - I don't think
it's the best way to go but actually if
you're looking to get a job but for
somebody who knows how to program man is
it's one of the best things out there
period
I do got a quick question are there any
stacks that's currently used in the
industry that uh utilizes Python man
it's cutting off again uh your camera
froze looks like you bet to sneeze cut
off you gotta say it again my for your
back um no I'm saying is there currently
any stacks used in the industry that
utilizes Python Python yeah um that I
know of I mean Google Google itself is
written in Python and YouTube is Python
there's a lot of apps like I think
Pinterest is made in Python there's a
whole bunch of them you know but the
thing is it's like this just because
like one company or two companies are
like big companies are using it it
doesn't mean the industry are using it
because that's the thing is like if
you're a college student right now like
whenever like I get the insights I got
the insights of like udemy which is a
very good way to find out what people
are actually searching for what people
are trying to learn and Python is one of
those things that is super hot right now
like it doesn't matter you can have the
most shittiest channel if you
have Python on it you go get you're
gonna get a whole bunch of subscribers
why because every college is teaching
students programming with Python Python
has become like the first introduction
to people when it comes to programming
yeah it was it was mine for the most
part I mean I dabbled with HTML and CSS
back in the old myspace days but when I
was like yeah I'm going to learn to code
and become a programmer I picked up
Python and I loved it mm-hmm it's it's
my side piece it's not what I'm focusing
on
I dabble in work a little bit with it
when I can make those meetings and
just have a day to gather house and go
to it and hang out with some developers
in real life I go but it's not my
complete focus but I love it it's
something that I would do just on the
side outside of the stuff that I know is
gonna get me a job like mhm HTML CSS
JavaScript my sequel PHP that's like
what you need if you want to make sure
you can get a job somewhere everything
else well yeah and like stuff like react
and a j/s framework to but everything
else is pretty much that's what you like
and that's what you do on the side or
when you're doing freelance stuff and
you have the option to use whatever you
want to do yeah exactly yeah no that's
like look right now these are the top
language is on on Gale which a reality
doesn't tell you like what are the best
or what is being used the most in the
industry
but this is the list they have Apple
Swift is number one you have golang
number two Microsoft typescript is
number three rust is number four Carlene
is number five which is crazy Colleen
went up like so many spaces in
the past few months like is going to
like the top three by the end of the
year is gonna be in the top three
CoffeeScript let me see who has Ruby
Ruby used to be I think number one or
number two and fellow of PHP is after
Ruby then you got Python after PHP then
you have a lick sir then you have Julia
and then you have crystal crystal Pass
Scala crystal pass closure crystal pass
Erlang crystal pass Elm Lang there's a
lot of different languages that crystal
already passed over so it's like a lot
of people are searching for it you know
like for me when it comes to languages
like go Lang and crystal write like
people the people who go on
and become like the pioneers those are
the guys that in the next few years
they're going to be getting those two
hundred thousand dollar jobs three
hundred thousand dollar jobs because
there's not that many people who use it
but companies needed you know like right
now if you search on golang this job's
for guys if you know Golan you get
higher for $150,000 like with one year
of experience it's like you know what I
mean like that's that's a big difference
you know like if you're gonna jump into
something and you're gonna dedicate your
time I will say jump into like something
like gold and crystal cuz this is more
like how you saying is it's like an
investment you're investing your time
into this but you know at the end is
gonna pay off because this all like
really great languages and then at the
end the companies need need people to to
code in this languages you know like
because even even like a confirm they're
not gonna be the top paying jobs they're
gonna be those jobs that oh yeah you're
brand new developer here 60,000 he is
60,000 so I gotta give you the on
fire internet yeah could hear me what'd
you say was that you use that Verizon
yeah right damn it good 27 times Oh
could you give us like a brick wall more
specifically could you give me like a
brief example of what golang is actually
used for cuz some of these other like
newer languages I know the names but I
don't really know how they're utilized
in stuff well right now for Golding I
think the most popular thing about
Golding is number one is docker
Dockers yeah so a lot of companies are
jumping on that right now the problem
for me personally that I've noticed with
jobs in Kolding is that I see a lot of
words that are mixed with IT and DevOps
meaning you're gonna be doing a lot of
server it's like more like server
programming I think you could do
websites and do things like that because
this is a general programming language
but the problem is that a lot of those
jobs are more like for DevOps in and
people who want to get into Dockers and
 like that so that's what I see the
use for it right okay so I that's why I
see the most popular things that are
popular for for docker is like on this
other language Kotlin right Kotlin was a
language that was created by the people
who created jetbrains
they created a whole bunch of different
like phpstorm they had that's the new
language that's used in android right
exactly okay all right boy Kotlin can
also translate well translate transpire
or compile to JavaScript and can compile
I think to see it could compile to a
whole bunch of different languages so
that's what I think is very popular
because a lot of people see it then I oh
I could father and continent that I
could just compile it to anything else
out there you know so that's why people
are are getting into Kotlin especially
now because Android made a official like
oh we're using continent you know so
once Google said that every you know
everybody a lot of sheeps gotta jump to
it so you know like I'm weighing right
now I'm just waiting I got I got all my
money on crystal because crystal all
crystal needs is the right promotion the
right company like if any company like
let's say the people who created Ruby on
Rails right the
the guy who created it if he was to say
hey I'm creating the next version of
Ruby on Rails in Crystal then they'll
say everybody jumps to Crystal if a
company like Facebook says hey we did
something in the backend with crystal
everybody is gonna jump to Crystal right
so it's like the people who are there
first are the ones that get called up
and be hey we need an expert you know
and then they look me up that I oh
the first guy doing tutorials on crystal
the first guy dropping a full
stack framework like you know it's like
it's an investment you know what I mean
so I also tell people like investing in
something that you could believe in you
know what I mean so my go-to language is
definitely crystal for sure so yeah man
let me see what's up with the chat room
let me see who's in here got you boy
the Crusader rabbits here you know I
want everybody who's in here in the chat
room leave the letter J right now just
so we can see who's in here it's put
there letter J you don't have to see
nothing else just leave the letter J so
we could know who's a narrator :
exact digital jazz DL Jones Kadeem
Stewart Akemi
who else George but Steele we got Lamont
we got logy we I can we got well Steven
we got sad we got Kewanee we got who
else we got Tom we got how beaten we got
silver blade who else is in here man
that's forty people come on guys what
was in here hasn't put the letter J
leave the letter J I want to know who's
in here man come on
stop being lazy man hey Larkin aka ak-47
Eva we got the Mandela effect you know
people are very very interesting when it
comes to their names we got we gotta get
wabbit Elon Musk I'm worried what
happened to you that must let me see
brave Blu spy know a couple of people
men oh yeah man guys I think I'm gonna
call it a day we've been here for I
don't know maybe like now I'm gonna have
two hours but it was fun man it was fun
hanging out it's been a minute I really
enjoyed it next time guys if you guys
have any questions man send it to me
man like I tell you guys yeah cool Acts
anything whatever you want to know I
just give my opinion and my expert know
I'm not an expert I'm just giving my
opinion you know what I mean maybe
people don't take it too serious
don't be like Oh Joe said this is
 now do your own research find
out on your own I could give you my
opinion of you know my five
years in the game if that means anything
right but also do your own research
that's why you're you're a human being
you got a brain do your research look it
up find out whatever you want it to find
out but you know put that time in all
right guys but still I appreciate it you
came through man Scotty I see you you
dig weird man but yeah cam Joseph Kadeem
thanks for coming through man I'll see
you guys later
you know we in here man coding face.com
your boy live on the podcast we're gonna
do this once a week guys
you know just so you you guys could get
used to it
doing the birdman' birdman hammer up
real quick
i'ma have to get you on my channel one
day there there's a thing I tell
everybody yo
invite me to whatever you want to invite
me I'm gonna show up you know when I
first started this thing I told people
hey man come join this channel come join
this you know this podcast now everybody
shows up now even to this day there's
people who I help talent show love and I
hey man let's do this then they tell me
oh I'm too busy I ain't got time I'm
right yeah those those are flaky
that's when yeah I had him I hit him
with the eye
yeah I think I think it would be good
because I feel like I do better when I
have someone actually talk to and stuff
and then now we can we can plug your
site and your udemy links because those
are good links and that'll help get some
stuff back since you do a lot to try to
give out free courses to people that
need it their stuff so I think I think
that's a good thing and you know at some
point I want to try to give back and do
stuff I can I know I found a couple
books I already have they've went on so
I might try to buy a couple of them do a
giveaway or something to someone who
really need to you know whoever use
that's good man that's hot that's how it
should be I feel like you gotta give
back so you know the universe could
throw a little sauce on you too you know
what I mean like old the good
that has happened to me in my life is
because I've always been good you know
even to this day even if somebody
me over I kind of just be like you know
what man he had a bad day you know
that's how I'm the type of person when I
owe this person slapped me one cheek he
was stressed out he's okay he's a good
person that's the type of person I am
you know what I mean so I feel like you
just gotta help other people out man
even when people do you wrong like the
other day I was like man people trying
to do me wrong I'm like you know what
I'm bout to I was this close to just be
like I don't even want to do it I don't
want to help nobody out I don't want to
talk to nobody I don't want to help no
other channels out I don't want to do
anything but then I thought around I'm
like wait now I sound like one of the
peoples that was doing that to me
when I first started so I'm like you
know what I'm not gonna do that
well that's that's human nature and it's
human emotion too you know it's human
nature that you see someone else
succeeding doing something then they
want to emulate what you're doing that
way they can succeed too not considering
how you know there might be better ways
where you can do things where it's
mutually beneficial and but it's but
it's also you know human emotion just
for you to to get upset like that I mean
each
every one of us goes through that I know
I've been through it myself personally
but I just want to do my part to try to
help keep the community to be good and
just have people like we can constantly
reach back and forth to and stuff I want
people to be like wow this is what
coding is really like this is like my
job sucks even if I think I can't do
this it's worth me trying to do it
because the people are just wonderful
human beings exactly yeah another that's
the same thing that when I came in here
man I came in here come by out man and
that's why I was like deal of day I was
like man you know shuttle traversing
media for showing love and you know he's
killing it right now he's dead he killed
it with that a video where he was
roasting code babes dude oh I haven't
even seen it yet ugh dude you gotta go
see it was hilarious oh you gotta watch
but you guys know Michael Thomas yeah
yeah English guy he's he's got about the
same amount of subscribers he he came
through my page and just dropped me a
comment like what's up and I got a sub
around the same time so I'm assuming it
was him and just you know his video
start out the same thing a journey
channel and so as to see someone that
got those like soap they just you know
all those subs come in on my channel and
throw some love and just say some nice
things I get it meant a lot to me so you
know I mean it definitely feels good
because I mean that's how it should be
you know what I mean like if I find I
thought it's like the real casted arrow
right
I found his channel I don't have to go
and and show love to him but his channel
is good why wouldn't I show love
you know what I mean or the real tough
candy
how Channel is literally like
one of the best I think out of everybody
because these videos we're not here
 giving no life hacks
we're not giving some crazy are you
setting out bro comedy with real-life
 with real opinions from her and
then she goes in and edits every
in a way where it keeps you engaged
where her content I'm like in her why
wouldn't I show them love you know what
I mean like those channels or channels
that everybody should show love because
those are the channels that make people
come back to YouTube and what people are
so dumb that they don't understand that
when people come back I know there's a
lot of people who come to my channel
right and even if they're not 100% into
coding I know I'm making the the coding
community bigger because I'm bringing in
people that would now be watching a guy
doing a tutorial on YouTube they're not
gonna be watching a guy talking hey guy
this is the most technical shade of
 world they're not gonna watch
that right so I'm bringing in a
different audience than now because I'm
introducing them to to coding now
they're gonna jump into their channels
because their Channel show on my related
check on my relative use right so now
they're watching Gary channels
and but they don't understand that if
I'm bringing in something new or the
real tough candy is bringing something
new that's Oh are we still live on his
channel I think so if we are I just want
to say real tough Candy's channels that
 though like you know what I mean I
guess it's no longer like three people
in the game which was dev tips
he like the computer guy and what was
the other one Denis Boston those were
like the top three yeah right so I think
candy the best female developer youtuber
that I've seen and uh my second place
for a female channel on this would be
Bruce Barry hurt her a newsletter man
it's got all kinds of good on it
like yeah no she definitely just like
like and I really want to see I want to
see more female programmers on YouTube
really
I went together I want to get her in
here like I want to pick our brain get
her loose you know get the little sauce
because I know she's saucy I know she
got that sauce you know I'm that I'll
Nev work that for you did I talk to her
a lot so I'll make it happen
get in here like she she's from
the Caribbean - she got that sauce you
know what I mean like there's a couple
of people here who I think and I'm not
I'm not putting it out there a
matter of fact I'm putting it
out there I feel after I came out more
people are coming in more people are
coming in with real channels real
personalities real cool content
after I came out in December a
lot of the people that were there before
they were not doing all this that
I'm doing or doing anything similar to
what I was doing if you look it up but
that's great because now there's like
 real people it's like I'm
excited to see something that shows up
on my related videos I didn't want to
see elide the computer guy next
to my video cuz I'm like this guy has
nothing to do with my you know what
I mean like we bro you you might not
know this but she sent me a link to her
bank app she she got some vocals where
she can sing and she can produce some
some nice tracks - I was surprised we
gonna have to get her in you do
something send me a link Joseph we gotta
I gotta check it out she said that uh
she could spit some bars so I was
wanting to see that too so I went to go
hear her spit some bars she was singing
I was like oh not bad not bad
but yeah she's and she's a veteran too
she was in the Air Force and so you know
well you know love man
so that's I can't do the shame see you
later Joe
by live chat chit chit chit chit I guess
this is not working oh no man yeah I
think
you
you
against Joe's out of here
