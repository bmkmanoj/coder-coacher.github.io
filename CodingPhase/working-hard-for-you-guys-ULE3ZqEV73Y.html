mad because regular dude just came in
and got in the game just dumped it from
the three-point line then that's on you
you know what I mean like it's not my
fault that I'm popular here it's not my
fault that people like me it's always
been like that my whole life everybody
likes me I'm cool with everybody I'm
just that type of person you know but at
the same time is it's not my fault it's
the swag is the sauces you know it's
like you get what I'm saying like we
here you know it's like it's cool cuz
it's like nobody does this like this
there's nobody in this game especially
and web developer who's somebody like me
you know like somebody with the swag the
sauce and just it's just nobody's out
here like that you gotta say it so we
doing something different that's why I
wanted to bring it to the table
I wanted to bring it you know that New
York swag and New York feeling you know
the the raw the realness you know it's
like somebody was sending me I forgot
was this guy's name
I'm I was telling me he's like man you
gave me he's like he's like oh not
saying I all had but he's like he's a
guy from like the 80s like man you
remind me of like dice dice the
community like just the rawness of like
New York is like it gives you that
feeling is like you know what
if I'm that cool you know cuz sometimes
like you know this a lobby as the solana
people who are very PC you know they try
to you know you can't say anything on
the internet no more
somebody's gonna question you somebody's
gonna hate on you somebody's gonna be
all you wrong
oh I'm smarter than you oh I do this and
that or I like this you know sky's the
limit for those people like dangers here
for that you know
me I'm just here to help people out you
know I have my website everybody knows
that pretty much when I first came in
here I have no website I wasn't planning
or selling anything I wasn't planning on
or creating courses like I wanted to
actually become a teacher you know teach
web development but at the end of the
day after doing the research and all
that stuff on man I don't want to go
back to school to get a masters to go
teach out of college I got rather just
come in and just create my videos create
the content that I want to create share
it with the people people that care
about you know people that just enjoy it
great you know it's like I wasn't gonna
go the long road of like man now I kind
of go in and freaking go get my masters
and computer science to go to a college
or go to like a high school and teach
you know freaking programming and what
the fellow mean like I love this you
know what I mean like I'm here because I
love this you know I'm not doing this
because hey I'm trying to come a million
if I wanted to become a millionaire I
will be charging 200 300 dollars per
course or some crazy numbers like that
you guys know what I'm talking about but
that's not what I'm here for you know
I'm just here like okay cool was like
the minimum that we need to to be
comfortable you gotta say what's the
minimum to be comfortable be able to
give as many people the content it's
really for me it's a thing about how can
I guess many people as I can't to watch
me and watch my content and enjoy you
know what I mean like instead of saying
hey man I could literally charge five
people a thousand dollars and I put on a
webinar give them all of my courses and
now hey five people per month I'm good
people do that you know what I mean they
come in they try to
sign up ten people you know that's
$10,000 great cool but that's not really
what I'm here for like why would I care
by just giving it to ten people that's
dumb like I want everybody to just learn
from my mistakes learn from the things
that I've done good you know everything
that I tell you guys is from you know
real life experience it's like I'm
coming in from somebody who was
self-taught you know I tried everything
out there where from Co school.com team
treehouse I did a coke Adam II I did a
freak okay you know ya know half a bar
free coke a freak oh camp it was great
for practice but none of this website's
was teaching me how to build room
websites like you know what I mean like
yeah I could come in and you know change
the background of a Dave well how do I
put all of this stuff together you know
if somebody don't come in and tell you
how to do it you know you don't really
learn it you know so that's the beauty
of unity for me when I found unity I was
like man this is amazing yes there's a
lot of BS courses yes cuz anybody can
come in they don't vet they don't vet
people don't know it's like hey hey you
freakin you're from you know Bangladesh
and you got a microphone you could do
slides great here you go even though
nobody can't stand you or even though
nobody you know what I mean like nobody
understand what this person saying or
you know get to follow their course like
they don't care they're like the lot of
true but then then you find you know the
people that I really care about this you
got the cold steel's you got the
stiffened grinder you got myself you
know now part of the game you know what
I really like just the other day people
