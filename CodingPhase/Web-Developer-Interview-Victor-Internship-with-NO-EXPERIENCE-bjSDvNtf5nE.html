would up what other good how's life man
good good I I work on this week is my
fourth week in my internship so that's
pretty cool dope okay I told stack look
so we're gonna start it like this first
of all we gonna we know your name is
Victor where exactly you found like what
state was city I'm from Puerto Rico but
I live in Orlando Florida a poor Rico
that's what's that yeah yeah it's
poppin' house the scene over there in
Orlando so far it's cool I've got a UCF
some bunch of college stuff to do okay
so you telling me you got an internship
now yeah I started teaching myself in
you to me and then like one week I went
on Google just to see what the job
market was out like and I saw this like
internship like position we're like I
read through their thing and mostly they
were like looking for the individual the
way I'm really looking for like good
knowledge so I was like they were like
all right a cover letter and tell us
about yourself and I was like I can do
that so like I did it and then I went on
the interview they offered me an
interview like a three hours I've
written my cover letter and I was like
well I'll go see what it's like see what
they asked me and I'm not really
expecting to get it but I leave the
interview would be good like a good
opportunity and I went in like two weeks
later they were like yeah you're right I
was like oh I mean people you hear that
you know sometimes sometimes people
think like man it's so hard to get in
the industry get that first opportunity
is like bro that's because you never
even try you never even send the email
you never even gave his chance to even
go out there and say hey man I want to
become a developer right so if you don't
take the first step it's like nobody can
hold your hand and bring you into the
industry you know what I'm saying it's
like even like back in the days when
people will tell you hey man you know
there's no jobs out here is like when
was the last time you applied you get
what I'm saying
you know I want to point out I didn't
lie on my resume or anything I didn't
say I was a pro when I'm actually not I
told him like I think the end they told
me like aptitude after like two weeks
they told me what held me was that I
went on the interview I didn't lie to
them and I was like hey listen I'm very
passionate about this and I like brought
out like my notebook on like all the
notes I've been writing down for my
courses and I led to know where I was at
and they were like what really what we
liked about you was the potential that
we saw in you because we see that you're
actually like working towards us so I
was like yeah and like the first few
like weeks has all been like straight
straight up like boostrap stuff so but
this week we're gonna start working with
MySQL PHP all that all that good stuff
yeah that's cool man III think like you
know like I said people just gotta go
out there and the opportunity is a dear
man if you want it you're gonna get it
you got a saying so what exactly do you
do now I mean what type of industry is
it that your company is in well it's a
small startup company but um well I
wouldn't really call it small cuz like
our biggest clients like the New England
Patriots so we work with a lot of sports
and psychologies that we make we use
psychology our CTOs are really big on
psychology so he use a lot of psychology
to develop the assessment test that all
the NFL players when they go like and
during the draft they all take this
stuff
oh no give me what yo yo what's up you -
I'm gonna take Joe's place for here real
quick yeah you know what so dude yeah
going back to your question no I don't I
don't even have a portfolio like I don't
have projects I did I did
cold steel's bootcamp all the way up to
the node.js part and that's where I
stopped because that's when I got hired
with my job and then my job told me I
needed PHP and SQL so I like cold still
hasn't had that is so I stopped that and
my my job pays for coats cool calm and I
do that but I like the unit you to me
sow and I'm like I like you to me better
and they actually pay for like courses I
want
so that's kind of yeah that cold steel
web developed a new camp if anybody's
like struggling with HTML or CSS or
JavaScript that's probably the best
course like even I knew a little bit of
HTML before took the course but I took
that course and that's pretty much what
got me like on the road to web
development that still still no of
course yeah so definitely want to say
like and the imposter syndrome really is
real like it hit hard like the first two
days and I was like what did I get
myself into but it also helps I'm not
the only intern there's four other guys
and they're all going through the same
thing so like for the first assignment
no one really knew what we were doing
but if he--if like the one guy found out
just like what this little code did and
I realized I had the same thing on my
page I'm like oh thanks for that and
then like if I found out something that
I would tell that and it's all it's all
team work it works the best thing right
for those go sounds like you have a
pretty good team they're both you have a
team of four or how big is your team
size I like to to expect five interns in
total and there's four full-time web
developers well okay yeah so what my
four guys oh I don't have a plane crash
or look like some crazy thing happened
were the house cooking there was like a
huge explosion or like I don't know what
the hell happened I'll tell you guys
tomorrow when we find out on the news Oh
next time on coding freeze I'm outta
here you guys I'm sorry
yeah it's cool man I mean you was you
already in here so you know you say
yeah I'm getting here um but yeah now
that's good so I mean what you guys were
talking about filming in so like that
I know exactly uh victory I just asked
him how big his team was at work just I
had a question you know how did you get
an internship like when you spoke to the
employer the team was it a three-month
contract was it six months was a 12
months the duration right now is six
months so my last day would be August
31st if they don't decide to like extend
me but basically I just went on Google
like I said found the post I applied and
funny enough like they wanted a cool
like cover letter basically the company
works in sports so like I I'm really
passionate about sports as you can see
like I'm all about sports so like I
broke my cover letter sharing like
experiences in the past like for example
like I told him I related how I taught
myself how to play hockey ice hockey in
like two months to my ability to learn
code the same way I was like this is
what I did when I really wanted to play
hockey and now I play hockey every
Sunday night and this is how I could
like bring the same kind of focus and
motivation to coding and do the same for
this job you know and then but basically
for the interview they asked me three
questions like three live questions it
wasn't any whiteboard stuff it was on
the online ID like shift at it and um so
they asked me first thing was like very
simple like I was really surprised I was
like scared I was like I'm not gonna get
any questions right and I went in there
and the first question is hey can you do
this table and format it and I was like
are you kidding me like T had tbody TR I
was like my god
second question the second question I
know they had the biggest bus loop
question on JavaScript which was like if
print all the numbers like 1 through 100
if it's even print fish if there's odd
create print buzz all that stuff it was
pretty easy then the third one was like
PHP stuff and I wanna I didn't really do
it well cuz I hadn't even seen page
where I went today but but then the
whole interview transition to like again
me showing them like all my notes on the
notebook they liked that a lot
they also interview no I did not I
brought the notes of all the udemy
courses stuff that I was like taking so
like if I saw a video on like loops
JavaScript I wrote down every single
example and like everything like I had a
bunch of like core stuff now that
someone that's definitely smart and then
what they also liked was that I went on
their website and I drew mock-ups of
things I would change on their website
kind of like ideas cuz on my cover
letter I told him I was more like
front-end visual oriented kind of guy
like I like a whole bunch of like art
stuff so I actually like drop like
mock-ups of like how I would do the page
different and they all like laughed or
like they all smiled and looked at each
other and they pulled up the website
they were actually like working on and
like what I drew up they were already
doing it so like nice they were like so
yeah you have good ideas in the meeting
and I was like you can yeah I like
knowledge but I show them how I could
overcome that well what exactly I mean
you going to school right now what
exactly is your all your background me
what you what you're studying right now
I'm an IT I'm about to graduate and the
BA associates which one are just
bachelors yeah nice for you that's cool
that's cool
and um so what makes you want to jump
into web development I mean there's a
lot of other fields that you could try
yeah I don't really I study I teach is
because like you know you can't go wrong
with computers I kind of shied away from
computer science just because I didn't
want to do the math but it sounds kind
of dumb now that I think about it I
should have just done it but basically
saying my story I mean that's the main
reason why I didn't want to do computer
science I got to calculus - and NASA
okay cool that's exactly right - I say
okay that's good enough for me I'll give
myself clap
back in I don't need to be doing this so
uh yeah but even at that man the degree
that you you already have you're good
you know nobody anything that's
technical IT it's always gonna look good
on your resume and then on top of that
plus the online training and the fact
that you already have you know
determination to be in the industry like
you're gonna be fine you know so yeah
now some of some I did the HTML CSS
Facebook markup one that one really
helped with like all the front-end stuff
I understand what flex boxes all right
now because I encountered that problem
like my job not like oh this is what
clear fixes like I didn't even know what
overflow was yeah you know that's that's
the thing where is like I tell people
all the time like hey man there's
certain things that you need to know
from like just the core CSS there's a
lot of good things that are popping up
nowadays in features that's gonna see
they're gonna come out in the future you
know later that's great flex boxes but
you still gotta master what CSS is
because you never know what company
you're gonna go to if you go in and say
I'm only studying the most modern and
the latest features and CSS and then the
day you go to a company where they have
some legacy code and they're not using
CSS grid or they're using something like
bootstrapping you don't understand how
regular CSS works then you're gonna be
like oh now I gotta go on youtube you
know what I'm saying you should have
been prepared actually my job does Aemon
they try to use as classes like custom
CSS as possible they try to stick with
all the bootstrap stuff and if you have
to change like add a little bit of
padding or margin that you can do that
in line that's how do you want you to do
it like it like you said in all the time
like each company does their own thing
you know exactly it everywhere you're
gonna go to write everybody has their
own workflow right there's people that
were there before you and they say head
this works for us we don't need to
change it you gotta say even though
there's more modern ways of doing things
as SCSS you know you can use less poll
CSS whatever people are using online and
say hey this is the latest thing is like
you go to the company they're gonna
train you on how they do it no matter
what my company doesn't even use
frameworks oh yeah use framework at all
yeah a lot of companies don't use
frameworks is it something that's cool
it's like okay it's for your own
knowledge of like okay if I bump into a
company that does use this framework or
the next job that I go to they want me
to use angular or react then I know it
but there's a lot of companies that just
don't need it even at that like you
might go to a company that just uses
WordPress and they don't even want you
to go and develop a website from scratch
they're like hey man just use this theme
that we already have and just customize
it a little bit and that's it you know
so definitely every everybody has their
own different workflow now you say the
majority of jobs are like that or would
you say majority of parts use frameworks
in the industry web development
specifically oh that what tell me again
you to do most of the jobs use
frameworks nowadays or do most of the
jobs just use like WordPress CMS type
stuff well most of the jobs depending on
the company and depending on the
industry right depending on the industry
you're in if you're in a company where
they do ecommerce then they do
everything from scratch so they might
use something like laravel and they
might say hey we're gonna use reacting
angular as the frameworks or whatever
they want to use right now if you're in
a in a company where like let's say when
I used to work for creative circle right
we do some work for a universal music
group right Universal Music Group all
their websites are done in WordPress you
would think like oh my god Taylor Swift
com is like they do that with a
wordpress you know is like those
websites what they care about it's like
hey we want to release a website we want
to be able to show the tour dates and
this this and that like simple things
there's no real like logic behind it
it's more like the presentation and
being able to give access to people who
are not technical or access to the
sigh so that's why WordPress is so
popular for people that don't know how
to code is like okay everything is there
for me all I have to do is just add
things in there like there's a title
this the content area I could upload my
images and now the developer already set
up the theme that when I uploaded it
puts the images down here so a content
editor doesn't have to know anything
HTML there's no that's why I did my job
actually has one like that he's a sports
journalist he writes like articles for
our page and he does it all in WordPress
but he doesn't do what us like full yes
that people like he just he's in his own
little corner just like typing away its
articles but yeah content editors when
you are content editor uh you know for
people who was out there and looking at
this video if you're coming with a
English English major and you say man I
wanna now I want to become a wordpress
developer or I want to become a
developer what I'm called a very easy
way to get into the industry is to
become a content editor right and
literally grow within that company like
you could work on companies are a huge
out there and you wouldn't be like man
how do I get a job at Nike is that hey
you got an English major right and then
from there you want to do web
development apply for content editor all
right you're gonna get in the industry
gain the company and then from there you
can switch up on the teams and say hey I
actually know how to code now you switch
up you get what I'm saying you got to
know how to play the game but oh well
yeah also WordPress is also good for
situations where let's say you have to
make a website for someone but you don't
want to always be there to change like
you know one word or change a picture so
you hook them up with a wordpress site
and then you say hey you here's how you
log into it if you want to change things
around that's all good yeah I think
that's more where WordPress oh yeah
exactly
so as far as like now your career that
you see yourself focusing on front end
focusing on the back end what do you
wanna focus on front anymore okay all
right our first assignment that they
gave us like our first real assignments
were like the first three assignments
were the
Able's like old pages and they told us
converted to the new bootstrap that was
pretty much it but the second assignment
that the real first assignment of the
gave us was on we had to design this
email builder template that the admins
use so let's say they want to create I'm
sorry I'm sorry I'm looking at the
partners coming through
I'm just I'm making sure like my house
don't gonna fire some crazy
oh good I might get here
sorry so it's yeah like I was saying
like our first assignment was basically
it's basically uh
they gave us this page that the admins
used to create the new emails that they
want to send out to like let's say
someone subscribed it'd be like welcome
to the right profile and inserts the
name of whoever subscribe you know like
build a template for emails also they
want text messaging in that too so they
totally each of us interns like oh come
in on Tuesday we're like five to ten
mock-ups of like how would you like this
sign the front end like draw it out like
come out what ideas we all pitched our
ideas in the meetings and I like at my
five ideas they picked the top the one
that everybody considered the top one
and they did the same thing for each
other intern and then they were like
okay now you have a week to go code the
front-end for it and then we had that
week and we presented that and now we're
waiting to see which intern kind of like
one there's no winning it's just whoever
has the best front looking page that's
the one we're all gonna go in and start
building the backend stuff for that page
so we're actually building like a real
page that's gonna be used later on but
it's that's pretty exciting but out of
all the interns they told me they were
like yeah you're definitely more like
front-end oriented cuz I knew those
other guy that had all his buttons were
working because he knows JavaScript just
like that like it's easy friend mine
like mine looks like what I had
different everybody did the same
drop-down thing you know like nah
I did like accordions and they had like
different animations and stuff and they
were like we like that so I don't know
they're gonna pick mine I'll find out
tomorrow I think I hope so that's great
I think I think that's something great
that that company is doing because they
really like you know helping you guys
out and at the same time as like letting
you guys be yourself how many developers
are they as far as like senior mid-level
developers whole time they have four but
our CTO in our head of development also
code so there's like five developers
yeah and they don't really like they try
to like they don't go ahead and just
give you the answer they try to like
guide you towards where you can find the
answer you know so it's not like hey I
need to know this and then they just
give it to you no it's not like that but
you know but they don't leave you like
get lost
anyways they guide you it's nice now
that's cool and as far as like you see
yourself in that company long term do
you like the people you work in River I
think that's very important to see if
you like working with the people there
you know ya know I love it I had a pizza
job place up until today today was my
last day and I was like man I don't
think there's any more in the over they
they abused you so much like this is
crazy
there's a victor don't forget to salami
more like like like last night I was on
the dish pit like doing dishes I'm like
man this thank god is my last time
I was supposed to be like from five to
ten and this other guy was supposed to
come in at 10 p.m. and take over to like
3 P 3 a.m. or something like that but
then that that guy never showed up so I
got stuck like another extra hour and a
half just like busting my ass cuz they
were like oh can you like leave this
place a little bit cleaner before you
leave and I was like man this I'm
already working overtime
 guys I think that this magical
place I'd bring something and then just
magically guess watch and they're like
come in they're like you know can I get
this on the fly which basically means
like doing it that's priority and I'm
like bro don't you see like all this
other I have to do well you can
watch it so it takes like five seconds
yeah you know they don't help hey I hope
