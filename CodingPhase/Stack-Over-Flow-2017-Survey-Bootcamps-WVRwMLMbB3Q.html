happy as because you know what I'm
not wrong when I tell you a lot of boot
camps are and why do I say they
 not because you can't learn
anything there but the numbers are
completely inflating and when I say that
right what do I mean I'm talking about
for new developers like you guys you
guys are brand new developers right
let's say an example you are now Johnny
Schmo from you know from pepboys
you Johnny schmoe who works out as a
mechanic and pretty much you're like hey
I want to become a developer and I'm
gonna go to this boot camp and I'm just
gonna learn everything that I can in
that boot camp because they say ninety
percent of the graduate they end up with
a job in the you know the industry in
three months or less right which is
completely because the numbers
already came out and I've been saying
this for a while it's like hold on I got
this I gotta earn a piece of paper
because I like to be doing out the
numbers man men lie women lie numbers
don't lie man and this is just from
people that they did it on on the survey
basically right so i think is like
forty-five percent of people that have
been in boot camps were already
developers meaning they already have
been in jobs already they
already were you know they could have
been a c-sharp developer they could have
been a Java developer and then now that
decided to go to an oj s boot camp or
Ruby on Rails boot camp and then now
well you know for a book em say like oh
yeah you know 99 percent of our
students they graduate and
become you know this amazing developer
but but they don't tell you is
the history of those students
met a lot of them already were
great developers right or they were
already knowing a lot of different
technologies so when you overhear you
say hey man all my students they
graduate they get a hundred thousand you
know soon as they come out and it's like
wait what something don't let up because
most junior developers they're barely
getting fifty thousand sixty thousand
dollars unless you're living like in San
Francisco whereas I completely inflated
because the rent is too
expensive so they have to pay you
something decent for you to be able to
live
they're all right but they don't want to
tell you that they don't want to tell
you the background or shake so now
everybody is an old man i'm gonna go to
a boot camp I'm gonna get myself in debt
because ninety nine percent other people
they graduate and they get jobs soon as
they come out and it's like no it's like
eight percent of them only get jobs when
they come up in another probably like
another eight percent get a job before
they finish the program now mind you
remember this there's so many students
in boot camps that were already coding
before that I like I don't care about
those guys I care about the
people that don't know anything because
it's like when you go to a boot camp in
your head you're like oh man I'm gonna
go to a place where you know everybody's
like a branding student I keep
hearing stories from people that send me
messages they're like ill man everybody
was so be on advanced compared
to me that it was more like why are they
here they're not here to learn
they already know this you know
what I mean and this happens to
people all the time they go to
this boot camps a lot of people
already have degrees also too if
you're a computer science major what the
 are you doing inside of a boot camp
like I want you guys to make this
 video trend I want this video to
go out there and just let people
know man like why if you have a computer
science degree why instead of you
 teaching yourself this why
are you going to a boot camp getting
yourself in debt for twenty thousand
dollars all right that's all I'm
saying man like don't believe this
numbers man they're completely
and it sucks because there's
people that go in there and take
my OEM soon as I graduate I'm gonna
 get this $100,000 plus get
myself in there but I could pay it off
in four months I'll go pay
twenty thousand dollars and four months
over two months nobody that's not what's
going to happen to you what's going to
happen to you most likely more than half
other people in the boot camps
it's gonna take them to three months to
find a job after the boot camp which is
the same shape of you teaching
yourself to code in your house from
online courses and there's another thing
to bring it out to numbers I'm
bringing out the numbers out of here
right I wrote it down so people don't
think that I'm looking at a
blank paper but yo ninety ninety percent
of developers are self-taught right what
that means it means that you're
constantly teaching yourself and you're
constantly learning right most likely
probably like a good forty percent of
people don't have a degree don't have no
background in computer science or
programming so they're completely
self-taught so you as a brand new
developer somebody who wants to get into
the industry why are you listening to
other people that they taught themselves
how you go to this boot camp why
then go to a boot camp didn't go
to learn that they taught
themselves boot camps are not a
shortcut boot camps is not a special
system that is going to get you jobs
right away it doesn't work like that
guys it's the time that you put in and
basically you finding the right
resources and that's what my website and
my channel is all about it's about
giving out the right resources because
it takes time and the last thing you
want to do is learning that you
don't need for a real job or taking too
long just figuring out which one's the
best framework which one is the best
programming language you know how many
people waste time just trying to figure
out which language should they learn a
lot of people waste so much time
just trying to learn
 language and they're like oh
yeah I'm just gonna figure it out i'm
gonna go online and every YouTube video
tells them something completely
different they go to stack overflow
Towson completely different it's more
about just putting at the time guys just
 learn you know what I mean and
it's just crazy man I'm just so
happy I got this in my hand man because
this just validates everything that
I've been saying every single thing that
I've been saying it just pretty much
just said yeah you're right Joe now this
 proof and it's not stack
overflow the survey right it's not every
single developer in the world but it's a
very large percentage a very large
percentage of developers filled out that
because everybody goes to sparking stack
overflow you know what I mean what are
whatever up tay tay tay whatever
elections what up guys for people who
are watching this video because this
thing is live right now but at the same
time it's going to be recorded and
everything is going to show up in my
channel at this moment I'm gonna start
talking to my my viewers the people who
are viewing the channel right now but
just to be honest with you guys man for
one last time don't go to a bootcamp
thinking that you're gonna come out of
there as an amazing developer like deja
 tell you don't go to a book am
thinking that you're gonna go in there
and you gotta get higher as soon as you
come out it's a very low percentage of
people that that happens to in a
high percentage of those people already
knew they already know how to code
they're already had jobs as developers
so a reality it's not fair for you to
put yourself and basically think in your
head like oh I'm on the same level as
this other person who just got a job
right after boot camp is I oh I'm on the
same love was him no you're not because
you just started to coat this person has
years there's people who are
lying and keep saying oh I just started
to learn how to code because it's really
cool to feel feel good when people look
at you like oh my god this guy is a
prodigy this guy is like the smartest
guy he learned how to code in two months
it is really it feels good just somebody
to continue and be like oh my god and
put this little handle over your hand
black this person here he learned how to
code in two months it feels great but
the background behind it it's not gonna
feel great to be like hey I know how to
 cold and I've been donation for
five years and then I went to a boot
camp which the boot camp taught me how
to negotiate salary and pretty much you
know how to answer questions on the
interview if you know how to
code you can look that up on by
yourself why do you need to go to a boot
camp you don't need to go to a boot camp
for the book ever to teach you how to
 negotiate a salary and you don't
need a boot camp to go to basically to
just go over there and be like
hey validate me as a developer because
i've been working in my house who I
already have a job and I want to be
known as a no developer no Jas developer
or ruby on rails developer so I went to
a boot camp that's what I'm saying man
alright guys so let me talk to you guys
what up what I what I would up yeah man
dudes is I go any hot girls in here come
on man you thirst bucket right now your
thirst bucket boy stop being so thirsty
man this this channel is now about
that man if you're looking for thoughts
you gotta go somewhere else like
straight up all right oh yeah so you
went to a dinette interview it was mad
dry yeah man dotnet it's like
it's like for those people that have
like I don't know man
don't even know how to explain it it's
more corporate than anything man if
you're like a real a individual whole
who pretty much likes design likes to
create cool shade like to be ahead of of
the curves like man is not the place for
you
yannick Academy is definitely good
Alexis like all you gotta do coke Adam e
if you look at my descriptions on all my
videos I have the courses that I took
you know the courses that made me into a
developer and the reason why I always
tell people just take those
courses man it's because you're gonna
save yourself the time of looking online
going through teen treehouse going to
coke Adam e going through our youtube
videos all of that stuff takes time
takes time away from you from learning
how to code if you take those courses
man you've got man they're like ten
dollars just get one at a time nobody's
telling people hey by all five courses
because you're not going to be able to
finish off our courses in one day just
take one course at a time and you're
gonna be sweet you know what I mean your
ad man good to see you in here man good
to see you in a chat
word dudes is trying to highlight girls
over here this this one girls don't even
want to come in here no more they like
that man if you cute if you kill when
you come into a spot where there's a
whole bunch of guys guys is already
thirsty man control yourself guys man
god damn all right oh let me see what
technologies do you use on my daily
basis uh right now in the company that I
work for I pretty much work with PHP
Lara laravel the framework and a lot of
JavaScript and a lot of react that's
what I work on but in my free time I'm
working on crystal Ling I'm working on
what else I'm working on I'm working on
know Jas and yeah that's what I'm
working on my free time yeah man you
already know I'm here to UM fury I'm
here for you guys man I mean for you
guys to just pretty much I just want to
be like the inside of voice of like of
you guys and just tell you guys like hey
man give you the resources to get you
going fast like I don't want people to
be like hey it took me a year to to
learn web development by myself it
doesn't take that long it takes way less
than that it takes in reality to be
honest with you guys it takes about a
month and a half two months to learn
everything that you need to start making
websites right and then from there
everything else like you know
specializing in javascript or you know
learning the more oh you know deep end
things like object-oriented that's gonna
take your time there is no no easy easy
way out of it there is no course that's
gonna teach you things and you're gonna
learn it right away like object-oriented
programming like it's just gonna take
time a few building websites
and as you build more websites you're
going to learn new skills but web
development itself it takes a month and
a half to learn then from there you
golden Ruby on Rails is still a good
option yes I still mess around with way
with Ruby I love Ruby doesn't you know
that's my baby but right now i'm working
with crystal leg crystal laying is
pretty much the successor of Ruby Ruby
the syntax basically the way how the
code looks it's amazing you could read
it is it's really great but to be honest
with you guys ruby is not that fast it's
not as fast as nodejs so i'm using i'm
using crystal lang which is like
eight times faster than no Jay has
everybody talking about node but crystal
is eight times faster than that and it
has the same syntax as as ruby on rails
on Ruby what keeps me motivated are you
guys you guys keep me motivated when I
come here I seen you people like like
yourself Alexis I haven't seen you in a
chat before or in the comments but it's
really good to see you here because then
it shows me that you're a new subscriber
so that keeps me more month or motivated
and basically come in here even on my
lunch break come outside with something
new and be like hey record this video
get this out here and show love to
you guys same way how you guys show me
love you know what i mean so that's what
really motivates me you know
yeah javascript but I use vanilla
JavaScript and react you know what I
mean I don't know man I think if you
don't learn CSS in one month I'll be
honest with you you didn't have the
right resources CSS you can learn it
pretty much in one week and I'm talking
about if you put in three hours a day
for one week on CSS if you didn't get is
because you don't have the right
resources is a you have to understand if
somebody not everybody knows nothing of
it I'm gonna break it down like this
going back there's a lot of people that
know how to program there's a lot of
people that know how to make websites
but now everybody knows how to teach it
now everybody knows how to give you the
right resources because to become a very
good teacher you have to have a certain
skill to break down things into a way
that somebody that has never seen it
before can learn it easily most
developers when they teach you something
they teach it to you as if you're
supposed to know these things it's like
people they start teaching JavaScript
they're like oh there's a variable and
then they tell you there's a variable
but they don't explain to you that what
the hell is a variable so if you never
seen a variable you like what the
is a variable what the is this
what the is a F statement what the
hell is a loop the person's teaching it
to you as Effie you already know these
things they don't break it down to you
whereas I a a variable is just something
imagine a box cuz you gotta break it
down real dummy real dummy status that's
how I like to to learn how to code if I
can break it down to me like I'm
stupid a variable is a box that you
could put anything in it you can put
strings numbers whatever you want to put
inside that variable
in that box you could give it a name so
you cook scored that variable high
school you can call that variable high
school and inside that variable you
could put in a string which is just
words you could put in a string that
says your high school's name if you
don't understand that if you don't
understand what a variable is from that
day I don't know what to tell you then
this is not for you I'm sorry but that's
how I think people should teach in a
real like real stupid way which people
every developers gonna write up man this
is also done but if you're Johnny
Schmo from the mechanic from pepboys if
you've never seen programming if you
never seen code when somebody's explain
it to you as if you're already like you
should post in all these things you
don't get to learn that quick you know
what I mean like you have to be
able to teach it in a real easy way
where the person that's never seen it
before it's gonna be able to understand
it you know Johnny's more from
pep boys man you know what I mean like
like that's how it is that's how people
get to learn because that's why I don't
like boot camps because in boot camps
that tell people that hate ninety-nine
percent of the people is going to get
hired the reality of things is going to
take more time than just three months
for a lot of people to get hired and
then from that forty-five percent of
those people they already knew how to
code so when you go to this courses in
this boot camps they're teaching it to
you as if you already have knowledge of
 programming if you even if you
have to take the prep test they give you
a prep test where it's like okay they're
giving you a practice we're supposedly
you already supposed to know a lot of
the fundamentals of programming which
makes me think like why the if I
already know the
fundamentals of programming why am I
going to a boot camp I already
know what the imma go to a boot
camp so you could teach me kno jes and
Express I don't know am I crazy to think
like that like no Jas and Ruby on Rails
and all these other frameworks they're
not worth twenty thousand dollars
exactly the capitalizing on the trend
right now so it's like you know what I
mean but yeah man I gotta get my lunch
guys you know it's really good to see
you here Alexis Martin and gooey and my
boy Cyrus sound who's you know everybody
say what up to Cyrus sound this kid's
been around since i had only like 50
subscribers man oh it's good to see you
here Tommy Lang is good to see you Matt
always it's good to see you a meal is
good to see you Vlad it's good to see
you Alan is good to see you Freddy it's
good to see your deal is good to see you
syro is good to see you Alex you know
what I mean like it's good to see you SI
eos is good to see you my boy king prod
you know we gotta work something man
King probably gotta holla at me man
yeah exactly like I'll be honest guys if
you really if you really enjoy enjoy
school and you really enjoy learning
this stuff I'll be one hundred percent
honest with you guys if you want to take
the route of going somewhere to learn
how to code get a bachelors in computer
science if that's something that you
really want to do but let's say if
you're basically somebody who was like
you know Johnny's moan from pep
boys the mechanic and you have kids and
you have a family and you have rent and
you have a lot of that you gotta
pay learn the on your own if you're
a brand new kid 17 years old and your
parents is bothering you and like yo man
you gotta go to school go to school at
least for an associate's but I tell me
like 19 you're ready graduated
from your associates and you can
start working and you tell you your
parents I hey I got a degree
leave me the alone you know what I
mean like those are my advice that i'ma
give you guys you know it's good to see
everybody here definitely nice to meet
you too Alexis and yeah bro Tommy I go
hard man I'm trying to make this as
much as as I can just to make it real
make it something cool for everybody you
know what I mean alright guys I'll see
you later imma go to freakin lunch man
