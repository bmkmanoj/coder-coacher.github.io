going to break it down very easy or very
simple for you guys think about it like
this every tag has information Saturday
and the side of that tank you could put
different content it could be an image
it could be a URL which is the address
to an image ler address to another page
it can be multiple things it could just
be regular text right so let's look at
this this is the h1 tag which is the
biggest header out there right so let's
look at this we have the Open bracket
there from then we have the H 1 which is
the tag name then from then we have the
attribute name which is the class and
then it says equal to the value now the
value for this attribute is primary so
what we're basically saying is hey
letter name this h1 and we're going to
basically identify it by the class which
is equal to primary pronoun from that we
have a closing bracket then inside of it
we actually have to count it affected
conflict right so we say this header is
going to be a head array and therefore
name and salary we have to counter which
says example header and then from there
we have a closing tag now for you guys
you probably never seen this before or
you seen in but you don't understand
most HTML tags have a certain content
inside of them so we'll give you guys a
quick example so let's look at this
right click it and expect and look how
it actually works as you can see this is
a div this is just saying hey there's a
container right so we have the tag we
have to attribute here we have two
classes but then right here we have what
it says images as you can see that's a
container you see that space around it
and then inside of it is a content which
is just text with success images right
now this other situations where you
might see a image you're just different
image the information we actually put in
it inside of the attribute so these are
actually special occasions this doesn't
happen all the time there's only a few
tags that you basically put in the
information or the content that you want
inside of the attributes one thing that
you're going to notice is that most of
the time we're going to actually just
put content inside of an HTML tag like
here as you can see we have a div which
is a container and inside of a container
we have the anchor link which is this
image which is actually just a link as
you can see we hover on top of it if we
open link or new it's a good page but
inside of that anchor link tag this
actually an image this is actually a
good example for you guys to see how the
Dom tree actually works so let's let's
say an example you have HTML right
that's the HTML tag and inside of it is
a head and there's a body now inside of
the head there's a title there's a meta
and there's another letter now the body
you have h1 you have a paragraph and
then inside of a paragraph you got
actually alright which is just a link
then from there inside of the body you
still have an unordered list and inside
of that list you have every list item so
that's how exactly pages work now all
this does might seem like mumbo-jumbo
right now but soon as we start building
more pages you will understand it
because the best way to learn HTML is
just to actually start building a page
that's what we're doing next okay Kate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
