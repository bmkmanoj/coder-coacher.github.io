okay you boys back man so we still
talking about my diversity and I'm gonna
say the numbers right so the numbers
came in and basically this only 2.5
percent of developers who are actually
black and then 5% of developers are
Hispanics and then I think four point
nine percent are Asian meaning Chinese
Japanese you know Filipino now Southeast
Asians usually means Indians right
Indians Pakistanis Bangladesh
those guys are 8% and you know a lot of
people's gonna be like oh man like you
know it's the industry is very diverse
because there's you know it's a whole
bunch of Indians working and it's in the
field but it's like man Indians are not
black Indians are not Hispanics Indians
are not freakin Asians you know I mean
they are aging because they're in Asia
but they're not you know here in the US
we we really don't consider them like
you know like really huge minority so
when a lot of people be like hey man
we're we're very diverse we got you know
40 percent of our developers are Indians
and it's like man well what about the
black kids man what about the Spanish
kids man what about the you know a
little Chinese kid man
like what's up with dump me think why
they not in the industry and a lot of
times is you know we can't blame it and
all this all-white conspiracy white
people trying to put us down it's not is
not them because the industry is very
liberal everybody wants more people to
come into the industry they want more
women women are seven percent which is
hilarious to me because in my channel
women are seven percent I got seven
percent of women that come to my channel
and in real life been stuck out on
stackoverflow their stats came up that
seven percent too which is kind of crazy
you know when it comes to to the details
but you know I don't want to say that oh
my God we're being oppressed we're
they're not hiring us no it's not that
it's just people don't think that
there's like a solution there's a way to
get into the industry you know they
think there's like oh there's only
Indians and and white kids who do this
shit no man this this can't be done by
anybody this is not about what college
you want to what's your background this
is more like hey guys just fucking do it
just show what learn this thing I got
you know the best courses that you could
ever get from anybody there are my
description you can become a developer
is that simple you know at the same time
it's like you know you don't see this
and you don't see nobody pushing any of
the students you know like hey guys you
guys got a really go into math and
science and this and that like in public
schools they're they're bullshit you
know what I mean so there's a reason why
this more you know white students
worldwide more white Caucasian
developers because they're getting a
better education and a lot of times it's
not really their fault it's more of like
people have limitations in their
heads they're like oh I can't do this oh
this is for white people all this is
dissing that man y'all need to stop with
the limitation stop fucking putting
yourselves down and just like man right
now if you get yourself a certain
education and you're like a whole I'm
just gonna be a developer I'm gonna
learn this on my own I'm gonna bust my
ass you could become a developer
nobody's stopping you know what is this
like you know this is not the fucking
1950s in Alabama
this is fucking 2017 people are just not
going for it you know everybody's
talking about you know like I remember
high school people trying to play ball
they're trying to be a basketball player
baseball player football player but man
nobody was really telling us in general
like you know in school I don't remember
nobody telling us at all you know you
can start a computer science and you
could become very successful you know
what is telling you that you know what I
mean that's one of the main reasons why
I made this channel to show people like
hey I'm just a regular guy I'm just some
regular Spanish kid who's half black
half white you know and it's out here
fucking doing it you're just making it
happen I don't know I don't put
limitations on myself or if I want to I
could work in any company I want I could
make as much money as I want nobody
could stop me you know what I mean so I
think for 2017-2018 man that's my goal
man my goal is to bring up the diversity
rate up because there's no reason for us
to be you know black people would be 2%
that means that people's diving this is
not even a viable option for them this
is not even an option for them to even
become a developers in their head
they're not thinking hey I could become
a developer because nobody's promoting
that nobody's telling you that you know
yeah you see rappers getting money you
see hustlers getting money you see this
this and this but I think people just
gotta see that you make a really good
living I remember
being a high school man that was this
kid who was telling me he's like man I'm
gonna go to this school called apex
which is like mechanics and shit like
that he's a gay man they make $18 an
hour and like his eyes were like wide
open like $18 an hour's like fucking
great money and I'm like nah man in my
head I'm not trying to get $18 an hour
man you know why because I live in New
York City I look I look to the other
side I'm like man I see this white kids
man day they make him money man and I
don't know how they make him money but
they always had Starbucks they always
with a low laptop and they working and
I'm like man I have to make that money I
need to make that type of money where
you're just chilling and relaxing
you know what I mean so for me to even
think like becoming a mechanic or some
shit like that like that's not even an
option for me like you know what I mean
so that's how I want people to think -
it was like yeah we need mechanics we
need truck drivers how the other guy
said but at the same time man all this
shit is gonna be automated you know so
what's gonna happen to those people in
10-15 years there's not gonna be no jobs
for them so it's like right now is the
time to prepare people and be like hey
guys you can't become a developer you
can become successful and it's like the
industry is not stopping you it's
yourself you're stopping yourself from
getting into industry because everyone
that's in in basically programming
computer science web development
software engineering like everyone's
super cool they're not like I've never
met a racist I've met somebody who was
sort of a racist but he didn't have no
position he didn't have no power
he was just like another fucking
developer who was just a piece of shit
but he wasn't like the person that was
hiring you know what I mean so yeah
you're gonna bump it to racist people
wherever you use gold
the matter but at the end of the day
they're not the ones with power you know
they're not the ones that's hiring it's
freaking the owners the HR the freaking
head engineer at the company CTO like
those guys are the ones that are hiring
so there is no no limitations for you
there is no reason to just be to put
2.5% of developers to just be black or
5% to just be Hispanics like we just
gotta get the word out man and you know
like if for some other people they'll be
like oh yeah my company is very diverse
we have 40% of our Indians are you know
they're Indians and you know it's very
diverse it's like man you need to stop
with that don't tell me that bullshit
you know
yeah only limitations that we have is
the ones that we put on ourselves man
sky's the limit I feel like right now
even with everything that's going on
with the whole Trump and all this other
shit that's going on in the world and
you know fucking Nazis coming out of
nowhere man those fucking people they
don't have no power that's what's funny
like you know why those guys are mad in
you know middle America is because they
don't have no power it's kind of sad I
looked at that was a thing our article
that was I wish I would have saved it
there was an article where they were
talking about how you know in the 50s
like or white white workers who earned
so much more than you know just a
regular person a regular dude now I'm
not talking about professional I'm
talking about a regular Joe Schmo will
earn so much more money than a Hispanic
or a black person
right like a good 30 40 percent but shit
has gone down the fuck
right now that now pretty much like the
lower workers that are white they make
the same money that a lower worker less
black there are lower working the
Hispanic they make the same amount so
there's no there's no difference so
those guys are actually just mad because
before they had a little upper hand that
would feel good that I oh I'm white and
I make a little bit more money than done
but man those days are over
this guy's not over there earning the
same shit as fucking black and Hispanic
people you know what I mean and I'm
talking about the regular jobs I'm
talking fucking people you go to Walmart
you earning that same guy that's fuckin
super racist he's earning the same shit
out of the fucking black guy that's
there you know what I mean like there's
no fucking difference so that's why some
people they're mad and they you know
they jumping on the Trump bandwagon
because they're like man the last thing
that we had was we felt a little bit
better of just being fucking you know
being white and it's like that's dying
out just being white it's not gonna get
you anyway just like those days are over
everybody now is equal you know what I
mean everybody else gets treated equal
in every job so just being white it's
not a plus it's just your fucking
regular person so that's why a lot of
people are fucking pissed off with that
you know what I mean like that's just
how it is so I just think like you know
blacks and Hispanics they have to get
out of that cycle of like oh my mom you
know my mom is a high school dropout I
dropped down there like now on my
fucking FedEx I know a lot of fucking
people like when I was like growing up
that you know there were my friends and
I haven't seen them in years
but then I can't man I work at FedEx man
and it's like I got this job of FedEx a
$12 an hour was like
by the timer I do five years I'm again
like $20 an hours and it's like what
like FedEx is not a career man FedEx is
not a fucking career best buy is not a
career you know I agree with a lot of
people when they say hey man this you
know working in fast-food chains
those were not jobs that were supposed
to be made as careers those are jobs
that you do when you're in high school
and you're like hey I'm gonna become I'm
gonna work at Wendy's for the summer and
shit like that and then you move on you
keep on doing moving on with your life
you just don't stop and be like oh man
you know if I stay at Wendy's in three
more years I'll get a little benefits
maybe I'll become manager no man that's
not where you're supposed to end up at
you're supposed to move on in and keep
going you know what I mean so that's
just my take on it so yeah and going
back to diversity in tech nobody's
stopping you man nobody's stopping to
becoming a developer nobody's stopping
you to becoming your true potential
those days are over the days of like
fucking races stopping you those days
are over
nobody's stopping you and of course it's
gonna be isolated incidents where this
might be a fucking person will just be
like hey I'm gonna choose this this
white kid over you it's just that's how
life is
there might be a girl who looks good and
she just might get hired in front of you
that's just how life is
you know what I mean you can't fucking
fight that but the idea that there's a
system stopping you from becoming a
developer and becoming successful in
this world that doesn't exist you can
become whatever you want
know what I mean like you just got to do
your own shit
exactly bad chicks are undefeated you
can't beat that
you know fuck I'm sorry guys no matter
how you look at it if a beautiful girl
goes into a job interview and she knows
as much as you she's gonna get hired
that's just how it's gonna go and you
can't be mad at it
cuz you would have probably done it too
if you had the power you like man if
there's a beautiful girl coming in or
just a regular guy which one you're
gonna hire be honest 90% 99% other guys
is gonna hire the beautiful girl it's
that simple so it's the same shit with
fucking race man I feel it's the same
shit you could become a fucking
developer man like right now there's
nothing stopping you and we just gotta
let the word out
we just gotta let this thing be known
out here like hey man like we're in the
fucking you know information age we're
in fucking 2017 we sold BOTS of being
2020 there's no reason for fucking only
to be 2% of black people there are
fucking developers especially when I
know there's so many freakin like you
know smart kids out there but nobody's
selling them like hey you could become
this that's the problem I feel like that
there is no role models there is no no
people coming around it and you know I
remember what was at the YMCA had like a
program where it's like you know certain
dudes that were successful will come in
to to show you how to play boys she like
them like who the fuck needs somebody to
teach you how to play ball teach
somebody how to fucking make money in
this world teach somebody how to get out
of poverty teach somebody how to be
successful in life
don't teach me how to shoot a ball
because once I become 18 years old and I
gotta go out to the real world
what's the opportunities that I get just
to play ball what happens if I get
injured that say my life is over and now
I gotta be in the corner selling dope
those are my options because nobody
showed me a different way you know what
I mean so that's what I'm saying that's
what I want to change that's what I want
to change the coding phase calm like I
want to make this shit more more
accessible and like I already have a
budget saved like once I finished my my
website I'm gonna promote the shit out
of it on WorldStarHipHop calm because
every minority is on it everybody every
black K every Spanish kid is in there
watching videos on YouTube or watching
videos on worldstar but if that's the
place with they're all watching things
I'm gonna go in there I'm gonna promote
coding phase calm I'm gonna make a
really legit video and I'm gonna pay the
the full two thousand dollars that it
takes to get the big video on top for
one day just one day just to have it
there and even though it's gonna cost me
two thousand dollars to promote : face
comm on it but at least a million people
is gonna see that video and that's gonna
be something really good because now
everybody's gonna choose to become a
developer now everybody's gonna choose
to change their lives but it's that good
5% of people that's gonna change that
those are the guys that I want you know
what I mean like they're there's more to
life than you just fucking you know just
being a fucking stereotype you know what
I mean like you don't want to be a
stereotype out here man you know you
don't want that you know you you know
especially like now man like you don't
want to be just like hey man
that black K man he sure plays boy
or you know a little Spanish kick man he
works great on it Under the Sun like you
don't want it fucking yeah you know you
don't want to be a fucking stereotype
you don't want to be like oh man that
little Mexican kid he's a great
construction worker you don't need to
fucking be that you know what I mean
like you could be something else you
know people are always talking about hey
man I don't want to be a statistic
you're already a fucking statistic when
you you become just a fucking regular
person out here you're already the
statistic of like yet you didn't get
killed by 21 but you're already a
fucking statistic because you're fucking
working a bullshit job and that is what
people are expecting out of you people
are expecting for you to just be like
the guy is fucking is Deshawn working at
Foot Locker you don't want to be fucking
Deshawn at Phonak er you know what I
mean you don't want to be fucking Pedro
doing fucking deliveries you know what I
mean like you know I'm sorry for like
you know all my white audience to it
this is not this isn't this video is
never to be like oh fucking fuck white
people or whatever I'm only focusing
some fucking minorities this is not
about that there's more about I want the
minorities to fucking see that this is
the option you know what I mean this is
an option to become successful in this
you know because a lot of people don't
even think people don't even think I
told my friend like five years ago man I
was like man I'm doing IT work then this
is like slave work I'm about to just
switch back to becoming a web developer
man and maybe you should do it too this
what he said exactly he said nah man
that's for white people what the fuck
does that mean you know what I mean like
where was this rule who made this rule
to say hey being smart as for white
people being
successful is for white people no man
you putting a limitation on yourself
sky's the limit you know what I mean
like and where is he at I'm not gonna
say his name cuz he might see this video
but where is he at right now he's
fucking working cleaning clean fucking
high coolest thing you know the high
rises cleaning the windows risking his
life for like $20 an hour and for him
that's a good job you know what I mean
like I make three times as much as he
makes and there's no reason why he
shouldn't be making the same thing that
I make it's only about putting
limitations on himself you know what I
mean but yeah man this are my daily
talks on my lunch break my little 20

bullshit by here man I'm about to go to
lunch I'm about to Issei man I'm sorry
he already knows your boy joke back at
it again : face calm listen guys if you
guys want to support me listen I know
everybody here has 50 cents on them stop
playing support the cause support what
I'm doing go to mic my website coding
face calm at the bottom there's a little
thing that says hey if you want to
support you just fucking throw me 50
cents
I'm not saying throw me $10 throw me $20
throw me 50 cents I'm out here you know
just fucking getting fucking sense
because even cents is gonna fucking work
out it's gonna I'm gonna be able to do
something with those little 50 Cent's
I'm gonna be able to give a free course
to somebody else because I'm already
good I already work in the industry I'm
not doing this shit for me I'm already
fucking good I already have money saved
where I come from opening my own
business in like a year or two like I'm
good I'm doing this shit for other
people because I want to help out other
people you know what I mean I try
helping out my old friends and my old
friends were pretty much they don't want
to do shit so I just leave them alone
but there's people out here on the
internet that they want to get help and
they want to be able to fucking get
courses and and learn the right path and
that's what I'm here for
I'm here to help them up there's only so
much I could put in into the pot so you
know whenever you donate five dollars
ten dollars that's like you already

cents so if you like what I'm saying
you're like my movement you like what
Conan face calm is supposed to be there
you go man
donate fifty cents or go to my patreon
in my description and donate a dollar
every month

month donate it which is fucking great
because $25 I'll do something with that
you know what I mean I know how to
fucking I know how to hustle and how to
make $25 and flip that shit to make $100
back and then with $400 I could give
somebody you know five six courses you
know it helped them up one day freaking
when they get into the game they'll
remember me in the but I yelled coding
phase comm go visit our website that's
what helped me out yeah man now don't
worry I don't have to go all out ten
dollars that's a lot of money to me I
feel like that's a lot of money yeah I
don't have to go that big but fifty

you know what I mean but yeah G no man
thank you for the donation man and you
know you guys are the best
I'm just here for everybody I'm here for
you know help people out let's see what
happens man give me a year once coding
phase comm is already live in the next
few months then from there the next step
is gonna be just keep on promoting this
thing I'm just gonna go super hard I'm
trying to bring up the diversity rate on
the tech community and I'm trying to
bring up people who who think that
they're not smart enough to become
developers and change their lives that's
what I want to do I want to just bring
it up bring that fuckin level up man and
then when a few years from now when
people is developers and working in
companies they'll just share my story to
somebody else in my album yeah man I
became a developer because you know I
became a developer cuz I saw this video
on YouTube this guy called coding face
his name was Joe and he always used to
come in and be like dab coating face

guys later
I gotta get this fool man pilot your boy
