so let's say you got a link you say
create you found I don't know let's go

podcasts here you got all the stacks
stacks is still coming through that's
the last thing that I'm gonna build
because like I said it's the most
difficult one so you have stacks then
from there let's say you had a a Python
stack right then from there you have all
the things that a person needs to learn
to be able to learn the stack HTML CSS
JavaScript Python or whatever right then
from there you click on one of the links
takes you to the area where all the

the actual course of what it is you know
content created by Doughboy YouTube /
Doughboy right then you have here up bow
down bow other videos that
people can vote for to actually take the
number one spot so it's like it's a lot
of cool that's the comments area
you know we allow the cool right
now is like beta man right now naming
beta alpha coz beta is gonna be at the
end of the week I'm gonna release it for
everybody to sign up or register and
then from there you know you guys could
go in whoever actually registers or
before three months I'm gonna give it a
three month like deadline where it's
like okay
for three months the first three months
the people that sign up in that first
few months they get automatically
a badge that says founders right the
people that were there from the
beginning because this website is gonna
get huge it's gonna be huge
trust me when I tell you that and then
basically those that get a foundation is
count everything you know later on I
might do like you know coding phase uh
uh you know merchandise or like let's
say um a paid course that might create
or a paid course that somebody might
want to create and Sunday through coding
phase comm then basically you guys
whoever was the founders of people to
sign up in that first three months
automatically get 50% off no matter what
it is automatically all right so that's
good point man let me see what you guys
is up to man let me see the live chat
let me get in here real quick so our
pricing so few guys see what everybody
is up to wearing now and I got minute
rock yeah let me see what skills good
Matt what up break your what up khadeem
steward what up FinTech what up Julian
what up Clarence what up Torino what up
nikka what up FinTech what up on breaker
what up
we said captain alpha what up let me see
who was this in here
Rico name fails in here Darryl what up
George what up what is in here man let
me see Johan what up
yeah man I'm gonna see once I start my
blog again I'm gonna bring you know
bring out Casa Darrow I'm gonna bring
out tough cookie with lots of good food
tough candy I keep saying her name world
I don't know why but uh well so and
she's gonna bring everybody in here man
so it's gonna be like a pretty cool
podcast I used to have it the only
differences I used to have three people
at a time now it's just gonna be one
person per podcast so yeah that's what
we up to right all right so what's good
guys what videos you guys want me to do
this week man let me know let me know
aim what up why did I put ads on my
website why wouldn't I put ads on the
website I'm gonna have to pay for this
right so would you guys don't know is
that just so on I'm paying for her
broeckel right the whole hosting
everything's gonna be paid to her oh um
I calculated that monthly I'm probably
gonna end up spending about 400 to 600
dollars right on the website now it's
that money gonna be paid by me no I'm
not gonna pay 400 600 dollars out of my
pocket to build this website right so
how is this thing gonna get paid it's by
the advertise there's gonna be ads you
know whoever doesn't want ads then I
don't know I guess I'll create something
like $5.00 a month or something like
that if you don't want to ass right um
yeah so I don't know unless you guys
want to donate $600 a month
so basically get this website out then
we could do it for free you know no ads
no nothing but it'll make no sense for
me to basically pay $600 a month which
is a lot oh yeah
so there's gotta be a disguise google
has ads YouTube has ads every website in
the world has ads so you know what I
mean like you can't run away from this
thing it's like if you want stuff for
free
you gotta see ads of course come on you
guys should know that let me see yeah
when definitely some social there's
gotta be some sociable pieces to it I'm
also gonna do it in a fun application to
react native once I finish the website
because first the API side is easy I can
build this thing right away
now what I want to do with the website
I got create other views I gotta create
order logic I gotta create basically
different user permissions there's going
to be the regular users there's going to
be the paid users there's gotta be the
users who are um moderators there's
going to be the admins and the super
admins right so every single person
needs to see something different on the
website you know so it's a lot of logic
and I'm building this by myself usually
what I build the website like this
there's usually like 10 different people
in the team right and it takes us like 7
months to 8 months to build something
this large but I'm doing it by myself
knocking it out every day guys it's
gotta get there
trust me man okay I'm getting says
you're getting banks though as a
developer yes yes I'm getting paid as a
developer but I'm gonna be honest with
you yeah I'm gonna ask you this would it
make sense for you right to spend I
don't know 10% or I know 10% 8% of your
paycheck on a website just to build it
where there's not gonna be no income
coming in
nothing's gonna you know it's like
you're basically paying for this
right will you do that just for the hell
of it
you know what I mean like you're not
gonna do that trust me right like $500
for you is the same as me $500 $500
like you know paying $600 a month to me
is still a large amount of money you
know like I'm from the bottom key I came
from the bottom I know what it is worth
$100 in your pocket all right so I give
value to that money I'm not gonna go and
create a website which I know is gonna
get a whole bunch of traffic and if I
don't pay for the best hosting in the
best database the thing is gonna crash
right so no matter what I still have to
pay for this so I was like if this
thing is gonna be out there I have to
make some type of money that's gonna pay
for it you know I don't know like come
on guys that was like you know the goal
or tell Elon Musk and be
like hey man what why are you creating
the cars man like why are you
charging for your cars you're a
billionaire right
like you could just pay for everybody's
car right what guys like this ain't
Oprah
you know I'm a sense for this type of
websites this as always you can't try to
Philly offers yeah maybe I'll try that
later on but at first man I have to I
have to add something that's gonna
generate money man like I'm not trying
to pay five hundred dollars by myself
every month especially when I got a
whole bunch of other bills I'm
already paying like $5,000 a month
 last month it was $6,000 and I
paid in general in all my bills right so
for me to say hey guys out of the
kindness of my heart I'm gonna throw a
extra 400
on my bills of all the bills that I have
is like here's another fine glass like
come on guys
you guys gotta have half a brain come on
like you gotta understand nobody
is going to is going to come out of the
kindness of the heart and spent $500 a
month like I used to do that in the
beginning I get in the beginning I
freaking spend like $400 giving out free
courses and I wasn't makin I even one
sec from YouTube in the beginning the
first two months I spent by $200 and
then $200 on giving off free courses the
people that have been here since the
beginning they know that I was doing
less and giving out free courses so a
whole bunch of people here man people
email me send me messages like you're
from India Tom I'm here I'm trying to
become a developer ask you to send or
attend a McCoy's alright so go to you to
meet by the course is given out so it's
enough for free right in the long term
after two three month I was like man
this is adding up it doesn't make sense
for me to you know pay for this
when I could go in and pay some of it
but not the whole thing I'm not gonna
throw myself extra bill just to be nice
to the world you know it's like not like
the world is being nice to me like you
know what I really like you know if you
look at right now you go to all let's
say to my patreon you go to my patreon
let me see
oh where is it you see so you guys can
really understand a lot of people think
is like I'm making mad money on
this shape when I'm not it's like I'm
doing a lot of out of like you know
just to help out people out and keep
them motivated but you know even with
the patreon right now you look at the
patreon we got six patrons right that's
six patron is 5% of $500 right that's
what that's the goal 500
month is the goal for this website tool
to be maintained and you know it's like
I'm doing on this ship for free
regardless but just to pay for the whole
thing all that you know like come
on you guys could do you could do the
math you know let's do it like little
kids like back in the days let's say
five times five hundred divided by 125
right so it's like 25 dollars a month
like you guys really think that's gonna
be able to pay hosting especially when
you go to say Google Analytics right
let's load this up real quick get this
analytics right cool so right now we
basically get in 78 78 people around
there 78 per day that's unique visitors
right so that's when nobody's coming in
is like because the website's not being
able to long to register people are I
just coming in just for the love right
now way from my knowledge you know with
the promotion that I'm gonna pay and
also to promotion having this website up
word-of-mouth this thing is gonna double
up to at least 5,000 users per day right
now at a given time let's say that uh
400 users on the first day right you
need to have a very good server to
actually run a website in that
don't crash you know cuz any time that
you go over 300 users at a time or a
website you're looking at least 200
hours of hosting minimal plus I know how
this watch is
and the type of people that that want to
come to the site is going to be very
active so I know this thing's gonna get
out there and it's gonna be pretty huge
because even right now my websites
naming up in like Brooklyn people are
coming in and constantly so you know
trying to register they you know it's
like I see it through analytics
everybody's trying to press join join
join join like mad people want to join
right so if 80 people a day right eighty
a hundred people a day been trying to
click a frickin joint every single day
calculate that let's say 100 do like
little I love doing bad like I was a
little kid I love to listen or you go
like a 100 times 3,000 right so it's
like 300 thousand users right that's
that's why I think it's gonna be by the
end of the year from the first year that
I sign up
and I create the website and release it
to the world till the end of that year
when is you know you're gonna feel
released I know there's gonna be at
least 300,000 users and like that's it I
can't pay that
Wikipedia can't pay themselves like they
do donation you know hmmm
we could be the the biggest freaking
website in the world one of the biggest
website they can't even handle
the traffic you know traffic that they
get constantly so they gotta do like
donations and they gotta do a whole
bunch of you know so it's like no
matter what guys like she gotta get paid
bills that I get paid K let me see
a whole skater yeah man host give us his
trash language you're looking at like
freaking a little things that all they
want is like little WordPress
sites because it doesn't it doesn't take
that much to build a website start
hosting it but when you building a web
application is different when you need
like a custom custom hosting in
dedicated servers SSDs at least four
gigabytes around like starts
getting there
exactly yeah of course I I have to have
like you know adds something some type
of way where we can generate
some money cause I'm not looking at this
thing right now
I know if I build this thing this thing
is gonna get big but it's gonna take a
year to you know catch up to where it's
profitable right and there from there
you know sky's the limit man you know
know what we're going from here man it's
like I've done it before with music
websites right I used to have this other
website which was generating about you
know $500 a day and it was cool but then
it just got Google at that time was
giving me so much traffic that I
couldn't handle it so it can't crash I
can't crash it so I learned from that
I'm like you know what if I have to pay
$500 a month for hosting I'm gonna do it
because now I know I know the importance
of it
from married yet not yet man we about to
we about to get married one of these
days I'll invite you guys I'll do a live
live feedback from you know for me
getting married let me see what up what
up I don't know if I'm coding fast
enough how long does it take to build a
HTML CSS one page agency website
it takes time everybody's different
that's another thing too you can't think
in your head like Oh am i coding slow or
I'm doing this and that
listen when you call it from
scratch it takes time now the way how
you get really fast is by being able to
copy and paste code that you already
coded before right so like I said you
know you're gonna use a similar menu to
a page you did before
so what your day was you go to that
other page you copy it paste it on the
new page that you're building and then
from there just edit it so it could be
close to whatever and you layout that
you're working on but that's how people
code fast it's not like people gonna
hope a little great at typing oh I'm
great I coming up with ideas no
it's like you reuse code you reuse code
that you already stay so that's how it
is
you see I see you gonna manage well
DevOps is hard
Jamal you down bro so you found it hours
a month but you gotta do something for
me
yeah you know very spiky Elon is thirsty
come on bro there's a million girls out
here and you know yo semi April's number
you crazy
come on man do I have kids well I'm
about to have a kid now yes coming this
month that's it the baby is already is
this nine month the baby could pop out
any moment any given time so it's gonna
be cool Salim ah my people Philippines
wife you from the Philippines so you
know me man I'm half Filipino half Pinoy
call me Kuya Joe you dig
could I get a phone in developer job
without knowing frame were like react.js
or angular yes if you're lucky because
now that's like a standard like you have
a framework to be able to get hired
about coal reuse do you take notes of
snippets off your notes on get on no
missing thanks for taking the time make
your videos shared knowledge is greatly
appreciated you know get alert I really
appreciate that you appreciate it
yeah I'm just grinding guys like I'm
trying to create cool for you guys
you know cuz
it's like me like when I was starting
there was nobody who talked you know
what I mean like yes there was
guys like the new boss thing or elide
the computer guy or whatever what I
started right but those guys I didn't
feel like hey I want to be cool with
that guy
no I never felt that I never felt like
oh I want to hang out with this person
oh hey he reminds me of one of my
friends like I never got from got that
energy from any of them right because
all of them were just strictly cold
strictly or no personalities
strictly just talking about one topic
and that's it and it's like that is
boring I mean for me is really boring
you know some people they come to my
channel today oh you were supposed to
just give me cold and I'm like
no bro this is not a channel about cold
it is it's connected to code it's coding
phase right but it's also about me and
like the that I do throughout the
day and like hanging out with you guys
like that's what this channel is about
you know so you know what I mean so
that's the day
missing trilogy calm let me try that let
me see what they about see trilogy
educational services
let me see I'm reading to the website
trilogy dot-com seems cool I don't know
man
you know it's like I've I've talked
about boot camps so much man
it's like I don't have the energy
anymore
I don't want to talk about the love I
mean listen it's like this alright so
you already working at a startup doing
sales right so it's very simple do you
feel there's the questions you gotta ask
yourself do you feel you can learn by
yourself right do you want to be with
people who are also looking to learn to
code
do you like the environment of being in
a place where everybody that's there
they're looking to learn how to code
right now if you're looking for that a
book it might be fine now also
economically like talking about
money-wise do you have the money like
extra money around do you feel like you
don't have debt like do you feel late
you you can get yourself into a ten
thousand twenty thousand dollar loan and
it's not gonna bother you cuz you make
enough money or you have enough money
saved then ya go to a boot camp for
somebody is coming from the bottom
meaning you know Joe Schmo coming Joe
Schmoe the mechanic
who still owes student loans or who
still has a a mortgage or who still has
a whole bunch of a boot camp is not
worth it because a boot camp you're
pretty much just painful an experience
and experience to go and be in a school
that's all about cold now can you learn
this stuff by yourself yes totally you
can learn this by yourself now do you
have the determination to you say here
I'm gonna learn this on my own if you
don't if you don't have that right now
you feel like oh man I need
maybe I need to see a instructor or
maybe I need somebody to teaching this
then you gotta go to a boot camp all
right
because already you're if you you know
when you're iffy about something the
best thing to do is like you know maybe
just go to boot camp but it's
not guaranteed that you're gonna learn
how to code from it because you're
already going in iffy right there's
people I go to boot camps when they're
actually already computer science which
so they have background or I tease they
already have backgrounds as a developer
or working with technology now you if
you don't have a background in
programming you might not be at the same
level this other person so when you're
there don't think that oh it's like oh
man everything's coming easier for him
is because he's already has a background
into this you you're coming in as zero
like you've never done this before so
you gotta have that expectation already
that when you go into there's gonna be
people that gonna know way more than you
and a lot of times instructors is gonna
go faster because this the majority of
the people in the class already know
this topics for you as a brand new
developer you don't know anything so a
lot of topics is gonna go over your head
so you either have two choices you gotta
learn in your house or
basically try to catch up before you go
to the boot camp because if not then you
just wasted money that's it you know
MSO doesn't thing guys sometimes it's
hard man I think everybody there's a lot
of people I want to join and become web
developers or so for engineers but
there's not that many resources that
people can just follow and say oh I want
to learn to become a web developer this
is my this is my goal this is how I got
a goal that's my role that's why I'm
creating Kona fees.com because I want to
create that for people and tell them hey
and give it to the community let the
community choose like hey there's the
best course to learn HTML this is the
best YouTube video to learn javascript
is the best blog online to find to learn
database associate right because when
you're Brady developer you're somebody
who's trying to get into this you get
this ideas you're like oh man what I
become a developer but now in this sea
of resources how do I find the
best one so you spend more time looking
through resources that actually are you
good also does it thing
oh yeah Darius Harris if you want to
join a boot camp go ahead man if you
have to money go ahead if you feel like
it's not gonna hurt your pocket it's not
gonna bother you and you're like oh yeah
20k it's fine 10k also - you don't think
about it three months of full-time boot
camp means you gotta have enough money
to survive well you never go back to
your mom's career and be like hey mom I
gotta hang out here for a little while
until I finish this boot camp because
it's three months and you can't work
full-time and also that's a day yeah but
there's nothing to like coding is not
it's not something that you're gonna
learn everybody learns it different some
people might take a year some people
might take three years because depending
how much time day they put in so that's
a payment but yeah guys I'm bout to head
out cuz I gotta get back to work and I
got actually hungry I want to eat a
little something before I get back to
work
but yeah men love seeing you guys in
here man
I love seeing you guys coming through
only showing me love like always you
know 40 people sorry for 40 people
watching me you know live at any given
time it's always good man um and yeah
man make sure you you know stay in touch
man : face comm the bait is coming up
next week guys you're gonna be able to
register and like I said if I were you
guys I would just register it's free
just register then now you're in the
system and then you know you're gonna
get that badge that says founder after
you get that badge you get 50% of
everything
period so if a month is $5 - nothing can
get advertising when you're on the
website you can get a foot tulip awesome
fifty cents a month come on you're

in two dollars if you don't that to
others
guys I'm being honest if you don't have
two dollars to u.s. dollars I don't know
you got to do something with your life
Brent because you gotta hustle you how
to do something out here because two
dollars is like literally money that you
give to a homeless person as I hear
buddy here's two dollars get some food
alright so if you don't have that then a
homeless person is actually doing better
than and guys yeah I say that because
there's always people hitting me I'm
like oh man I don't have I don't have
any money I don't have Goods I don't
have that it's like I can't find I can't
buy a book for coding and I don't have
money I can buy a course from coding
because I don't have money I can't
 go to a boot camp because I
don't have money I can't go to college
because I can get a lot of money I can't
do this because I don't have money it's
like bro
stop thinking about what you don't have
