you're back at it again man out here
coding face.com man I want to talk about
this idea of what people think like you
know what uh what developer or what a
developer is supposed to be like and I
kind of feel like I'm not the average
developer I'm not you know I'm not the
you know the little nerdy kid skinny kid
who who basically goes in and colds and
you know and this is now like that's the
idea that people have what what
developer is or what a programmer is and
the reality of things is like I'm not
I'm not one of those people like and I
probably would never be like you know
I'm more Elon Musk than Bill Gates if
you know what I mean like yeah man so I
just wanted to talk about this cuz a lot
of people think like oh you know they
feel like oh they're not smart
they might they're not smart as some
other people they they might not fit in
you know they might not you know
whatever but this industry is like
pretty amazing because no matter who you
are if as long as you go to your job you
could get into in the industry it
doesn't matter how old you are it
doesn't matter what color you are
doesn't matter what sex orientation you
are it doesn't matter where you come
from what matters is can you do the job
that's what's important you know what I
mean like right now I just came from the
bank man like I'm like kind of tied to
you guys like this is string blue cheese
man this were like a little quick Hajis
look like you know what I mean a little
shine shine shine you know what I mean
but that's me that's that's my swag I'm
pretty sure other developers don't do
stuff like that because that's done you
know what I mean but I'm gonna talk to
you guys about like my inspirations of
you know what a developer I am you know
what type of developer I am you know
like I always been flashing my whole
life I've always been you know one of
those people from you know from my high
school days like everywhere I would go
like people but oh Joe without blue you
know like people know me they know who I
am they know how
I speak they know the swag they know the
lingo they know who I am pretty much
right so I'm gonna talk to you guys
about the saying exactly
alright a lot of people thing is like
most developers look like this and you
know is like like although squiggly
nerve you know nerdy guys and isn't that
but in reality you don't have to be that
guy man you could easily be DHH if you
don't know who DHH is or look it up he's
doing that created Ruby on Rails this
dude is a rock star man like
this guy is like you know he's
everywhere he got like you know freakin
Lamborghinis he's he does the the big
deal you know what I mean like he does
car racing he freaking he's flashy with
it at the same time he's very serious
about his program in it you know also to
his family and everything but he you
know he don't have to be you know the
little nerdy kid from school and you
know like he could just be himself and
that's it he could do the job he could
become a you know a great programmer a
great developer you don't have to be
this you know a little weird kid that
you know what people think that are
developers you know what I mean like
he's not the quote-unquote developer
like right now if let's see what you you
get when you search web developer let's
see what we get okay
Oh marina look at this
that's all saying like what does this
have to do anything so you know what I
mean like oh let's see web developer guy
all right
like okay all right all right all right
god damn it all right I this what people
think that you know what developers are
and how they look and like you have to
be a certain way but this
amazing girl beautiful girl who is
actually a engineer right so she came
out in an ad right and people did not
believe that she was a engineer marry
this girl right so they basically took a
picture of her at her job and then they
post it up online oh well and posters
throughout you know I think in San
Francisco right and everybody's like oh
my god
she's she's too beautiful to be really a
engineer why are they getting models for
you know for the commercial whatever and
in reality she was a engineer she
actually does Ruby or else he actually
does HTML CSS JavaScript and plenty of
other languages and like she's pretty
badass I mean she's definitely beautiful
and gorgeous but that doesn't mean that
she can't be a engineer you know what I
mean it's like me like some people might
you know coming just judge a book by its
cover like why is this guy over here on
YouTube with so much money and showing
his money up like developers is not
supposed to do this developers is not
supposed to show up money and be like oh
yeah my god I'm making money out here
like people is not supposed to do that
right you know like I'm just here trying
to show people like you can just be you
in and do what you gotta do man out here
like this girl says something amazing I
want you two guys to actually search for
this video uh Rebecca
Garcia ladypoints right watch the whole
video she's pretty Lee Jay beaut aful
girl but besides that she said a very
important thing she said people have
said things like oh well you're too
pretty to be a programmer oh you don't
you don't look like a programmer and
it's like really there's programmers
from all different backgrounds what's a
programmer supposed to look like
somebody had pointed out to me that the
idea of diaper
city in tech isn't just saying well we
need this many people this many
ethnicity or this many people from this
background it's actually just having a
welcoming inclusive environment that
feels like it's just a safe and
acceptable to be you whatever your
background is you know what I mean
whatever your background is like my
background is I'm from New York my
Grilli from New York queens in a house
you did like I go to read it and I'll
drop a video log drop a message or
whatever and it's like people is like so
pissed off they're like oh my god like
I'm sorry if you're like if you feel
threatened like you're like one of those
those like super nerdy guys like there
are oh my god they're not in the cool
kids and like no bro no like this is not
about that man this is about like you
know all of us if you you got a
programmer you could at at developing
like that's what you man like we're all
good you know what I mean like if we're
good at something like why is you trying
to stop me or us or like people of like
that's not the typical programmers in
you know what I mean
so I like my question to you guys is
like what do you guys think or what
developers supposed to be like what do
you guys think a program our developers
supposed to be like like you know I feel
like we you just gotta be yourself you
know what I mean like this is one of the
reasons why right now in the United
States there's not that many people
graduating with you know stem degrees
and you know science and math like why
because people feel like oh my god like
like you know they're not gonna get
welcomed and in that crew or or you
gotta be super smart in and listen I
like no man just be yourself man you
like science we all have a little nerdy
side in us man
I love Star Wars I love Star Trek I just
I'm not the guy over there you know
looking all crazy and in a Star Trek
show I'm not a Trekkie I just happen to
love it you know what I mean but yeah
man and I'm not judging nobody from the
other side I don't want nobody judging
might sound like meaning like how I am
but like come on man like this idea of
what a developer should look like and
how he should act like we need to throw
that out the window man cuz its
2017 man and this house is gonna be
there's gonna be beautiful girls around
you know becoming programs in the future
you know there's gonna be dudes like me
just swagging it out like guys we just
here you know what I mean I hire people
telling me like you're a brogrammer
like what what the hell is a programmer
like not a program brogrammer look it up
it's like they say guys who are from the
frat house or like you know pretty much
what they're saying is the cool kids who
now are programmers that's what they're
saying it makes no sense man listen this
supposed to be an industry about you
know welcoming everybody and this idea
of what developers should look like that
 needs to go away okay anyways man
