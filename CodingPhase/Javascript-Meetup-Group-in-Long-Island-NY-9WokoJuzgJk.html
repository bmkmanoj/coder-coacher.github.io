your boy joke back at it again man
coding face.com on my way to my first
meetup in Long Island this is gonna be
fun that's gonna be pretty interesting
it's gonna be a JavaScript Meetup
I hope you guys enjoy this video that
I'm about to make for you guys and I
hope I enjoy to see that you guys are
good I know it's a little light but it's
not going to be the code color so I mean
I grow hot peppers pretty much all year
round and we've got a little ray of hot
peppers here and we have a little
hotness next to them so we've got two
properties name and hotness and we're
just gonna do some basic manipulation
just alright so the first one we're
gonna return this is a filter so we're
gonna be filtering this all right this
first guy we only want to return the
ghost pepper so in the beginning assume
that that filter method is probably
highly optimized yeah yeah yeah but with
that said I don't really think you can
get faster than the for loop because
it's sitting right I mean what I
wouldn't any other people like like you
know
go leg before where I was trying to
implement a different version of Reagan
Park for the text parsing and I really I
could not get even close to equal to
theirs and I looked into it try to get
into their function I found its native
codes it's like you know they're
implementing something I can't I can't
even look at you know it's a that would
make sense to me and we obviously like
with this example like no problem with
no you know we're going over arreva you
know we're dropping the database or
something like that so I could see how
like this epic method could end up being
faster it's they're using here that this
map function returns right so it returns
this description right so if us here we
do the console log of pepper map
description right now if we go and we do
okay so if we might comment this out and
I do just a console log on the pepper
map description right so I'm just the
odd or the array of objects itself and
then I do it on the peppers so channel
coding fees.com
this is art of the guys from the Long
Island JavaScript Meetup I really
appreciate you guys having me here I
just wanted to share with the audience
this is very important because a lot of
people get scared to show up to meet up
like those people are gonna set me
that's probably gonna be guys are way
more advanced than me so I just wanted
to ask the question like who here has
been calling for more than two years all
right more than five years now a year
that's good alright now as far as
frameworks choose one view right anybody
has used it they like it okay react all
right
angular all right hyper app nobody yeah
yeah let's see it actually guys what do
you guys get from coming to a meet-up do
you feel like you guys get to meet new
people
there's a forum or for learning new
things or or getting to meet other
developers what do you guys think I mean
anybody wanna I kind of just like to
like be able to nerd out yeah I don't
have friends that code so it's nice to
come here and you know hang out with you
guys and be able to teach everybody
stuff and learn from
and into that like yeah I don't have
many friends that code and because of
that I you know talking about what you
do is just as important and doing it I
think it just it's almost like a way of
normalizing it in your brain especially
for someone like me it's not my primary
career at the moment I love for its be
but it's it's not so just talking about
it as well as doing it like kind of
helps kind of keep me in the mindset and
yeah I'm just gonna say it's pretty
inspiring also to hear what people are
working on now it's just like a one
every one month recharge it just like
feel like ya know yeah well it's no it's
just also nice to know you're like not
alone because I like learning to program
by yourself
it's so like intimidating and it's so
hard when you're like so like coming to
one this is my first time here too so
like it was really really
let's just be able to feel like oh I
don't really know that I'm prepared
someone to explain it like I'd say this
thing it's my first meetup as well it
was really really nice to watch you
before you know it try to get the
function to wait and then fail like over
and over and over yeah I wanted to ask
because this is something like my
audience constant asking oh man I'm
gonna show up and there's gonna be guys
who have been working in the industry I
have no idea what I'm doing I mean how
many people from here have worked as a
developer and got paid for cool so yeah
so pretty much um this is exactly what I
wanted to show you guys like this is a
pretty cool community out here and I
want you guys to go out there and just
go to meetups look in your local area
find a cool spot and yeah we here live
Long Island JavaScript yeah you did so
I'm Mike Allen saya way a professional
programmer and yeah I'm the co organizer
the Long Island JavaScript Meetup Thanks
what's going on it's got the veto on the
programmer of another co-organizer Long
Island JavaScript meetup so I've been
like actually coding I guess since
University so you know six years or so
I've been coding since I was younger
just like websites and for plans on
games and stuff like that only very
seriously wet without two years I mean
right now would be you guys for you
about this I mean it was a great meet up
today you know what type of vibe did you
guys get it seems like you guys are
pretty comfortable with everybody like
they've been here before a couple of
times so you need I say pretty cool
community you guys have to pee in the
winding I mean yeah guys you guys from
oh yeah yeah yeah we're go from around
oh it's pretty cool in general too you
know everybody really wants to learn and
yeah I mean just in general like the the
people that come you know it's just all
walks of life I mean we have people that
have been programming for like thirty
million years there and then other
people just started and it's it's really
nice to kind of be able to meet
everybody where they're at and you know
really be able to teach them cool stuff
and also learn cool stuff from them
yeah everyone I've met so far from here
has been such a cool person that I love
meeting programmers I guess because to
come out to a meet-up like you got to be
at least a little bit passionate about
programming and creating and doing
something so it's always interesting to
talk to everyone endeavour of the night
stand on me what made you guys start
like a JavaScript you know like I just
so measure you know you could go crazy
with me
why talisman so we definitely have to
shout out Justin yeah yes Justin
bookerson yeah he's uh he's the creator
of this me up he's unfortunately not
able to make it for the next two months
because of work but he's yeah he pretty
much created this out of nothing and
babied it for about a year and a half
two years until we came here and then
just became friends yeah yeah he like
originally made it I think to actually
learn JavaScript
yeah he did so he created like he pretty
much like I mean this man pretty much
has like five udemy courses of slides
worth like all that he made just to
learn JavaScript and teach it to
everybody else and like I think he
originally did it to like because he
liked the idea of like when you learned
something to teach it to somebody else
you really like have to know it so I
think that's originally like kind of
where it came from
sorry if that's not it just I think I'm
talking to you about that yeah yeah guys
