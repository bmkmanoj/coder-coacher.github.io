know what I mean yeah man you look
forward to my videos man I look forward
to seeing you guys in here that's for
sure
Bizzy rain we got here Vicente we got
Jacey Alejandro the final boss cyber
smoke busy rent being coffee Kevin J
George mark laddie
remix we got Lorenzo we got Curiel we
got Kelvin Davis back at it again you
got your boy 84 music back at it again
Andrew Warwick Kelvin Davis yeah man 84
man we we doing this Ruby on Rails you
know me man I'm all about web
development alright so the first Ruby
course was just everything you needed to
know about Ruby
period all right and then now is when we
start making websites now is when we
come in and start making full
applications so what I'm doing is I'm
building a Craigslist
we pretty much building Craigslist from
scratch right we're gonna have people
post we're gonna have admin section
we're gonna have a whole bunch of
categories etc right so all of that is
gonna be set up and what's cool about it
is that you everything that you get to
learn there you pretty much are going to
be able to put it into use to every
other application that you want to build
you know user authentication dealing
with migrations dealing with the
database all of the good stuff
all right yeah man yeah nah go ahead go
ahead man you know you can still go
through the Ruby
you know like the Ruby course is more
like I said like the syntax you gotta
learn the language you know when you're
ready to start learning how to build web
applications with rails then you could
jump on it and that's another thing too
I definitely recommend to everybody to
at least skim through the first Ruby
course you don't have to be a master cuz
that's the beauty about Rails you don't
have to be a master just know the basics
and from there you're good you can start
building applications but if you want to
go deeper watch the whole course on Ruby
and then jumps over your rails but for
you or a t-4 music like you don't even
have to go through the whole Ruby course
I don't cuz you already know a lot of
JavaScript so you already know a lot of
the programming so in reality all the
things that you learn in JavaScript you
could reuse and bring that knowledge to
Ruby on Rails okay so ask me anything
people okay now is the time difference
between a web and software development
web is websites you know software is
dealing with software
meaning like you could build something
for a computer you could build something
for like let's say a fridge I saw the
other day a fridge that had a the UI of
it like you know the information had to
weather had the weather it had how much
ice was inside of the the fridge all of
the information was done with software
but what's interesting is that they use
react for the UI interface so I mean
that software development you know
whenever you build a a game technically
you know now they call it game
development but game development is
software development because a game is
software let's see what else anything
that that you build as far as like not
even just for a computer but anything
that you you program in reality it's
really software you know what I mean
but yeah man now web development is just
development just on the weapon that say
which one has Craigslist that's the new
course that I'm working on for the next
2-3 weeks and it's on Ruby on Rails for
everybody who is on the website if you
have a membership to the website which
is usually why like $10 if you caught it
on a special you probably paid $7 if
you're one of the original members you
paid $5 a month like it's literally like
dirt cheap compared to everybody out
here listen you know me I'm not here
trying to become a millionaire I could
literally become something else but I
hate man we we charging $700 per course
now we're not doing that we here to help
people out I'm not here to sell you guys
the things that are like hot right now I
mean I oh this is hot right now on the
internet and it's great for SEO let's
sell view GS let's sell Python no I I
leave those things for last because I'm
here for the jobs there's no point of me
telling you guys learn something waste
your time and then you realize oh
there's no jobs for you so now you got
to spring another two months learning
something else you got what I'm saying
like I'm not here for that
Kelvin Davis s your hyper app course is
dope man I got props in state right away
I told you you take that one you're
gonna understand how everything works
and that's exactly how react works too
and like if you understand hyper app
you're also gonna understand Redux so
it's like you get what I'm saying like
it's pretty simple let me see can you
guys see me right now can you guys hear
your boy Missy properties
how's the audio man is the audio good
yeah let me know yeah I hear a baby in
the background yeah I hear anybody
talking in the background let me know I
want to fix the audio for you guys
for real my son loves the Pokemon Rock
Paper Scissors game you date with
JavaScript listen man if he loves that
way until you know once we do all this
web stuff man we're gonna start jumping
into game development man like there's
so much cool stuff that you could do
with JavaScript that you know that's the
thing that I tell you guys like when you
sign up to the website number one you
know you supported me right you're
supporting all these videos that I do
here on YouTube but not only that is
like you getting real knowledge right
and then on top of that you're getting
constantly new content you know every
single week I come in and I go deep into
a subject a topic and like really go
deep into a course and build it for you
guys you know I mean I've been doing
this for five years but I've been like
literally the amount of hours I've put
in like I probably could say I could be
like 10 15 years in that's how many
hours I put in because
for the past five years I've been coding
for like five from now probably like a
minimum of like eight hours a day to 12
hours a day minimum every single date
for five years right I put in so much
hours and so many different topics so
many things that I've learned things
that are difficult to learn and then
that's why I'm like wait the way how
people taught it to me I'm like I want
to make it easier for people to learn it
and that's what I'm like okay now what
is he learning it's easy but for the
people are coming in it's like you could
go and send them to a an instructor or a
course that people might come in and be
like oh man I hate this you know what I
mean like I've seen it happen to so many
people they'll be like oh man this is
hard I'm not coming back I can't do it
but it's not that it's hard it's just
how somebody presented to you and so how
do we how somebody does it for you okay
so throw questions man when is your gold
course available the gold course I'm
gonna break it down later on you know to
be honest with you guys I want to make
sure that I'm up to par with gold I want
to be like top sheet with go right to be
able to break it down for you guys
easier cuz even the way how I'm doing
and I'm developing applications and go
now it's a little bit difficult my whole
set up and even at that I'll be thinking
like yo there's gotta be a way to make
this easier but it seems like there's no
easy way around teaching gold or even
talking about gold so I'm waiting until
I figure out a way to break it down for
you guys easy instead of me coming in
and start breaking it down like you know
no computer science way like that's the
only way out so explain it because it is
difficult there's a lot of topics that
you have to know before you even jump in
to go but all of this other stuff that
we're doing like web technology and
programming languages they're simple
because in the web everything that you
could do in the web is pretty simple
but when you're falling into gold and
we gotta talk about you know how
computers work we gotta talk about you
know how programming languages work how
the compiler works it's a lot of stuff I
don't want to fall into that right now
you know what I mean I want to get done
all the the stuff that I feel like are
easy to teach and I could get it done
quick and it's gonna be valuable for you
guys to find a job right away that's
what I'm trying to teach right now first
because especially because you got most
of you I'm not saying all of you guys
both of you guys are how you call is a
lot of you guys are junior developers so
because you guys are junior developers
and you haven't gotten into the game yet
I don't want you guys to start going
into certain topics that they're not
hiring junior developers for you know
what I mean
like I want you guys to really start
learning Oh start learning stuff that is
gonna get you hired right away as a
junior developer you know Golding is
something that is like more senior level
you can't just show up and be like hey
guys I know Golding I learned this
online it's like you kind of need to
have some years behind behind you and
your resume to be hired what do you
enjoy more react or Lera
I don't know you can't compare both of
them because react is in the front end I
love react is fun and easy it makes
JavaScript fun then laravel is great to
build applications laravel for me is
more work right so something like Ruby
on Rails is something that I have fun
with but laravel is more like those sort
of most of the jobs that I've done most
of the companies that I've worked with
have used laravel you know what I mean
so most of my career has been with
laravel I think I've been doing it for
like the past two three years so let me
see do you teach C sharp and dinette and
your website currently no and I don't
know maybe in the future but I'm not a
huge fan of dotnet C sharp or dotnet
because usually those type of like
c-sharp the jobs that usually work with
our c-sharp they like most of the jobs
that I've seen have been in companies
that are super uptight they keep track
of your hours they keep track of like
what time you came in whoa
you know like what's your dress code
like I'm not that type of person you
know I mean I'm more of a small business
or startup type of guy I'm I rather have
comfort and be comfortable then being
working in a company where you're like
number you know five thousand and three
you know what I mean exactly what
JavaScript skills on junior developer
needs to get a job basically just know
the language know the syntax understand
the Dom understand how to add and remove
classes right understanding at least one
framework it doesn't matter which one
just understand one and that's about it
after that you go get a job if you know
HTML CSS and I could give your design
and you could build that then you're
good coding phase there is a way to make
JavaScript fun I feel stupid doing
JavaScript yeah you know like I said
learn react you know take the
future-proof JavaScript it's a pretty
simple simple course you learn
everything that you need not everything
in JavaScript but everything that you
need it's a big difference knowing
everything in JavaScript is gonna take
you years who ever tells you oh you
could do it in three months two months a
month they're lying to you
the there's certain errors and in
certain problems that you're gonna learn
as you go in as you become a developer
but you basically the course that I
built is just it has everything that you
need to start building websites and
building applications and understanding
the frameworks so that's about it you
know what I mean
thoughts on samory xamarin is cool but I
haven't really seen jobs like that on
xamarin to be honest with you I did some
companies that have it as like a bonus
like you know how they put on a listing
is like Oh bonus if you know xamarin but
it's like nobody really is using that
you know when it comes to like iOS
application Android development I will
say react negative it's way better way
more easier in there's like a whole
bunch of components already built so
yeah let's see your work reminds me a
traverse immediate guy yeah that's my
boy man I haven't gotten a chance to
collaborate yet with traversing media
but one of these days I feel like and we
close now he's from I believe boasting
I'm from now I live in Connecticut guess
I'm a Connecticut I'm a Connecticut do
now you get what I'm saying like we out
here now let's see what else I'm
originally for New York dog don't get it
twisted
you know the swags still there the sauce
is still there we're still sprinkling
that you know what I mean how can I get
a career in a back end nothing like look
online look for PHP look for WordPress
look for Ruby on Rails look for nodejs
look for you know those things like
those are backend technologies and those
are the things that people are going to
be hiring you for it if you could build
an application if I come in I'll tell
you hey man I have a real estate
business can you build me a website that
means you need to know the backend
because you need to create the the
database you need to create the
authentication you gotta keep track of
sessions you got to keep track of the
cookies if you understand those things
then you're a back-end developer already
you get what I'm saying let's see Nick
Schafer says completed the front-end
track over on Cole camp Joe now I'm
planning on coming over to your site to
learn before applying to Josh what do
you recommend I started in your site I
would recommend go to the time
I'm actually about to release a new
version of my website the the version
where you see the courses they're gonna
stay the same because that's being
hosted by teachable but my website by
itself I'm revamping my whole website
I'm releasing a whole brand-new website
where it's gonna have like everything
that you need for you guys to keep track
of the things that you need to learn and
it's gonna have like different tracks
same way how all you know every other
website does it out there but the only
difference is is gonna be according to
my courses so it's like okay you want to
just do Fernan and you know cuz a lot of
people hit me up Joe
buy one do I need to start applying for
jobs and then I'm gonna break that down
and but I hate after this course after
you took this one start applying okay so
it's like I'm breaking it down there's
gonna be a front end it's gonna be a
back end there's gonna be a full stack
so it's like the whole range or you can
say hey I wanna be a PHP developer I
want to be a ruby developer I want to be
a Python developer so all those things
are gonna be in there and not only that
I'm gonna break it down for a lot of
people like they want to become like
let's say for you guys you die hit me up
and ask me about that net I'm gonna do
the research I'm gonna find the best
course for it done it right course is
that I don't have I'm still gonna put it
on the timeline so I'm gonna link it to
you to me or link it to Pluralsight or
link it to whatever website has the best
course that I feel can help you out on
your journey to become that um because
it's like like I said I'm not one of
those people that is like oh I can't
promote this person I can't give love to
this person no if I find a legit course
out there for dotnet and I don't have it
till the day that I have it I'm going to
say hey take this course you get what
I'm saying so that's what I'm doing on
the the new web site because like I said
my websites supposed to be a resource my
website is not supposed to be like oh
I'm using coding phase com I can't use
any other website no my website supposed
to be a resource to you
journey okay and then from there once
you get your job it's up to you if you
feel like okay Joe's gonna continue
releasing good courses for me the stuff
that's gonna continue on your career
help you out and then you stay stick
around you know I've noticed that some
people that you know they come in they
do all the courses and then they cancel
which sort of makes no sense because
then again a month later they come back
and then resign up again and say bro
like you knew you was gonna come back
anyway so why would you cancel it you
know what I mean all you did was now you
basically are remove all your your
history you know when you cancel you you
basically delete your whole history of
all the courses that you already did you
know so it's up to you but you got to do
a smart man coding phase we would an
unrelated two years stem degree machine
be beneficial for my resume I want
semester laugh I want to switch into
entry web development yeah if you do it
listen if you're doing any type of
degree in you know in stem like let's
say science technology biology like all
those things are all gonna be good you
know anything in math you know all those
things is gonna be good because
programming is it's really more like
math when you think about it when you
create a function it's like math I
forgot which one was I don't know if it
was calculus or like I can't I have a
really bad memory but I'm trying to
remember where was the first time that I
heard the word function I know it was in
a math class you know what I'm saying so
if you have all your math or courses
let's say you have up to calculus one or
calculus two or calculus three whatever
or even linear equations or you know I
know some people who take biology and
they take a certain type of math for
biology if you have your degree in there
all those math courses they look good on
your resume no matter what a bachelor's
degrees always going to look good no
matter what you know because
a bachelor's degree is not something
that you can say hey I have it just to
have it it's like it's still gonna look
good even if it was like okay you're
doing let's say graphic sorry excuse me
let's say you're doing graphic design
right and you have a bachelor's in
graphic design but now you want to do
web development it's still gonna look
good because you have a degree which
means you applied yourself to finish
school if you go in and you have a
psychology degree it's still going to
look good because you have a degree you
know what I mean so it doesn't matter
which one was it that you had is just is
gonna look good yeah
algebra there you go 84 I need 84 can we
can we somehow man can we get a budget
for 84 music I need like 84 music out
here man like we need to link up 84 man
can we get a budget I'm about to hit up
freaking Krishan to put me in contact
with the people who seen tree house and
I can we got a budget so we could get 84
music right here or like a chair right
next to me and be like okay you know how
you guys have ever seen this guy Joe
Rogan so Joe Rogan comes in and talks
and then whenever somebody has a topic
he has like a an assistant somebody
who's there looking it up for him and
puts it up on the screen like I need
that right now
you know what I mean can we get can we
get a budget man word man we need to
link up 84 man you right there man
you're like a freaking hour and a half
away
andrew says I'm currently doing your
course how to make money as a web
developer I've created my own site with
ads how do I promote it I'm pretty sure
there's a video there where it talks
about that where it talks about how to
promote it where to go you know
yeah man Chris Shaw is in the building
man the golden child we got the golden
child in the building what up son we
need to link up too man
Chris Shawn's bougie now Chris Shawn
don't made it he forgot about the hood
you know what I mean it's like Chris
Shawn is one of those dudes that is like
he used to go to the you know to the low
spot the low Chinese spot for the beef
or broccoli now he made it now he's out
here trying to eat steak you know what I
mean it's like Nam I do come back come
eat the beef or broccoli man yeah we
miss you out here Chris you guys know
I'm joking man that's my boy we need to
bring Chris Shawn back bring Chris Shawn
back you know I miss Chris on doing
videos every day man for real man it's
like Chris Shawn does like one video one
video per week is like you know it's
like here you go you guys should be
thankful yeah I got a video from me as I
hear you go I don't maybe I him you know
what I mean we need you man
I know man that's right people be asking
me sometimes like you know why don't you
drop more videos like you know how you
used to it's like now if you really it's
hard because it's like if you really
want to do quality stuff right it's like
right now I got the lights yeah I got
the little thing I got the little setup
you know what I mean
but if you really want to
come in right hold on let's let's reset
this thing because these things is
annoying me right now hold on give me a
second this thing this view account
viewer count singing zero we got mad
people in here sign like don't try to
play me we got mad people in him so yeah
so it's like if you want to come out and
create more content for the people and
give them good quality it's like it's
all it's good but it's hard because it's
like now you got to spend hours of
editing so it's like you know I wish if
I had like a team like I'm dying to like
just make it to like a certain amount of
like subscribers and had a certain
amount of people just so I could come in
and start hiring other people and be
like okay help me out with this you know
what I mean like let me just focus about
the content and let me not have to worry
about editing uploading freaking putting
you know sending out messages on emails
like somebody who sent me an email or
yesterday I sent the email about the
Ruby on Rails course that I'm working on
and somebody said damn Joe you're the
only website that don't spam and I'm
like bro I know I don't have time to be
writing no emails you know what I'm
saying like I don't have no time to be
sending out emails you know what I mean
it's like this guy goes like yo thank
you bro you're the only guy that don't
spam I'm like yeah I can't I don't even
have time to be sending no emails how
can I spam you I wish I could what you
know what I mean man but I don't even
need the patreon you know if you guys
come to the website yeah sign up yeah
support me just from day off the junk
it's like I feel like patreon is cool
but it's more of like begging for
something and I'm the type of person I
never beg for nothing I just come in and
give you good quality stuff and give you
good content and good work and then it's
like okay this is the same thing that
you will pay somebody else another
company
that you don't care about right and
instead of doing that you supported me
and I'm giving you the content that you
really need and the stuff that's really
gonna get you hired you get what I'm
saying so it's like that's how we do it
man
you know Joe I'm 19 soon to be 20 with
my age be a problem when it comes to
landing a job now man
listen look up there's a kid who was 13
years old who got hired by Facebook
the youngest developer in Facebook
he's like 13 14 years old like that's
not that's not a huge problem at all you
know what I mean like age being younger
I think is even better because if you
get really nice were you young by the
time you you like my age you like you
like a master you know what I mean like
you know what I'm saying but even when
you're older you're still good it's just
those years is still gonna take you that
time like you start at 40 years old so
become like a master at this thing by
the time you're 50 you're gonna be a
master it's the same thing as a kid okay
who's uh 20 years old comes in by the
time you're 30 you're gonna be like a
master of this thing
all right but let's say a kid who's like
14
you know that's what we all envy right
we all envy that little kid
because at 14 he started super young so
that means that he's so good by the time
he's 20 24 years old that's like when
you really in your prime when you want
to be out here party and you want to be
you know boiling now you want to be
buying a Ferrari you wanted to be doing
all this crazy stuff this kid's gonna be
able to do it by 24 which a lot of us is
jealous about because there's like man
he got to do it young you know what I
mean some of us is gonna have to we all
gonna be able to do that but we're gonna
do it when we like you know what I mean
like we already like 30 40 years old and
we like ah man I wish I would have been
doing this at 20
that's how it is so let me see any more
questions man wear it tomorrow to make
sorry to me says I love you do because
you love Ruby four times so that's like
the way how you do that's how crazy and
easy Ruby is like if you wanted to print
something four times you put forward at
times and then you put in whatever you
wanted to to actually display four times
like that's crazy you get on say like
like when was the last time you seen
something like that like this barely any
languages like that how old are you Joe
I'm thirty years old man I'm I'm old man
I'm out here I'm okay now I'm an old
head you know what I mean I started when
I was 14 I left it alone I wish I never
would have left it alone man
because I seen the whole process I've
seen the whole process of before there
was even an iPhone I was doing this
thing before there was even a youtube I
was one of the first people in YouTube
listen I go so way back that when I was
on YouTube there was a few people you
know that we're coming from soundclick I
don't know if you guys know about this
this there's like stuff that people who
were like on the web really knows about
this there was only a few people on
soundclick calm all right that was like
Soulja Boy me Tim delageteau
a couple of people who have been around
for years
same thing in in freaking you know
MySpace days then came the the days of
YouTube YouTube was all the way in the
beginning there's guys in here like you
know DeFranco like I've been here when
DeFranco was dropping his first like
10th video like what showed you boy
started popping up on YouTube and I was
like look at this dude this dude coming
over here I was like look at this dude
coming over here from soundclick now he
thing he popping like I go way back
I've been around for many
you know so it's like I look at all of
the stuff but I was doing other things
you know and now looking back at him
like yo if I would have freaking
continued doing web development when I
was like a 14 till now I would have been
awesome like straight up no lie like I
don't even know how to put it out there
like like real big like crazy big you
know but it's fine man it's a process
you know what I mean like everybody got
a destiny for signing a yo and the
Silicon Valley Joe you know they need to
put me here you imagine me like yo give
me a cameo on Silicon Valley like just
come through real quick yo what up hey
what up son hey all right Missy its web
developer categorized as a software
engineer yes why I mean companies
they're companies that name whatever
they want for their their developers you
know there's people that are named UI
engineers UI developers software
developers like they just cramp
everybody who programs gets cramped into
software developers like some people
they want to disassociate themselves
from web development I don't know why
because you know the web is where it's
at in reality our software is cool but
it's not really where it's at it's now
really what's touching people every
single day software is good but I don't
remember the last time that somebody was
like hey man you you downloaded this new
me this new program like nobody's doing
that you know what I mean now it's about
applications like iOS applications so
people is you know people will be like
oh you downloaded a new app but all of
the applications basically order the
major major ones and all the famous ones
they start in the web first no matter
what because they need a back-end you
can't just open up our application and
not connect to a back
you know what I mean like you need the
web no matter what so the web is where
is that man or even if you're working
just software you need to connect to a
back-end like somebody got to build that
back-end for you you get what I'm saying
I want to see you get into a coding
battle would go for you listen man for
me to go into a cold battle man or just
do some dumb like somebody gotta
bring me a bag you gotta bring me a bag
give me like fifty thousand of saying
something to for me to even want to look
at something like that it's dumb I feel
like you know sometimes and this is
something that somebody asks me right
this is a good topic somebody asks me
Joe what do you think you know I don't
code as fast as some other people or you
know I can get the job done but I'm not
coding as fast as other developers who I
think that are probably better than me
and it's like for me I'm like you know
you're fine who cares you know this is
not a race you get what I'm saying like
this is not a race is can you get the
job done you know so even like oh batter
will sound so dumb because it's like
okay who could code the fastest who
could solve the algorithm the fastest is
like bro like you could have that title
you know what I mean like I wouldn't
even I'm not even interesting and so
dumb as that but okay let me see 84
music take the title literally I think I
think they take the title literally
html/css
like is like tech support now it's
basically all security and back end
there is no desktop support per se okay
I'm lost on that word 84 Oh winter says
isn't any software that connects or
online fall on the web that could be
something yeah technically
you worked on firebase firebase is cool
but firebase is pretty much I think
firebase is really for the people that
don't want to learn the back end right
because you're using firebase for the
simple fact of you don't want to build
the backend yourself you have an
application you have an idea and you're
like hey man I just want to connect it
to something and save my data and that's
it that's great you know that works
perfectly for people who are iOS
developers Android developers they don't
want to worry about dealing with a
back-end especially when you building
something on your own
right you're like okay I'm building this
large application but I don't want to
deal with the backend or I don't want to
deal with having to upgrade the servers
and this this and that then firebase is
perfect but for people who are
developers in like back-end developers
or even full stack developers whatever
like firebase is a waste of time you
know it's like even par so Jay is like
let's bring it down to personal genius
if you're taking that course that I did
on building the portfolio right there's
so many things in parcel Jay yes that
you cannot do that is not even funny
which means which means like you try to
use something that's pre-built it's
never gonna be better than what you can
build yourself because when you have
something pre-built it means that you
have to do it a certain way or you have
to already use whatever limitations that
they have you have to work around
whatever limitations that system has so
firebase has its own limitations you
can't build your ApS the way how you
want it you have to use it their way you
have to connect to to it their own way
you get a saying like you can't
completely customize that your how you
wanted you know so let me see what else
oh yeah
I was talking about web development in
titles let me see
deadlines remix tool to die for says
deadlines yeah I think coding fast it
can look the more experienced that you
are the faster that you're gonna be able
to code but there's people that just is
it doesn't work like that for them it
doesn't work it's not a race where it's
like okay I got a freaking build
something in two days
alright and then it has a million bugs
you're not saying like even deadlines is
stupid because I'd rather have a more
flexible deadline then a set deadline
when somebody comes in and tells me hey
I need this by the 24th of January I'll
look at them I'm like bro you don't even
know how web development works you don't
know how websites work you don't know
what type of bugs we're gonna deal with
you gotta take into account how many
people are working on that project how
many are you know how many developers
are doing the further how many people do
in the backend
etc like there's so many factors that
could go in you don't even know how to
frickin calculate human error this times
that you know something and you realize
you spent four hours and then at the end
when you figure it out you're not oh
shoot I forgot a semicolon like that
happens people act like you know like
this the world is perfect which is what
I told you guys the other day on the
other live stream I was like you know
the world is not perfect you know and
even when I was doing the the you know
showing somebody about functions and
coming in and showing them like okay I'm
doing instead of using ticks I'm using
the string because I was coding in Ruby
so much it's like that happens all the
time people are jumping into different
programming languages or a different
frameworks and they you know your brain
still working on that other type of
language but you're trying to finish
something else in a whole different
language so that's when human error
comes in and you make a mistake this
time somebody sent me an email to where
they're like man I don't know how to
debug does react react course that you
build and for some reason following your
course and I can't figure it out because
mine's not working and it's like bro
like you gotta learn how to debug you
got a go line by line and figure out
where was it that I broke if everything
else before or before that line that
says is their error it works then you
gotta figure out what where is that
variable coming from is that variable
there is that variable doesn't exist
there's so many things that you got to
look into you guess so it's like human
error happens all the time so when
somebody comes in and tell you I want
this by Friday and it's like bro you
know what I mean like that's crazy so
let me see what else I'm seeing I'm
trying to
people were talking about I'm lost on
this conversation between coding
Morrison and 84 music so let me see if I
see what it says
assuming is a normal sized monster how
long would it take
have you tried calling him coding
Morrison says have you tried pairing an
e-book release alongside of the online
courses you released that sounds like a
great idea if I had the time I just
don't have the time I think I probably
do that in the future you know two older
courses and probably start adding like
one by one but currently I'm not doing
it like that but I think it would
definitely be good for the people to
come in and see okay I have a book
especially to have it on their hand you
know sometimes you download an e-book
and you have on your phone and then you
ask you follow the course you can scroll
up and down on the thing and you can see
the code there so you definitely got a
point that would be cool Joe is
obtaining an AWS certificate were fish
that I start coding how much or much
love cake I think AWS if you become like
a master in 8 WS is like man there's
gonna be so many jobs for you out there
but that falls into the world of IT that
falls into the world of DevOps I mean
that's a completely different field you
know what I'm saying that coding is
totally different like when I go to a
company I go there and I specifically
tell them hey these are the things that
I'm good at these are the things that I
focused on these are my strong skills my
skills are not good
in dealing with servers I'm not good
with you know how you call it's like
having to two servers and and you know
doing a balancer or like you know load
balancer between one of them like that's
not me you know what I mean I focus on
the code
let somebody else focus on that because
I feel like you can't do too much you
cannot become a jack of all trade if you
want to become a developer you become a
developer if you want to become you know
a freakin iOS developer you become an
iOS developer if you want to become a
freaking Android developer focus on
Android you know what I mean like don't
go and say hey I'm focused on Android
and then now I'm gonna do web like now
focus on that and then later on if you
have to and for whatever reason you
can't find a job in Android or whatever
then jump to the weapon and try it out
but you have to master one thing now AWS
like I said you have to that's more for
DevOps that's more for IT for me I
freaking hate hate it being an NIT
worker or dealing with other people's
problems and you got to remember that
when you working with AWS like those
freaking servers go down all the time
they go down all the time so you gotta
be the guy that gets on cause I oh my
god the website is down I specifically
tell every company I work for I'm not
good with servers I'm not good with
dealing with like crazy calls in the
middle of the night if you're ready for
that world more power to you for me I
try to make sure that they don't even
think of me when it comes to that like I
come in I build a code if there's a bug
I fix it now if you come in and tell me
hey Joe the website is down it's two
o'clock in the morning or it is like
2:30 in the afternoon and you know prime
time and the website goes down because
there was like you know I don't know
somebody made a
a viral video about your product and now
you got a million people going to your
website and the website goes down I'm
not the guy to call don't even look at
me look at the other guy who knows about
this stuff so that's that's my point of
view
AWS so it's you gotta really focus on
one thing let me see the Missy was in
here Crusader rabbit says I'm afraid of
becoming a program because I am afraid a
company is going to force me to work
massive overtime every time and I won't
have time for my family no you saw me
you guys remember when I did that that
video when I just had came back from
like an interview my friend sent me a
message since I gave man this company is
like a few blocks away from you you know
they hire in this and that and I went to
the interview the guy started asking me
oh I see that you know you do like
YouTube on the side you do a little
freelance you you know it's like we like
guys to to be just focused on our
company on our product and I was like
this place is not for me that's the main
reason to why I don't go to companies
where they use net when you use that net
most of those guys they know about
working 80 hours a week I'm not one of
those guys I'm not doing all 80 hours
I'm doing 40 hours and I'm leaving you
get what I'm saying like I go in there I
do my 8 to 9 hours a day and I'm leaving
I'm not doing overtime I'm not staying
over time because you gotta understand
too when you get paid salary that's it
that's all you're gonna get
you could come in and say I'm gonna be
the hardest worker in the company and
I'm gonna stay overtime I'm gonna do
late nights I'm gonna stay overnight
nobody cares nobody cares about you
there's no big bonus in your hand will
you be like oh this person stay here for
you know till 12 o'clock at night
look my and my last job my coworker my
boy
he was super cool he was he's such a
nice person like he took that company on
himself I know so much stuff going bad
in that company that it was ridiculous
and it was just us to building this
whole huge application and worry about
the whole company going down and losing
business like there was so much stress
and so much problems if you guys start
looking at my videos from June of this
world last year
you'll see the stress that we was under
right because it's like is an e-commerce
website and there was like so many
issues on the website and people wanted
us to just build it out of thin air and
be like hey guys builders in two days
and it's like we can't because it's a
huge website you idiot right so so there
were so many different situations there
but this guy my coworker was such a good
dude this dude slept in the office like
transferring the website he stood in a
hotel room close to the job he even came
look he stood at work right till like
4:00 or 5:00 o'clock in the morning went
to the freakin hotel room cold took a
bath came back to work the next day at
10 o'clock in the morning the same day
matter-of-fact like did anybody care
about that no to anybody come and give
him a huge bonus right here you go ten
thousand dollars because you a really
hard worker nobody's gonna do that for
you so any type of a company that comes
in and tells you and tells you like hey
man we need you to stay till twelve
o'clock at night we need you to say to
8:00 I'm quitting that same moment I'll
be like nope goodbye that's not that's
not for me because it's like it's easy
to be like oh you guys get paid $100,000
it's like you guys work easy no we don't
all of this stuff takes time to learn
all this stuff is it's difficult to
learn you know even though I'll say it's
easy but it's difficult you know it
takes time
it's like expertise is like going to a
doctor
and be like hey man you know this is
easy you went to school this is easy you
could do this you could just do this
operation this guy don't spend 10 years
to be even be able to to open anybody up
it's the same thing as us we come in
with some people might come in and be
able to get a job in two three months
but that's not reality for everybody
right and that doesn't mean just because
you got that first opportunity doesn't
mean that you are a developer you're
just a junior developer you just some
guy that just got hired and now that
they trust in you to going to help out
give our extra hand but nobody's gonna
come in and give you serious projects
you know what I mean as a junior
developer it doesn't work like that
it takes time so for people to come in
and be like oh this is easy it's not so
when people come in and try to tell you
oh you got to work so many hours and
this doesn't that like nah man no I
don't I have a skill I have something
that makes me valuable you know it's
like I'm the acid in the company not you
hiring me you know what I mean it's like
you gotta give yourself that that value
yeah there's some companies that don't
want you to work freelance on the side
at all because they feel like the way
how they look at it is like you're gonna
go home you're gonna work eight hours a
day in their company you're gonna be
tired you're gonna go home and then
you're gonna get tired again by working
somebody else's job freelancing and then
the next day you're gonna come in all
tire and like worn down they want you to
go home and stay away from a computer
which doesn't make sense because we're
never gonna be able to stay away from
the computer if we want to stay focused
and we want to stay on top of things
when you work in a company that that
thing just takes over your mind like
even after you leave the company and you
go home your brain doesn't shut down
with the bugs that you
on the website your brain doesn't shut
down from those things you even go home
and again try to figure out oh man I had
this bugs today how can I fix it now you
go home and still try to figure it out
or you still try to go do research
online and this this and that you get
what I'm saying so it's like that's
stupid for companies to think that just
because you're working a freelance job
or you're like helping your buddy to
build a website on the side whatever is
gonna make you tired cuz like no matter
what when you get home you're still
gonna get tired because you stole your
brain is still thinking about the things
that you got to do the next day at work
I mean you guys everybody here has
worked at some time you know at some
point in their lives I know some people
are young and maybe never even worked in
a day in their lives but a lot of us is
experienced you know experienced people
you know you might have worked in retail
you might have work in an office job or
anything the things that happen that day
they get transferred to your house too
you get what I'm saying
so what development is actually even
worse than that because you have
problems on the office and you bring all
those problems to your house now you're
in your house thinking oh let me look on
the documentation and we look on Stack
Overflow
let me see on Google see if somebody has
bumped into these problems so it's not
like your your brain shut down so it's
like when a company tells me hey man we
want you to stay focus on us and say bro
mind your business like when I get home
mind your business like that's my that's
my motto to any company I go if tomorrow
I get hired by Google I'm gonna tell
Google Google mind your business
like when I go home mind your business
whatever I do after 5:00 p.m.
mind your damn business like that's not
your business to know what the hell I do
if I do freelance if I do personal
projects if I do an application mind
your damn business and that's how you
guys should be - you know put your foot
down
don't let this companies come in and
just be like oh that's why I tell you
guys look at that course that I built
how to make money as a web developer you
never want to be the
depending on the job like we have a
skill this skill is now for you to
become a worker this skill is for you to
become and use somebody the way I look
at it I use a company to pay for my
bills and then I build things on my own
that make profit that's how I look at it
I go to a job that pays all my bills all
right so everything else that I make on
the side is profit for me you know what
I mean
so that's how you guys should be you
guys should come in and be able to learn
a skill and use that don't just sit down
and be like oh yeah I got a job
no bronec make that skill work for you
because you're making some idiot fifteen
twenty million dollars a year while you
come in and you get your little your
 a hundred thousand and you
think like I got a hundred thousand I'm
making money out here no you're not this
idiot that used you that paid you the
minimum that he could pay you and you're
actually the rock star of the company
it's paying the minimum that he could
pay you
he makes twenty million dollars cuz he
owns the company how about you cuz
you're actually the one building this
thing build your home company and then
now you become the owner now you hire
other peoples you get what I'm saying
flowers top flowers to kill says coding
phase can you be my dad I hope my son
enjoys talking to me when he grows up
yeah I'm gonna have some cool
conversations man let me see
any other questions man Hey Joe can you
elaborate about managing freelance
while working full time do you have
recharge for our or project I usually
like to charge per project and I'll be
honest with people I'll be like listen
man I work full-time and I'm gonna
charge you accordingly like if you're
not working full-time for somebody you
also cannot charge them like as if
was working full-time on their project
which is something that people get
missing screw like you know some people
I hate people oh yeah I just charged him
$100 an hour and it's like bro that's
why people yeah you charge him $100 per
hour and they never come back to you
it's easy to get a one one-shot deal you
know what I mean
hey new subscribers hey we in here k-8
money way that way so yeah but it's easy
to be like hey man i'ma charge you $100
an hour and the person be like damn I
need this application they hire you and
they never come back to you right but
when you do a freelancing and you know
you work a full-time job and you know
you can only do this on the nighttime or
weekends be honest with that person be
like listen man this this work that I'm
doing for you
I could be charging you you know a
hundred two hundred dollars per hour
because you're getting a really good
deal this huh
you be like yo this how much I'm getting
paid at my job but because I'm doing it
basically part-time for you I'll charge
you forty five fifty you got a saying
like that's how you hit them in the head
but at least you're being honest with
them you know how good is getting a PhD
in computer science I think if you're
getting a PhD is like you want to become
a college professor you want to do
something like that like you know what I
mean like it's just no point to me I
don't see a point unless you're one of
those people that be like hey man I just
want to get more knowledge I want to be
more knowledgeable like that's it
guys gotta listen to college dropout
there's a escape from Kanye West where
he goes like he does like man what was
it that he said he says something like
oh yeah he's like man my dad was the
smartest man in the world he you know he
read thousands of books he you know he
got a bachelor's and associates a
master's a PhD a doctorate and you know
nowadays you know what you know he what
he uses his his degrees it's like he
uses it you know to keep himself warm
cuz he lives under the bridge like these
people will like that how many people
out there have like a whole bunch of
degrees and our meaningless like they
have nothing to do just because they're
like oh yeah I wanted to go to to school
to you know I wanted to become ultra
polish on Tripoli gist we hot right now
what you know about that kid we hot
right now new subscribers all the time
yeah we hot right now man I'm looking at
myself in this video yeah I imagine
people be like man this guy's crazy
I've never seen a developer like this
it's like man you never been to the hood
man you know we've been to the spot you
never been to the Slauson hey we hot
right now kit listen we going up
everyday we are about to start touching
2,000 subscribers per month which is is
is good let's just say is good which
means buddy I feel like by the end this
year I wouldn't be surprised we have
like 30,000 50,000 subscribers you know
what I mean I people don't do that in in
a year you know what I mean unless
you're doing like shenanigans and you're
doing like dumb on the internet
that goes we have
oh man yeah yeah no I think we
definitely doing good man yeah the guy
goes I yell you know what keeps me warm
those degrees like yeah I forgot what
the how the the thing actually goes but
I know it's like the guy got mad degrees
things like now he uses it to keep warm
let me see yo can I start applying with
knowledge but without my own projects I
see people try to do that all the time
you know who try to do that all the time
college graduates all the time they come
in with no projects zero projects
there's the problem of college all this
computer science majors right you gotta
understand this unless you come from MIT
Stanford freaking you know the big
colleges you know freaking Boston
University like if you don't come from
like legit colleges that that are like
known for releasing like the best of the
best in technology and you go to an
interview without no projects no nothing
you ain't getting hired you get what I'm
saying like all of this College like
graduates even you know even the last
kid even the last company I was working
for one of the kids the kid that got
hired like if it wasn't because I was
like yeah you know what hire this kid he
wasn't gonna get hired because he had no
experience had never done anything on
the web he had never done any projects
at all he's like bro how are you going
to interviews just by saying hey I have
a college degree but I have no projects
to show for like coming to the interview
with a Raspberry Pi or something
you get what I'm saying like come in
with a little robot that comes
rolls and be like hi you know there is
something show us something that you
know how to code or or something you
know what I mean college graduates come
in and they think like the African
degree means something it doesn't mean
anything compared to when somebody comes
in with a whole bunch of projects like I
tell you guys build your your portfolio
build your portfolio build your projects
because when you come in and you show
that hey man I did 30 different websites
you know what I mean I did you know
website for client side a website for
family I did websites for myself I built
my own arm application that I make money
if you come in and you tell somebody
yeah I got my own website online that I
built in it generates five hundred
dollars a month it's not much but I you
know if I scale it it can be something
people will you know they that raises
eyebrows I'm like oh wow so he's
building stuff that's being productive
and and profitable but people show up
with hey here's my computer science
degree here's my computer science degree
I know you know I know thirty different
algorithms and that's in and as I bro
you're not getting higher man you know
that's why a lot of this this computer
science majors man they straight up
going to boot camps man because they
don't even have projects you know what I
mean and they know how to code but you
gotta have you know you gotta have
something to show for cuz it's like if I
show up and I say all I got is my
knowledge but this guy shows up with
knowledge and something physically the
guy that shows up with something
physical or something that he could show
for is the one that's gonna get higher
then I say my project from school such a
mistake now I got so many from tutorials
gotta organize a man is it a good idea
to put tutorial projects in my portfolio
yes you can do it but you also gotta
alter them you can come in and do a
tutorial right let's say for example
this is what we building and let me
share this ok so this is what we
building right let's say I come here and
I'm building this website you know for a
Ruby on Rails course alright you can
take everything that's in here and
change it around change the image change
the colors change the name instead of
saying Craigslist put in Johnny's list
but ain't no Java dawa do whatever
yabba-dabba-doo listings you know what I
mean fer Flintstones listings whatever
you decide to put right it doesn't have
to be the same thing you know I see
people that come in and have like cope
steals projects or they have our
freaking what is this guy's name I can't
remember Steven gratis courses on their
portfolio and they look exactly like the
ones from the portfolio be smart change
it around play around with it do a
couple of things change the font make it
look different you know reuse that same
code for another type of application you
know don't don't show the same thing as
what if somebody is out there it has the
same thing as you and you come in and ya
both have the same project you'd be
surprised that happens
you probably think like oh man nobody
knows about Cold Steel nobody knows
about Steven Grider nobody knows about
coding freeze
you'd be surprised how many people know
about a lot of this instructors out here
you know what I mean so it's like
they're gonna be like oh he just did the
same thing as this other guy like you
don't want to do that you want to have
you want to edit it just change it a
little bit you don't have you don't have
to scrap it because it'll be done to
scrap it because you actually built that
even though you you built it with
somebody or guiding you through it you
built it that's your project you own
that but what you need to show is that
it looks a little bit different man let
me see Hey Joe what you think of
building our website portfolio while
learning yeah of course you're supposed
to build your portfolio even before you
even start learning just like buy your
domain or something yeah let me see what
else
Brandon King exactly if they could
Google your project it looks bad yeah by
the way I do have CSS grids on the
website for those of you guys are
interested man break it down let me see
what else is that okay so
website design is actually the way they
look on dribble yeah you could do it
what you can't do this or resell it you
can't come in and resell somebody's work
unless you reach out to to the michaelis
to the artist you can't come in and be
like oh I'm selling this this design to
somebody I'm not you know what I mean
it's like me whenever I come in and I
ask something from dribble I sent a
message to the owner and get you know
information for number like okay can I
use this for one of my courses they'll
be like yes or if I haven't reached out
to them and I use it I make sure that it
is like free because all the stuff
that's on dribble is free like all those
things get put on there and they're free
like there's no copyright to it what has
copyright like let's say an example
somebody comes in and has a website
right I have two designs for coding
phase comm that are original designs and
everything is original for me right
let's say somebody comes and takes my
design
right I can sue them and be like hey man
you stole my design and used it for your
company you get sued but if I come in
and I use somebody's redesign that's not
a real design that's a that's like
that's like a copy of a design that's
already made you know what I'm saying
like it's an original copy but is a
redesign it's like you wasn't gonna sell
that you wasn't gonna reuse that you
know what I mean like that's why you put
it online so yeah you could copy that
and use it but even at that I will still
contact the designer from dribblin be
like hey man
I'm using this just for for me to show
that I can build it and most of the
designers is gonna be excited cuz
they're like oh wow you know they create
something and it's cool to create it in
an image but when you see it
in live-action you show them a hey man
this is why I built from your design
what you think you know they they get
excited it right oh wow this is nice
you got what I'm saying yeah I mean if
you put in on your portfolio listen
nobody's gonna be nobody out there is
like searching for people be like oh my
god who took my design cuz millions of
people take people's designs like you're
not selling your course you're not
selling another course you're not
selling your your your website you're
just putting it as a portfolio to show
that you can build it you're not taking
the design and saying hey this design is
mine this website is mine all you're
doing is pretty much just saying hey I
can build this website out of this
design which is different you know what
I mean
Coenen face I was wondering if you're
going to make any back-end course like
MongoDB or other back-end stuff such
because most companies are asking for no
GS in MongoDB etc I mean I already
didn't OGS course and I released it I
took it back down because I wanted to do
a better course for it like that course
was like literally the first course that
I built so I was like you know what like
I could do way better than that plus is
I could come in and break it down easier
there was people having trouble
installing MPM and doing all that stuff
and I was like really getting annoyed
with teaching people how to install
nodejs I was like you know what I'm not
gonna do this I don't want to be dealing
with this stuff that's why most
instructors what they do is they teach
you with how you call is cloud 9 so they
could wash their hands like when you
dealing with no GS you could work on my
computer it could not work on your
computer you might be downloading the
wrong version you might be downloading
the wrong package so a whole bunch of
stuff that could happen wrong right your
computer might not have Python your
computer might not have distance in that
so it's like I didn't want to be dealing
with that so I'll say you know what I
don't want to deal with this stuff I'm
gonna do on no TS course the basics and
then I'm gonna do I an Adonis GS the
framework course which is in no GS but
as far as like nodejs and MongoDB you
gotta kind of do your research on that
because that's not really like a true
statement most company is looking for
that what they do is they put that on
the descriptions and the person who puts
in the description is usually like how
you call as a that wasn't even as a
recruiter or somebody from HR who don't
even know what nodejs is like I could
come in and say hey we need an extra guy
to come in and work and we just want him
to know the basics of no GS
and maybe even know a little bit of
MongoDB and then now the recruiter comes
in and says we're looking for somebody
that knows Ruby Python nodejs a MongoDB
my sequel Postgres 30,000 30,000
different technologies and then when you
go to the interview they'll be like oh
yeah we we basically use dotnet here and
there's like so why were you asking
about 30,000 different technologies oh
we just you know those are like bonuses
like what do you mean is a bonus like
you know what I'm saying like that makes
people nervous they go into interviews
and be like oh my god I don't know this
I don't know this I don't know this and
it's like for a job that you was gonna
get hired you didn't even know need to
know none of that stuff
a lot of people don't even get to apply
because of it you know that's a way to
weed out people you get what I'm saying
like so you gotta do your research on
that unless it says no js' developer
then I will say okay you need to know it
but most of these companies they put no
GS for MPM they don't even know the
difference how to put in NPM and and no
GS when I you know HR person comes in
I wish and says are you ever going back
to working for a company I don't know
maybe in the future it depends it has to
be a cool company you know I was looking
over here online Priceline is hiring out
here in Connecticut ESPN is hiring out
here in Connecticut and I was looking at
the description everything that they had
your boy checks right right into it is I
hate I fit into that effort into that
effort in today so I could most likely
get all those jobs but do I want to go
into a nine-to-five right now nah I have
a lot of projects that I'm building
right now so once I finished building
all those projects and that's another
thing to once I built like when I feel
like I've built every single technology
or every course for web development that
you could think of then I'll go back to
work cuz then I'll have everything that
you guys need right to start going in
and get jobs and alerting that you need
to do and then I could walk away from
the side and then just work on a course
like part-time right now I need to work
full-time and knock out all the courses
that are are really important for you
guys to know if I was to be doing this
stuff I I probably wouldn't be able to
do none of the courses I would have
probably still been doing JavaScript
right now if I was still working full
time you know what I mean we're talking
about that is why it's been like an hour
I've been here Brandon was a Michael on
Drowsy it's like yo you got a long lunch
