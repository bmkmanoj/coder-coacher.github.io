programming channels called YouTube
emblems so this little YouTube business
of ours is now multi-channel this okay
how does a fan feel about this how do I
feel about this to be honest the only
reason why I'm sharing this video I'm
talking about this this new video that
are fun front function released and deaf
tips also day like up how you call it's
like a uh interview on demand I guess
it's like an introduction or why you
know he's letting them take over the
channel and I'm gonna be 100% honest
with you guys
personally I don't think it's a good fit
I like fun fun function for what he does
right it's a more technical channel it
goes more into details as far as like
programming but this is not taking
anything away from him and you know and
everything that he's done but this a
little sauce it's a little flavor that
that Travis had you know what I mean
like I don't know I feel like we need
some type of explanation from Travis
like what happened in his life like what
was it you know what I mean like from
the whole situation where he was talking
about like oh man that he's going
through stuff when it comes to gaming
like gaming addiction like I just I I
don't understand it as a youtuber who
has the side business who has multiple
clients who also has a wife who also has
a kid has another kid on the way I don't
understand how you build something and
then after you do all the work that
you've done over the years and in
and subscribe to you not really to
anybody else or you know like YouTube is
very how you call this youtubers caught
you - you know what I'm saying like you
to so pretty much it's like right now if
I have my channel this is coding phase
calm and the next thing that you know is
you come here and then you see Erin and
beta on my channel people is gonna be
like yo what the hell's going on why is
Erin beta encoding phases Channel and
then three four months later I come in I
do it interview and um and and then it's
like hey guys
Erin and baby that's taking over coding
phase people's gonna be like wait wait
wait wait hold on we didn't subscribe to
airing in beta and Erin I love you you
know what I mean I'm bringing you as an
example because we're totally different
like you know how channels are
completely different right
we have different styles different
Cadence's you know and that's how I feel
about this whole situation we're fun fun
function taking over def tips and the
reason why I feel certain way about it
because I have that def tips is like I
hold it to such a high standard that the
only way for somebody to take over the
channel has to have a similar
personality has to have cool I don't
like like make the the the programming
videos fun and and just like I don't
know maybe I think the only person that
could really take over def tips channel
is maybe Mackenzie child that's the only
person that I've seen that could I have
to say like they're very close to to
each other
fun fun function is totally different
his MO he does like his small comedy
things it's completely different than
what def tips does even though the react
videos the react series that him and his
other buddy were are starting to do on
the channel it just doesn't feel right
you get what I'm saying like
I don't know am I the only one who know
this is this and this is not to talk not
this not talking bad about fun fun
function he's like the most one of the
most technical guys out here and like
one of the most experienced developers
that I take my hat off what I do it I do
he knows way more than me you got what I
said he said oh gee you know what I mean
like he worked at Spotify he worked a
lot of companies and out is that on
Quora
he's like the og triple og you got what
I'm saying like you say one of the big
boys right but I find that in YouTube
this first word in - right
it's the you and then the - so it's like
that's not you yeah is it like I
subscribe to to deaf tips you know I
mean like I subscribe to deficit and
subscribe to fun fun function and I
don't think like the personality is
gonna match on the channel the type of
way how they do videos is gonna match to
the quality and the style of deaf tips I
would really love to hear from from
Travis like what happened you gonna say
like did he feel that he had a lot of
pressure on him like man I I can't do
this like oh man I'm working on Google
I'm working on this I'm where I'm gaming
too much like leave the mouse down for a
second and like talk to the peoples cuz
I feel like none of us have gotten a
real video from Travis really explaining
why he just left for YouTube
it's like the new Boston right the new
boss he left right the new Boston is the
og triple og before there was traversing
media there was two new Boston okay he
put into work you know traversing media
took the torch he's gonna you know I
wouldn't be surprised
traversing media gets the two million
subscribers by the end of the year
alright cuz he's that good right but I
will feel weird if I go to traversée
media
and I see simple program doing tutorials
on traversing media you get what I'm
saying like it's just not it is now what
people signed up for it's not really
what the channel like subscribers really
signed up for and I understand
business-wise is good but personally if
I would have been Travis I would have
just let the channel goal of you know
on a high course you know leave it alone
like you don't have to continue it yes
your accumulated 200,000 subscribers yes
you create an amazing community but at
the same time like what happens if
things don't work out you got an old
saying like you just don't give your
channel away I've actually sold the
channel before that was a business move
that was a business move where I got it
to a certain employee and sold it all
right but I don't think this was a
business move I think this was more like
hey man I'm not doing videos on on this
thing for like six seven months and
because I'm not doing videos somebody
could take over it and you know what
this guy is super technical were they he
knows this thing let me give it to
far-far function but I just don't know
man and I don't know that's just me I
want you guys to comment here and let me
know what you guys think about this how
you feel about that I mean would you
like if one day I say hey man I'm tired
of doing YouTube videos I don't want to
do this no more but would you want me to
give my channel away to somebody else we
want me to say hey Erin and beta take
care take over my channel
Chris Sean take over my channel
clever programmer take over my channel
you gotta have the same simple
programmer take over my channel I just
don't know if if that's something that I
would do you get a sense wrong I'm just
wondering how do people feel about this
you know cuz I'm an OG youtuber when it
comes to this right I've been on YouTube
for a long time been here since 2007
I've gone
different genres this different
communities in YouTube and this is one
of the first times that I've seen
something like this done and especially
when it's told hurt you know
polar opposites you know like totally
different type of people's like if I
come in here and I give my channel to
somebody as similar to my content in my
work then it makes sense but fun fun
function his channel his style his his
Caden senses his uh small little comedy
things like they're totally opposite
from what def tips did on that channel
so I'm wondering how do you guys feel
this is how I for your body as a
subscriber that's been here from I was
on deaf tips when deaf tips had
literally 57 people 57 people you gotta
understand like I was there for a long
time and it's the same thing as I was
this guy's name larry Codecademy you
know I was there for a long time you
know what I mean so even him he actually
he hasn't really dropped videos like
that anymore he dropped like one video
the other day about mechanical keyboards
and stuff like that but I don't see him
with the passion no more but I just
don't think he's gonna give it away to
somebody else
so I don't know I would really like to
know what you guys think and I would
really like to know what does what
happened to trav is like my life is busy
I think I can't just working at Google
traveling and doing this I don't see
that you you don't have an hour an hour
out of every two weeks to drop one video
or even a video a month like I just
don't yeah I can't comprehend it you got
what I'm saying like it's not that
difficult but I wonder what happened and
I don't know what you guys think about
fun fun function taking over deaf tips a
channel that's completely different than
he does so let me know what you think
