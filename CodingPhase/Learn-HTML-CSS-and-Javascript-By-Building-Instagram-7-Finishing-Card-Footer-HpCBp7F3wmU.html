search if the ground
stop sorry Bob hi I guess we got a
little bit crazy then this one
alright alright let's go to close all
the lake here let's do a folder image
see Hey alright so let's see card car
header now we're here Honus Ulysses
okay so let's call this content image
let's say content right just leave it
back now we have content and what else
so in here we're gonna do this okay
image source IMG poverty I don't know if
the file PNG PNG
all right cool
now let's open up the sass go to source
inside the card cool all right so this
dual counter image so the image inside
the content class let's do this with
100% okay why isn't this yeah there you
go
all right see you see you got the image
there right now let me check
what else am i messing
all right so we got the 27 likes and
definite is okay okay let's get back to
this thing um all right
so let me put this to the side okay I
want to click on it later all right
so we have this right let's do it like
this until another one let's do
description description and then we're
going to say this class like 21
all right so I'm gonna fill elects
whatever and that we want to say in
Scripture
let's move this just flutter right are
coming for a long description and what I
forgot the description we got comments
okay all right
description
all right let me see what else
one the description have two username
and then just breathe their shadow kids
gonna sing in the name and side of a
thing
and she wears these cold heart flutter
my my side of the bed
hard
it should be inside I don't know why
you can wonder how this always gonna be
issues guys like there's something that
you have to know because there's going
to be some type of issue I'm trying to
understand why this thing is outside of
it it should be inside this container
try
a compound called that sugar because at
a margin should be I don't know right
now
why the hell things not going inside of
it sometimes with HTML and CSS it
becomes a headache
a situation like this I know there's
something to do with the margin but this
thing should go around it no matter what
yeah
it did it but now's still in this place
and tried removing from the P scription
oh come on take this let's try doing
this like this on the car flew without
put a patty 15 pixels around
okay okay I might have like a set height
that's what it was
so that's why I was like you know no
matter what it's never going to grow
bigger than 600 I thought that that I
did that in the beginning so if we take
that out everything should be fine yeah
there you go okay sorry you know
sometimes you make mistakes and then you
find it you know later on which is fun
and you know I'm going to keep that
there because some of you guys got need
to see that you know code is not perfect
sometimes you make mistakes and then you
go back to when you fix it you know
nobody's perfect I'm over here coding
this thing live you know
so no preparation or nothing I'm just
straight-up coding all right let's see
description okay where we at like lend
ice we're doing this keyboard I'm so
used to the Mac it's annoying okay I see
all right the confidence likes font size
12 pixels see something's wrong does not
resizing himself
okay let me see
I'll put the license out inscription
all right what else size 14 follow with
700 which means we want to make make it
bulb
isn't in degrees oven
still should be resolved something's
wrong okay
sometimes there might be a little hiccup
with you know Linux this doesn't happen
on a Mac by the way yeah all right so
let's say I gotta give this one space
got dual 15 pixels add bottle 15 pixels
let's keep my plans probably less than
that probably do like a little 10 pixels
yeah that's better
all right after that a description what
else comment
so the comments is do same thing you
know your voice starts bucking
but this is copy this keep it simple and
I'll repeating myself but it's fine PMC
as we move this from the paragraph
all right
all right let's do where they change it
into Croce and then what else all right
so we got the form right so what else we
have here
that was the form okay so it's like one
icon input field and another icon so
that's the let's let's blow it by
percentages great part
comment class Hey no options now let's
see what else class heart we got to go
back to little font awesome
let's get these
okay
and then here we're going to do type sex
all right what else now say
all right so then we could do something
like this you know what we could
actually make this form instead of let's
call it a class form let's make this
form just in case if we really wanted to
you know pull something to a database or
anything or you guys might want to use
it for something I don't know does uh P
that yeah so you see what else we got
left
yeah I'm coming alright well should we
go to this day my style it alright yeah
looks like right now but after we
finish this and we fixed it up it's
gonna be legit so let's do this we name
this mmm
we just do targeted by just one phone
okay basically we do that heart
where's the same 20% back comment at
comm is the delay
okay with 60%
oh yeah that's option we go if I go
through this
15 15 million with let's do let's play
your line block because right now is in
a block so that's why it takes the whole
space each one takes the whole space for
we put inline block you basically
telling a hey going line and but still
become a block one for slowly is it go
stop all right
now a common tool in place
weighs 100 set all right and let's break
this up for each icon is break them up
and say FA which is going to target
although the icons that's a one size 24
stop big enough yapping this big
all right this was a little padding on
this
now heart relative pixels alright
now we want to do this we want to say on
this movie please hold
put this make this thing actually
smaller heart that's yeah
now this thing we got fixed because we
have a fixed way from this thing so it's
not being responsive
okay so now let's not worry about
responses until the next one next video
but let's keep on fixing this thing
moving it to the side alright the
options slow left right and then let's
do something like this
let's make this event or slaughter yeah
Thanks SP position:relative pieces and
I'll split them better
all right now this what we gotta do is
nothing like this key Houston let's add
a comment
um input input we're going to keep
adding five pixels
weight in pixels what should be the big
flop song that should be fine
corner zero pixels
