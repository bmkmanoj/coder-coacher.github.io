that you're about to see now just make
sure that you subscribe and click on the
little bell because that's the only way
to get notifications so when you did
freelance were you doing WordPress work
for people was there a lot of coding
evolve or was it just manipulating the
themes that you enjoy or was it boring
when I was doing freelance I was doing
some WordPress stuff like I did a couple
of themes myself a lot of times that
what I would do is I would show the the
client like a design if they liked it
then okay I will say okay cool let's say
somebody comes to me and say hey we want
you to build us a website for a
restaurant right and we want to be able
to change the menu and this and that and
we want to have our own back-end but we
don't have money to pay you know two
three thousand dollars or even more for
you to build it's like a custom back in
right like if I'm gonna build something
Alera Belle you're gonna have to pay me
a lot of money because that's gonna take
weeks to build and to build all the
features that you might need right so if
they don't have that type of money and
they only have like 500 bucks 600 bucks
700 bucks I would just go in there get a
a theme or let's say yeah theme from
WordPress that was about a restaurant
used to features that they already had
and then just redesigned the whole front
end but the whole back end was from that
theme rain meaning he already had the
plugins already had the menu set up I
already had the login section so it was
just like more I did the front-end I
will use the backend of that theme and
from WordPress and that's it and then I
will give it to the client that will
take me two days and I was like seven
hundred dollars right there
you know I mean like you can't be
matched seven hundred dollars in two
days how much is that I was like three
hundred a day or let's say if you work
eight hours was it three hundred divided
by eight
so that's like what 37.5 does like 37
dollars an hour that's not bad you know
I mean I see people be like oh but those
guys talking about they could get a
hundred dollars per per hour and it's
like you know what to do
more power to them but most of those
guys they're constantly looking for
clients right that's another thing
switching topic sometimes developers
come in and they'd be like hey man I
want to get $100 an hour now as a
developer and you're freelancing can you
get $100 an hour yes you can but is rare
right it's rare to find those jobs so
what happens a lot of times I see guys
that they're looking for those
high-paying jobs online and then they
don't take into account the time that's
gonna take you to to find that find that
that project or find that that company
that's gonna pay you that much now if
you take less you find a job like this
or you can also do multiple jobs at that
same thing and get paid more than $100
an hour right so let's say you're
working on a project for a company and
to tell you hey we need you as a
freelancer we're gonna pay you $100 but
the the work that they're gonna have you
do is super difficult which is gonna
take you all day and then not only that
when you leave your computer you're
still thinking about that job because
it's so difficult and so complex it's so
much work that you got to do that you're
like oh man
even though after you leave your
computer you're pretty much working 24/7
because it's very complex that's why
they're paying you are $100 an hour now
you can say hey I could take two
freelance jobs that are paying me $40 an
hour that I could do with my eyes closed
right and that's the type of jobs that I
like right when I'm doing freelancing
I'm not trying to do nothing complicated
I'm not trying to come in here and
recreate the wheel I'm not trying to go
in there and create robots now you could
keep those jobs I'd rather do for
different jobs for different clients
they're all paying me forty to fifty
dollars an hour and that's more money
than what you will get paid getting
stressed out getting worked out with
whatever your job that you do it for
$100 an hour I rather do for jobs that
basically pay me for forty to sixty
dollars an hour
I've from what I've noticed for me that
is better because number one you're less
stressed
number two usually it's like super
simple jobs like you know somebody comes
to you as I hang could you build me a
restaurant web app or restaurant
application or a website a landing page
hey I'm creating a new video game for
you know iOS I need a landing page could
you build it for me I'd rather do that
then go in there and recreate the wheel
right because I could do that with my
eyes closed I could probably do that was
like two three hours of work a day and
then go do something else or go work on
another project or come back here on
YouTube you get what I'm saying so it
makes more sense
some people they they get stuck an idea
of trying to to make the most money for
one single job but you gotta understand
the reason why they paint you a hundred
dollars or even more than that is
because the job is very complicated very
complex it's not a type of job that you
gotta be like oh I'll do this and I'm
working from home and I'm I'm just gonna
do 3-4 hours and now I'll play them in
and charge them for the full eight hours
it's like now buddy they're gonna have
you doing some complicated work and
you're in reality it's not worth it you
know what I mean because if they paying
you that is because they're like they
don't want to pay multiple developer so
most of the time when they paint you
that much is because they want you to be
like a one-man team doing the front end
doing the back end doing the database
uploading into the AWS doing DevOps like
you're doing like you wear five
different hats to earn that little
 hundred dollars I rather be
smart get fifty dollars an hour and
basically just do like something super
simple that I could do with my eyes
closed I've had situations that people
pay me to do work for
you know two weeks right for two weeks
and I know they have a project for me
that is the deadline is that two weeks
from now right I never worked on it till
the last two days I work hard for those
two days and then I handed it in so
meaning for the two weeks I had nothing
to do I had fun I was going out back you
know back then I was going clubbing you
know listen putting in that work let's
just say some people need to get their
backs checked out let's just say that
you know I mean so I was out here so I
was chilling right so for two weeks I
was telling hanging out with shorties
and at the last two days I remember it
was like a Saturday or Sunday it was
like doing the monday so I did the whole
project build everything Bill freaking
uploaded it and freaking put it online
and I got paid man money and I pay like
I think it's like $1,800 for two days of
work you gonna sing cuz in reality it
they were planning that I was gonna take
me two weeks I did it in two days cuz it
was that easy
now when you win a when you're in a
situation where you're like working in a
very complex application you can't you
don't have that luxury you can't just
say hey I'll get back to this nah buddy
you're doing a lot of work man trust me
they're gonna milk you for that hundred
dollars okay so you got to be smart out
