coding phase comm your boys back and I
didn't did it again
alright listen guys today we have
another portfolio another great
portfolio and it's from Jena Malone I
actually got to meet her on the meetup
that I want to you guys remember like a
few weeks ago maybe almost a month ago I
went to a meet-up here in Long Island
and it was a JavaScript Meetup and she
was there you know it was pretty cool
she saw me from that day over there
basically I I recorded a little video
for you guys just to show you guys to go
to meetups and you know that is pretty
cool but yeah going back to her
portfolio she already told me she's
working on something better something
you know more showing off her skills
that she has now and everything that
she's learned but I really like this
portfolio because it shows her
personality it shows that she cares it
wasn't like something like hey here's a
bootstrap team and here you go right
like a lot of people do that
right people are not original they don't
come in and create stuff that when you
go to their page you better oh yeah I
know it's this guy's website a lot of
times you see portfolios where they look
as if they just took it straight from
you know the bootstrap examples that
they have on the website you know how
you go to the bootstrap documentation in
the first thing that you see is like
they have like four or five examples
like here's how a navigation looks
here's how this dissing that looks and
like that's what I was seeing all the
time from people in the portfolios so
this is cool I like the fact that you
know has some nice navigation something
different has a name up here shows she's
a web designer live live and breathe to
create it's pretty cool I like the way
how things are made now you could tell
she she's a designer and she has a very
good design sense just from the
beginning so
as you start scrolling down you start
seeing you know exactly what I tell you
guys you gotta have like a little
paragraph just to share a little bit
about yourself
you know because what's gonna make you
different than from everybody else right
when that person comes in and reads
something that they say oh I like this
person I like what what they said here
like you giving them a little glimpse of
who you are your personality are you a
culture fit for the company you know
what I mean
so yeah and then it's like yo why do
print design web design email marketing
advertising design children branding
typography color theory product design
page layout motion design drawing like
there's a lot of stuff here that shows
more for her web design but the same
time like I believe that's what she's
doing on her new on her new website
which is to showcase more her web
development skills now mind you she did
build all of this stuff so she already
knows you know HTML CSS JavaScript like
she's already pretty comfortable you
know of course just like me just like
you she wants to also develop more more
skills and you know perfect them and and
become a better developer at the same
time you know as far as the design I
could tell that she already has that own
pack so it's pretty cool shows you know
the programs that she knows how to use
so it's like the same thing for you guys
you guys can put this as skills so this
is pretty legit I like this section here
you know the little circles different
projects that she she has worked on you
click there web design you know got the
sites you know custom on t-shirts a lot
of design stuff but it's pretty it's
pretty good you know like it's pretty
legit I think this is a great website
and as you can see hats are indeed her
behinds her email contact you know send
you right back to the top like a lot of
the things that are here on this page
you know it's like all the checklist
I tell you guys okay these are the
things that I want you guys to have on a
portfolio because it just shows who this
person is it shows them you know from
their skills how long they've been
working you know everything that you
might need as an employer to want to
hire them for you guys as a developer
most of the time you guys gonna have a
lot of more projects than what she had
here as far as like you know you want to
show them stuff like you know
applications that you have built maybe
get give them access to your your github
account little things like that but like
she said all of those things she's
adding it because she from my
understanding she's transitioning from a
web designer to becoming a web developer
right so she is in between that stage
right now so once she releases her next
portfolio I'm definitely gonna put it up
here for you guys and yeah man I mean
you guys can definitely check it out
it's called J Malone design calm and
yeah man I like it
alright guys so yeah make sure you leave
a comment make sure you give this a
little like and let me know what you
guys think do you guys like it is a cool
design cool website you know do you do
you guys feel the same way I feel about
it
and yeah just let me know what you think
you know what I mean like let me know
what you think I really like it when
people come in and critique it and leave
a little comment also we gotta be
respectful you know leave a respectful
comment guys don't go in there be like
oh I don't like this because this just
give us a reason if you like it you like
if you don't like it give us a proper
reason you know what I mean because
sometimes I'll be seeing crazy comments
out here but yeah man um yeah so I
definitely like this and by the way guys
if you guys missed out on you know
coding phase comm cyber monday 65% off
on everything guys like literally like
it was an amazing
you know a lot of people took advantage
and you know they signed up you know but
we still have it at 50% if you go
through the link below on my description
here or you want to say hey I want to
just buy a course on udemy listen when
you go in through the links you
definitely support the channel so it's
up to you if you want to do it but a lot
of people are definitely on this website
right now and look this is what I'm
working on right now so we finished
setting up this design store which is a
project I'm doing for the PHP laravel
this the final project it has everything
from user authentication to dealing with
eloquent migrations databases connecting
to a third party like literally
everything that I told you guys to do
you know where I'll tell you guys hey
guys go to dribble that kind of find a
design that you know you could get
inspiration from that's exactly what I
built here and everybody that's actually
signed up to the course is actually
building this thing here where we come
in and we connect to the Behance API and
say something like let's say store write
search that comes back sends back order
the images different day you could come
here and then pretty much say hey I like
this design I like this one or I like
this one like the colors it is so you
can come here click there add it to your
list right now if you if you not a
member yet you gotta sign up like the
whole thing it's a full application man
it's like we have checks and balances we
have you know user authentication for
certain pages we have a dashboard we
have an admin section we have a lot of
stuff in this project this is the final
project this is not like a regular
project where it's like okay guys let's
just follow along
no we're building a real project
something that you can use as your
portfolio we're using something that all
the skills that you're using here you
literally could put it for every other
website that you could think of like
sometimes you get ideas you're like oh I
want to create a
as a service for this like one of my boy
Jerry he hit me up one time he wanted to
build a website for you know I believe
for firefighters and basically it's like
everything that he wanted to do after
taking this course he can do it because
now you have all the skills now after
that after knowing all the skills of
like web development in the front end
and the back end then from there it's
just your imagination you could build
any type of software or basically any
type of service out there you know that
you want to create for people and be
able to charge like it's all you know
Forney is up to you you know this is
what I tell people at a time it's like
once you you have this skill doesn't
mean that you have to work for a company
you could work for a company to also get
some money benefits or you know better
yourself as a developer or you want to
work in cool projects whatever right but
at the same time you could build your
own business out of this man so you guys
check it out man you click on the
description below it's this project is
inside of the PHP and laravel so if you
wanted to learn a back-end language guys
the easiest way is to learn it through
PHP and lab rolls and amazing framework
guys like literally I'm talking about
you're gonna get a whole bunch of hours
like look I'm not lying to you most of
the videos are ten you know from seven
to ten fifteen minutes like a lot of the
stuff that are like super quick is
because that's like syntax things like
you know learning the syntax of PHP
those videos are actually pretty easy to
to understand so they're usually like
five minutes but once you start getting
into more complicated topics we start
seeing 10 15 20 minute videos so we go
really deep into it different day we
come in we have object-oriented
programming we have a simple website you
know the most simplest thing like
literally you could take this to create
your first portfolio put it on GoDaddy
in there from there you're good right if
you want to say hey I want to take it to
the next level you continue with the
course you have to crud it with PHP in
my sequel right create read update
delete that's all you need to know about
my sequel to be you know just be
dangerous with it you know what I mean
of course there's more things that you
could go deeper into it like optimizing
your databases and all that stuff that
i'ma leave it for another course because
my sequel itself is like a large topic
for me to come in here and teach you PHP
and also my sequel and also frameworks
like Clara like it would have been too
much you will be looking at like a 40
hour course like who wants to be here
for 40 you know 40 50 60 hours in
one course me personally I don't want I
don't like being in the course for that
noise you know what I mean like I like
to keep my people you know engage so
definitely check this out man and then
from there we do the same thing the same
crud that you did with playing PHP we do
it with Larry Bell crud you know we
build that and then from there we come
in and start building this new project
design storm and like this is pretty
legit guys like this isn't like some you
know some little project this is like a
full website you know it's been taking
me a little while to finish it because
we're actually building like a real
service this is not just like hey guys
let's build a to-do app like to do app
is not gonna do nothing for you you know
that's why we build the crud the crud is
just it's more like a to-do app but it's
just a teacher the basics when you go to
a job nobody cares about hey just know
the basics that saying now you gotta
build real things so that's exactly what
we did here man
you know we're coming here you're
currently I have a lot of stuff that
we're still building but what's cool
about it is if you come in you take this
course by the time you get to even to
the first project this course is gonna
be 100% complete right and
just the last project that is done a lot
of the people are taking a course right
now they haven't even got to project one
like that's how deep this course is a
lot of people haven't even touched
project one now we're doing the final
project I believe there's only one
person only one person who's one-to-one
with me right now
basically that's up to the same video
that I'm up to right now right everybody
else is like still learning the syntax
nobody has touched the first projects
yet so you know by the time this thing
is done you're gonna have all of the
stuff man we're gonna have a nice
dashboard we're gonna have a section or
you know where to create your projects
where to edit your projects or the
images like it's gonna be legit man so
our same man take advantage go to the
website coding phase comm and the main
reason why I'm telling you guys about
this project is because this project is
legit guys like I'm not you you guys see
me
you guys don't hype anything up only
time that I hype anything is because
when it's something legit and this is
actually legit man so you already know a
simple job back at it again coding phase
comm your voice backing out and did it
again let me know if you like this
portfolio man Jenna's killing it and
yeah if you have more portfolio send it
to me all right
love you guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
