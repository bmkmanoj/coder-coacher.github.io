boys back no OBS sorry OBS your a-hole
well your boy is back man we just try to
do a live stream with OBS I think the
problem with OBS is if my computer's
heating up if I've been recording a
whole bunch of videos and doing a whole
bunch of stuff like I was doing beats a
little while ago I was doing a lot of
stuff I was like work in this computer
and I haven't turned it off so if his
heating
I'm guessing OBS is like ie coal is like
it takes a lot of resources out of the
computer and this is just a little
13-inch MacBook Pro ok like yes it's
maxed out but it's the 13-inch it's not
the 15-inch is not the 17-inch it's a
it's a big difference this is good for
what I do what development is perfect
for that right but I definitely think
I'm gonna have to get on your computer
I'm either gonna get an iMac or this
might seem crazy
I might get like an old MacBook MacBook
a Mac Pro uh old Mac Pro not the new
ones the older ones I think it was at
like the 2012 2011 um I loved those Mac
books man 19 MacBook so I keep saying
Mac look I love those Mac computers man
Mac Pro's and they're pretty cheap right
you could go in there buy the parts
update the you know up day everything so
I'm thinking about doing it all right
because it's like I need the processing
power and I just love Max Plus it's
gonna be like a cool project it's like
hey guys look at your boy Joe he just
bought her a Mac Pro for like $300 in
and shoot it up to like 2000 you know
that's gonna be interesting I was
watching a random video that just showed
up on YouTube and that was like this kid
is armed
this African kid who pretty much
he was doing like some type of tutorial
but I was like wait what type of
computer he has and then you know I was
like being nosey just you know you start
noticing little things like how them you
know the Apple logo looks how this is
this and that and I'm like wait this
dude is walking around with a 2008 Mac
Pro and like he's making his videos he's
making all his work he he works all
professionally online I was like yo I'm
about to do that you know what I mean
like I bought this Mac MacBook Pro 2013
not 2013 2017 with the touch bar and to
be honest with you guys I regretted it
right soon as I bought it there was a
issue with this Mac Pro so I the first
one I went I don't know if you guys
remember I went to buy this Mac I went
and I got another one that had the touch
another times you had the regular keys
right so then I say man what's $400 man
is let me go back to the store change it
for the one with the touch the touch
screen and then pretty much so unless I
get home I turn it on I'm excited that I
there's like a little dot at the corner
of the screen a little little dot I was
like man that's normal man that's you
know it's Mac manufacturing you know
like somebody dropped is not that
serious over the past year that I've
been with this computer and this is the
very first time that this has happened
right the screen now has a line across
the street the screen like it takes the
time it takes some time to boot up now
boot up but like I guess the screen to
heat up or something and then it turns
on completely so mind you I've never
bought a brand new MacBook Pro I've
never bought it I've never gone to the
store this was my very first time and
I'm a huge Mac fan I love Apple I love
everything that they do the system the
operating system works perfectly for
right but it was a letdown and I know
there was gonna be something weird I was
like man I shouldn't be trying to you
know try to upgrade for the stupid
touchscreen I've never used a
touchscreen it's really annoying to use
the touchscreen to be honest with you
you know the little touch bar and like
you got a swipe left and right I don't
need that in my life I've I've never
really paid attention to that thing so
it's like I pay like a extra $500 and I
changed out of sinks the computer that
was good for a computer that was messed
up now I haven't been able to go to the
Apple store and exchange it cuz you got
alcohol year warranty where's like
anything happens to it that's factory or
whatever they give you a brand new one
they fix it or they give you a brand new
one so that's the beauty about Apple
that you can just go and take it to the
store and hey if they can fix it they'll
fix a few days there's a problem with it
hey man we'll give you a brand new one
right so that's really disappointing so
somewhere next week I have to actually
take this before a the vehicle is the
warranty finishes which is April
something so I have to take you
somewhere this week right so I will be
doing some videos with my Windows
computer which is it's not really a
Windows computer I made it into a Linux
computer so you will be seeing stuff in
Linux now for probably a few days like
they told me it takes six days maximum
alright and that's it right so I'm just
to be honest with you guys I was really
disappointed when that happened I was
like wait but that's what happens no
that's that's like a good story to tell
you guys sometimes you say hey man you
have something that's good but then you
say oh man let me just go and get the
upgrade why do like I don't you know I'm
good but let me just go get the upgrade
and look what happened to you boy I saw
the guy yo you know sometimes I'll be
taking him on like yo like ma
life it's like I always gotta work for
something like I'm buying a brand new
MacBook like the least you could do is
work perfectly like I'm paying you you
know a full cash I'm paying you like I'm
not doing no payments I'm not doing I'm
paying you cash you know I mean but
destiny that's the type of destiny
that's the type of world that I live in
was like it's never perfect and I hate
that man like yo oh yeah man so I was
just telling you guys that story because
it's crazy like I'm thinking about him
like yeah this guy is on a 2008 Mac Pro
he's good he he's chilling doing his
work and that's why I tell you guys a
lot of times people tell me I want to
jump into max I'm like yeah you gotta
jump into max but don't even go and
spend the money to buy a brand new one
you don't have to there's a whole bunch
of older ones that were like legit that
are even better than the brand-new ones
I don't know I think the switch
manufacturers or something but the the
ones after 2015 it seems like everybody
has had like some type of issue at
something if it's audio if is the screen
if it's something you know so it's like
good thing is like you always go back
and exchange it they give you a brand
new one and luckily you have a good box
but it's just crazy to me I'm like yo
every single MacBook Pro I've ever
bought even my iMac that I bought a few
years ago was used I traded a PC
computer I had I gave to do 300 bucks on
Craigslist he gave me the the 27-inch
iMac for 900 bucks fully equipped power
you know what I mean and then things
happens man you buy you're going you buy
something brand-new and you're like this
is brand-new this is legit you get home
line of death you know what I mean I
mean it happens to every company happens
to every product if somebody comes to
tell you hey man this never happens to
to Dell like now you're lying man Dell
the people who freaking you go over
there you you say let me get a Dell and
you caught something on your hands
already like that is it's a walking
virus you know what I mean
you go and but I came in I'm trying to
buy a ling novo lino will have the keys
don't even work you're gonna say like oh
I'm trying to go in and get myself what
else is out out there I don't know Sony
Vaio is thanks this anymore it's like
you go in there trying to get a Sony
Vaio the Sony Vaio don't even turn on
now aren't buying somebody spit on the
arm bite you know I mean like crazy
situations like that you know you know
how it is man imagine this you use some
random Chinese do that at Foxconn you
know it's like you're getting 66 cents
per hour and you're like man I can't
wait until I throw this loogie on the
screen spit right on your screen now you
got the line of death just because some
dude eating like his job and that's how
it happens it's not really the product
it's more of like people F man
that's why I think manufacturing should
be by by by robots and machines cuz this
is it's too much human errors in it and
people messing around you know some dude
on FedEx is like okay seventy different
different boxes from a MacBook Pro they
they get to the l2 to the FedEx store in
the FedEx store the guys on Instagram he
drops the high/low he drops the whole
freaking packet you know what I mean now
I'm paying the price
you gotta say like that's that BS man if
that bring the robots man so anyways
guys let's talk about some code man I
know that's why you're here for a man
sorry I'm rambling about my
my Mac unfortunately yeah I love max man
I wouldn't give it up for anything in
the world man you know I hear people
that tell me man
with the price of a mac I could buy
three computers I'm like hi man go ahead
and buy your three computers your
shitty-ass computer go buy three of them
you know what I mean but I wouldn't give
them up for night cuz it's like it's
made for professionals it's not made for
like regular people like regular people
is just like they want to go Microsoft
Word and they want to go on Instagram go
facebook and send a little email windows
are perfect for that when you want to do
like professional you know or audio
recording um a video editing what else
you know programming you want to work on
iOS you can only do it on a Mac you
can't do it on the windows no matter how
much hacking taught you could hack like
it just doesn't work properly so I will
definitely advise you buy a MacBook Pro
but what I will say is try to get the
older ones man that all the ones where
legit like you you can't go wrong man so
anyway so let me see who's in here we
got Ramsay Jordan J Montero Francisco
Caballero and Mikey oh hey Emma
what up we got new peoples yes we got
new people in here Emma what up we got
Robbie the techy shout out to Joe from
LA
Andrew Warwick space 3:40 Rohan astron
some well rode striker the dawn sisig
imide let me see let me see strike of
the dawn Caesar Gamache says how much
this guy makes us is web developer I at
my prime am i prime right the moles are
probably made
at a company was probably about like a
hundred and ten thousand at a company
right now just because that's what I
made that a company doesn't mean that's
what I've frickin made throughout the
whole year you know it's like my whole
thing where I tell people is like hey
man just because you work at a company
doesn't mean that's all your salary you
gotta be smart you got skills use it for
a whole bunch of stuff so you know where
we at now we make him a lot man we get
it to the point where to be honest with
you guys I don't want to talk about
money you know when you when you get to
the point where you're like wait I don't
know if I want to be telling people I
did actually did a video where I was
explaining my whole income I mean I went
into the things that I I different
YouTube the things that different
clients the things that I did from other
websites like Ed you fire you to me
stack stack stack skills freaking out
ebooks that I got a whole bunch of stuff
right that I did and then like they I
don't get making like almost nothing
last year right but all that stuff it's
like increases little by little little
by little so this year per month is
crazy right I probably make what the I
don't know I guess what I don't want to
talk about it let's just say I don't
want to put it out there I don't want to
give that number but let's just say fine
whoever has around I don't know two
hundred three hundred thousand
subscribers go to social blade and then
you will say
that's how much I make and then you
could you could guess it right
that's exactly around how much I make as
well sometimes I'm like yo somebody left
some stupid comments like yo you're
you're a bitter your channels dying and
I'm like I don't even know it's my
channel dying I constantly see new
people here my channel still is going up
now should it go faster than that you
know higher jumps cuz the quality of
concert that I put yeah yeah of course
but hey man my life that's how my life
is you know what I mean like I'm
constantly a uphill battle I don't get
those little breaks I don't get those
you know I was like hey man here's a
little sprinkle of luck nah I make my
own luck you're gonna say like I've
never had luck right so everything that
I do is hard work so yeah and like now
to be honest with you guys I'm at a
point where it's like I've gotten to
that point where you just don't want to
tell people how much you make because
number one people are haters number two
um people just look at themselves and be
like I'm more talented in the sky I'm a
better developer than this guy why is he
making this much and why his distance in
that and it's like yeah you a hater you
know what I mean so it's like let's just
not feel the hate so sodium and a
hundred ten thousand was the most I was
making last year I could tell you how
much I made last year when I was working
full-time and I was doing like my stuff
I made I got 174 so it's like I mean
that's normal though this you know we
don't see how how the income is gonna
look next to you you know I mean you
know I mean kit listen man it's your boy
job man we out here so I'm just
answering questions that I see on the
thing man but yeah we aren't to a point
where let's just say I'm at a point
where you just don't want to tell people
right when you making $50,000 you could
tell anybody man I mean $50,000 when you
make a certain amount you start looking
at yourself in the mirror like wait
should I be telling people about this
like should I you know what I mean
that's like a lot of times when I see on
on YouTube dudes that be like
I'll make 12 12 million dollars on last
year selling or was it some guys like
selling was it they Shopify and this
this and that and then you start looking
at you like bro if you was making 12
million dollars a year last year like I
don't think you will be out here like
cuz you start getting to a certain point
where you just don't want to tell people
how much you make and if you're
comfortable you're like wait I just
don't want to share this with the world
especially because of the hate and does
the people that be like brain you
shouldn't buy it is because in Africa
you know there's four kids eating each
other like you know how people will be
like you go and you spend yourself by
yourself like a expensive shoes or
something and somebody leaves a comment
with that with douche the dough sneakers
you could have paid the light for our
village and simple way and I'm like you
know what I mean soon as I got some
point you just don't want to tell people
so I'll tell you last year but this year
no more no more okay so let's talk let's
see I read some bad polls about juniors
yesterday already let me know what was
the post let me see Windows 10 man okay
yeah yeah the new max is is is if he I
don't know what they doing but I just
know that I love I oh s I love um Mac OS
the computer themselves lately I don't
know what's going on that's to be honest
with you
let me see let me see the museum reading
I'm reading any questions guys any
topics yeah I want to talk about before
I go into my main topic which is your
biggest problem that's the title of this
livestream for today let me see let me
see public figures shouldn't be
disclosed that stuff
yeah man you can't really you can't
really put so much information out there
Juan Lopez is like yo Saturday stream
yeah man
listen I'm actually trying to move my
Thursday stream at night I want to move
it to a Sunday stream so I'm still gonna
do my Tuesday at 3 p.m. but I'm thinking
about doing not this week but next week
starting next week I'm gonna do the live
stream at 9 p.m. or Sundays because I
want to give more time to my wife and my
kid that's to be honest with you guys
throughout the week out I work very much
and even from early in the morning
sometimes I might even wanna go to sleep
late but I wanna keep myself on a
schedule the past few days I've gotten
off the schedule
I haven't gone to the gym I haven't um I
haven't gone to the gym I haven't been
waking up early I've been working like
late night and I do the live streams and
do the nightlife streams and do the
editing and do uh answering emails a
whole bunch of stuff so now I'm gonna do
this like a a business you know like as
if I was working at a company so my plan
is to wake up super early wake up like I
don't know um six seven o'clock in the
morning and then from there start

laptop now touch nothing by five o'clock

looking at my son every day I'm like yo
every single day he's doing something

them to you know go in there when I'm
chilling with wifey I mean they're like
like that the baby I'll be grabbing the
baby throw the baby in the air catch him

somebody cuz somebody asked me Joe about
the the condo how is it the condo in
Dominican Republic so I wanted to show
you guys and somebody asked me it's not
gives me like hey guys look at what I
got you know it's like now people's
asking me like Joe you move it to
Dominican Republic you got a condo how
hard was it
I mean it's not that hard you know I
found it online found it online and it's
in my hometown of mocha mocha Dominican
Republic
yeah so let me show you guys right now
see if I find it via Karolina
let's
Evelina
alright alright so let me share the
screen let me see how can I share this
screen yeah so this is pretty much the
condo that I got this how it looks so
this is like the layout the Leo of it
it's pretty legit it's like you got
three rooms I live I should live in the
first floor cuz I do not want to be
walking up no stairs in Dominican
Republic when it's super hot so it's
three rooms they got warm room right
here in one room right there got a
bathroom right there there's like the
general-purpose bathroom this like
living area from here is like the dining
area the kitchen right here this right
here is a another living space I don't
know why this is a living space they
should have just closed this off and
made it I would have made dental office
maybe out make it into office later on
um what else what else what else
or maybe I only have one kid so I'll
probably just have one office either
here or here right in the medical
republic and what else so yeah and then
we have for another room right here
which is for the maid so in the are you
could have like you may live with you if
you want so the person they have to own
bathroom they have done shower so
reality is one two three three showers
three three bathrooms right it's not bad
it's actually pretty good it's actually
a very good neighborhood too
so I'm excited I can't wait I'm going
over there in in August I'm spending the
whole August over there and we'll be out
there for a whole month
and it's gonna be cool man and it's just
gonna be me you know buying stuff for my
new spot make it how I want it
hey I'm in Dr man listen you can't
complain dominican republic kid so it's
actually 40 minutes away from the beach
and like for any beach so it's like I
could go to either side of like the the
country and end up at a beach and was
cool that since I live in more calm
close to her mouth which is it's a river
it's like everybody goes to the river so
that's gonna be cool so let me see real
BAM I'll want to show you guys this so
you guys someday if you have the
opportunity to go go to Dominican
Republic you could go check this up let
me see I mean share the screen
guys so this is like the hammam it's
pretty legit and it's very close to
where I live I'm actually more of a
river type person than a beach type
person cuz you go to the beach to come
out mad dirty you come out with math
sign but when you go to the river you're
chillin you're right there man
know what I mean you know a couple of
biddies you know that that's my wife you
don't want me to go out there by myself
because you know it's a rap yes that's
the real it's pretty legit it's pretty
close it's like 20 30 minutes away you
know it's legit
and the artist it's cool man the J man
is a great opportunity if you guys have
the opportunity to buy like let's say
you live here in the US and you have the
opportunity to work here but you're
coming from another country always buy
something back in your country because
for us it's easier to buy something over
there all right we have more money we
earn better and we could actually use
that as an investment there's a lot of
places in the Middle Republic that I'm
also looking into later on and like a
year two years to start buying like
properties and buying land you know just
because it's like here in the u.s. it's
cool I just don't like the idea that you
gotta pay taxes like every year for a
freaking house or something like I find
that stupid in Dominican Republic you
bought your house that's it you ain't
paying no taxes the next year like you
you freaking that's a you pay you what
you needed to pay you don't need to keep
on paying every single year so yeah man
so I was gonna talk about this topic
we're gonna get to it right now
after we continue reading the comments
and and messages that you guys have
sending me if you guys have
oh let me see if I find it if you guys
have any questions ask me right now I'm
right here
anything you guys want to talk about
your boys here you know what I mean
you know this is this great man I look
at every time I look at my stats on my
yo 1.5 million views like that's crazy
you know what I mean like it's kind of
crazy
I don't know so let me see what up Joe
what I would I would I would up so I'm
reading I'm reading reading reading
reading room let me see there is see so
Tony Jesus how do you know if you're a
good JavaScript if you're a good in
JavaScript for a job well basically like
JavaScript is all about manipulating the
Dom right so that's what you're gonna do
in your first year your whole first year
you're gonna be manipulating the Dom
unless you decided to be like hey I want
to join a company that has no js' and
this isn't that that's the exception
that's not the norm so if you are going
to be doing front-end work basically
just gonna be focusing on creating
interactivity through the website like
you click a button a drop-down shows up
when you click on something this does a
request to the server the server sends
you back some JSON data if you
understand those concepts and you
understand programming like you know
functions variables if and else
statements conditionals right if you're
comfortable with that then you're ready
to start working late a lot of times
people think like oh man I'm gonna go to
a company in and they're gonna have me
doing so much difficult work and stuff
that's like for super smart people like
no like if they hire you you go to the
interview if they hire you that means
they know that you don't have all the
skills that somebody might be getting
$100,000 $200,000 a year
but at the same time he's two extra hand
this things there that people don't want
to do like if I'm working at a company I
don't want to be doing emails so who's
gonna do that you who's the junior
developer now you come into the company
you got hired now you're doing the the
little work that nobody else wants to do
that the main and senior level
developers don't want to do so that's on
you to actually to do it you gotta say
so it's not that hard you know it's like
the same thing if somebody comes in they
hire you they need an extra hand they be
like okay we need somebody to create a
couple of forms that's gonna send data
to the server justice and that they tell
you hey we have to design build it for
us because right now I'm the senior
developer I don't have the time to build
this the the design for this page I'll
actually have to do other things as far
as like you know my responsibilities so
that's why you got hired you know I mean
so as far as JavaScript you're gonna be
fine as soon as you you could go in
there and understand the Dom in you know
say hey if I click on this button then
another thing happens right that's
pretty much it that's as far as
JavaScript you know people think like
javascript is so difficult so hard
I feel like now they're making it more
difficult with things like webpack react
and that's like that's like more events
courses and more events things that you
got to work on but at its core
JavaScript is pretty easy so you should
be fine uh Nick Pole say
hey you got any tips for negotiating
salary first of all you gotta find who
is it
that's gonna hide right you gotta find
out who exactly is it that's gonna hire
you and see how much money do they make
how much money to other developers they
make how much developers making your
area and then from there you calculate
depend on your your experience and your
skills if you know them well that the
skills that you have and the level that
you're on can get you jobs like this
then what you could do is you you say
hey if they ping $90,000 and you know
that you have the skills say $90,000 all
right and then if they'd be like oh we
we think like you don't have that much
experience this isn't that then you say
okay listen I'll take 80 now you got
eighty thousand right now your next job
when you go to another company you would
like hey how much were you making on
your last job you've been like eighty
five thousand hey they might say hey you
probably made 80 another company be like
hate but eighty five thousand is the
minimum that I would take for any other
company for me to even see them right
and then you that's how you keep going
up the ladder right that's what I did
you know I started very small I started
at $13 an hour and I went to two free
gain to tumblr I went to Twitter right
and they didn't hire me right because I
didn't have this the experience number
wonder the the questions that they asked
me I wasn't prepared because I was just
like a self-taught developer and I
didn't even look at a lot of advanced
topics in JavaScript but I went to the
interviews so didn't hire me so I I felt
a little bit discouraging I say man I
just don't want to be spending time in
my house learning and learning and
learning when I know I could get a job
as soon as possible so that's what I did
so I said you know what I don't care how
much I make the next job that just hired
that tells me hey we want you
I'm gonna take it so I went to this
company I told her hey whatever we did
the whole interview they say oh you're
great we're gonna give you a call back
they gave me a call back then they told
me what was the the salary I was like oh
man I'm making way less than what I was
making on my other job my regular job
and I said do I stay home waiting for
that dream job or do I just say hey I
would take the the money that this
company is giving me and then once I
have that stamp move on and that's
exactly what I did I had the skills to
get paid way more than thirteen dollars
an hour but I said hey if I go to
another company and tell them I'm
already working at this company they got
a freaking hire all right cuz that's how
it is it's like people don't want to
take that risk people don't want to take
that risk with you in the beginning of
yourself to a developer so you gotta
force it you gotta say hey I'm not gonna
stay home waiting for this dream job
until I got a dream job now I need money
in my pocket you know so it's like while
I'm still learning I'm still growing as
a developer let me work on this little
 company get my money and then
jump to the next one soon as they give
me another job
and that's exactly what I did in less
than three months I was already out of
there
cuz I already knows I got $13,000 that's
like work in a everything I don't know
that's like a little bit above
McDonald's but I did I say whatever man
you know I didn't have like I always
tell you guys I don't have that that
little luck where people come in be like
oh man I got hiring in a month and a
half
I got hire in two months I already know
my life doesn't work like that my life
is like hey man you always gonna have to
learn Road so what I did I said I'm just
gonna take the first job that gives me
the opportunity use them for
recommendation and for giving me that
stamp and now when I jump to the next
company they gonna see my skills and the
fact that I worked at a company before
and they not gonna deny me and since
then I've been having jobs whenever the
hell I want so
yeah and so don't get discouraged at
first if you're not making the money
that you see online you're like oh man
guys in San Francisco making $200 a $120
and it's like that's them you know it's
like everybody has different situations
man it's also tools like you know that's
how life is man you gotta go in there
but you gotta know how to you gotta know
how to smash that lets match that that
and that freakin luck lady luck smash
her down properly like you can't you
can't stay in your house and be like oh
man I'm gonna be a developer but I want
my dream job first and it's like okay
that dream job never comes so what
you're gonna do you're gonna stay home
for like two three years now you go and
take a job I say you change your luck
okay how let's see what are the
questions man 84 music what up 84 music
said Joe's gonna look over one day his
son's gonna be caught 18 coding future
yes like what happened now I mean um
listen if you say yes it is what it is I
think the beauty of UJS is the fact that
you don't have to use webpack it's just
like jQuery you could just put in the
library and then use it for that that's
cool but if you want to do anything
that's more advanced than the basics you
still gotta use webpack so if I gotta
use webpack then I'm gonna use react now
if I'm using I don't know like a library
where I'm like hey man all I want to do
is just see the end something connect
the script I'm not gonna use view I
don't like the computer this the V bind
is V V bind that I'm not internet I
wasn't into it and angular I'm not gonna
be into it now so what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna say cool I'm gonna use jQuery
that's it so that's the time
person that I am in yeah so if you jes
is ID man let me see they me out
when Lula's abandoning what after
whatever I would have what about up
island life
where man yes sir
okay
pipe hey yo hey yo aiding is a yo how
can I catch your Piper yo hey yo ate it
I don't know I don't go that way man let
me see I was as Stefan and
hey do you have a course on testing
because I hate it no I don't I hate it
too let me see what else Joe I'm not
gonna design but I'm trying to get into
an entry-level job as a front-end
developer will you recommend downgrading
PhDs and converting them to HTML CSS
JavaScript to add my portfolio oh
downloading so I said downgrading Emma
Cole yes Emma I would say listen what
you should do find a website find the
most difficult website that you you
could say man this website looks crazy
like there's so many animations there's
so many different UI elements in here
like go in there break it down step by
step each piece and build the whole
website when you do that that's when
you're gonna know like you know I'm
ready and I know exactly what I'm doing
so you can start applying for jobs and
get hired as soon as possible you know
as an entry developer listen you're
gonna be surprised man like I said to
the other guy there's a lot of companies
they're hiring people that just know the
basics they need an extra hand they
don't need an expert if you see if you
see this look anybody paying sandy and
down anybody paying $70,000 and down
right they're not looking for expert
they need an extra hand write anything
$70,000 and up they looking for an
expert the 70 thousand dollar mark
that's when you do that jump if you're a
mid-level or your senior level developer
that's when you take it to the next
level right but they expect you to know
a lot of stuff
if it's like right now if I go to an
interview and I go in there and they
they pretty much ask me a
bunch of stuff right they tell me hey
we're gonna do this one our testing on
you we're gonna do this and that first
of all I Maxim how much is the the
salary that you guys are looking to to
pay for this position if they tell me
it's not above seventy thousand dollars
literally I will tell them I'm not gonna
do all of this work I'm not gonna work
on on you know I'm not gonna work on a
take-home test I'm not gonna work on on
let's say a white board I'm not gonna do
that because if I'm getting paid this
this much like seventy thousand dollars
and down if you're gonna pay sixty five
thousand fifty thousand forty five
thousand sixty thousand whatever you
getting paid right you're gonna have a
position that's very entry level you're
not supposed to be working on difficult
projects because if you're gonna be
working on difficult projects then
you're supposed to be getting paid way
more so just knowing how to convert a
PSD to HTML CSS and JavaScript is good
enough to get hired for an entry-level
job everybody knows how this industry
works so they know that when you come in
for those type of positions you're a
beginner you're not a an advanced
developer you know if you are events
don't clap it up of like man we gotta we
gotta take this guy as soon as possible
or this woman all right so they're like
yo we gotta take this person but for you
guys man if you're a junior developer
and you're looking and you're everything
you see something like at forty fifty
sixty thousand dollars it's your first
job apply for it most likely you gonna
get it just have a portfolio have
something to show for and be like this
other websites that I did these are the
two small businesses that I did in my
area I did work for Johnny's pics areia
I did another website for a little
Cindy's arts and crafts whatever right
you say I build their website in their
life you know what looks really good on
a portfolio when you have real domains
like
komm a dotnet a.org ADATA oh right I see
a lot of people that they create their
portfolio with a whole bunch of github
pages github pages just shows that you
are a beginner if you get somebody even
if you got a pig your first year let's
say for example if I was starting today
and I was planning on doing a video
about this if I was starting today as a
junior developer the steps that I would
take would be work on HTML CSS once I
know how to build a website then I'm
good right work with interactivity with
JavaScript no jQuery then from there
understand how to communicate with the
back-end server from getting JSON data
to the front-end and displaying in the
front end once you're there you're good
your hireable
you're able to get a job now from there
what I will do is my next step
build a portfolio build real
applications real websites find designs
on dribble find the signs on on EB hands
calm wherever write find designs in and
things that look good to put on my
portfolio then take it up a notch right
take it up a notch and be like hey I'm
building
Johnny's pizzeria how about you gay
Johnny's pic Surya calm if you know
whatever it is right get the domain buy
it put the website on a real server
right do the whole process not just
github but put it on a real server and
basically just show a tool or your next
employer who I was gonna hire you and
but I hate yeah I did a website for
Johnny's pizzeria yeah there our website
for sandy crafts and koat-dot-com and
then now they looking at that like okay
he did websites for businesses not just
like stuff that he's doing online like
hey guys let's do a JavaScript clock
like nobody cares about that you're
gonna
to accompany nobody's gonna care about
that so yeah and while you're good just
listen to me guys
I always tell people listen to me it's
now because I am an expert I know
everything now there's a lot of guys who
are way better developers to me there's
a lot of guys that are out there that
are very smart but the problem is a lot
of those guys are not self-taught
developers like me right a lot of those
guys have not gone through the things
that you're going through so they give
you advice on things that what they
would have done and if there were in
your situation but they've never been in
your situation I've been in your
situation there's a huge difference
between somebody who says oh yeah you
know I'm a computer science major but
you know if I was self-taught today I
will do this and it's like now you don't
even know what you would do because your
brain don't even work like that you
never came from another career to this
career you get what I'm saying like so
big difference so listen to me you're
gonna succeed man I'm not an expert I'm
not a freaking I don't know I'm not Gary
Vee who's gonna be here cursing and you
know and cursing and be like hey guys if
you don't do this and this isn't
that they acting like they're you know
they're experts and and this dissing a
light you know what I mean like I'm just
some regular dude who's giving you the
advice that you need to get working and
understand what's happening in this
thing all right cuz I've been through it
you know nobody could tell me nothin
because I'm the one that frickin made
all this stuff happen you know I wish I
would have had somebody when I was in
here I had this guy that was one
youtuber who was in here this he's like
he's not black he's like a little he
looked kind of Spanish he got a bowhead
he used to work for Yahoo I forgot his
name but he was the only one that was
here but his advice never worked for me
because he wasn't giving me advice as a
self-taught developer somebody who was
going through the struggles of jumping
from you to me to coke Adam II to free
coke am too
every single website out there I went
through all of that I went through Coe
school I went through Pluralsight so
it's like I know what the hell I'm doing
man so let me see what else what else
what else what else what else okay so
what is the biggest problem as a junior
developer the biggest problem is that
you need the Vella prayer is number one
you're too insecure on your skills
that's it that's the biggest problem
I've seen people that are very talented
and just don't even go to interviews I
always tell this story and I always
bring it back to myself right for me I
could have probably got hired a month
and a half in I had opportunities I had
people calling my my phone like you know
recruiters people hitting me up and this
and that I didn't go to interviews until
like almost a year because I wanted to
become the very best developer out there
the moment I took that out of my mind
and said nah I'm just trying to work I'm
just trying to survive in this world
then I got my job then I I got to move
on in and do everything that I'm doing
now but it took me a whole year I didn't
I told you guys I don't have those
stories like you know this was not
Christian as hey I went in there giving
that perfect smile and they gave me a
job I didn't go to you know it wasn't
like was he the dreaded F somebody
called him up on his two months in it
and he just learned on team tree house
he just learned the basics and he did
bootstrap studio and told them hey I'm a
developer and he got hired I didn't have
that I didn't have none of that stuff
right I didn't have to the extra little
factor of luck of like somebody's in
sprinkle not on me you gotta say my
thing was all hard work and I took
forever to get a job because I put that
on myself I don't blame the the
companies companies called me up on
you know recruiters I don't blame
nothing I blamed it on myself because I
spent so much time trying to figure out
which one was the best resource which
one was the best framework which one was
the best way for me to get hired instead
of working on my projects instead of
working on my portfolio instead of
showing that I could really do this you
know when I went to Twitter and Tumblr I
didn't get hired now because I didn't
have skills and I didn't know what the
hell I was doing I went in there with a
resume
both times cuz the whole time almost a
whole year I spent the whole year doing
a whole bunch of to do apps a whole
bunch of things like learning knockout
learning backbone learning angular
learning what else I was learning out
there amber I was learning every single
framework and all I had was my little
resume that said I know amber I know
backbone I know this this and that and
then when I went to the interview people
would look at me as like okay cool what
websites have you built what projects
have you done I'll never forget I had a
little clock that's the same thing the
guy I remember the guy that's what he
told me as I came like he just looked at
me I was like it was like yeah I did
this with JavaScript man I did it this
way and you see the animations I use G
set for this and the guy was just like
he's just looking through my through my
stuff he's like like this right and then
did a couple of questions and sometimes
this is something that I've seen
firsthand right sometimes if you don't
have the projects that show that you
have the skills this is what employee
employers and interviewers do they don't
have no knowledge of your background
they don't know if you are good
developer they don't know if if you want
really have built good applications they
don't know if you
if it takes it takes you forever to
build something or for you to even learn
something so what they do is they pull
out the most difficult things for you to
answer right because it's like right now
somebody comes in and let's say for
example right somebody goes into
mercedes-benz sorry and they're going in
for a mechanic's position they've never
worked at mercedes-benz and they never
worked at any company any company as a
mechanic what they gonna give them they
gotta give them a test of every single
piece inside of the engine of our
Mercedes do you think that person is
gonna remember every single piece of of
the the engine now take it back to web
development when you go to this
interviews and they don't see that you
have two projects they don't see
something that they could say hey this
is something that we will have on our
website that he's not on our level let's
test them in a way to see if he's really
advanced right that's it if your self to
developer you're not events most of the
time you're not gonna remember all of
the different algorithms and all the
things that they're gonna ask you right
so to save you from the headache go
ahead build your portfolio do your thing
but be confident on your skills be
confident on what you haven't in going
there you know confident right so those
are the things that could say are the
biggest problems for a junior developer
just confidence on their own skills like
I say you know how to build a PSD you
know a website from a PSD you know how
to build exactly how the image looks and
it's better cuz you're doing a
responsive design without no design no
design for the responsive website you're
ready to start working why are you still
here why are you still talking to me
about how can I get higher it's like no
you're already able to get higher you're
just not going for the interviews you're
scared to go in there and fail if I
don't go into
to tumblr if I didn't go into Twitter
and failed I wouldn't be where I'm at
right now that's being honest you got on
say like if if you didn't fail the first
time the second time then where will you
be yet you gotta say now I get freaking
invites to all these companies you gotta
say like I got invites to f8 like
aluminum whoo-hoo here on YouTube even
got invites to f8 they wanted me to go
over it for Facebook that's the only
company I would say I would love to work
for but I'm not really in the mood to
work for anybody
you gonna say so it's like even though I
got declined by Twitter and Tumblr at
that time back in what was it like 2012
2011 2012 hey I got a job I got my
little stamp that says hey he's good
then from there the whole three months
that I was working at his company you
know what I was doing even at the job I
will be listening to you know udemy
courses on my ear or YouTube whatever
all YouTube developers on on my ear and
just have like people talking about Cole
all the time I used to be subscribed to
this was a Ruby Rose the podcast
JavaScript jabber the podcast you know
like all this it's like I went super
deep into web development I didn't just
go in half-assed him like I do one hour
he went I said you know I go to work and
then come back and do listen that now I
quit my job and then I went hard I could
have gotten hired like in a month a
month and a half you know it would have
been nice and sweet to be here like hey
guys I got higher in a month and a half
but I didn't because I wasn't confident
you know the confidence that I have now
like I don't care is because of the
failures that I I had already right
nothing could hurt me nothing could
really stop me you know I was like right
now if I wanna you know I love Facebook
like I said if
go to Facebook go try to go for
interview if they was to deny me how
about now okay cool I probably make more
money than the developer that works here
and go home with a smile you know what
I'm saying you got to start thinking
like that you go into this interviews
OCO I don't get a job cool the next one
I will that's how you got to start
thinking you can't come in there you
know insecure and thinking like oh man
you know am i ready and also to the fact
that like I said spending so much time
trying to find the right resource listen
I know it's my website
I know it's my website and somebody left
a comment tool on the was a frico camp
video that I say man it could be a trap
for people it's a trap for a lot of
people because they'll be there for six
seven months and still you give them a
design they can't build it it's a trap
right now for everybody
cuz those people would people don't tell
you is that they looking at other
resources there aren't you to me they're
on YouTube they do this and that now the
people that go to a frico can be like
I'm gonna follow this little thing and
it's free and I'm gonna become a
developer you know a month and a half
from now six seven months they don't
know anything
I know it's my website but if I will
have the opportunity to go back into
time and there was somebody who was
already providing me for a pathway on
how to become a developer I would take
it because the problems are you gonna be
bumping into trying to become a
developer I already been through it
right now even if you didn't want to
come in and go to my website find the
developers that I told you about already
cold steel Steven Grider uh who
um they haven't forgot that this Indian
guy he's really good
even traversing media got some good
stuff to write so you could check them
out check them out you gotta say like
not everybody is gonna be like Joe we
love your stuff cool if you feel like
you don't love my stuff that's fine but
fine those people that I told you about
so you who followed them and continued
on learning because the problem you're
gonna be bumping into all the time is
which one is the best instructor which
was the best resource which one is the
bestest in that guys we're all going to
teach you the same thing it doesn't
matter who teaches it to you as long as
you're you're you're able to stay there
and they keep your attention like I feel
for me what keeps people attention is
the fact that I'll make it boring when
we build stuff we're not building
something that looks ugly something that
looks like it's not professional like
it's not a real website when you build
something with me I make sure that it's
at the same level of quality of
something that I will work for for a
company and I get paid a lot of money
for it right I'm not gonna give you guys
it's like hey guys lets you learn nodejs
but we're gonna do it with the basic
bootstrap now we're gonna give you the
nice design something that you're gonna
go in and be like damn I feel like I'm
building a real application I'm not
gonna go in there and break it down
exactly how the documentation is I'm
gonna go and break it down the way how
you're gonna think as a developer
building it I'm not gonna go in there
and give you all the fake the fake
content like you know how people do it
they have one screen here with all the
code that's already pre-written and then
right here they come in and they just
copy it over I don't do that I come in
and I build it with you so we both
building it together the mistakes that I
bump into you're gonna bump into you
don't see that you're gonna be like okay
cool I missed the semicolon in PHP my
cold broke but if for whatever reason
the instructor shows it to you in a way
wastes complete
perfect you don't even know how to find
the error you got what I'm saying so
it's like I tried to give you guys the
best thing so it's like if you're going
out there and you just constantly
looking for the resources the resources
resources which youtuber which channel
guys you have everything here on this
channel
okay and even if you don't want none of
my course is cool get it from the people
that I told you I told you just get it
from Stephen grinder
Acco steal those guys like that's it
stop jumping from different frameworks
to frameworks all you need to do is be
good at one if you're really good at one
our company is gonna pay you to go to
let you know what I mean like tomorrow
let's say for example ten years from now
I'm struggling I'm all my businesses
went down I don't have no money I go to
a company how eighty-four music says hey
they tell me Joe you're gonna have to do
a few Jes imma be in their module few
Jay s with a smile
alright because I won't be like hey I
need training I haven't really worked
with you of UJS like that because I'm an
expert at JavaScript I'm an expert at
react so they're gonna look at them but
oh wow so we're gonna pay you to learn
this new technology or learn whatever
view 7 whatever is our thing 10 years
from now right so I'm still gonna go in
there and work on that you got I'm
saying so it's like once you learn the
skills from somewhere you take that into
other programming languages into other
different frameworks no matter what
because you already know web development
I don't just know JavaScript I know web
development you give me whatever
framework comes out whatever library
comes out whatever freaking language
comes out I know web development you
know what I'm saying so take advantage
so those are the things that I say are
the biggest problems for somebody you
know it's like you constantly looking
for constantly looking for resources and
then you're like jumping from place to
place and you're like it's
working on your portfolio instead of you
going to interviews you're just in your
house wasting time and trying to become
expert or trying to become a master at
JavaScript or whatever it's like start
building applications man so you can
understand how web development is done
you know also to like another comment
I forgot the guy's name he's always here
too
he said hey man there's no jobs for a
dynasty yes well there's no jobs for a
dynasty yes there's jobs for no J yes
when you go to a company and then I
asked you do you know nodejs they're not
gonna actually do you know Express do
you know a dynasty answer you know happy
do you know what's the other one um I
think it's like train or something like
that there's a whole bunch of different
frameworks every company uses a
different flavor of JavaScript and this
companies that they code you know raw
JavaScript with no frameworks it's just
straight no GS no framework no nothing
but if you know web development and you
know JavaScript doesn't matter what
framework it is you're good the reason
why I'm teaching it with a dynasty yes
is because it's a very good transition
to understand how web development works
a lot of you guys are not experts
wait you're not experts in in this so
you need something with structure you
don't need something like Express
Express is good too to start with and
but okay cool this is how JavaScript
works and this isn't that but you have
to build everything from scratch so now
you're constantly looking for different
libraries and doing a bunch of work when
it's like how about you focus on
building the application learning what
web development is and then from there
once you have your job then you could go
into a lower level of the language and
try to master it that's what I did I
come in here I'll tell you guys the
things that I wish somebody would have
told me that's it
so let me see what else any other
questions man
some breeding reading reading reading
reading reading reading reading
I don't know why I'm freaking feel like
my eyes is blurry now so let me see what
else what else what I was what I was
what I was what else so any more
questions made hottest culo test culo
maximilian stephen Grider we react
course is really outdated yes yeah this
other steven crowder got like four or
five react courses like there's a lot of
react courses and as far as like
outdated
no there is no outdated it's not
outdated at all like you're learning
react you're learning how to work with
the framework you know I mean oh so let
me see Tyler Benton says damn he
throwing shots at reversing media nah
hell no that's my boy he comes in here
all the time that's one of the very few
people that's like at least real in this
whole YouTube community now what I'm
saying is I haven't seen that many
courses from traversing media that's to
be honest I've seen his stuff on on
YouTube I haven't seen his courses on
udemy I seen the the angular one which
is pretty legit I added it to my list
because it's pretty legit and that's a
um I had seen a video of course from him
when he was doing what was a the company
before ed monix right he had an OGS
course there but that was like so long
ago that the the style that he has now
and the skills that he has now is so
much better
I'll be honest down one I didn't like it
because it was a long time ago
and to be honest with you I didn't even
get to by I think I had guy in it
like from like a torrent or something
like that I don't even know it was
traversing media I found out later later
on um but like his stuff now is the July
he found his niche he found his way or
how to break down our frickin tutorials
and you know how you call it tutorials
and courses like he's really good now
like he found how to break things down
he found how to do his presentations
properly you know like there's a lot of
stuff that you know it takes time to to
get really nice with it like he's nice
now he's legit nice you know what I mean
but I haven't seen that many courses
room only seeing those two one that was
super old and one that is the newest one
which shows like all the skills that he
has now and how to present his course or
it's legit so definitely will say go
check him out and how can I throw shade
at him dummy like I feel like Tyler
Bretton sometimes will you be trolling
me sometimes I'm like yo like I have him
on my freakin top top ten list like how
can I even throw shade I am
he's on my top ten list of courses to
buy
so anyways right
I'm reading a reading of reading yeah
yeah now sometimes you try to become an
expert man and it's like now man just be
be normal man yes just freaking be
normal just focus about making your
project stop putting the pressure trying
to be the best like let other people
give you that title like you work you
keep working you keep doing your work
let other people give you that title say
damn you you're the best developer not
you trying to become the best you just
work and let other people notice it and
then that's better you know what I mean
um Joe what do you think about web
developers trying to start tech through
QA testing what to try to start in tech
Oh through QA testing I mean people who
make it this is always room for
everybody there's a whole bunch of
different pathways like what I did is
one pathway right I'm a self-taught web
developer right I got into the industry
this way tomorrow could be a game
developer now my story's totally
different than somebody who went to
school to become a game developer or
somebody who spend their whole junior
high school in their high school you
know making games at the house now their
game developer so it's like you see
everybody has different roads to getting
to a goal a career so if you want to get
into the the industry through QA testing
yeah go ahead
John G Fisher says Haskell and pure
script what do I think about it I like
pure script
I like pure script in Haskell um I was
looking into it at some point to try to
learn pure script but it's just like I
don't know I was like his good
personal projects but I don't think I
would build it I would use it in like a
real application I don't know I just I
wouldn't use it I was trying to get into
Elm Elm seems very interesting and I
also don't feel like I will build it in
any how you call is like a real
application like it's cool to work like
a little to do happen this this and that
I can't see myself writing like that for
a full application a full single page
app website like I wouldn't be able to
do that
it's like gonna get really annoying you
know what's interesting I like I don't
know if you guys have heard of this live
script
I wish man this thing will become
popular man so bad because I really like
this this language man then we got 98
peoples in here
what up I don't even know we had like 98
a hundred something people in here um
yeah so this is a language that
transpires what compiles to JavaScript
which is pretty cool man
if you ever tried a CoffeeScript coffee
scripting and you're into that or you're
into like you're into Python this is
like Python but for JavaScript and it
just composite for you but I don't know
why it hasn't become popular you know
like sometimes there's a lot of
technologies and libraries and
frameworks that are out there they're
very legit but the problem is that if
you don't have that backing then that's
it you know what I mean it's like if you
right now we could create a library
right create a framework if I come in
I'll create a framework that's semi good
and somebody from Facebook just add say
at the bottom of the footer right now
I'll go and I'll put that into into my
my library's website like used by
Facebook
now the whole world stars using my
library you know what I say the same
thing that happens with what's the name
in typescript right typescript is cool
it's noisy it's nice but this other
language is out there that have that's
compiled into JavaScript that I feel are
way better than typescript but why are
they not popular because they don't have
that step you know not to bring it back
to you Jay yes I heard of UJS when Vijay
s was view one when there was just view
the view js2 that's a high Calissa a new
phenomenon you know I mean that's like
hey they said the guy was in the guy's
name even you so what angular was doing
and then he saw what react was doing and
saying I'm just gonna take off ideas and
merge into one the view one the original
one was nothing like react at all but
you know he got the little stamp from
laravel laravel is a huge community of
developers like huge it's all over the
world every like everybody who does PHP
uses laravel now right from personal
projects and professional projects for
companies right so if you somehow if you
somehow get inside of a library or a
framework like laravel and they cosign
you you're good your library is gonna go
up no matter what no matter if there's
better libraries out there like look up
react react this better than view but
wipe react hasn't skyrocketed
there is no
company behind it why the angular become
so popular
Google's behind it now they have dart
right dart is another language great and
they have this new framework that's
called flutter to create phone
applications now that in 2018 is bottle
go up but why does it go up a little
stamp that Google stamp so a language
like this like live script they don't
have no chance you know you could be
like the best developer out there you
don't have no chance you know what I
mean you could create something that's
way better than everybody else but your
library your language is not gonna make
it even like crystal Ling crystal Ling
is given competition to see in C++ in
and go but why are people not talking
about it how they should very simple
they don't have that stamp when you
don't have that stamp it's hard you need
somebody's just like how you guys are
you know your junior developer even
though you are super talented you
somebody who could do the job until you
got that stamp if somebody says you're
golden you're good then you won't be
able to really get it get your job and
do what you need to do you know what I
mean so it's the same thing as a library
a library without that stamp without
somebody who's bigger than them from
co-signing them or using them for their
services then you know they're not
they're not gonna make it
same thing with react react became
popular you know the moment that
facebook said hey we have this library
and then everybody started going on it
Airbnb started going on it um who else
Zillow started going on it like was
another one house comm started going on
it then freaking react started blowing
up there was a lot of people using it
I'm like alpha and this dis Annette well
until those big companies give it
a stamp that library has no chance so if
you have the opportunity check these
guys out
check this out this guy's out the only
way that libraries like this languages
like this get to make it to the
mainstream is when the community forces
it when the community forces say that's
why I always come in I make sure I give
a star right even though to me stars
don't mean but for the community
people are so ignorant sometimes that
you might have you know ten thousand
stars and people be like oh this is
legit it's like this thing called react
I be let me show you guys right now
react I be this thing don't even work
where is it react ID let's say react ID
is the first dedicated ID for react
applications react ID for development
this thing don't even work like this
thing don't even work and got 7840 stars
none of these people that gave it stars
got to use this this is like a cool idea
somebody took a pictures I owe this one
what would be cool wouldn't it be cool
we had an idea for react and then people
started giving the stars cuz yes we like
the idea but this don't even work so why
are we giving it stars you got on saying
so yeah man it's crazy but that's the
world that we live in kids we live in a
world where whoever has the most stars
whoever gets that stamp from a bigger
company they become the leaders in the
industry right that's it
I told you guys last year I told people
you know even with UJS before you
started popping off I say yo
watch the moment the guys are laravel
decided to prove you jes ask their
official framework their front-end
framework that even have react look it
up
there's a thing where is it laravel
missile Arabelle no Larry cast miracast
where is it Larry cast forum let me see
if I find it like they have the Larry
Castform
may echo financier Joe Santos Garcia I
can't find it um but yeah pretty much
didn't even half react there wasn't
supportive react when the new all
angular now angular the new Larry Bell I
think five point four or five point five
when they came out with the new Larry
Bell it wasn't even supporting react
they used to have this thing called
laravel mix now Larry Bell makes
terrible elixir elixir work for every
single framework so then they implement
the laravel mix because of webpack to
when they did that then they basically
said hey we're not gonna support react
we're gonna support view jes the moment
they did that view one like this and you
know what happens because people love to
start they love to go to github and find
out what's trending on get up and then
you see like oh everybody from laravel
is giving it stars so now it's like a
snowball a little snowball comes down to
the you know the hill next thing you
know next year is avalanche and that's
what happened guys I know about all this
stuff man all the schemes all the
schemes that people do all the things
that people work on you know
like come on man you gotta use your
brain sometimes man it's all about
marketing you don't know saying it's
like I told you guys to about some
youtuber out there I'm not gonna mention
the name because it dudes is out here
like Baltimore you know what I mean like
we don't mention their name so anyways
this is not YouTube drama this is not
drama phase this is literally people
sending me emails like hey man could you
expose this who you talk about this I'm
not gonna expose it I'm unless somebody
else expose the person first and then
I'll give my opinion on it but right now
since nobody knows who it is I'll talk
about it I'm not mentioning let's just
say Baltimore you know holding more is
out there so world amour is selling
courses or selling one course not
courses one course at a ridiculous price
students are hitting me up like hey man
we signed up for this thing almost none
none of the videos are there we want a
refund
now the person schemed it the person
schemed it he said hey signed up for my
course and you're gonna get it in a week
two weeks three weeks whatever people
bought into it remember when I was
telling you guys a few months ago I say
hey man this is kind of fishy this is
kind of weird do or people signed up
then from there when they signed up that
went in there
there's no courses now I was like oh I'm
traveling I'm gonna I'm gonna do this
and then I'm gonna come back I'm gonna
do the course and this and that
extending the period of the people so
they signed up let's say you signed up
in January first you guys supposedly 60
days to get your money back now we're
talking about March you're you're 60
days are over but you never received
your course you never got your course
you never got anything so you pay for it
60 days ago
so now you
wait it's almost three months I haven't
gotten my course I'm a guy my my thing
not only did I pay some extravagant
number astronomical number you know
football number it's like a football
number you paid to somebody and they
don't have the course there but now it's
over the 60 days how convenient
so it's like it's over the 60 days you
want your refund amen it's over 60 days
I can't send send the refund I'm
traveling the world I'll help you out
when I can't you gotta say I told people
about this
I tell people people were we're doing
this buying views buying subscribers
from India uh Philippines the places in
in Latin America buying cheap views
right I could go to Facebook and pay $20
and get probably about a hundred to you
know a hundred to five hundred
subscribers with that $20 on just heavy
rotation promotion right
well that's from India and that's from
Pakistan that's from Nepal those guys
don't have that type of money to pay for
a premium course right but why does
somebody do that why why inflate your
numbers and why promote in places where
they're not gonna buy your courses
because as an American you know the
schemes you know that people look at
things they look at the numbers and say
hey even though this other person might
not be as good as somebody else who's
good those numbers look good they got
over a hundred thousand subscribers they
got a excellent amount of views and this
isn't that so now you're some some poor
guy here in the US trying to find your
your journey as a developer and you're
like oh man I wanna I want to become a
developer you find this person you have
the money you even take a loan I seen
people that don't even have a laptop
there's a
I don't have a laptop but I'm gonna take
a loan to to buy your course in his eye
oh you don't even have a laptop don't
buy you go buy yourself a laptop on
Craigslist like what are you doing
start it start thinking with your
freaking brain man so so now people
because know that I talked about this
months ago
now everybody sending me emails like hey
sir mr. Joker you could you talk about
this could could you bring the slightest
is messed up
we believed in this person we want our
refund we won this in there it's over
the 60 days buddy he's gone you gotta
say like that's a you can't do anything
so that's what's happening right now I'm
waiting for somebody else to talk about
it and then I'm gonna expose it I'm
gonna be like yo that's effed up and
that effort you know F set up for
everybody else who's here
you don't saying cuz we are people that
are you know working here for for the
peoples and I told you guys I was like
yo this looks kind of iffy this is it's
like this like the same things that
people do with my marketing courses
where Shopify courses with um how you
call is with a real estate courses
people be like hey man you want to get a
million dollars you want to buy a
million dollar house with zero down
payment come take this course you go in
there you signed up take a some crazy
webinar where people telling you is like
oh this isn't that this how much I you
know it's like a whole bunch of pictures
of their own friends is like this is how
much I made I bought my first house with
twelve dollars and then you have another
lady is like who is like the auntie of
the guy is like I bought my first house
with fifty cents all I had to pay was
full of paper copy is like hmm it's like
what anything that seems too good to be
true is fake guys right when you see
somebody telling you something that it
just seems too good to be true it's just
fake so I'm just
for somebody else so exposing I'm not
gonna be the first one I'm gonna talk
about it
Baltimore listen Baltimore I got nothing
against you but I already knew about
these schemes I've seen it before
people have done it to me people think
like when I come in here say I've done
through everything I've bought courses
from people and people have you
know like can you go in there and they
give you like an hour of work you're
like wait I just make $200 that happened
to me when I was doing design and I
wanted to become a designer I wasn't
going to school and I said man I want to
step my game up I want to you know learn
from the a professional some do show me
a course for $200 for one hour so I'm
paying a do for $200 for one hour
basically like it's all about the
marketing it's all about the schemes you
know people people just you gotta keep
your eyes over man people ask me like
hey Joe why why is your core so cheap is
it because it's not good quality is it
because this and that
guys I'm not here trying to become a
millionaire like literally the money
that I make from here is to pay my taxes
for my other stuff this is not my main
income YouTube is not my main income
YouTube is great because it lets me keep
the money that I have in other other
places I gotta take that money like last

didn't you listen to me when I was
selling you months ago right come on man
you don't think you don't think I've
been through all this stuff like I'm a
self-taught developer guys I've been
going through the things that you're
going through it's not just like I'm
some random dude making up like I
know how people try to get in the game I
know how people are desperate and
because you're desperate people know how
to go in there in people guys you got to
start using your brain you gotta start
like you gotta understand how marketing
works you gotta understand when
something looks too perfect to edit it
to to everything like there's something
behind it there's some money behind it
you gotta say like there's something
behind it nobody's gonna do it like like
that like you know what I really trust
me so I'm adding the links click this

$500 $1,000 off you instead of you being
able to buy yourself a freakin laptop
you're buying somebody's course that you
could probably could have gotten it for
way cheaper we all teach the same thing
nobody's gonna teach you nothing beyond
what you're already learning from one
person like if you're learning something
for me this is same thing that Steve and
Greg is gonna teach you this is the same
thing that Maximilian is gonna teach you
this the same that go well
traversing medias gonna teach you this
is the same that are well switches
courses are fun fun functions gonna
teach you this is the same it's
called web development right so if we
all here and we all have we basically
say hey man on udemy you can find us on
YouTube you can find us on our website

that the average cost is like ten to
thirty dollars how can this be 300 500

so I'm laying you guys in yo John G
Fisher getting here man I want to
actually I want to you know I want to
talk about your job man how's your job
going I know you you told me you you got
that new opportunity man refresh the
page and go through there
James webdev says this questions for
Hollywood Joe Hogan
I got good question what do you think
about coding challenges for jobs hacker
ranked triple bite um I think they're
cool they're good you know I think it's
practice guys is the same thing as free
cocaine it's like you're gonna go in
there to practice right you get to
practice things that they might ask you
at companies but that's where I tell you
guys portfolio and skills trumps all of
that like I haven't had a you know like
a whiteboard question or nothing I
haven't had that in five years I had in
the beginning the very beginning but in
five six years I mean I'ma be sixty
years in this year now in in the summer
time and may actually it man will be
five or six years in as a developer I
haven't had any questions like that you
know that's because my portfolio just
speaks for itself I mean I don't know so
yeah you cool you could be in there and
and try to practice all all you want but
to be honest like let's say right now
you like let's say for example let's say
for example you are a developer right
you live in Michigan live in Michigan
and you live I don't know some city in
Michigan right and you're constantly
studying studying your algorithms and
studying fizzbuzz and Fibonacci sequence
and all that stuff you spend two to
three months learning all that stuff
memorizing right now you do that and
then you have no portfolio you have no
work you have
chances of getting higher now if you
live in San Francisco and you're trying
to go into Amazon you're trying to go to
Facebook you're trying to go to Google
then here I will say study that right
well another thing too is like Facebook
Google none of these companies is hiring
guys start coming in from you to me I'm
being honest
like they mad they're not looking at
your resume and be like okay this guy
never worked before he's never had any
opportunities he's never worked at any
company never went to a school never had
any kind of type of training not even a
boot camp you know like it's like the
lowest of the lowest you know boot camp
is like okay you have no degree you have
no nothing is like you go to a boot camp
release so it's like if you don't have
none of that and you're trying to go
into Google with no experience no
nothing you're not even gonna get
interview a phone interview right so why
are you studying like three months of
your time on algorithms instead of
building projects that could get you
hired right experience Trump's degrees
experience Trump's boot camps Trump's
anything that anybody could put in front
of you that's being honest which I was
like hey man if you show people you're
at the same level as them the type of
projects that you have is that the same
level as them said why would they test
you like they know you could do your
work you know what I'm saying so yeah
ramsley joining it's like if a job asked
me to do a whiteboard I'm flipping the
table and I'm walking out don't
disrespect my skills k like word and
just be like we out of here wait don't
talk to me about that not us that's not
what I would do I mean I am flipping oty
just be like y'all listen how much you
guys is gonna pay me I mean am I gonna
I'll be honest with somebody I'll be
like hey am I getting paid for this hour
if me explaining this Lake that's to be
honest with you like that's what I would
do um but the same time you guys are now
in the same level that I am and I have
six years under my belt and I have
companies that work for it whatever in
the whole shebang right but for you guys
you go to a company is I okay cool let
me try to do this and if you don't do it
then you know now you didn't get hired
right which is like some BS because you
probably was a really good talented
developer but you got nervous you forgot
to do a freaking the last loop at the
end et cetera right these things that
people forget and now you didn't get
hired because of some stupid white board
like so let me see
wants to come in guys come in hello yo
James what thank you thank you man
thanks for answering my question one
last one so we finished all your free
tutorials first or just enroll at your
encoding phase website what you should
do try to do the timeline well a lot of
people don't know or I don't know if
they know but if you look at the
timeline you will see that all I have is
just the name of the courses there right
when you go to my website I actually
have to fix this I'm gonna put links
every single thing every single course
on the web so I'm gonna link it to the
directly to the course how I used to
have it um a lot of the courses are in
the beginning are completely free you
gonna say so is that you go in there and
you're gonna be fine right so you just
do it in order you don't have to find
them you don't have to sign up until you
are you get you know you finish the
basics ready to Adam editor how you call
is a terminal like those things that are
free just knock those things out and
then you start with the HTML CSS then
from there now you have to pay for the
membership right and that's it
but yeah so we got somebody else in here
who we got in here oh we got Adhan hey
can you hear me hey Ilan was good was
good can you hear me
yeah cool here you can hear me okay call
okay yeah yeah I'm good how are you
doing I'm good man how's life man huh
doing good just doing stuff on the
weekend you know just enjoying it
amen you got to enjoy it a week in May
yeah yeah definitely especially from
work so so uh how long you being a
developer how long you've been in this
man uh I'll say since like May of 2015
okay so yeah you started working already
you uh uh no I'm just trying to
currently trying to move to another
stack yes I'm currently working on I'm
currently like a Java developer
company currently trying to move to
maybe like Ruby stack or probably node a
poly more to a porch Ruby since there's
more more stable mm-hmm I would say now
that's hot that's I think I think that
that would be a really good good move
for you plus you have since 2015 you've
been working or yeah it's like one
company for about maybe buddy here and
then got laid off from there cuz of how
their system works and pretty much
they're like an odd job for seven months
delivering packages door-to-door just to
get by and then got hired to another
company like seven months later
okay here and where I probably love that
so what part you from Oh from Texas a
Santana a a Texas you already know
that's why people's out there man shout
out to each town you're you know we
ain't here sourcing it you know set out
to the source twins man y'all hear me
all right so let's get it all right so
it's hot man I mean you already have
skills right you already know
programming you already know Java so all
those skills that you have in the
experience that you have you
easily transfer it to another stack now
is it's time for you to just start
building your portfolio as if you really
want to become a ruby developer the
things that I would say really focus on
a building full applications and don't
do what a lot of people do like they
create applications and don't give
access to the application right like you
want to create an application that you
have a back-end meaning an admin section
no I see I see a lot of times people
come in and but I hate here's my blog
and you know it's like the blog is cool
it shows that you know the crud you know
how to work the the framework you know
how to work with databases migrations
the whole shebang right but now you want
to have an admin section and you want to
be able to supply what was the employer
like somewhere at the bottom and say hey
here's the the password to an admin to
the admin user so now the person could
go in there and say oh cool he has in an
online store this is pretty legit let me
log in to the online store see
everything working they could add
products they could um check or what
product sold like you know what I mean
like you want them to see that you are
ready for primetime and you really know
the framework cuz in Ruby on Rails
nothing to that they really asked for
Allah is testing unfortunately they got
the r-spec and all that BS I hate that
part I hate that part of Ruby on Rails
you mean like the testing testing yeah
yeah actual testing so that's why pretty
much have to jump up on to that just in
case I apply for any jobs that may
require any testing libraries or
frameworks or that even at that year
you're fine because with the skills that
you have in the experience that you
already have they you know though if you
have to write projects you and you could
show them I hate listen I could build
whatever you want then from there what
they will do is I okay maybe you don't
have that much years in doing text
testing so because you don't have
testing that much you know will take
like a $5,000 if there was gonna be
ninety thousand they'll pay you 85 right
who cares it's $5,000 he's still gonna
get higher you know what I mean I've
seen people I know one of my friends was
like pissed off because he had guy in a
Ruby on Rails position and they they
deducted him like five thousand dollars
because he didn't have the skills as far
as like testing so the position was like
for ninety 90 to 93 thousand dollars a
sign like that and they deducted him
like five thousand dollars so he was
like a 80 88 or something like that he
was like pissed off was like rain I'm
not gonna take the job I'm like bronze
Tatas and dollars like you know it's
like two hundred dollars less on your
check
like just frickin take it you know I
mean so you're gonna be fine
yeah cuz I got my jobs I just straight
through a resume and implying so I
haven't had a coil to get jobs but
that's because I graduate from college
for the CS degree so that's pretty much
the main reason why they gave me a
chance no no I'm not one of the two goal
audience for this channel but I do watch
your channel a lot and your videos are
have all those gems in there and it's
just it also ends here and watch the
same time so ya know it taught me some
stuff that I didn't know so you know
yeah no no I'm really glad look this
channel is for everybody we welcome
everybody here you know I used to have a
a side persona of kumbaya Joe but come
by a joke passed away now is Joe
Hollywood Hogan you know what I mean so
it's like now we got a new character
coming in but we welcome everybody
you know um and at the same time is like
listen this things that I tell people
all the time that you could take some
things that fit for you and some things
that don't fit for you like now
everything on the channel is gonna be
for everybody
meaning like I might one day I might
talk about a topic that relates to you
and then the next day it might relate to
the the next person you know what I mean
so for you as a you know computer
science developer you know somebody
would have the CS degree like that's
exactly what I'd be telling
like hey when like let's say for them
who are self-taught developers if you
don't have that degree what's gonna
happen is if you don't have a portfolio
you're done you're not getting in period
now you because you are a developer you
already have a OCS degree you could say
hey man I know everything I already know
the theory I already know that the
destructions I already know I have a
history this is something that that
shows on your resume like hey this holds
weight when your sell to a developer the
only thing that holds weight is the
projects in the first impression if you
give somebody a good impression and be
like damn how the hell this guy his
website look better than our website you
know they want you automatically and
even for you to now that you're you're
focusing more on the website right let's
say I don't know if you as far as Java
will you do like spring or were you
doing like what what exactly will you
focus on well to be honest currently for
this whole de for this whole year they
pretty much have me working with
Salesforce instead of Java so that's
what much the main reason why I'm
looking because I'm using Salesforce
it's okay but it's not really my thing
I'd rather focus more on actual
development and front-end back in you
know so I thought maybe I can switch to
Ruby I can do more fun stuff in the web
yeah that's pretty much what I feel I
want to do but the the company itself
and all that it's like real nice to work
there and all that and it is a good
place to work actual work that having to
do for this new year it's not really my
cup of tea but you know it is what it is
but you know but mainly I also wanna try
to be more of a full-time developer
because right now working like on a
contrary to hire basis mmm so what I'm
trying to focus on is either try to
either try to get another job with Ruby
either remotely or in my area first or
try to convert full time so I can try to
do an internal transfer to another
project or team that does use the skills
that I would want to use so that's like
my plan either one or the other would
have whichever happens first and the
meantime I'm just working on trying to
just a brush up on any gaps I have my
web dev knowledge and then trying to
get more comfortable at the boobies
stack and try to make projects out of
that so I can actually have actual real
web projects to show to employers that
look I made I made these web
applications and this is what they look
like and they look like all nice and all
that so pretty and whatever so that's
what much Michael right now just working
towards that but out of that I'm
breathing pretty good hello
somebody got our speakers on please
lower it I don't know London London
London series buddy
oh I like that guy who said I look like
everyone class yes I got that before in
the past a few times - yeah it is a
fitting also some live one time as well
so I thought that was pretty funny like
who like who like what was his name I
forgot his name you yeah cuz you remind
me I thought you was him for a second I
was like wait he lose some weight
I'm like boy I get that sometimes - so
you know I thought it was surprising
yeah nah but not it's cool man I think
you you and the right path I think you
you know exactly what you want and
that's perfect is when you're in a
situation like I was in something
similar like that on my second and a
half year to like my fourth year where I
was like working a lot with this company
co-creator circle like they were pretty
legit they are a company that they hire
you and then they put you in all the
major companies like you know I was
working with MTV I was working on a
whole bunch of companies I came in
pretty name every single one well it was
like major companies that you'd be like
you put down on your resume you like
that like this guy is the J what a lot
of the times was through create a circle
they were the one that place me and all
this company's but there were jobs where
it was like six months or nine months
and or 12 months and then you have to
spend in like you know two three months
of not doing anything as you couldn't
find uh they couldn't find you a job or
whatever the situation might be right
so I definitely know what you mean when
you're trying to like jump into a more
secure position where you say hey I'm
working full-time like let's say for
example you was working let's say I
Airbnb
right and you was quoted a Java
developer yes you went in there as a
Java developer but you could still
transfer to other sections of the
company and but I okay I want to work in
the in the you know the Ruby on Rails
side I want to work in the JavaScript
team will react like you know what I
mean but when we're in a situation like
that would they just have you for one
set of skill that okay this is the
Salesforce guy you're like this is not
even where I wanted you know this is not
where I want to end up at you know I
mean so yeah I mean sit and then you
know you got to go through it but being
smart and knowing I hate I also want
more for myself that's the right thing
to do you know what I mean so definitely
so anyways let me see I got a couple of
people in here we got other we got John
we got London we got Mike yeah we got
Mike we got Tony we got a couple of
people in here London I had to mute mute
you out if you can leave the page and
then come back in so you won't be muted
so leave the page and then you come back
in with the same link alright so here
man
Tony who's that Tony dude made me yeah
who's the icon who are you a comic book
form I believe the carven and Holmes
hmm
never heard of them it's an old whole
cone hops the tiger and the kid won't go
never heard of that one
I'm like wait hold on who's that Master
Splinter I'm like oh man so um let me
see homie X my boy John G what up man
john g what up how's life man you still
in Texas right now
oh you can't oh I got into LA like about
a week ago for this new gauge so things
are going well so far it's good yeah
there you go
listen man your boy John G if you guys
not following him listen this one of the
dudes that I F with man like you know I
like John G a lot man this kid is smart
he knows what he's doing out here um and
you're from Connecticut so you already
know your boy got it so yeah tell him
your story man tell them a little bit I
mean what you bring up to him
how how's your journey boy yeah so okay
so I started coding few years back
started off with Python picked that up
enjoyed that started moving into
JavaScript for the web side of things
and let's see so started off just making
like making projects doing that kind of
thing
let's the obvious last time we talked I
was heading off to a boot camp I stayed
there for about three or four weeks
before leaving actually
and I basically spent more of my time
just building projects things like that
started applying to jobs and ended up
getting a gig as doing full stack out
here for using like Python flask and
Reax things like that nice so I mean so
what happened so you was just like yo
you was like yo there's Mountain yo I'm
good I'm gonna see you guys later I kind
of got more Skills than which you guys
kind of sees me is like oh I told you I
kind of told you when we use like you're
about to go to Denver and I'm like bro
like the things that you working on is
like so advanced like I don't even know
why you you don't have no reason to
you could have literally been getting a
job straight like you know but I know
what you were saying he was like yo
somebody's gonna pay for me and why not
you know what I mean oh yeah
I basically what happened and I started
like I bitch got kind of new stuff they
were teaching so I started not not going
to class and working on my other stuff
and said and then they didn't like that
look I could imagine you you in there
you like your way hold on you miss her
you and then like yo you miss a
semicolon at the end you you're doing
this wrong like it's like you already
know that you going in there dudes
it's probably looking around like how
the hell he knows so much it's like like
you already know what a shame you know
everything so you being at their mouth I
was like I know I was like yo I'm gonna
see how long he's gonna stay out there
cuz I'm pretty sure you probably found a
job before he even finished it yeah yeah
I'll tell you something too that made a
big difference
he's having like he's doing the YouTube
channel and the reason I even started
that was you made a video a while back
that was why he created developer shop
YouTube channel not watch that and then
the next day I was like alright I do
this so I was started on that and
then I mean spot-on advice I
tell people he would know man you know I
swear to god your people come in here
and they'll be like man this guy he
don't know nothing he's out here with
the fitty he know he's out here with the
Star Wars hat
he's screaming at the mic he's over here
you know Hollywood Joe Joe you know Joe
Hollywood Hogan you know what I mean is
like guys I come in here give you guys
an advices because I've already been
truly is now because it's like some
random do it just to say stuff who wants
to be talking here for two hours on the
Internet ain't trying to be here for
talking you know nonsense is really it
just works man you listen to me you're
gonna be fine you know the the certain
things that's gonna work for some people
certain things that's not gonna work for
other peoples but like the old general
advice that I give you is gonna work for
everybody you know it's like you want to
show that number one you have the skills
number two you want to build a presence
online you know some people say oh you
want to do a blog and this this and that
that's old-school what what is trying to
read anything you know I mean like
unless you're trying to make money from
advertising you you wouldn't even want
to be doing Oh Blas you want to do
everything he did to you - you wanted to
display your skills like those things
that I went to uh your channel I was
like why did this kids lazy like you
know it's like there's a lot of stuff
that you was in there like you know the
the neurosystem like I don't know
nothing about that right so it's like
you're way more advanced than me in that
in that subject right so I was like yeah
why is this kid this kid slice like
people should be watching him like you
know learning from from this kid and you
know look at that you already got a job
like it's crazy you know most of the
people be like Mina I kind of wish I
could go to to Des Moines is like bro
I'm going through that mountain I'll be
out I'm out peace I already got a job
thank you you know I mean yeah I just
reinforced what I knew already you know
but yeah man so housing a job man so
it's dope dope so right now I'm living
in a house where the offices I get to
wake up I walk like 20 feet I'm in the
office I'm working and we're hearing
like on the peninsula like Palos Verdes
California that's just pretty nice cribs
listen man send the mics and do my
resume be like yo yo listen that's what
I'm telling you man it's hot man when
you are developing this is a thing and
this is why I tell people like you could
go and become a freakin our own own a
freakin doctor or some crazy like
that right
you're not gonna get the experience to
be like yo I just went across the
country and I'm living here I'm working
I'll go downstairs I go into PJs you
know it's like it's not gonna happen
like that like this is a great great
community and great you know great
lifestyle for people because it's like
even like that even if he was working
like I say a pretty big startup the type
of things that you have most people
dream about you know saying like so to
become a developer
I think this is something that people
should definitely look into man like you
know you live in the dream world oh man
I'm proud of you I'm happy for you hey
Don you then you can put YouTube channel
on the chat because I think people are
asking about the channel yeah yeah I
mean yeah cool look at her ground G
Fisher I did a collaboration with him I
want to bring him back up even though I
said I don't want to collaborate with
nobody but with him that's my boy you
know I mean I do a collab with bar the
boy Baltimore out the freakin basement
is you know man god bless them but I
just don't like when people try to take
advantage man because I see right
through all our rules like right now all
of you guys are what corner cool premium
subscribers are right people who are
either from the US or like let's say
England or Australia that's like the
premium right is extremely hard to get
subscribers who are from America or from
all english-speaking countries right but
all this other countries man you you
could inflate you with your whole
channel and then now let's say freaking
John G freaking was to actually become a
developer and he's like looking online
he said wait this person got a 500,000
subscribers let me find out and then he
comes in tells you hey man you want to
learn this because I got 400,000
subscribers you gotta pay that premium
it's a thousand dollars per course and
it's like wait everybody else charges
like 10 to 30 dollars it's like yeah boy
I got 400,000 subscribers 500,000 people
they love me as an American now you're
like wait
he's the legit one you know what I mean
that's like when you
- - to the store I've seen the other day
I went to the Gucci store the Gucci
store has some crazy sneakers mom and
brain that matter of fact it was what's
the name of the school of the store
loading tater Lord and Taylor right I
got so Lord and Taylor they have the
this ugly-ass Balenciaga shoes they're
right and then you have this nice
ferragamo shoes
the ferragamo shoes cause like 450 ee
see I will cause like $900 there's
people waiting on line for it and super
ugly just because it's $900 people think
that the price is what really makes
something if it's legit or not and it's
like now it's like this is actually good
you know what I mean
but that's how we think here in the u.s.
most countries people go in there
they're like they start analyzing the
product and like wait why is this
costing 500 what is this one cost 200
people here they're like now if it costs
a thousand that's the legit one so
that's my whole problem with all the
more you know what I mean like I just
don't like when take advantage imagine
this you you're a developer and you come
in here and be like Joe I don't even
have a computer I'm gonna take a long to
take your course I'm like my dual here's
the course you know I really you don't
need to take a loan like that sounds
crazy you know whatever anyways there's
much more for that
let me see so who else we got here we
got London so London what up London
London London and in town yeah here you
know yo all right I'm not gonna make you
know you're not that good right now
you're good good okay yeah I'll check
that out I saw you alive so I figured
I'd just going in now there's a
supplement that's what I like to see I
like to see people in me oh yeah well
you ferment I'm in Atlanta a ATL made
yeah who are you
the Connecticut or I'm in Connecticut
man
we went up the mountains man we livin up
the mountains now yeah I guess you guys
are just stand-in here I've always been
a developer for about a year now so I'm
a career changer so oh there you go so
yeah so I was actually uh in claims and
insurance okay I was gonna yeah kind of
just and I have a finance degree so but
about a year ago I decided to you know
make the career change and it's been a
bit of a journey mmm so it's definitely
been real so yeah wait in Atlanta I
always want them like that
how's the tech seen over the 8000 we
have a place called what is it called
golly oh it's not take square with
Georgia Tech but you know Georgia Tech
is here so we got tech square in Midtown
then I'll and a tech village is uh what
is it called a co-working space mm-hmm
here's like one of the like the fourth
biggest in the United States I don't
know if that's true or not but it has a
lot of startups there things like that
so the tech scene is pretty it's pretty
nice here a lot of react a lot of
reacting angular as far as frameworks
maybe react is kind of surgeon a little
bit the anglers popular as well hmm
yeah notice how long that's women
started working already or you still owe
ya actually went to a boot camp okay i
watch one of your videos are the day
you're in the old video you are you're
trash don't waste your money and all
that stuff like that which I definitely
I definitely see you coming from mmm but
for somebody like that's a career
changes that totally get into it like
from scratch from nothing
I think boot counts really helped uh
their structure and they keep you
motivated they keep you going because I
tell you if you went on for a boot camp
I probably would probably quit or if I
wouldn't quit it would have took me a
lot longer or I wouldn't have known what
path to go you know I would have known
what to learn you know that's look
that's exactly I said to people I know
people might look yeah it's like this a
boot camp and reality is like let's say
is like a gym to a fat kid right so it's
like saying it like that is like me
saying I'm sign up foot to the gym right
on up to the gym I could go to the gym
bar go whenever I want
now if I'm paying for a freakin an
instructor or you know somebody that's
working out now I got the motivation I
got somebody that's there right you know
I mean this couple of different
situations where I think a boot camp
works perfectly somebody like switching
from careers right let's say oh you work
at Finance let's say for example right
you work at finance right you have some
money already saved double you can say
hey man I could do this I'll go take a
few months off and say jump into another
career or you work at a company where
you say hey there's more opportunities
for me as a developer than me being the
finance guy at this company now I could
literally go to this boot camp
switchover come back already have skills
that I could take into uh you know the
workforce and then you're good you're
golden now for me a boot camp doesn't
work for the people that are that can do
it on their own right if you can do it
on your own it wouldn't make sense right
if somebody that already has put into
work and put in the time it doesn't make
sense
somebody who has a computer science
degree it doesn't make sense and a lot
of times you see that on boot camps
there's a lot of guys with computer
science degrees and they're like oh I
want to become a web developer you have
a computer science degree that you don't
need camp you know
yeah
you know how to program already you you
could literally learn this on your own
that's what the whole video is for
because also to it was like more like
I'm asking what a lot of people do here
on YouTube like I get literally every
bootcamp that's out there I'm like the
last of the Mohicans out here you know I
mean they literally they flood me out
there like man how about we will give
you a four thousand is like nah how
about we give you five thousand a month
hey a lot of youtubers they already
under the wing so even there they are
against a or even if they say I'm I
learned on my own was like that's my
biggest thing if I learned on my own was
it the difference between me and
somebody else right so I just think
people should give them snow stopping to
learn it and they're from they decide if
this segment I'm just I'm not gonna be
in front of a computer I need somebody
to ya help me out with this then you
know I mean that's totally different you
know I mean but everybody has different
roads things you know no it's more I'm
more against not really the boot camps
Oregon's at the fact that they charge so
much for the little amount of time I
seen a book at the other day that once
for six months for six months of of a
boot camp and they paid for you paid
that thing as like fourteen fifteen
thousand dollars and for six months you
could live with them you can learn
everything that to me makes sense I was
like oh sure now that's a game changer a
two to three months bootcamp to pay
15,000 20,000 dollars doesn't make sense
to me but you know everybody you know I
went to I went to boot camp and it was
actually six months and I got a job
probably almost right after now I
applied a lot and they helped me with
career services and stuff like that but
I got a contract job for and I did that
for three months and now I just got a
full-time position and I start not this
Monday but make
Monday full-time positions benefits and
everything so you know and it's pretty
much a year I'll be starting a year in
two days after I quit my job and
insurance and there's no way I could
have burned all this you know without I
mean it was a lot I did a lot on my own
to write a lot of after hours reading
tutorials and just everything else but
it's crazy to have completely changed
careers like in any year and so didn't
rain so not aside yeah I tell people at
a time like listen when I got
into this thing the main reason why I
freakin like I learned all this stuff
like my first month month and a half I
already know everything as far as like
HTML CSS in JavaScript right then from
there was just about learning framework
saying like every month I started
learning a new framework which was a
mistake that I did but um all the stuff
I learned in like in a month and a half
and that was because I had quit my job
and I just literally was doing 16 hours
a day
of just like coding coding coding coding
coding going website to the website at
one point I have four different
subscriptions I had global site team
treehouse
what was the other one close sites in
treehouse called school I had like a
subscription to to some guys website if
a guy's name but he's out there from on
YouTube oh so yeah so I had like four
people that was like you know four
places that was constantly just going
and that's not even talking about all
that sounds that was on Stack Overflow a
lot of times I was on on github asking
questions like why is this library
doesn't work is like oh yeah you forgot
something you forgot a freaking issue he
idh TV instead of HTTP like some dumb
 like that you know yeah well that's
how you learn is like if you really dive
into it you're gonna be good you're
gonna be successful the people that are
not successful other people that come in
and be like outdoors on the weekend
after chill with wifey I'll take the
kids ow
listen ain't no wifey ain't no kids
you gotta tell them be like yo do you
want me to change career and be able to
provide something better for us that's
how you just gotta be real with
everybody around you and be like yo
listen I need this time to literally
dive into this I need to have zero drama
zero stress let me just focus on this
and then you're gonna thank me later if
you can't do that it's gonna take you
forever I've seen people that were like
oh I'm on my third year I just got my
job is like yeah he was probably doing
like one hour a week you know what I
mean yeah yeah one last thing I wanted
to say because you were talking earlier
about what employers look at and this
this latest employer the hiring manager
was most impressed by my github I got
like I got like 64 repositories on there
and like 450 contributions in the last
year that's because I don't really
commit everything and push everything
but I've probably done a lot more than
even the 450 commits there but they
didn't even ask me ask me a bunch of
javascript questions and stuff like that
for typical inheritance you know
closures but they asked me anything
about algorithms but they did want me to
do a project and they were looking at my
github but so in my experience it's like
sometimes algorithms come up I've done
like one whiteboarding where they
actually can catch two arrays and take
out some duplicates or something like
that but a lot of times it's having a
portfolio you know I have my website and
I have my github and a lot of
prospective employees they're really
looking at that to see you know what
you're doing so yeah I mean it makes
sense because this is like like I said
if you're coming from zero and you have
nothing that shows like hey you could
actually touch our code base then now we
have to test you before you even get
that close to our stuff you know what I
mean like nobody wants to have somebody
that somehow schemes their way into a
company so what they do is like if they
see your projects is now up to par with
their quality of code or their quality
of sites then they have to test you
you know soup
like okay now let's see bring out the
algorithms you know what I means I have
to go through the whole process but if
you go in there active on freaking get
up you see my projects you see what I'm
working on is my portfolio this is all
the things I've done this past year like
you gotta be fine you gotta say so yeah
yeah definitely so let me see them see
who else is in here so Mike what up what
up there you know me Mike you scare the
 out of me right now I could have
sworn that was like an icon I didn't see
you move the whole time I like there do
is like yells oh shoot he's here I was
like okay so what was good son I'm good
good I hear me yes sir mmm the way from
like let him know my new dependently not
too far from London day you know but
hour and a half away from you know a
Tenakee you know what I mean so yeah
well people went like I need to go down
south man I'm like I'm like og out there
I have never been matter of fact I've
been to Texas I've been to like others
I've been more to the west coast I
haven't really been pass Virginia down
never so I need to touch down down there
man ah it's Shane man I'm a Spanish -
I've never been to Florida you know I
mean that's like I'm a disgrace right
now in the hood you know what I mean
it's like you got a Florida Miami's like
it's like everybody's uh how you cause
it's like the christening you know what
I mean like everybody's done that at one
point you know I haven't been able to go
down there so you know I definitely need
to touch down in the south man so how's
everything over there for you Mike man
it's going man I've been at this little
coding Bank about a about a year now I
got an opportunity not too long ago and
I blues an opportunity so I'm gonna I'm
on the way trying to get back in okay so
I got a I got a
few months under my belt working with
some Python and Django did a little bit
of selenium automation and stuff like
that but yes for health insurance
company once the open enrollment clothes
I've been January he hired me right
before it then soon as it ended he kind
of promised like we're gonna bring on
five more developers never get your
equipment upgrade blah blah blah it says
open enrollment and he killed the whole
IT department so I might have trying to
explain this to people in my resume like
he's only at this place like three or
four months some of them not getting it
I'm China I'm trying to find my way back
in but I definitely that I pretended let
me realize the truth this is what I want
to do yeah no I mean wasn't a lot of
times you gonna bump into situations
like that and you're gonna trust me
listen when when I first went into my
second job right
they asked me or something like similar
to that door like wait you you being in
his company for three months in lying to
other places sorry buddy that was me or
you gotta put headphones man you gotta
love you know I mean like there's no
headphones went oh but yeah so when I my
second job right I went to the interview
I don't forget this right and then they
were like man he's like one person was
being an asshole all right so it was
more it wasn't even the technical person
wasn't a developer it was more like that
upper management they looking at my
resume so um yeah so I went to this
freakin interview wasn't the technical
person was a manager and his manager was
like okay why do you why
are you leaving from this company at 3
months and this isn't that and I was
like listen this company I went in there
for it was my first opportunity my
heart's chance it was great
well it wasn't the place where you know
I could really show my skills and I
explained to them the whole situation
the tech the person who wasn't technical
didn't understand it the developer
understood it perfectly so sometimes you
know it depends on where you go you know
just keep applying you're gonna find the
right place that they gotta take you
right back inside okay it was in three
for three months at some place but now
he wants to work here it's like if you
got the skills you know what I mean but
that's why I tell people all the time I
gotta bring it back you gotta have crazy
portfolio so when you go in there he's
like listen man don't talk to me about
nothing you hire me or what like that's
how I don't listen so it's like you have
your portfolio you have all your work
and it's like if they talking too much
be like oh I'm sorry I'm late for
interviewing just literally be like
thank you and that's it just don't waste
your time don't waste their time you
know what I mean because if they're not
gonna hire you they're not gonna hire
you know you get that feeling when
somebody's gonna hire you you got that
feeling already like mmm I got this put
this in the back pocket you know what I
mean so you already know you're good
play situations like that when they
already like you know oh man why was you
there for three months this is in
dancing listen don't pay no mind to it
just keep applying or build a portfolio
build something that you could be proud
of him something that is gonna wow
people be like that his websites or
anything ours you know what I mean yeah
and if I need to be there so if I got
that opportunity and I didn't I didn't
focus on update my portfolio about a
year oh you know I kind of put all my
eggs in that one basket I was gonna say
Mike does that happen where once you
were working at a job you just focus on
that job only you don't try to keep
learn anymore after that so I just think
just to stay on top of your game doesn't
have to put more time into
more technologies and languages while
you're at a developer job
hey Mike were you uh were you not able
to just kind of tell them the contract
ended or something like that or is it
like a problem I think it's a
combination of things right now like
they gave me the opportunity I didn't
know any Python when when they hired me
and they're just pretty much HTML and
CSS JavaScript I was focusing on what
that job wanted me to learn because I
want to be there we're supposed to be
getting stuff happen blah blah blah if I
wasn't updating really my for my
portfolio at all and so at this day I
think was promoting likely happening
there's one there looking at my resume
and say he's only been there like three
months and he did or they let him go and
a combination of the fact that I didn't
know if they my portfolio because I
thought yeah I'm doing that one thing I
think I don't know where you don't like
that attire stuff with Python or machine
learning or what I mean really no it's
just the original CMS that they had
built was based off of Python so when
they brought me in if we were we were
working with this is really managing the
the customer customer base okay yeah
once you get enough experience and all
that then you know especially if you get
connect with recruiters they call you
like all the time and I was so focused
on I'm gonna hit them with the you know
not right now I'm not interested right
now 7/8 and as soon as that like the
ended those same recruiters I reach out
to them I can't hear from I it's just it
was like that's like night and day from
what I had before
yeah mmm I had to pick up a little
smaller fund of you making your claims
adjustment prior to being a yes I was I
got my property and casualty insurance
license our phone insurance oh yeah yeah
yeah take a job as well so your when I
alone there had to do an object like
some months it sucked in the bills and I
right so yeah isn't life and everything
she understands my wife I got a wife and
kids she was some sportsman pretty well
I thought I could I mean I know for a
fact that that's not what I'm going to
be doing and it's holding me back from
being able to continue learning and
conceit of they might you know do things
I need to do and get back in back in
programming so oh sorry guys right now
or what are you doing right now
as of Friday I am no longer dinner so I
talked to Matt a lot going on and I went
concentrated there so I can access focus
on getting back to back to the
development yeah yeah whoa
all right good luck man appreciate
appreciate I need I'm applying
everything
oh yeah but that's just how it is
you gotta apply like everyday but also
don't be afraid to try to network as
well in your area so try to see if you
have any tech meetups in your area and
then try to go to those try to talk to
people maybe if you know enough you can
also try to give a presentation as well
see your meetups saying put yourself out
there more and then then your local sex
scene can get to know you more so I had
a buddy that gave a talk yeah like we
actually asked meet up firebase or
something like that
hooking up and she offered like a 95k
job after the speech so that's good
really yeah I always want to do a
presentation but never thought I never
felt like I had anything to present yet
because I kind of anything good yeah
at least my standards so yeah yeah yeah
shoutout to pixie crafts I was like you
know woman of course like hey man that's
what you're supposed to be here girls
got girls be scared matter fact we only
have one girl when I did my my show
before it was like the mentorship and
you know a lot of guys in here with 30

well girls gonna be scared you know me
I'm great everything out here so come in
and say without you know come hang out
with us you know but yeah well going
back you guys were talking about I don't
even know what you guys are talking
about ways to like like what what you
can do besides applying for jobs every
day like when you're trying look for a
job like when you're in your downtime or
if you're so I said earlier about how
you should go to meetups in your local
area and then try to you know network
with people there and then also try to
get presentations presentations there as
well if you can spray yourself out there
so we're pretty much talking about like
ways to try to get a job aside just
applying oh yeah yeah yeah definitely if
you go if you go in and like percent you
know even like asking people present
like react that's like okay who does
react like but it's like helping them
out because it's like they put down a
portfolio that I got to a section
actually I should do that I was thinking
about those are great okay yeah people
arrived me all the time to work to go
like do presentations I'm like you know
what I'm about to start doing that tool
man show up and be like yo guys you
already know it would go back at it
again
ot face.com DAP a big-ass t-shirt gonna
be like you'll get a t-shirt you'll get
it you'll get it you start throwing it
out but now um now definitely for like
new developments guys find the meat of
the yeah
very funny in your area and then just
literally spool up the first time you go
there just get to know the people who
are setting up the Meetup
then from there you know talk to some
people that's around you you know
usually it's conversations people be
talking about regular things like oh why
is our angular better than react why is
this dis and dad have you heard of this
language have you done this it's like
cool stuff it's like things that you
could nerd out things that you
wouldn't be able to talk about your
friends to be honest with you because
it's like if I was to tell my friend and
like yo man you heard that you knew
stuff this out man
you heard about that crystal and my
friend is gonna be like yo bro
listen I am moving on crystal meth out
here so I heard about that graph you
know my friends is gonna be like yo girl
like I don't know what you're talking
about you know I mean tell me about the
bees you tell me about starlets you tell
me about a couple of spots I know about
that but you know what I mean so it's
like a meet up is good cousin that you
get to meet people who are like you you
know what I mean so people yeah yeah
tell ya these meetups and Dallas to the
head like they give out beer a pizza and
stuff Madame Tussaud pretty good deal
sure yeah hey John where where did you
make you work now or am I not where but
like location-wise are you out you said
you were in some islands or something
yeah who me oh the other guy John good
Oh John we got John G johnsy lay low Sam
pretty about there right I mean like
you're not gonna walk up out there and
get a job in the in Cali I mean it
depends on the scene so la I know la a
lot of startups coming up here right now
and a lot of them are looking so I mean
they're not looking for someone who's
got like 10 years experience necessary
to come in they're looking for somebody
that can get in there just start writing
some react codes they're trying to get
their website up and soon you know
they're trying to play within the month
so you can come in there they okay I got
my projects I did these two or three
pretty nice projects and reacts like you
put me in there I could hit the ground
running I can I'll have ten
seven
ponents up for you tomorrow you know it
all right yeah good so I saw that's I
look like something like that San
Francisco I can't really speak on that
too much that's from my buddies working
right now but I imagine it's probably
pretty similar if not even more ok yeah
yeah that's I mean that's how it is in
every like tech hub not like in New York
City it's like that true like that's why
a lot of people move from other parts of
the country like let's say if you really
want to be in a startup scene
you gotta move to like the major cities
like that you got Austin you got LA you
got San Francisco you got was a Boulder
Colorado I hear that's crazy out there
where else they got a couple of spots
man so it's like you gotta find the one
that's closest to you from what I hear I
landed two is is pretty tech heavy right
now like this yeah but I got a friend of
mine who so tells me he got a job by
Buckhead so he's like he's like it's
pretty legit over there he's like you
know a startup and a lot of words you
know a startup is like somebody who come
up with an idea right let's say for
example I am a I don't know
I am a construction worker right now I
became whatever the owner of a
construction company now I know this
industry and now I have money in my
pocket I say you know what we could come
up with a better application I know this
system I know this these are this whole
industry
I need developers right so they come up
either from you know angel investors or
people who want to invest in them or
themselves with their own money and be
like hey man I got this idea this is
about to blow up all I need is a budget
of you know two million dollars two
million dollar budget let's say in a
team of 10 that's like that's like two
years of work you know what I mean so
and then as you continue building the
application there's more funding because
now you have more
of the application itself that you could
show for him but okay this one we came
up way and then you know etc right so
most of those opportunities you're gonna
find in the major company like in the
magic on our major cities of the country
not really in you know in freakin
Wyoming is that you gotta find in the
tech cops
you're not gonna find that in freakin
was a mobile you don't to find that
there you know I mean so he's like you
gotta go to the spots you gotta go out
there now our enterprise work it's
everywhere you could live on the rock
this enterprise work yeah you know my
network is everywhere you and after that
you open that little rock up be like oh
sure that's why companies in here you
know what I mean
that's how it is like you know you you
start messing with Java
you took dot net you talk about let's
say even angular angular super
enterprise-e like every freaking
enterprise company really mess with
angular um
so reality is like there's like a whole
bunch of different niches that you could
jump into and all depends on the type of
person you are like me I'm more of a
startup to smaller business I'm not into
the those big you know companies like
here's a we got 200 developers in in
Austin 100 developers in in New York
City 200 in Chicago I'm not into those
companies because most of the time is
like you gotta be in there with a
freaking button up you gotta be freaking
way
freaking slacks I'm not that type of
dude I come in late I do order all the
wrong things I do my job well those are
the things I currently fit into a
start-up or smaller business that can
accommodate to me you got insane so you
just gotta look into yourself and see
which one you fit into you know and like
angel if Co they show of startups that
just got their first series in funding
and a lot of them you just if you just
sit down and send out like 20 25 emails
a day
there's like all these new startups I
just received their syriza and they just
got a ton of money to make whatever
ideas
supposed to be making and if they have a
developer that comes to them is like put
me on the team man I can do it they're
gonna they're gonna think they're gonna
like it yeah I uh my contract
opportunity was with like a large health
care provider like top five top ten and
yeah you're right like joe said is like
just fish you know in a huge pond you
know work is been seen by people you
don't know who they are or where they
are and everything else and now there's
this company I'm gonna start with now
it's kind of startup startup feeling I
have less than 100 employees they've
been around for more than 10 years but
you know it's one of those where to see
you might see the CEO like in the
building you know what I mean yeah stuff
like that so it's gonna have that kind
of feel so I'm gonna definitely get to
see like the enterprise versus that
startup you know what I mean so I would
definitely see oh I was gonna show you
guys this company but this company is
called don't won't sir hey I know of a
few people that went through that back
when they recall that Ian turn that
belief yeah well technically I so
somewhere around like in the summer um I
was supposed to go work with this
company before all the songs you can say
you know after that I'm just gonna do my
own thing but now that I'm working me I
can say their name whatever so once an
interview did the whole thing super cool
company but this is not like a small
business who's like a major business
like they got like it's like two huge
buildings or it's just dumb you got on
saying like I don't know like this
company is so crazy like the whole
process of like how they they hire like
they look at the interview uniform then
after the interview before they send you
a test then after the send you a test
then they fly you to to to the freaking
I forgot was in North Carolina South
Carolina
one of those two and pretty much is like
the whole process of it is crazy but the
catch is it's like people not relaxed
people gotta be in there without a polo
shirt those is looking mad generic it's
like a passing of the matrix I'm like
I'm not I'm not into that you know what
I mean it's a great opportunity would
have been cool but it's just not for me
so it's like you got to do the research
of the company that you want to work for
know what I mean oh definitely your
research check out glassdoor.com and
yeah guys I'm actually got a gold
because I gotta go drive to New York
City right now and year man it's been
great I'm happy that everybody got got
in here we are then we got it under we
got gone I mean Alejandro will see you
we got that we got the icon we never got
to see him oh we got him in here John we
got your boy London we got your boy Mike
we got Tony we got Tyler so yeah man we
had a full squad plus we had like a
hundred people at some point so that's
great week the numbers is going up
person that let's say Joe your channels
dying you my channel is growing
every day I don't know what the
 you're talking about
and yeah yeah honestly what sets you
apart
you're definitely you have that
interactivity with your audience so more
these live streams we actually have your
viewers some subscribers actually come
in here and talk you're here I know I
don't know of any other coding the child
that does that at all so trust me you're
about to start seeing them you know as
they whatever I do somehow it ends ups
sprinkles up is like wait hold on Joe
did this hold on hitting account go
smoke hold on
you know I mean so you're about to start
seeing it but just remember what you saw
it first
you saw the peoples in here and yeah man
whatever we hear we live man is your boy
Joe back at it again cutting phase
okay damn life man drop them life
I'm about to say dive on them real quick
