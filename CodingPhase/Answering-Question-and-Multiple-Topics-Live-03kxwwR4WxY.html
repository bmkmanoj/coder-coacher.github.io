alright so there's like the review
section we got another one right here we
got all of the stuffs coming from the
data if you've been following the
website coding phase comm you know you
wouldn't notice we got a lot of stuff
going on right now and then on Sunday
I'm gonna finish the nodejs database
section and then from there all of next
week I'm gonna focus on the no J guess I
wanted to get this one done because this
one is good there's not that many people
doing the nodejs yet cuz most of the
people are starting from the beginning
so from what I've noticed this a lot of
people came in they did this Adam text
editor a lot of people came into the
terminal developer they don't learn HTML
CSS for some reason people are taking a
long time to put to finish this right
and then we have build a responsive app
this is pretty easy people like the sass
like a pro and then from there they get
to play around with pod template pod
template engine that was complete I
maybe I should
around maybe we should say creaturepod
JavaScript and then take the pug
template engine but yeah they keep going
build the restaurant web app that's what
I'm being focus on right now I finished
the react one I'm still adding another
project to the react course for those of
you guys that wanna know more about
react of adding another one the
somewhere next Wednesday I'm starting on
this one another react project which I
don't know maybe I'll do the the project
of high college the digital agency I
might do it every act and just like you
know so you could have two projects and
react one project here build a
restaurant which is HTML CSS and
JavaScript and a little bit of hyper app
- yes then you have the node.js course
which is this one it has the portfolio
let me see and react we have - Rena
state so then we got a lot of stuff and
then at some point I want to start
working on this which is advanced back
and we'll go you know so that's - after
I finished nodejs I got a tool this tool
here so yes I have a lot of stuff man
and I also want to do a face ejs course
which is pretty legit you know it's
pretty easy there's like straight
JavaScript it's not crazy you know what
I mean so yeah man all right 36 people
in here what up okay so let me start
reading the comments start asking the
questions man
let me see
Tyler Fleming says Joe do you plan to do
an SEO course yeah I could do a little
quick SEO course that should be pretty
easy I mean nowadays you know it's not a
how it was back in the days where people
will be like man SEO is everything you
gotta have the keywords the description
this isn't that the alt tags on on the
images like guys nowadays YouTube
YouTube Google they all do whatever they
want right they do whatever they want
now like SEO really doesn't matter
anymore
to be honest with you because Google
decides which ones aren't gonna be
popular which ones are gonna be famous
whatever which ones aren't gonna be the
one that's gonna show up on top plus if
you look at Google now let's say I
search PlayStation let's search it here
so you guys to see it let's say
PlayStation or not let's choose
something like mechanics near me like
this is things that people search
automatically right so this is what
they're gonna find on the search results
automatically is the first thing is I
add right of course you're gonna get a
nod right and definitely you're gonna
get the map and then from there you got
Yelp and then you got like the major
companies like thumb stack
Angie what Angie's List your mechanic
calm like worrying about SEO is like it
doesn't matter anymore cuz Google does
whatever they want you know they put in
the companies that pay money to get
shown out here so I mean I I could
create like a course on all the basics
of SEO but SEO doesn't matter anymore
like those days are over those are one
of those things that people
like clients and oh yeah we come you
know we're gonna fix the SEO we're gonna
do this and that and you know we're
gonna get your to number one like you
know white hats black hats like no that
stuff matters anymore
because nowadays it's all about social
media you know our people searching for
your specific website like that's how
you show up on like top keywords and of
course paying for them right so yeah
that's where SEO is that right now now
let me see let me see another question
what economy he'd let a computer guy and
I was being silly graces addressing you
approach I mean that's nothing that's
not a new for him you know what I mean
like wish him the best
you know but I don't want to talk about
that guy I mean he's he's
self-destructing you know so let him
self-destruct by himself I already said
what I needed to set it by him like come
on we winning out here and it for me
when I talk about him I don't gain
anything I actually lose this is what he
don't understand which was what I was
trying to explain to him to me bro
I'm trying to tell you like listen to
other people listen to you
your comments and look what people want
they weren't content they don't want you
to be here crying every day like you
have time two hours to talk ish on the
computer but you don't have time to
create content you know what I mean so
that's told I'm saying it's like I'm
worrying about you to us if YouTube is
like a person that's like a little
problem like mental illness like YouTube
doesn't care about him he's not marques
Brownlee he's not lioness he's not one
of this tech guys like he didn't his
channels an educational channel guys
like me right now right my channel is
about coding right if I come in here and
I know seven years from now I started
talking about different topic other than
coding that people are watching and
subscribe to my channel they're not
gonna come back to this channel the one
they're gonna unsubscribe they're gonna
bring oh shoot this is the coding guy
like why is he talking about this
dissing guy like they just gonna
unsubscribe you know what I mean so
that's what I told him but you know let
him be whatever he wants to be you know
if it makes them happy look crazy on the
internet that's all here let me see
reading through what everybody saying
no I'm not gonna have a tube sock said
are you going to have a back-and-forth
with Eli the computer guy yeah that's it
that's done you know we proved our point
and it's obvious you look at the
comments you go look at all his videos
all the comments are people saying the
same thing that I'm saying yeah they
have a mental breakdown he's going
through hard times financially or he's
just like self-destructing this people
just you know there's something wrong
with them you know I was like people
were there for content they know they
don't care about you know hey I was
making 200 300 grand now I'm making 100
grand
like what like come on man go get
something to do you know what I mean
like that's how people look at it like
nobody's gonna cry a tear for you okay
how hard is finding a job for html5
games wutface there are another
framework um I would say it's not really
that hard because if you look online
there's a lot of people that ask are
like you know independent little web
sites that you gotta look for them but
they have sections where they'd be like
hey we're looking for somebody to create
a game for us for Android for iOS so you
can go in there and create the game with
html5 and JavaScript so I will say it
people don't care how you make it as
long as the game that they have like it
you know an idea like let's say I saw
this this post like I don't know like a
few months ago when somebody was like
hey I want to create a Christian game
right the person who was gonna create
this game was gonna get about seventy
thousand dollars to create the name
right let's say you create this game and
you have like stuff that you already
created right code that you already made
and you take those code and just change
it with the different sprites and
different animations and stuff like that
or reuse code that was online somewhere
right you can come in and create that
game in three two
right in there for three to five months
you got paid $70,000 like you know and
then the rest of the year you could work
on your own personal projects on your
own person again that's how a lot of
game developers do or sometimes they
create a game and send you know they
sell it to a company a distributor who's
gonna from there promote it and make
money out of it so you know is everybody
has different different ways to do it
it's like one of the things that tell
people all the time is you have to skill
once you learn how to code you have the
skill to choose different roles for
yourself right you can do web
development you can do software
development you can do game development
you can do you know hybrid apps you know
like there's so many things that you can
do so this is just a tool right for your
own creativity now if you don't have no
creativity than what you should do is
you should work for a company that tells
you what to do all right but if you like
somebody who's creative like sky's the
limit for you you know if you're not
very creative and you can't come up with
business plans and ideas the best thing
that you could do is find a company or
find clients so you could build whatever
ideas they have all right for me I'm
more of a creative person I like to
create things that I come up to my head
and I just want to create new things you
know me working for somebody else is
like to me is so boring because it
usually is like a dumb idea like you
know hey build me a website where I
could you know sell t-shirts and this
isn't that like you know how many
websites I've done like that ecommerce
websites like a million of them you know
nobody's creating new stuff like they're
not creating like new ideas like oh man
I will create something that you know
with your phone you can exit an API
whatever etc right something different
something that's gonna challenge you
something that's gonna come up and be
like oh this is super cool that's the
things that get me excited so when I
work on things on my own time
work on cool stuff stuff that it hasn't
been done there or I haven't done it
with our company but when I'm working
with a company is like I'm doing what I
would they want and usually it's just
something simple you know before for you
guys I think that's how you start as you
get more experienced then you start
branching off and that's why I always
tell people you gotta have an exit plan
you gotta say hey I'm here for XYZ of
years but then at the end it's like I
want to start my own business you know I
know people who date what development
right but now they freaking design
bicycles like I have a friend who he has
a go fund me and he basically designs
bikes like you know straight bike Stassi
but now he has a business that he goes
and designs a bike and customized it for
somebody and people come in and be like
oh I'll pay you $5,000 to customize this
bike if you know he gets ten clients in
a year you know that's like $50,000
right now if he keeps groaning groaning
he goes in and you know goes hard he
could be making two hundred three
hundred thousand dollars a year from
profit right and all that stuff is
possible because he started with web
development if he didn't have that money
that capital in his pocket he didn't
have those skills he wouldn't have the
chance to open up his own business you
know what I mean like once you're in
you're in and then from there you branch
out into other things that you want to
do you know even get the meet up I
remember I mean I've went to the
JavaScript Meetup
there were so many people there that
having worked as developers or the
people that worked as developers they
were already retired like oh they had
other businesses they work for other
things like you come in you make your
money and you're good you know you gotta
be smart you know so that's all I'm
saying
so as far as html5 games as like yo can
you find jobs like yeah you can find
jobs
let me see what do you thing about
sequel is a commonly used oh yeah of
course
it's the most commonly used database
it's like sequel is everywhere like
right now
MongoDB is is trying to eat up the
market but it got a long way to go you
know it's like MongoDB is like electric
cars right like we know at some point is
gonna take over but it has a long time
from now
it's gonna be a long time from now for
it to actually happen you know it's like
my C cool is like gas right and then you
know cars that run on gas
that's my sequel MongoDB is the future
but most companies are not ready to
invest into the future they happy where
they at right now that's one of the
thing that I can tell you about
companies like once they have a system
that's working
they don't care you know even the
company I was in before they had Perl
for about 15 16 17 years like you would
think that they would have upgraded
their system but it's like why would
they when they were making money you
know I mean and that's how it is every
business out there like this business
out there that are still running my job
of spring or you know like some
old-school pearl systems or even see
I've seen companies running everything
with C and C maybe c-sharp just regular
C I've seen companies working on their
whole system and I'm like man why don't
they upgrade and it's like bro they
making money why would they spend hours
and the time to reinvent the wheel when
it's already invented you know so people
have been using my sequel for a long
time why would they switch to MongoDB
you switch to MongoDB if you're a brand
new company if you're branding company
like oh this is MongoDB you know it's
the way of the future
you know that's how it's gonna be ten
twenty years from now but the companies
that have been around they're gonna want
to switch to MongoDB so you know the
whole process that they have to do to
switch Eric
single you know single database that's
relational to make your work with what
will they be like it's too much work
that's that is not gonna give them
anything okay drop the chalupa says what
do you thinks are my marketing jobs that
are asking HTML CSS in JavaScript yeah
that's how it is there's so many usually
that's like recruiters right like they
want people to let's say you are you
working for a marketing company right
and all you're gonna do is be working
with Adsense adsense Adwords and let's
say what else doing down let's say in
facebook pixels and stuff like that
Facebook ads but they want you to know
HTML CSS so you could build your own
HTML emails so that's when your HTML CSS
comes in now the JavaScript size comes
in because a lot of times those company
wants you to create the Google ads
yourself you know like when you see the
ads on Google Google ads like I say on
the side you know those are little boxes
that's me with html5 and JavaScript so
you need to know animation you need to
know how things work so that's how it is
man you know so a lot of companies
asking for HTML CSS now just for the
basics like it just makes you look
better right if you're going in for a
marketing job and you say yeah I know
how to code in HTML CSS you got the job
because the other marketing person
doesn't know that right so they usually
have a developer over there in a company
for marketing right but what usually
happens is that the Vella purse don't
want to be working on HTML emails and
stuff like that so what they do is they
say hey you're the marketing guy why
don't you do that so now because you
know HTML CSS you get hired because all
the other marketing people that came in
for the interview they didn't know HTML
or CSS so you pretty much got a leg up
on top of them so that's why they pretty
much asked them for that man programming
of Eric keeps sneak dissing you
I'm not worried about those kids and let
Eric do whatever he wants man you know
it's like it's obvious it's obvious like
his channels pretty much taking a lot of
my sauce you know a lot of the ideas
that I was doing here from the beginning
like he's doing them now and it's like
who cares I did it I'm done with that I
finished it it's like I'm good you know
what I mean
like I'm not worried about it man like
um I don't know in this full-time this
is the same thing that some like he like
the computer guy okay you guys over here
crying for you know for money and he has
almost a million subscribers I don't
even have ten thousand subscribers and
I'd do this full-time I make I make a
living of this you know what I mean
like if I I live comfortable in New York
with what I'm making from YouTube right
now right now if I move to a cheaper
state like you know I think yeah I lives
in the middle of nowhere like you know
there's like places where it's like your
rent is like $700 like if I live over
there with what the money I made right
now I'm like it came over there you know
what I mean so he's like I'm not wearing
a body Eric is like whatever man
those my son's man there's a lot of my
son's out there and you know to keep it
room to guys like I'm not really looking
into any other like developer channel I
got I mess with Christian art you know
for the simple fact that he's cool he
hits me up I had a mom we talked we you
know it's a cool relationship you know
somebody that's just normal just genuine
just like minding his business he's
doing what he does he well he does his
good in it was great so he's good
you know what I mean other people
they're my sons you know I'm not worried
about them you guys know where the sauce
came from so like that's about it man do
you think about digital marketing with
what development makes you more
marketable yeah I think so
I definitely think so I think you know
at some point you gotta have multiple
skills
can't you say hey I'm just a web
developer you don't have other things
that come with you too because you got
to think about it like this
it's like you might go to a job
interview right and you know HTML CSS
and JavaScript the other guy knows HTML
CSS and JavaScript but that company
needs an extra person to help out with
marketing so when they look at you like
oh this person knows about marketing
this person knows about Google AdWords
this person know about Adsense this
person knows about Facebook pixels and
how to retarget and nobody ends and this
and that if you know those things you're
gonna get hired above the developer
that's next to you because now you're
gonna come in with more skills that they
could use so it's like getting to people
for the price of one that's how
companies look at it you know what I
mean like every time that I've been to a
company like they look at my whole
catalog and like my whole resume of
things that I know and you know it's
like I could go in from animation to
drawing to art to graphic design to
freaking web design to programming to
marketing like I've done all those
things over the years and I continue to
learn more skills because of that
because it's like it looks good and at
the same time it it makes me a better
person to say hey I know all of those
things like when you hire me
I count four five different types of
categories like I can come in do
marketing I could come into programming
most of the time I mean people want me
for programming but even at every
company I've been to they always ask me
like that you know like this there's a
thing that always happens like people
are having conversations oh can we use
no how can we promote this and it's like
oh you could use influencers from social
media they look at me like oh how do you
know about this is like people try to
box him in into a certain section that I
oh yeah this guy is tough the web
developer but when you come in and
you're like somebody like me most of you
guys are like me too like in the sense
of you have multiple skills you know
nobody could come in and box you and say
hey you're a marketing person
you're a designer hey you're a developer
because in reality you have multiple
skills this you know nobody's just one
person you know life is born when you're
just doing one thing you know so yeah
word man am I using twitch currently I
signed up at which last night I signed
up at which last night but I'm still

even though they write something like um

little while before I get to whatever
you write on the on the chat but I'm
still gonna answer it you know what I
mean
let me see let me see
word yes there's a chat in the video now
so people could see it man I mean
hopefully I'm trying to figure out how
to make sure to save this this stream so
hopefully it saves that's the idea
behind it right yeah word way
wired I was up here at 4 o'clock in the
morgue like in the morning man
I fight trash Trump I mean I don't care
about Trump I'll be honest I like the
idea of a random person coming in and
becoming president but he's just like
such a I don't know he's so crazy
inconsistent and like he's just crazy
you know I was like yeah you can't take
him serious but I do like the idea of
regular people being able to become
president because this you know people
think that to become president you gotta
be like the super smartest person in the
world and you gotta go to Harvard and go
to you know we could have to be a
millionaire I don't believe in that I
think all regular people should become
presidents and people in power but it
doesn't happen like that you know what I
mean it's kind of sucks because it's
like now because of how this president
is how crazy is you know in the future
people might not vote for a regular
person anymore because they've got all
this person is crazy so you know this
isn't that for job description asks for
HTML you know it's a BS job fifteen
twenty dollars an hour well I think it's
not bad man fifteen twenty dollars an
hour these people out here who are
making less than fourteen dollars an
hour you know there's a lot of people
who are here making less than $14 an
hour you know there's people who work at
FedExing they're working for you know
thirteen fifty an hour and to become a
truck driver you have to go through this
whole training and this and that just to
earn $18 an hour so if a company comes
in I'm gonna hey you're a junior
developer nobody knows you you have no
history in this field we're gonna give
you $20 an hour take it you know they
don't give you a raise in three months
leave that's it that's all you need it
on your resume those three months now
when you go to the next company now it
looks like oh this person he worked
somebody trusting all right that's it
let me see what I was what I was what I
was made risking your SS you have to obs
running at the same time can you delay
let me see I don't know if I could delay
on my computer let me see what else any
other questions guys let me know I'm
here today we're talking about different
topics today we're talking about you
know everything man
i subbed on the 19th last month on david
p what changes are you talking about let
me know let me know you got an email me
man whatever look to be honest with you
guys I work for you guys alright
you know from 9:00 to 5:00 you guys are
my 9:00 to 5:00 Friday from 9:00 to 5:00
I work for you guys all the people that
are subscribed to my channel subscribe
to my website I work for you guys right
so if you have any complaints anything
that you want for the website any course
that you want me to teach you send me an
email say hey Joe I want this right and
I will build it for you I will make it
for you David P says I meant charges not
changes oh that's another thing a lot of
you guys gotta be careful with how you
do the payment you guys are using bank
cards so sometimes if you use the bank
card like even though it goes through at
some point your accounts gonna get
cancelled because what happens is you
get charged the first time you're using
a bank card then the next the next month
the bank is gonna decline getting
charged again so what I will say is hey
if you don't have a credit card use
PayPal send me an email or use the
PayPal at the bottom of the screen so
I'm gonna show you right now you come
down here you go to let me see where can
we do this locked out use all right go
to all courses let's say you here
Ketel access right get the OU Access
Pass all right at the bottom of the page
if you are having any issues because
your internet
soothing or you wish to have your paypal
use instead of your credit card then use
this PayPal button to subscribe alright
you could do it with this if you're
using a credit card I know it's some a
little bit confusing and you're probably
thinking why I can't just use my credit
card here the problem is that a lot of
banks that's like a security thing they
don't do subscription-based with you
know with an independent car company
like teach about that columns are
independent company this is not Netflix
we will put in this idea of like oh but
I use Netflix where if this card ends
like yeah but this and this company is
not Netflix you know what I mean like
you know they're not gonna come in and
gonna hate we're gonna let you keep on
charging ten dollars a month every month
because it looks suspicious so the best
way for you to do is just sign up
through here through the paypal if
you're gonna use a bank card I was
thinking about it I might just use I
might just remove these two things from
here and just leave the the one-time
purchase here because then just make
everybody sign up with the paypal
because the problem is like I said it's
like you know a lot of you guys are
using bank cards and you're getting
declined you know and you're still under
on the website but I think is it gives
you I think like five to ten days before
it cancels your account once your
account is cancelled and I say it's
cancelled you know when you're doing a
portfolio review I'm gonna do tomorrow
I'm gonna do it today and matter of fact
I'm not release one today like a seven
eight o'clock at night because I have
the videos there I just haven't uploaded
them people send me a whole bunch of
portfolio reviews so the portfolios get
reviewed like a whole bunch of
you know for sure for sure let me see so
like I was saying man guys gotta check
this out man you're gonna come to the
website make sure you subscribe and make
sure you show some love I do I think
it's like the best way to like we're
really supportive channels like cuz I'm
pretty much working for you guys alright
the moment you say F Joe I'm out of here
you unsubscribe you cancel your account
and then I say you move on you leave to
another channel or to whatever you want
but knowing like hey this is the best
way to pretty much support Joe and at
the same time have him create content
for me every single day and the content
that I want because there's what I tell
you guys send me your email I'm looking
I'm gonna go on my email right now you
gotta go into my email one thing I don't
use this email Joe Santos Darcy as you
can see is like super spammy this is
where like all the recruiters hit me
like I never check emails here guys so
make sure you send it to coding face at
gmail.com now I'm going through my email
sorry if your name shows up or anything
so that's a Kona face course trending
famebit sponsorships back to beer fans
under Rico medium Aussie email was an
absolute lap want to create a one-way
okay you're my link you see comments
made you help
yes okay this is a this is a good
question says can a slow learner would
have with a learning disability being a
web developer I think so I probably make
a video about that so let's leave that
alone but as you can see you guys are
nobody has sent me like emails about
like hey Joe I want this course I want
you to teach me this course like I work
for you guys think about it like that
like I work for you guys you know don't
be a ho hey ho boss but just be nice to
run your jump I want this course I want
to learn this from you or like let's say
you you are learning a topic from
another course like there's a lot of
people who makes match what they're
learning on on team what in tree house
are are they learning on udemy they're
learning where were they learning right
and you having difficulties right and
you say hey Joe I'm subscribed to your
your website I'm having issues with this
topic like let's say for loops that's
just an example right you say hey John
have a difficulty with four loops then I
will come in and create a video for you
explaining for loops right because you
are a subscriber I work for you you know
what I mean people are not taking
advantage about this you know they're
not taking advantage on this thing and
I've been telling you guys I'm like you
know email will email me what you want
man like let me help you out you know
like I work for you guys man I'm here
for you guys I'm not here for my own for
my own health it's just more for helping
you guys out let me see we check the
chat room
should I learn WordPress in PHP I think
you could learn it by thing I don't know
PHP is like ready PHP is good but
WordPress I don't know if if WordPress
and it's like the way to go you know
it's good for like if you're gonna work
for a digital agency most of those know
digital agencies they use WordPress but
I don't know if you really want to get
into web development I don't know if
that's like the right way to go cuz I
did it and that was like the worst year
of my life working with WordPress it
sucks
let me see still ready sorry sorry I'm
like behind the comments end of the
check
word man Jeremy a13 says he got a
serious question just asking what is
your advice for a 16 year old only knows
html/css who wants to be a web developer
when they grow up what's the next step
and what should I do when I graduate
what I would say is you should this is
the first nation number one you should
definitely after you learn HTML CSS and
you can make any design that anybody
throws at you right you can make into a
website then jump to JavaScript after
you jump to JavaScript then try to learn
a back-end language it doesn't matter
which one you decide which one you like
right it could be Python could be PHP
could be non JSP whatever all right if
you coming straight out of college the
nasara that comes straight out of high
school go to college even if it's a
community college right now some people
wants to be like oh man come to a
community college yeah go to a community
college go to wherever you want to go
right but as you are a student on your
college right and you're taking classes
continue making websites creating real
projects real websites for businesses
right by the end of your first year if
you really took this serious then you
should be really nice with web
development right start applying to jobs
you should be like 18 19 years old by
that time right start applying to jobs
and then if you get a job start working
continue going to school part-time the
moment that you start seeing that hey
I'm making more money than I would if I
go to college then don't go to college
after that continue becoming a web
developer because in reality what's your
inside
the industry you don't need college
degree you don't need it and it all
depends on what you want to get into if
you say hey I want to become a web
developer you don't need a college
degree all you have to do is have the
projects and know your stuff that's a
and B working with companies that's
about it like there's so many people who
work on major companies you know Netflix
and LinkedIn Facebook a lot of those
guys endeavor by - to college or they
never finished it you know is like
nobody cares about it all they care
about is can do the job let me see
are you bringing back the mentorship
videos um I don't know I might I might I
might bring back the mentorship videos
but if I bring back the mentorship
videos is gonna be an exclusive content
for my website it's gotta be free but
I'm not gonna post it on YouTube until
it's complete alright so what I'm gonna
do is if I bring it back this is the
idea behind it I will do the same thing
that I did before what I would choose
five to six people you know maybe even
just for because even last time we have
five six people in autos you know if a
six people only for people who are
really doing their work so I might just
do four people and then after we do four
people we would choose them from the
people that are subscribed to to the
website and then we will have as an
exclusive content the same way how I
have here where if you go to my website
I say preview as a marketing user you
have to this or is it I have another
section called coated face uncut like
here is a section where I can put in any
videos that I want stuff that that you
know I don't want to have it on YouTube
that's what I'm putting on my uncut
videos and I could come here and create
create a mentorship a mentorship video
section way you know what I'm gonna
start it up right now give me a second
I'm gonna start it up right now
we're gonna create it right now because
that's a good idea I should bring this
back
okay that's creative right now
and we gonna do seasons mentorship
mentorship program all right
you see mentorship show all right I'm
building air right now kids let's put it
right here
so let's see then - show
I'm gonna choose for this here
remember of coding phase no or started
kick let's just have the web developer

and some become Amenti for coding phase
comm we're going to do this man it's a
good idea we're gonna start next week
let me see where is it order list okay
we're creating this we're gonna make
this pricing free so anybody can see
this alright

glitch on the screen and it's driving me
crazy
I mean this computer is brand-new this
computer it cost me about like $2,200
and this computer doesn't even have a
year and there's a issue with it and
from what I've seen a lot of people have
the same vision on line with this model
so I'm gonna get that fixed or they
gonna give me another one
where a man to touch it touch it - well
Riley voice will do alive
chit chit chit chit chit chit chit hi
Joe are there limited seats for a
mentorship yes they are limited seats
let me see so for people only four
people last time we try to do six people
it got out of control
people don't even show up people that
even I'll do the projects people were
doing free game using frameworks instead
of coding into cells like we don't want
to do with that you know we don't want
to deal with none of that stuff on this
time so yeah man we here we live coding
face.com
your boys backing out and did it again
Joe how can we make sure to be on one of
the seats just email me you'd be
surprised you know a lot of people think
like in situations like that they're
like oh man I'm not gonna get I'm not
gonna get picked I'm not gonna get
picked and this and that right well you
will get picked
all right you definitely will get picked
because a lot of times people be like oh
I'm not gonna get picked so then they
nobody signs up for it so what happens
is the people that they signed up they
get it because nobody else signed up you
know cuz everybody throws gonna be
thousands of people who sign up it's
like nah you know say yeah man
I'm gonna make a video right after this
and I'm gonna make it legit I'm gonna
make it official I'm gonna release a
statement for you guys we bring him back
the coding mentorship season two little
season two kids we had season 1 in the
beginning of the year this is gonna be
season 2 this is legit see this is what
I'm talking about it out know what I
mean like we good
well it's like yeah should we email you
email me now man
email me coding phase at gmail.com only
requirements is that you're basically
subscribed to the channel you have a
camera right you should have a laptop
something right because if there's no
video I can't help you you know like I
want people that to see their faces like
people come here and they want to see
your faces you know they don't just want
to see me on the show they want to see
you guys too to see you know and I do
this to make sure for people to know
like oh they regular people learning how
to code like it's nothing crazy you know
what I mean so there's a way to motivate
others so I need you to have a camera
that's it and don't be scared to be your
video but this time I might do it
differently now that I'm thinking about
it I might do it differently because I
might not want to do it like how I was
doing it before where I would have you
know four or five of them or six of them
and the same show what I might do is I
might do a twenty minute video or each
one a 10 to 15 minute video with each
one then save that video upload it to
the website mix with all all the videos
from everybody and then from there
uploaded to onto my website as one
single video all put together so like
that it could be a one to one thing like
the very first video is gonna be with
everybody then every other video after
that it's gonna be a one-to-one thing
instead of having their to do it with
like so many people are the same time
everything okay Johnny now you talk okay
sandy you talk okay Shane you talk like
now
doing that I want to say be what I
wanted but I hate a man your co needs to
fix here you need to listen that so it
