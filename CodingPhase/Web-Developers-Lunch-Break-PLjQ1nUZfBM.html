laravel because I'm continuing the bait
store remember I told you guys I'm
continually if you guys have been
following the beef store tutorial right
now we're actually up to the part where
we install our bow right and if you guys
installed it yeah should be good man
it's super easy man it doesn't take more
than 10 minutes you know to install
everything and be up to speed
I don't even know you know one thing
that I hate man I come to an area where
nobody's here
and somehow dudes still somehow they
want to freakin park next to me like bro
I don't want nobody next to me so I got
my job they pissed off because I'd be
freaking I'll be taking two spaces
you know after man every time that I
have somebody next to me they leave me
marks on my car that man I
don't want nobody next to me straight up
where am i I'm in New York City now I
mean I'm in the outskirts of New York
I'm in the suburbs suburbs of New York
City in a factory area undisclosed area
we're ideal it's funny how you know
somebody somebody left me a comment I
don't know last video something like
that somebody saying like oh my god you
use the center tag like you're not
supposed to use the center tag guys I
don't care I'm not here I'm not here for
for your amusement I'm not here to
 show you if I know how to call
it or whatever if I'm prototyping
I'm prototyping quick I don't have
time to go sit in there and say hey I'm
gonna put this thing into a a div and
then inside of it I'm gonna make another
div that's gonna be you know you know
 margin:0 and Otto
like I don't have time for that if
I want to censor something I'm
prototyping prototyping means when
you're creating something quick when you
have an idea you're not okay I'm gonna
I'm gonna create this real quick I'm
just gonna put it out there right you're
not looking at at how your HTML
tags are should you be using an F should
you be using a UL tag so you be using a
link can you put an anchor tag and then
a little li inside of it like I'm not
thinking about that when I'm prototyping
I'm just I'm just coating quick trying
to get an idea out you know if I don't
get the idea out then I forget about it
you know so that's what prototyping is
guys you know so it's teaching you you
didn't
Nicholas Kakashi
what up grunge is of gob jazz Gope
grungy yes is too slow
yeah now sometimes people when you got a
prototype you got to build something
quick guys man
only the Nerds I'm being honest only the
Nerds only the people who are like
diehard who have a tattoo right
here in their face that says HTML like
those people are the only people that
care about saying man when you at
work when you prototyping would you just
want to get something out you want to
get an idea out nobody's looking at your
HTML tags man only people that are
really not in the industry at all like
are looking at your HTML tags you know
and that's just beautiful
you know like nobody looking at
that trust me guys I'm being a hundred
percent honest with you guys
nobody's looking at that because what
matters at speed if you don't get to
build something quick then you're losing
money
we're got a little jst right there how
is baby mama any baby names yet um well
we don't know yet I like eating
I like Alonzo I like hurling son I like
what else I like I like uh I don't know
I like Kenji like his name is gonna be
Kenji you know how you got a little baby
name in the house and you know people
just call you by the by the baby name
like you know so that's gonna be the
baby it's gonna be like my little baby
Kenji
well are you looking for what are you
looking for some nurse said not to use
the senses I got murked
I mean it doesn't really matter guys
like when you you gotta understand this
to two things right all right like let's
say like this when you work for somebody
somebody's going to tell you hey we want
to get the design done we want this
piece to to work we want this done fast
that's all they care about right now us
as developers we might say hey we want
to make it clean right and we want to
make it functional and have a page that
works properly right but then there's
another type of people who they want to
have everything perfect
alright and when you have everything
perfect what happens there you basically
you spend more time on trying to
refactor your code and then refactor
your code and refactor your code and
then you never get to push out a project
or product or a webpage because you're
constantly fixing it up or you're trying
to like make it easier there was
some some person who who I knew before
Ryan this kid all he tried to do
everything that he tried to do
he tried to put it into a one-line if
statement right you know what I'm
talking about parentheses a question
mark and then quotation colon quotation
that right now quotation yeah quotes
yeah quotation so one line is statement
all the time because see things in his
head is I oh this is smart this is going
to make me look smart or like when
people come in and start doing on es6
everything that they do is they try to
do a one line arrow function and they
think in their head they really think
like they're smart or when they
say hey instead of writing three things
like let's say you have a la Li tag
right and instead of you writing let's
say for your menu right
just a regular menu that nobody cares
about right you have the home about in
the contact page this type of person
will try to make that into a loop so to
not write it you go and create a loop
that's going to take him four to five
minutes to create the whole loop
connected to the database create a
database migration do a whole bunch of
shake just to have a menu to be dynamic
right when all you had to do it takes in
two seconds to write down or a
menu and just copy and paste this three
times it saves you time right there's
people out there that they just they
think in their head that doing all this
extra work pays off it doesn't pay pay
off like you get to a certain level like
not even to be talked but I'm
already a certain level where I know all
of the so when people try to call
me out on any I'll be like
don't you think I know that
don't you think in five years that I've
been doing this I know that and don't
you think that if I'm prototyping and I
need to create something fast
I'm just coding fast like to build a
project or the product to get it out as
soon as possible you know so guys when
you tell me something you're not
literally I'm telling you right now
unless you're talking to me about gold
unless you're talking to me about
crystal unless you're talking to me
about Java
you can't teach me nothing like I'm
being honest you cannot teach me
it's five years under my belt of
everything else HTML CSS JavaScript sass
nodejs I've been using node.js
for three years and somebody try
to leave me a comment like trying to
teach me something about nodejs that I
already know I'm like burn I've been
doing this for five years
like what where do you get this idea
that you're going to teach me something
I've said that I've been doing for so
long
you know teach me whatever you see me
doing something crystal leg then come to
come teach me in that cuz i'm not
i'm not the best crystal lengths
developer out there right teach me that
when you see me start doing some job
teach me that when you start seeing me
go doing go and i'm up teach me
that cuz i'm gonna be on that right but
on that i know come on man
you you guys are sounding
ridiculous right now
y'all look crazy what do you follow up
this irrelevant now it's just
conversation you know it's mine that's
what I do in my my lunch breaks man I
come here tell you how for you for the
day tell you how I'm in the mood for
this I'm in the mood for that I respond
back to people on the comments respond
back to people on on how you call this
on the live like that's what this you
know slow section of what developer
lunch breaks is about you know so yeah
that's why I give it I give them a
little bit light again with just a
little pinch I gave a little pinch a
little pinch of attention that much you
see that much that much attempting I
give word sorry you see that now saying
it's naming just on this week alone I go
I got like a whole bunch of gray
hairs on like it's not I'm not even
lying there was so much stress and my
job I is crazy
let me see it's really cool that you
give it give your time yeah man I'm here
I'm out here man I'm out here for my
peoples freakin us crazy kid
interesting gaming HD what out man is
good to see new peoples in here Mandela
good to see you in here I love seeing
new people in here man every day new
people come in Clarence what up I love
seeing that man what kind of stress well
I told you guys remember we just
released a new website right so we just
released a new website the new website
is sort of buggy because we kind of rust
it because upper level management wanted
to rush it so there's a lot of
bugs so now you know it's a real website
it's not like this is not a
website where you guys going oh yeah
they they make $10,000 $50,000
you know there's a multi-million dollar
company like they make millions
like millions and millions and millions
last year was like 40 million right
which is not that much in large scheme
of things but for a small business of
200 employees is still still pretty good
right so right now the certain bugs on
the website so we're trying to fix all
of that so we have to basically we
have like this API that connects our
database from the website tool to the
back where you know people create the
glasses and all that so they build
the glasses
and you know for the machines so it's
like everything that we do on the
website connects to real machines in the
back that bill glasses and and
sorts things out so yeah so there was
like some some type of bug that you know
I don't know some issue there
I wasn't dealing it dealing with it too
much my my part is mostly the front end
of the of the page but I'm doing the
admin section so there's a lot of bugs
there's that I have to fix and you know
there was just a lot of issues and
so we were just you know kind of
stressed out man like stress guess to
you guys like you guys thing like this
 is a joke you know but for those
 people was looking people that
think that I'm home jerking off
or something then like oh man this guy
is not a real developer da-da-da-da-da
he comes here with a finish and he's
always stabbing oh my god damn right so
they really think like I'm in there I'm
I'm a job I'm in my job like that you
know so well what they don't know is
like a work man I really work
unlike a lot of people from this
you know this is my web
developers lunch break guys this is when
I come here talk I release it and
let it be known man it's like you know a
lot of people come here and act
like they working
they don't even work like they
give it out tutorials they
talking giving out advice they haven't
worked as a developer for more than 10
years they haven't done and you
know it's like I'm out here I'm I'm in
the trenches right now son I'm in the
trenches I'm in the field you know I'm
out here working son I'm in the field
right now so you know so when I come in
here and say what developers lunch break
this is a real web developers lunch
straight man you know so
that's what I'm saying man you know it
was like it's easy to work it's easy to
work in your house and go something guys
but when you're like you have to build
something right and you have to build it
properly and you have to debugging you
have to make work and you're like
oh man what I just created if there's
errors on in there's like
glitches on it the company is gonna lose
money and then people's gonna come to
you and be like yo widest this
lens options don't work then you know
that's what stress comes out you know
stress comes down by oh man I'm stressed
out timing I don't know this life man
you know that's just how it is
what up King flip a smart boy right
there
it's a couple of people that mess with
and that's definitely one of them King
flip is is the man I love his channels
like straight up man
if I could if I could straight up our
 paint came flip to record my
 channel cuz the way he does it I
wish I could do it like I have to sing
cameras him but he does this in a
way words I get smooth is you know got
the slow motion got the right music at
the right time you know the hitch is
legit you know like that's one thing I
won't point I need to get on that game
man like having legit like I'm
getting there but you gotta understand
your boys out here working working
full-time and I wish I was just like I
wish I was like one of his
people that they could survive
with like a thousand two thousand
dollars a month this and then they
could just stay home and and just
 work on YouTube right there's a
lot of people who are like that on
YouTube like straight up like they lives
they live in like in the middle
of America where
 rent is like 500 bucks they pay
400 bucks for a house they like
you know what I really like there's a
lot of people out here like that that's
why you know they could they have the
time you know but when you out here man
just my all my bills put together it's
like six thousand dollars a month that
 is a lot so it's like you know what
I mean like it's hard I can't
just stop working and be like yo
I'm just gonna chill and do
YouTube all the time I wish I could man
I really wish I could and I don't even
know I'm about to have a kid I don't

four or five thousand dollars a month
like they should got a it gotta
slow down

right and then it's just like
how you call it like how big he
said more money more problems the more
money you make the more expensive
that you get the most more expensive

and then you're like oh I gotta pay
$10,000 a month from you know so
now I gotta cut down that's my plan like
this next two months I'm going hard I'm
cutting down I'm paying off everything
that I need to pay off
I'll cut that down to 3,000
