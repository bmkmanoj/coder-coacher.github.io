at it again man Conan freeze dark kind
of them listen yo shit is crazy this how
you know i'm i'm doing good out here
right now man listen guys I know there's
a lot of people that watched me there's
a lot of people that you know they also
do youtubing they check out my channel
and and everything but please don't
clone me man just let me rock let me let
me get a little bit big and then you
could clone what I do then you could go
it you know do the same shit that I do
promote the same shit that I'm doing do
everything that I'm doing right please
guys you know I like every single
YouTube where I'm super open to do
collaborations with other people but
come on man my channel is not even
10,000 subscribers yet and I already
found two clones matter of fact there's
three clones out there that i found that
pretty much it it's taking my format
taking what I'm doing out here on
YouTube and I'm like yo I don't even
have 4,000 subscribers yet how are you
how are you finding me in and just
cloning my whole swag don't clone my
shit take what I'm doing maybe do it
your own way do it your own style find
your own lane find your own wave man
don't copy what I'm doing that's all I'm
saying man if I'm doing something you
know what it's so crazy that when I
started my channel right I looked at
everybody's channel I say you know what
I'm not gonna do tutorials like learn
code Academy I'm not gonna go in and do
p or high collars pure videos from
freako camp because coding was a coding
tutorials 360 I was doing it already and
I say you know what I'm not gonna
fucking do that because I can be
original are coming to youtube it create
something that's new or
you know something that's different and
just pretty much just be myself when
your yourself it just you people who
notice that people could notice that
you're actually just being yourself you
just you just don't care you know what I
mean like I've seen other channels that
are fucking cloning other channels like
come on man and then on top of that like
I'll throw one of the guys names out
there like fucking clever programmer the
dude pretty much copy what coding
tutorials 360 was doing and you know
because of Google's algorithm basically
his channel has been blowing up and it's
cool that is blowing up at the same time
it's like you're not original you're
pretty much copying somebody else's shit
all right so that's one of the channels
that is copy somebody else I'm not gonna
give light to the dudes are copying me
on my channel because I'm just not gonna
do that I'm not gonna give him no
fucking light but come on man don't
fucking copy other people's shit you
know like the whole shape between me and
in a hike honest and this fucking guy
what's his name the fucking dude that I
said that I i was in fucking way I
forgot his name man but the whole shit
about him I made a video about him was
because oh yeah Chris Hawks the whole
reason why i made a video about him was
because number one he sounded like an
asshole in a video that i saw and where
he was talking about you know other
people collaborating and then he
explained to me why he don't collaborate
and its understand sometimes you just
don't have the time so i took down the
video but i also made the video because
somebody told me like hey man Chris
hooks talked about the same thing and
this and that and I'm like you know what
I got mad because I don't I specifically
if I see a video that Chris Hawks made a
video I don't talk about that if I see
simple program or make a video about
something
like not so in computer science general
or programming in general but something
specifically a topic that he came up
with an idea that he came up with I
don't talk about that I don't create the
same shit I don't create the same
content because then now you're not
being original and it really sucks when
somebody takes your idea and then this
is becoming more more popular than you
luckily that's not happening to me yet
but when somebody goes and take your
your idea like you know like clever
programmer he fucking took Oh coding was
a corner according to Tori's 360s whole
idea and pretty much just ran with it
and now he's being he's more popular
than even coating tutorials 360 he's
growing faster than him but nobody can
deny he just fucking copy his whole swag
man he just copying his whole fucking
format and I don't know man like I think
you just gotta fucking have some respect
out here you know I you know what I mean
like put some fucking respect on people
standing put some fucking respect on on
people's ideas man because this is the
problem with you too somebody create
something somebody creates on a certain
meet and they see oh that shit is
working this shit is working for that
person let me try to get in there take
his views take his subscribers sake
whatever he's working on whatever took
him who knows how long that should take
somebody like you know for me it took me
like a few months where I was like man
should i do a youtube video should I you
know should I put my face out here for
this shit and I was like you know what
maybe I should you know what i mean so
now people are just cloning what i'm
doing man don't clone what I do man like
view the channel for what it is like it
enjoy it and then create your own thing
man you know I like what Chris Christian
said you know like he don't do tutorials
because there's already a million people
doing tutorials nobody else is doing
vlogs so that makes same original
nobody's doing vlogs as far as like
developers
you know what I mean but there's a lot
of people that's just fucking copying
people Styles man don't do that don't
come to my channel and fucking take my
swag man because I'll take this shit
serious you know what I mean like I'm
fucking make your videos every fucking
day and don't shit every single day and
then like for somebody just be like okay
this is working for whatever programmer
don't fucking come here and copies
people shit man that shit pisses me the
fuck off like straight up you know and a
good note man fucking a little rant
about you don't don't fucking copy you
know just be yourself be original man
especially people are here on YouTube
they try to be fucking you know
professional speakers and the way how
they looking at this thing is totally
wrong like people come to youtube to see
somebody else experience right to see
somebody else's experience and be like
hey I want to know how it's like to be a
developer you know who's 29 years old
who was a Hispanic or whatever they just
like everything you know how I talk or
whatever it is right but they like that
about me they know I'm not here trying
to be a fucking public speaker or
fucking talk perfect and fucking be like
hey guys make sure you go buy my book
I'm not doing that shit make sure you go
sign up for my fucking five hundred
dollar coins even though I've never
worked as a developer like come on man
don't fucking come here to youtube if I
can take advantage of people man because
then it just if I can look shitty on
everybody else because people come here
did somebody love me to come and be like
oh are you really a developer and I'm
like yeah I'm brilliant developer my god
that's what I work at like you know I
work in a real company I work I've been
doing it for five years and why do
people even act something like that it's
because fucking they know that there's a
lot of clowns on YouTube that say hey
I'm an expert at this
I'm an expert at that but then they're
not even fucking real experts they don't
have no experience in this field you
know what I mean that's all I'm saying
you know don't copy other people's style
don't stop cloning niggas Styles man
don't close my shit right straight up
man right oh by the way guys oh fucking
tonight we gotta do the podcast i'ma do
this shit quick you know a little quick
podcast whoever wants to be on it send
me a email coding face @ gmail.com I'm
just saying man like if you want to be
part of the podcast tonight let me know
send me your information a couple of
people are cancelling which kind of
sucks but that's all done man if they
can't make it I'm sorry you know
sometimes it's got to make a little
sacrifice sometimes you know if you want
to be part of something cool you got to
make a sacrifice sometimes you gotta go
to sleep late sometimes you gotta wake
up early whatever it is on your time
zone you know like I'm doing the thing I
a p.m. and uh yeah so it's like it's
just a little bit of sacrifice man I
understand that a lot of people that
they're you know in other countries they
can't make it because at the time zone
but sometimes if you can make the
sacrifice to try to make it if you cant
its fine because I'm gonna do one on the
weekend another one for the podcast on
the weekend maybe like a 12 p.m. eastern
time or one p.m. eastern time so like
that wherever in the world they're still
be early you'll still be like eight
o'clock at night or not look like a
night for you guys so that's fine and
also to man make sure you go to coding
face calm that's the website that you
gotta check out man I'm still building
it you can't register yet but every
single day I add a little bit more to it
you know what I mean
yeah man I'm fuckin tired today I did
not want to come to work I don't like I
really did I want to come to work it's
like fucking raining as you can see and
I'm like oh man I gotta be in here till

you know again yeah man like I'm just
saying whatever you do you could be a
freaking you know you could be an artist
you could be a graphic artist you could
be a architect you could be whatever you
want to become in this world right but
men don't clone somebody else's shit man
take that as inspiration and find it
inside of you of how to you know create
something new create something cool
don't copy the next person right because
what work for them might not work for
you and if it does work for you people's
going to know that you with just a copy
if you're just a copy like people know
this shit man people know how you know
if you're a fucking fake online if
you're you're fake and you'd be like oh
I'm fucking oh I fucking work for Google
people could fucking search that shit up
if you'd be like hey if I can pay four
hundred dollars for a one-to-one course
with me people can fucking search that
here you've never fucking worked in your
life as a developer so how r is you
fucking charging four hundred dollars to
people like that's all I'm saying link
you know that you have to have some
consideration I understand I get you
know you might charge twenty dollars an
hour to somebody because you're pretty
much like Twitter in them but don't try
to fucking try to charge like man money
on people especially when you don't have
no no real life experiences indistinct
and on top of that you're fucking
channel your cloning people like come on
man but yeah man let me see what's good
will go everybody in the chat let's see
what you guys is up to
let me see let me see what I what I what
I would up sorry you know today is not I
ought to make this little lion video
about coding I just let this shit no
because there's a lot of people who come
to my channel and they see the channel
to see what I'm doing this seat oh the
courses that I'm promoting the they see
I'm the fucking creating shit out here

I'm trying to help people out and
they're like you know what that's just

what I mean
yeah you know I mean I got I've got
nothing against the kid but it's just
like man don't clone people shit man you
know what I mean like people come in

every single day you know what I me and
for somebody else to just come and just
steal your fucking idea don't steal
other people's shit man
yeah live people if people buy the on
the course yeah Gallo sign a yellow
change you throw you know course this is
like ten dollars so as I the quizzes
like ten dollars I probably make like
two dollars three dollars and it's not
even like I'm fucking become a
millionaire off the chain it's more like
people keep asking me what courses that
I take to become a device so i pretty
much say hey there's all the five
courses that made me into a developer I
could come in here and just be super
fake and be like hey guys I'm on fucking
promoting this course and doing this and
that I'm like nah you know people have
hit me up from you to me right people
from you to me have hit me up and they
told me hey you're you're you're
bringing us a lot of a lot of sales on
my gear I know and they're like you know
how about you know you promote
discourses and I'm like man I've never
taken that question those courses did
not make me into the developer that I am
today I'm not going to fucking say hey
guys go check out the c-sharp course
I've never taken a c-sharp course
because I'm not interested in that shit
so why would I tell you guys you know go
take a course for you know what I mean
or like hey guys go sign up for this
boot camp when I've never even been to a
boot camp like I do now become a
developer because of a boot camp you
know what i mean so and they constantly
hearing me up tell them in the hey man
first they told me like yeah we're going
to give you six hundred dollars for a
video for start promoting for three
months right boot camp I'm not gonna say
the name then they now to send me
another one where I game we're going to
pay twice as much 1200 1200 hours a
month right a lot of people be like oh
man so 100 artists is allowed maybe
they'll be good for me what I gotta do
is just promote them on my other videos
but it's like then I will have to be
fake I don't I've kind of taken a
fucking bootcamp course I've never been
into a boot camp so how would i look
like promoting
right the full stack boot camp is not
really it's all it's what pretty much
that guy what's his name Chris Cole
something like that cope something he's
actually a very well-known instructor in
boot camps like they hired him from
different boot camps to go teach right
in the same shit that he's teaching on
you to me is what he teaches on the boot
camp right but when you go to the boot
camp they're going to charge you twelve
thousand dollars to twenty thousand
dollars he's selling it to you for
fucking ten dollars like that's the same
shit they're going to teach you our any
boot camp I guarantee you that so yeah
that course is legit man yeah my email
is coding face @ gmail.com you know what
I mean it's like right now somebody
could come in and be like hey Joe we're
gonna hire you to come teach our our
bootcamp right automatically for me to
go to teach at a boot camp is going to
be like a hundred thousand dollars right
a year which is like you know a good
eight thousand eight thousand dollars a
month right now if I create the same
course that I'm going to teach you in
person for ten dollars will you buy it
most likely year it's fucking ten
dollars why would you want to go to a
bouquet and paint fucking twelve
thousand dollars for three months it
comes out to four thousand dollars a
month you know what I mean like I don't
make no sense
we finish the HTML CSS free coal camp
man checkout the courses below man check
the courses on the description that's
what you need to be at you know because
you can sign up to team tree house to
which has a whole bunch of different
topics but at the same time they're not
teaching you how to put everything
together into a website that's what the
udemy courses teacher like for me that's
why I like them because they go from
every different of scratch so it's like
you start in the beginning from HTML CSS
definitely start building in JavaScript
then from there you build a back-end so
all the information you don't get that
from like teen treehouse date they teach
you topic by topic but they don't teach
you the whole thing on how to build it
you know the full video yeah now I
really appreciate it city on city curves
man I like that I'm City curves and bunk
down you're killing them right now with
that name oh my god it's fucking people
I'm trying to get out everybody wants to
fucking get out at the same time
fucking is crazy this fucking parking
lot gets crazy on lunch time everybody
wants to come to the same store hold on
give me a second guys it's just you know
it's like an accident waiting to happen
one of my viewers sent me a message like
Joe I'm worried about you you make me
nervous when I see you making videos on
the car you driving I'm like man I've
been doing this shit for years man I
just happen to do it now on YouTube but
I always been making videos driving it's
a skilled I already have
why okay why do I think Chris Sean what
only needs a jquery his company what I
think in reality you you don't even need
jquery or anything you could do
everything through javascript but jquery
makes things easier now for whatever
he's working on if you don't need to
have like a big framework that's great
because it saves them the time of
dealing with a lot of bullshit of
frameworks instead of doing that he
could just start coding you know what I
mean like sometimes you don't need a
framework and that's what I tell people
like hey you don't need react you don't
need view you don't need all this
angular and all this crazy shit just
because people tell you hey you got a
fucking download this you know this the
coolest new framework you don't fucking
need that shit you know because jquery's
been around for over 10 I'm taking over
10 years I think or maybe like eight
nine years right jquery is it's all you
really need at first now when you do you
start making more complex apps then a
framework is gonna be better so right
now I don't think that what krishan is
working on is like super complex he's
not working on single page apps you know
what I mean like from my understanding
you know so it's different needs every
company has therefore meet you know it
will be crazy for him to like the same
if all he needed to do was just
something simple like you know submit
forms like little animations and adding
classes and removing class like why
would you mean a big framework you don't
need that shit you know what I mean that
all that's gonna do is slow him down so
that's why I think you don't use or any
other framework at his company not every
company
you
and do you need everything in JavaScript
sometimes you don't man sometimes you
really don't need every single thing
from JavaScript but it's good to know it
because at one point you will you know
what I mean it's like let me say an
example like a first your first I think
you could go a whole a whole six months
without having to need JavaScript
promises right but and that's if you're
working just on the front end and that's
it but the moment the moment that you
should well using something like Ajax
you
you
you've forgotten e javascript javascript
promises
okay I'm losing service out here for
some reason always in my job there's no
service are you for whatever reason but
yeah for JavaScript just know he says
is what is a if next
and what else does pretty much that's
all you really need know how to add
classes know how to remove from element
and that's it
hey
any man I appreciate it you already know
it's your boy we need to work something
out man when when your website is done
let me know man so I could show it to
the people because feel good yeah right
now super I will see you guys later cuz
this is to la arena</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
