it again coding face.com your boys back
in adarand did it again
listen guys this week we have something
special we have something very special
there's a new section call hey coding
face updates alright so I'm gonna do
this once a week to basically go over
the things that I've been up to on
coding phase comm and showing it to you
guys alright so first of all basically
we finished the sass like a pro course
it's pretty short short and sweet I
didn't want to give you guys hours and
hours or something that you don't need
it's it's that simple I break it down
what people create courses that's like
an hour two hours three hours I've seen
SAS courses there are eight hours and
I'm like why are you taking so long to
explain something this simple let me
break it down so for the people right so
that's what we did here we created the
SAS like a pro basically get you up and
running all right that's what I was up
to this week there from there we got you
know terminal for developers everything
that you need to know from the terminal
nothing more nothing less
everything that you need to know for the
terminal as a developer I'm not giving
you shell commands I'm not giving you a
whole bunch of stuff that you don't you
don't need all you need is the stuff
like change directory remove files
create files you know move rename that's
it that's all you really need so for a
developer this your go-to course man
when it comes to the terminal all right
now then from there what else I did this
week man this week definitely we started
the es6 year 7 breaking down es 7 man
and es6 of course um we got like a lot
of things it's not complete yet I'm
completing everything this week even
after this video right now I'm doing
more videos for the es6 course
right like I said guys my goal is to
break things down in a way that anybody
can learn it so that's what I've been up
to year six was I love JavaScript you
guys probably know that by now
I love JavaScript that's one of my main
go-to things people been asking me this
whole time like Joe where do I learn
laravel how can I learn there about PHP
laravel simple guys is right here
laravel like a boss basically created
this this course for you now this is not
complete this is like a really really
long course that's probably gonna take a
month or two to complete but every week
we're finishing up one project I'm
probably gonna do like four to five
projects right and what I'm gonna do is
we're gonna create a couple of projects
and then I'm gonna have other sections
where I explain exactly every piece of
Larrabee
so you could come back you know after
you do your project and you could say
hey man do I go to the laravel
documentation or do I go to Joe to
basically explain things for me in a
simple way so that's what I'm doing I'm
basically giving you projects and then
from there breaking down a lot of the
things in the documentation that for
newcomers you probably be like oh wait
what is this so I just break it down for
you all right now what else I did this
week another thing that I was working on
was basically I know how to code now
what I think everybody seen this video
right there's a video that I'm dropping
a video every week probably I'm gonna do
like two videos this week on this topic
the next topic is to basically how to
build your resume all right and then
after that where to find jobs because
you know people give you courses people
give you advice but nobody gives you the
course or the the answers that you need
after
you learn how to code I keep seeing
comments on YouTube of people that
they're like really prepared like and
they telling me like oh man I got my
portfolio but for some reason man I
can't find a job I'm like bro there's
something that people haven't been
giving you and it's like the right cheek
coats man and that's what I'm doing
right now in this course I know how to
code now what what do I do after this
man so far right now people have been
loving this video this one of my I guess
one of my biggest videos so far like
literally we made I don't know like two
thousand views in like a day or
something like that
pretty much people are going crazy about
this this course is really gonna change
the game because nobody has done this
before nobody has given you the right
tools you know to to have after you you
finish learning how to code like okay
you know how to code whoopty-doo what do
you want us to do you know is like now
you need the skills to get the job
because that's that's what we're here
for we're not here for you know for our
intellectual you know being a no yeah I
just want to become the smartest person
and learn everything under the Sun no
you here for a reason you're here for a
job so how can I have courses for you
and not tell you was gonna happen after
you learn how to code right so that's
what we're doing here alright that's
what I did this week let's see what else
we got Adam text editor there's another
course still not complete but I'm
building it right now and for everybody
that's watching this this is completely
free this course right here is
completely free and I keep telling
people like hey guys you know because
