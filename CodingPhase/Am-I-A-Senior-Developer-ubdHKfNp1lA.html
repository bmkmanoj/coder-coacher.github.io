simple jump back at it again man listen
today's question is Joe are you a senior
developer well I think in paperwork I am
a senior developer mean if you look at
at the paper you'd be like oh yeah you
look at the resume but okay he worked
for a lot of companies he's done a lot
of projects he knows a lot of
programming languages he definitely
knows a lot so he has to be a senior
developer and to be honest with you guys
no I'm not a senior developer well I
mean currently the company where I'm at
right now all right I'm not a senior
developer and why is that because I
don't go to job positions where my title
is senior developer you know senior
developer I I don't care about that I
don't want to be a senior developer at
any company particularly because of what
happened the last time that I went into
basically a company and I was basically
labeled as a senior developer and I mean
I don't know for most people I guess
this doesn't happen to them but for me
this what happened to me basically I
went in I was a senior developer a
senior front-end developer and next
thing you know I'm basically holding a
lot of responsibilities I'm doing way
too much work I'm having to stay late
almost every day I'm working on the
weekends I ended up being like you know
mentoring other people you know interns
that came in so I found myself doing
you know I bought like 60 to 70 hours a
week on just you know just because I
have the you know quote-unquote the
title hey he's the senior developer he's
the go-to guy to do everything he still
whenever you have a question you
wanna go ask them you wanna want him to
do it man and after that you know I
realized well I don't want to be a
 senior developer I just want to
be a fly on the wall let me do
my code I come in when I come in I don't
have responsibility for of going to go
into meetings you know project managing
multiple peoples it's like it's already
hard when you work on your own code and
then you have to worry about other
people's code or you have to worry about
helping out others or making sure
everybody's on tracked or you know going
over everybody's gay you know sometimes
people do merge conflicts you gotta
solve the conflicts you gotta go
do meetings with the owners or marketing
team make that side of the senior
developer role I don't care about so
what did I learn from that right I'm
like hey
I know there's gonna be a limit of like
how much money I might be able to earn
you know in the world of development and
as far as my career because I don't want
a necessary level of responsibilities
that I like anything past that I don't
want it the money is not working you
have to be there all the time you could
 barely take a day off the day
you take a day off people are looking at
you like crazy like old man you're the
senior developer you're supposed to be
here what happens when something breaks
it's like man I just want to be a
 regular developer coming to work
I don't want a responsibilities I don't
want to be responsible for for the whole
 company I don't want to be the
go-to guy that people are looking for
answers because I'm just there to work
I'm not there to that's not my
 company that's how I look at it
like that's not my company yeah
I can make you know I see people who
have like you know the senior role and
they get to they get to get you know up
to a hundred eighty thousand dollars
when I think about em like man I could
make that extra 80,000 I could make it
on my own on cool projects that I do or
you know side projects that I do for
crying or for clients and and like
that but man I don't want to be
responsible for a single company I don't
want to have that responsibility I don't
need it like I already have enough
in my life then to be worrying about how
is this company that I'm working for is
doing good is all the code perfect are
people getting along because
then there's other too like you
know this you gotta have certain people
skills like you gotta manage
other people don't like each other
sometimes people just they get into you
know beefs or arguments and like
that thing us two senior developer I
gotta come in and you know bring it down
and better hey guys come on man
come on huddle up you know let's be nice
to each other you know whatever whatever
the you gotta say you know and it's
like it's not just about the coke and
it's like yes I could do anything
anything that you throw at me I could
build it but the issue is the
responsibilities that come with that
title so I learned that I'm comfortable
I just been just a mid-level developer
being just going you know for
depositions we're just as developer or
front-end developer or back-end
developer or full stack developer I'm
fine with that
if it's a senior developer I don't want
it I'm now looking excellent because
there's always gonna be an extra extra
responsibility that they want from you
is like man I have a personal life I
don't want to be
thinking about this company 24/7 this is
not my company like you know
it's different if you're part owners and
you're like oh yeah but even in my last
job the owner had my personal
number of you know the CEO had my
personal number you will call me up like
hey hey on a Saturday afternoons
like hey there's something going on with
the website and this doesn't that I'm
like I'm out of there like I don't
 need to be talking about the
website
I'm on free time
you know what I mean so no again I got a
senior role because I don't need like
what that and just like okay guys my
name is Joe my cold that's it I
want to be the fly on the wall that's
doing his work and after five o'clock
hits I'm out of there wait 459 I'm
already packing my up you know like
if I'm I'm not the owner the
company I'm not like that's what the
things a lot of people get so invested
into coding
even link you know into the cold and
invest into a company it is like man
you're not even your worker
grown like you're not even a
owner why are you giving so much of your
 time of your life into a company
you're not even owning this the
company is already earning like you know
100 million dollars and you make barely
not even 1% of whatever the
company makes you know like you don't
even make anything of that reality
it comes out so for me that's why I'm
not a senior developer you know
in paper I am a severe developer I have
the skills but and my job I'm not I
don't I don't really go for
those titles because even right now my
boy who works with me you know he came
in just as a regular developer the
senior developer that was there before
him was pretty much a piece of to
do never really did his work never say
anything and happens that at the
end of the day now he's you know the
other guy got fired and now he's the
senior developer but now he has so much
responsibilities and so much that
if I could see it in his face is like
it's not really worth it it's not worth
the stress and you know sometimes the
owners try to throw a little extra money
at you like he is money man go ahead
take all the stress take all these
 problems you know money is gonna
solve it money is not gonna
solve anything you're not gonna be
 happy there you know some people
they like that they like the
pressure they they they shine when they
have a lot of stress and a lot of
pressure me I don't I just don't like it
I just like I like to code I don't like
to go into a job where I'm the go-to guy
I don't like that feeling because now
I'm responsible for everything there
people look at you like you're you're
 you're Jesus and you're gonna go
and save the company all the
time we're saved the website or come up
with the latest thing or the newest
thing you're like man what I want to do
is cold I'm not here to
you know be the Savior so that's
why I don't take you know senior roles
it's just not working man the money is
not working man like right now the money
that could be getting in in a senior
position I'm already making that on the
side on cool project some cool here
on YouTube or you know clients like
making more money than a lot of
senior developers and what I'm making
that's like your baby you know yeah if
 working on this website for the
past three years and you know we're
rolling out this new feature and this
and that and we have four agile team we
 using JIRA all this other crazy
 I'm like man all I wanted to do is
just call I don't care about no
big words don't give me no new
paradigms waterfall
 agile teams and like that
like I just wanna call don't talk to me
about test-driven development
I think I'm not doing on that
because I don't care about it you know
what I mean
anyways but in a positive no guys good
morning to you guys yeah now that was
just answering a question because
somebody asks me hey am i a senior
developer I'm like no no I don't
want to be like when you get to when you
get to that level and you go to senior
positions man you guys will know what
the hell I'm talking about everybody
that that were has worked as a senior
developer or has worked as the single
developer in a company knows the type of
pressures that you get and the type of
expectations they want from you and it's
really not working
yeah
anyways man let me see what you guys is
here talking about I'm gonna check the
chat real quick for two seconds I know
it's probably you know a lot of people
right now because it's super early but I
wanted to do this right before I went to
work especially because sudden gets a
little podcast yesterday or making new
videos I got a record a couple of videos
yesterday but I gotta edit them so once
I finish edit them then I'll be live
I'll put it up a line man I hate waking
up early man like you guys don't know
like I feel like I hate this
 that's why I can't wait to like
give me one more year man like I'm not
working no more like I already said that
 I'm not working no more I'm not
working for anybody anymore
I'm saving my money opening up my own
business so yeah that's the goal that's
what we're going to okay
I have to do okay I don't see too much
is given much is required being on top
is a sacrifice because the appropriate
way of doing it it is to serve and be a
servant leader yep
GG Jim hey word what up Andrew oh shoot

it has to be like a super Irish accent
like it's like I came and do it but it's
like I came how you doing man I forgot I
used to have a nice Irish Ireland
 accent like my people should I
done can't do it I can't do it
I mean Irish is English you know it's
not really another language it's just
more like a little a little accident but
you know it's like that's one of the
things man I guess what I got
if I had like a a British accent or or
Irish accent or like a
Australian accent I feel like everything
that I say would be golden
no matter what because it just sounds so
proper it sounds like this person knows
what the they talking about now
you've seen those Apple commercials went
what's the guy's name
something I've saw some like that
that's his name something like that
Gino Ives or something like that it's
the British guy that always
announces the the new iPhones like yeah
it's like it's a brand new phone brand
new style whatever is like what the
whole British accent it and yeah
it just sounded legit it's like you want
to buy it already you're like oh my God
he's speaking proper English you
know
one man yeah you guys have your own
language I didn't know that I didn't
know that Irish had Ireland had its own
language you know
let's see let's see yo Abdo for one what
up yo hablo do you ever finish the
course that I gave you man
you never updated me on that that you
finished that course Thanks
this is up man I give you so many
free courses to people and nobody
updates me like hey I finished the
course it was great thank you
nobody comes back and tells me man
that's why I kind of haven't been giving
out free courses for the past two weeks
because it's like most people don't come
back or like look I sent out courses
right and people don't even come back
and be like oh thank you for the course
like that's ten dollars like
sometimes I paid twenty dollars for them
right it adds up you know I was like I
was spending in the beginning of
spending like $600 my first love phone
on YouTube I spent $600 on
courses and then from there the second
month I think I spent like 400 then a
lot of people donated a lot of money and
then I use that money from the donations
and bought another $200 from free
courses gave it out to a lot of guys
from South Africa India a lot of
Filipinos and then nobody comes back
which is kind of up you know what
I mean like I give you a free
course I give you a free course least I
could do is come back and update me like
a man I'm working on the course like
 is coming out good thank you for
for the course like people that come
here and they buy a course themselves
they come back and send me emails like
oh man thank you for you know giving me
this courses which ones to buy and
things have been going great but then
the people that give it out for free
don't even come back and tell me nothing
don't even let me know how she went you
know it's crazy
where Barbara like we need to link up me
and you definitely when you come back
out here and let me know maybe you come
Cho over here to York man I miss you
will you please make a video how to
learn faster online courses show
impractically I'm a butcher now 20 years
or work game computer science where we
learn so slow to use it now feel like we
learn nothing
yeah that's the problem with computer
science man that's why I kind of left it
alone I went in for one year like it's
crazy but I have technically I went to
school for about like six years for six
years of college two years to get my
associates I know I did one year of
teacher education because I didn't know
what I was gonna do I wanted to become a
teacher my mom's a teacher my father was
a college professor so I didn't know
what I was gonna do that was like
it I'm gonna go to be a teacher then I
realized I'm like man I love computers
too much i'ma go for computer science
when I'm to computer science and
realized it was so boring I was
like oh my god boring so then I went to
I switched it up to programming systems
which was IT work I thought it was gonna
be about programming because it says
programming and systems that I learned
programming know
so whatever it was too late I graduated
then from there I went to to school to
another school for a four-year degree
and basically I did a communication
design but it was all about design so I
was like now I know design but I still
don't know how to code so then from
there even after I graduated that's when
I started learning from
you know I did a muffin tin treehouse
and then I did the rest of my career
just learning from you to me you know
it's just crazy but yeah I got the deal
must yeah man I had to switch it up man
you know sometimes I got to switch it up
sometimes I'm gonna do a little shine
and shine like you you see how I got
this right here like oh I can't receive
my but you see this right here is
like the little five o'clock shadow
shave a little bit down here you know
let the little mustache on top be a
little bit longer than everything else
you know it's just like you know hit him
with that you know once you once you hit
surely with them what up that says It's
A Wrap after that you know what I mean
you know what the deal mustache man all
right oh let me see what else but you
now two years and yeah I read that
already
I'm going to Cali next Friday okay do
you recommend staying in school what the
developers don't need degree they don't
need a degree man but the thing is that
it looks better if you have a degree for
like let's say an example you don't know
where life might be you know you might
say hey I like programming now but five
years from now you might hate this
you might just be like man I want to
leave I want to go work something else
if you want to work at any other job
they might take you because you have
experience but if you have to degree
they'll take you because oh yeah this
person has four years degree you know
it's like even though it's not it's not
the same thing like right now I could go
and become a teacher school teacher
I'll take I think it's a workshop for
six weeks and then because I already
have two degrees I have a regular degree
they'll take me in and I could become a
teacher and teach little kids you know
from ages one to eight no from grades
one to eight I could teach you know but
that's like a back-up plan like you
never know if like I can't find a job I
go to a state where I can never find a
job I could literally just be like hey
I'm just gonna be a teacher because I
have a degree you know what I mean like
when you don't have a degree
your next option is Walmart you
know you go to Walmart or you go to
 Macy's or some like that
or you go to Foot Locker yeah
yeah man yeah guys so I'm actually
layout supposed to be able already I
must see you guys later hopefully I
don't get in trouble but I'm not worried
about it
Oh I'll see you guys later man stay up
stay positive
yeah man search the rocky stack that's
gonna be the new stack man I always come
up with something new man you gotta
reinvent yourself all the time man you
know gotta hit him
gotta hit him with it and at the job be
like hey MA see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
