videos for you guys yeah but it'd be
checking that out Danny said this is
Loki the best channel on YouTube and
like people need to know about your boy
Joe I was like one of these days man I
wanna do like some more collaborations
when I think you know collaborations
with other other stuff like encoding but
I want this channel to grow for regular
people and for programming in general
like my whole goal can actually do it I
want them to do yep there's what I'm
gonna join my live stream because this
Matt traffic traffic traffic a lot of
traffic traffic we need a meet and greet
with both of you guys I'm the baby yeah
yeah what could be a single here on the
low
scoop show my face you wiped up ma let
they talk about courting talk about cozy
really for me Oh
JC said he's still learning JavaScript
those good you gotta learn JavaScript he
talked to a manager to do an internship
at full stack but he has he said for the
internship I will not pay I live alone
in Vegas so nobody can support me here
so I rejected that after yeah I know
that not all make no sense I smoked
dreams are you driving the car that you
bought in May yes same car we upgrading
those oh yeah least your traffic doesn't
contain horse and buggies upgrades next
year man give me another year I'm gonna
give this to wifey I'm getting that
mozzie get myself a mozzie
pull back in the lemonade
knowing my name
Trenton said he learned PHP before Jas
and it seemed easier to pick up yeah
because it's just a regular programming
language you know it's like when you're
dealing with stuff like you know the Dom
like it makes it a little bit harder for
people to learn it you know that's the
problem with JavaScript plus JavaScript
itself is like they freaking built a
programming language in a week you know
so if you have created a language in New
York is not gonna be perfect
there's definitely a lot of things that
makes it annoying for the web developing
challenges using bootstrap allowed yes
if you use bootstrap as long as you know
that you could actually do it on your
own without no bootstrap right if you
could do it by yourself which is we're
gonna see incest is fine you know what I
mean because it's only it's if you don't
know how to do it right
if you then it's fine
plus is like you beyond tomorrow is the
Lapidus it wants to you know create
their website you got till tomorrow okay
so send it to me so we could add you to
the list for next week next week well
what we're doing is I'm gonna have
everybody that sends me something right
I'm gonna show it on tomorrow's
happiness the past 3-4 weeks it kind of
sucks for the people that was there for
3-4 weeks but it gives a chance for
somebody from the audience to come in
and still they still the price this is
not the city there's the outskirts
choline sorry if I mispronounced what
should I do after completing the old you
to me well after you complete that start
building websites you should if you
already go through that whole course I
will say acquire the go to my website
check out the courses that I have there
okay like let's say react if you don't
know react you definitely need to learn
react right start building websites so I
will also say look into laravel because
you need to learn laravel like PHP is
just a programming language well no one
is gonna come to you and be like hey can
you build a PHP app from scratch that's
not gonna happen in the real world what
everybody does and every company does is
they tell you hey we're gonna use
laravel we're gonna use slim we're gonna
use cakephp we're gonna use code ignite
or whatever they use most likely is
gonna be those two laravel or slim so
look into those frameworks once you know
the language you need to learn the
framework so you can start building a
web app
occasions because a web application
framework what it does it basically
saves you from having to create things
all over again like from the beginning
like you should have happen you
shouldn't have to create user
authentication by yourself you shouldn't
have to deal with my sequel queries
without in orem like there's so many
little things that a framework does for
you but back in the days you know people
will have to code that from scratch it's
like this I think about I like this it's
like bootstrap right you know HTML CSS
right once you know that you know okay
cool I know this why would I spend time
creating all this stuff creating agree
creating all the these things from
scratch when I could use bootstrap and
then I could literally go in and get my
life a little bit faster and my my
workflow faster of course I don't know
if that's necessary I'll be honest it's
so easy like literally you just have to
look at it and you to like there's a lot
of people that have free bootstrap
tutorials like bull sharp is literally
like a 10-minute thing like if you guys
want it I could give when you're Korean
I got any explanation of the things that
you need from bootstrap or any CSS
framework I could do a video for that
now I could put it up online even to
YouTube for you know for everybody to
see cuz that's like there's really no
point to me to create like a paying
course a premium course on bootstrap
like it doesn't
did you ever create a hell yeah
yeah definitely have creative he wants
he or she I want to build a hat you
should think about html5 apps versus
native you should look into react native
take the course that I have on my
website
either that or Steven gratis course or
react and then Steven grinder has a
course pull react native which is going
to teach you the basics and you could
build a full application with react with
just you know JavaScript I'll see that's
what you really need because if you were
a now decided to create a full
application and you will so be like oh
I'm gonna have to learn Swift I'm gonna
have to learn Objective C I'm gonna have
to freakin learn how to build it with
Xcode do all that stuff like it's too
much work as I get cold</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
