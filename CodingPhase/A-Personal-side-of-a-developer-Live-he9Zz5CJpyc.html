the cold that's why I got my website :
face cop updated every single day and I
update this channel I used to updated
every single day now I'm thinking like
once every two days or I might do a web
developer lunch break
but it's just hard and it's hard I'll be
honest it's definitely hard to do like a
whole bunch of videos here a whole bunch
of videos on my channel a whole bunch of
videos you know everywhere else it's
like it's a lot of work kids but yeah
man let me see I guess nobody see you
tonight man it's like I caught you guys
on an off time this one thing man I
never tell nobody hey I'm going live
I'll never tell nobody
hey i'ma do this tonight maybe I should
start doing that because I just I'll be
showing up here I've been I okay cool I
feel like doing a live event I'm gonna
just do it you guys know how I am like
I'm pretty spontaneous I think of
something and I'm gonna do at that
moment so yeah it's the channels
actually called family face man
you know it's a little family face
saying that you have coding phase but
family faced with what a space
yeah Matt is like yell Joe Bravo has
money for internet and electricity to
stream you're giving off a strange vibe
job yeah man you boys broke out here man
times is hard man where we got Omar we
got Scotty we got our EP I repeat what

French sighs they could a the young NBA
draft pick aka our number-one draft pick
aka Oh young young Steve Jobs
we got Noah Bustos in here what up yes
I'm alive your boys alive man let me see
got a question there's a master of the
mosque says got a question can someone
who is visually impaired become a
developer I don't know to be honest with
you I don't know the answer to that one
because if you visually impaired how are
you going to code of course you can have
the keyboard there but I don't know if
you're blind I don't know how you're
gonna be able to tell cuz I don't I
don't think there is a program out there
that reads the lines that you're writing
you know I don't think so I don't think
there's a definitely a text editor that
you could do that I don't think so right
all right Scotty you actual says when is
the new gynaecology channel going up
listen one day man I'm thinking about
creating you know some t-shirts um
that's gonna be one of the
but uh the first seizures that I want to
I want to create I will sell me some
weed self-taught I myself to a
gynecologist and then in the back say
something like was good my we got to
come up with a couple of things I mean
my boy who's actually a graphic design
has been been telling me to to create a
couple of t-shirts and stuff like that
but I don't know I'll see I'll see what
I do man because it has to be cool stuff
man
I don't want to be doing like you know
like you got a regular t-shirt a
dirty-ass t-shirt from Kmart and then
it's like hey just because it says
coding face now people's gonna want that
that sounds dumb you know what I mean
like if I was to make like some t-shirt
it'll be like cool stuff like oh man
team treehouse taught me how to become a
self-taught gynecologist or let me see
what else something fun something funny
something that you'll see the t-shirt
Murray yeah well you got that t-shirt
from like oh man this guy from coding
phase calm he's he's crazy you know I
would like to have like a little like uh

watch watch straight dirtbag this be a
dirtbag in his world like y'all just cuz
you told me to throw out the garbage
ain't throwing the now I'm not gonna be
a dirtbag like that I gotta throw out
the garbage you know but yeah man we in
here man we live man you know me like
this times I want to talk about coldest
times that I wanted to do this and that
these days that I just don't especially
right now man like guys this is
something that I almost forgot man I
almost forgot how difficult it is to
build like a large app and how much work
it takes so all of you guys who actually
signed up to Conan face.com
I'll be honest you guys are good
whoever signed up to Conan feels calm
you guys are good y'all getting a lot of
content all right literally I'm talking
about hours and hours and hours like I
don't know how long I already got into
this man I'm already in like what 8:20
singing that's one hour right there
let's say right here that's two hours
let's say from there to there that's
three hours let's say from there today
and I say four hours four hours and a
half just on this on this project alone
real estate yeah and you guys know
how long it takes to basically build
these things right yeah I know how
difficult it is and how long it takes
because even though I'm doing it 20
minutes it's because I actually built
this thing but you guys think about it
like this 20 minutes for you guys it's
really more like to another 20 minutes
watching it plus another 20 minutes of
posting the video making sure running
down your code posting the video writing
down your code so if it's four hours and
a half that I have sold so far for this
project for you guys I'm looking at like
seven hours of content seven hours of
like continuous work for you guys like
you know what I mean
and it's really a crazy app man this is
the real estate this the thing that's
why I told you guys to build a realistic
because there's so much work to it man
like brain now I'm gonna show you guys
okay so pretty much this refresh this
from from scratch right now don't worry
about the styling because the styling is
this is like prototype mode right now
there's like very early stages so we
already did everything of getting data
showing it here and then now we
basically build the forms getting the
information from the forms and then now
what I did today which I took like a
good hour two hours of work is basically
taking all the data filtering it out
building everything dynamically so
coming from the data we filled this
things out where we populate it and
pretty much you come here filter all
your data by the city all right you
could come here filter it by the
apartment side condo single hall studio
multi hall or room you know you got the
bare rooms three bedroom plus two
bedrooms one bedroom there
you know what I mean
you got the price but like you know I
want this thing to be at minimum four
hundred thousand so automatically the
only one that's there is down one Lake
there's so much to this man you know
what I mean what else we got in here you
could come here say something like this
three thousand three thousand feet
nothing square feet there's so much to
it now the next thing that I'm doing
this week is gonna be to make this
clickable so creating this like that by
this type of you and they have another
view when you click it to make a imma
call it like the detail view and then
also putting things highest price lowest
price putting things by you know a to Z
or Z to a you know it's a lot of work
man and I don't know I think you guys a
man you guys are good I'm being honest
man you guys are really good who I was
taking this right now I got a lot of
people who are signed up to it so this
course alone let me see and will tell
you right now report let's say I'm gonna
check the report I wanna see how many
people are actually pay students for
this course so this course alone got two
hundred and thirty seven people right so
237 people are actually gonna take this
course a lot of people just started this
thing average completion rate only one
person has completed everything so far
and it's not really like completing
everything but it's just up to date like
soon as I upload something he basically
goes in and does the the work too so
that's pretty cool and that's like one
of the things now I want it like when it
came to to YouTube
which I felt I wasn't getting here on
YouTube like when I came here I put up a
video I don't even know who did it who
who actually finished the how long did
it take them like now now I got that
information and that's what I wanted you
know like you know I'll be honest this
$100 a month I'm paying for a teachable
calm but it's worth it man because it's
giving me all the information that I
need man definitely and like guys
whenever you have an issue you know just
go and leave a comment I answer it you
know right away see your boy win here
man answering questions helping people
out you know we got a lot of people in
here man got your boy despot
he has funder I don't know what why his
he was saying that he was not having
some issues but I'm pretty sure it's
more about he needs to install gulps ass
globally and also to note sass he has to
install globally so let's see you know a
lot of people you know if they have
issues that leave a comment so we in
here man let me see what I what I
without without let me see who's in here
man any questions guys you know when I
do this live videos leave a question let
me know I'll answer it right away let me
see let me see hell yeah I want song
cabaret that to the extent that you put
off learning programming let me see what
else what are those headphones called I
don't even know this cell phones cheap
man the cell phones is like you go to
where they what's the name of that was a
Urban Outfitters you find this thing for
like 20 bucks man this thing's it's
cheap
they're not legit there's not gaming
headphones it's just the cheap all
right let me see logon John oh where you
just had a kid - y'all Congrats let me
know man he woke up abort abort
yeah man it's the baby right there
that's what people say people say that
the baby looks like me I don't know if
the baby looks like me cuz there's like
different situations like you see him
from a certain angle he looks at me it
then you see him for another angle he
looks like the mom so it's weird
yo what's what's the subject for today's
stream the subject for today's stream is
pretty much a mole person on a personal
side with the law of a developer right
so there's a personal side of the
developer and I was just like you know
in the beginning I just told you guys
that I created this new channel with the
family got eat them baby Ethan got wifey
Elvie basically we created this new
channel called family phase I want you
guys to go check it out go subscribe
show some love of course like this isn't
for everybody
right there's for the people that you
know care about Joan you know there's
people who come here strictly for code
and just come here for code right that's
fine but those people that care about
Joe that care about Joe what he does on
the side I care about Joe's family cares
about you know any opinions I might give
out or anything like that then check out
family face you know it's just more
videos are what the family explaining
things you know like we're gonna do
reviews on a certain certain items we're
gonna create a couple of things a couple
of projects together me and wifey so you
know we we out here man
we working we doing doing our thing this
is also a way to you know
get my wife it to be more more
comfortable with the camera and having
the baby in front of the camera I want
that I want the baby to grow up with the
sauce meaning like not to be a shy baby
not to be you know square like I don't
like that
I never liked shy people I never liked
the shy kids man those kids that you
talk to them because I you know how how
I was since like kindergarten I used to
be that kid that used to come in but I
go without what's good everybody how's
everybody doing yeah good you got your
nice and I got you son that's how it was
when I was a kindergarten right like
that should be like a whole scale of me
just coming into a kindergarten class
like yellow it up was good I'm in here
we live right that was me when I was a
little kid so I want my son to be like
that you know just be the funny kid be
comfortable with the camera I really
wanted to get into music I really want
him to get into coding I want her to be
comfortable in his own skin you know
what I mean like no matter what whatever
situation is in I don't want him to be
like nervous or anything I feel like
this is gonna help him out too you know
growing up in front of the camera and I
like constantly I'm not gonna invade his
whole privacy or like you wife isn't
everything it's just sharing right
moments right at the same time plus I
don't think this nobody else has done
this here on YouTube as far as like
developers you know sharing their their
personal side so that's what I want to
do you know I mean I'm all about being
original I'm all about creating a
different Lane I'm all about creating
something completely different and as
you can see a lot of people you know a
lot of people did
it's no secret they do take the sauce
right they do take the sauce from the
King and they do a lot of times it's
like I do something and down everybody
what's it doing I started doing five top
five videos of something now everybody
started doing it and then I stopped I
was like okay you guys could go ahead
it's like I gave you ideas go ahead
start building that right you know what
I mean so now I wouldn't be surprised
now people start coming
showing the family more cuz the boy did
it you know I was like soon as I'd do
something then I okay Joe did it nobody
freaked out
he didn't started losing subscribers
because of it okay
now they want to do it right and that's
just how it is man you know it's like I
wouldn't be surprised somebody else here
will try to do a teachable dawn comm
site because everything that I do I
swear to God if you guys don't notice it
listening watch my videos like my
beginning videos right watch part even
my beginning videos things that I do
people start doing now right so it's
like they start looking at what I did
that I okay cool he did it now say it's
safe to do it so let's start following
the trend right but it's fine now I just
realized I'm like man I'm just
influential you know what I mean like
it's like you boys out here sauce in it
you know what I mean it's not my fault
so if I'm sauce and the drip a little
drip might hate them off him like drip
you know they they catch a little drip
they you'll have you guys have you guys
seen on this show call was it the
strength the strangle string was it the
Strand let me see this so we're string
so it's just hilarious they have this
show that's just funny man
oh my god where is it
let's see let me look it up because I I
know the string the string that's what
it is there's a scene man this is the
scene that's just hilarious man you guys
seen that show man trust me man
it's freaking funny this guy is like yo
everybody just want to suck off his
finger and he got this long ass ring
yeah I don't know if I'm comfortable
with this this whole thing is like
because if you think about his super gay
this guy this old man wants to suck on
this guy's finger to get the string and
it's just hilarious man I'm like oh man
you know it's always something crazy man
but yeah let me see who else is in here
man any questions guys I'm here man I'm
here for like an hour we've been here
for wild like 15-20 minutes we bring in
half an hour guys take advantage your
boys here ask me any questions man you
know so we definitely hear any questions
you guys might have let me know let me
know yo just signed up for all your
access courses can't wait to start yeah
man I can't wait for you to start
because I love seeing people you know
finishing the courses you know I only
have one person that complained about
the course literally one person and I
think that's fine his his thing was that
the html/css course was that I should
have left comments for for him to be
able to understand like when does a Dave
start and when does a div and and
basically name the class is completely
different so he could find out you know
exactly where does it
they've start and that was pretty much
it but I'm like bro that's why you have
atom man
when you go to atom and you click on a
on a div it shows you where is the
ending tag that's it like you know what
I mean like sometimes you miss one thing
you miss one thing and there's somebody
hits you're like yo you forgot this bro
bro like I thought everybody knew this
but it's fun because not everybody knows
everything I'm missing the El general
says can we ask your wife about that
about what let me know what's the
question now aksar sure say Joshua says
hey John why are you going to what when
are you going to change that profile pic
to a Conan face logo that coding phase
logo is I see 100 rebrand yeah man now I
should change it right probably I don't
know maybe today I'll do it right after
the stream thank you for letting me know
I should change it
let me see what else what else what else
what else
let me see yo Joe what ap are you using
for this I'm not using no ap I'm not
connecting I was gonna connect it to the
Zillow API but it was limited so what I
did I say you know what
we're going to make this on this course
as if we're connecting to a back-end
server right but with dummy data right
data that we build in ourselves because
in reality I could have went in and
connected to the Zillow API but then
it's too much I don't want to overwhelm
you guys I want to focus just on one
thing which is building the course
so teaching you guys react and how
things work and at the same time you
guys get to learn more about HTML and
CSS at the same time and more JavaScript
in with es6 that's what I wanted to
focus I didn't want to come in and but I
get you guys over the head cuz that's
the thing sometimes you take of course
and you get hit over the head with so
much topics it's like working with api's
it's a course by itself you know it's
like if I come in and start giving you
guys 7 different topics in one course
you you're not gonna understand none of
them you're gonna be like okay there's
way too much there's too difficult I'm
leaving but if we come in and we take
your parts by part and be like yo this
is how you build it this is how you you
start a project that's how you finish it
and that's it if we come in and start
putting too much things to it then it's
like a lot of people is not gonna be
able to understand it how's that team
that you hired getting on with coding
face.com which team haven't hired
anybody yet I'm looking I'm looking to
to get somebody man I'm looking to get
somebody I just haven't had the time man
I haven't had the time you know it's
like I'm building the courses and you
know I'm just setting myself up to
basically do this full-time 100% of the
time you know 9:00 to 5:00 create videos
for you guys and like my plan somewhere
next year if we move back to Queens what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna rent out
office and what I'm gonna do everybody
who's in the East Coast all of my
subscribers at any time any any time
that you guys want you're gonna be able
to come to my office all you have to do
is like pretty much just let me know
ahead of time be like hey I'm passing by
maybe on Fridays we could have like you
know quick hackathons and into small
meetups they'll be hot you know so I'm
thinking about doing that like renting
my office space and just having
something nice let me see home off
I'm gonna see if I show you guys show
you guys what I have in mine let me see
so let me see I'll try to find it okay
hold on I just want to show you guys
what what I have in mine right now
okay Brooklyn but you met any questions
you guys let me know man any questions
guys let me know
I so let me show you guys right now haha
so let me see where is it all right so
let me share my screen okay so this is
one of the spots that I was thinking
about renting out so you know I could
have people come over I probably get one
of the big rooms where I will say you
know I will host events and at the same
time recall all my videos so having like
us a nice studio
like a good space cuz all I really need
is a pretty good space right so at the
same time it has a good good little low
entrance so when you come in you feel
like okay I'm in a spot you know what I
mean and it's cheap eight hundred bucks
it's not that much man everything is you
know we could had they say furniture or
funny unfurnished I mean I don't need
nobody putting anything in my my office
man all I need is just give me the space
I'm good for 800 bucks that's not bad
then you got this other one which is
like it's more it's like it's pretty
bare-bones
you basically do whatever you want with
it
so probably again like a little
something I don't know like a big space
that's not bad so they got was a 300 400
square feet I don't know that's a little
bit smaller this was not that bad
there's like an old building nice little
spot
you know I could do some damage in there
you know what I mean
have a nice studio have a nice couches
have to you know the brick walls make
make this legit you know what I
mean that's the idea behind it that's
what I'm trying to do in the next few
months you know cuz it's like even
wifeless enemies like yo you gotta get a
backdrop like I'm over here with the the
the ghetto the ghetto the ghetto shade
because this shade is from Asian shade
like this the Chinese version of a shade
like I don't even know why this thing is
here for because you could see the Sun
right through lish and then this is like
this hard do it man we keep it we keep
it get over here man
but that I down look look you got the
cheat sheet then you take this which is
this is actually occurring
you take the kareem right you come here
take the sheet cheat sheet take the
curtain put it over right you put it
over put it at the corner so now the
pressure holds it down you know what I
mean like you know what I mean like I
got you you know it's like we keepin
this so it's like we need a better
backdrop it's like I got the the gear I
got the camera I'm about to get the
lighting about to do the whole thing but
it's like how do I look like over here
in this small ass room like y'all like
this like my spare room you know what I
mean
this the spare room so how do I look
like creating real quality videos in
this small a space you know I mean so
now your boys about to take it to the
next level we bout to rent out a nice
spot you know have a nice studio
have nice microphones all over the place
I wanna have you guys you guys are close
to New York or live in New York I could
come down to my office come chill with
your boy you know of course I'm gonna
have to ratchet just in case one of
y'all try to you know try to try your
boy you know you gotta have the ratchet
you never know
somebody might come in about your home
your biggest fan son and then try to rob
me or some I come in with the
ratchet sign I keep a hook out here I
got a license you know what I mean
so watch you watch your back kid you try
to rob your boy yeah I mean didn't who
was it that got killed was it John

crazy dude who's like man you know with
a bullet coming out his mouth he's like

I definitely for everybody else in here

chopped cheese you know what I mean my
you know hook your boy hook your boy
over here with with a shorty from the
heights with a fatter it's a rat Matt

he comes back to England with a do-rag a
bandana to the side some shades
and some grills in his mouth is a rat
he's like ma ain't coming back to
England I'm out here what up
Harlem Matt call him Harlem Matt you dig
Oh God
well yeah man like I say any questions
guys let me know we in here let me see
says what's the most important thing to
create a wordpress thing find a good
WordPress theme to copy off that's
always good
that's the truth like you know even
though people are created like the best
themes they have it's called having a
child theme which pretty much is a copy
of another theme which already has order
of functionalities that you want so you
take that theme and then you just change
the styles on it and then you understand
how that person got to build their team
and you be like oh this how you do this
on the world present distance and that
it's just everybody does that guys okay
let me see do we have to use a demo or
can we use sublime it's Adam better Adam
is better now sublime is good because
sublime is like is built with I think
object objective-c so it's like pretty
much is like bare-bones
like straight straight software now Adam
and Visual Studio code are built on top
of electron which is JavaScript and then
from there is trans file will compile to
a code that max can use or or Windows
can use but it makes them a little bit
slower but now there's the big button
all right big button
okay yeah so there's the big butt all
right basically the packages that Adam
has Visual Studio doesn't have the
package is that Adam has sublime
definitely does not have so there's so
many things that makes Adam way better
because of the path
Changez it's easier to make a package
for Adam I'm actually in the moment
building a package for Adam for you guys
for everybody that wants to to have all
the styles that I have have everything
that I have
I'm building a package that's gonna
install a team all right so you can have
my team have the coding phase team so
it's so much easier I've done it with
Visual Studio code and I'm like wait
this is extremely difficult compared to
how you could do plugins and packages
for for Adam like it's no it's a big
difference man you can't even compare it
so for developers look like now I just
keep doing packages for Adam so it's
like you're always gonna get packages or
Adam you know what I mean
so that's why I choose it Barbara is
like a RFP no sleep schedule
let me see is what a clock over there
muffled guys don't worry this video chat
is gonna be quick the live stream is
gonna be quick Matt you know I love you
come on let me see says I just wanna
well age just left to come he's just
like it's the first time that I see him
here his first comment is I just wanna
be sucessful
I wanna be I wanna be sucessful okay I
need to stop oh let me see what else
what else
yes the vampire one sorry guys I'm
behind on the comments I'm because I
like to read what everybody says okay
who is the developer that you are Meyer
and why okay there
who I admire oh you know I was like
Steve Jobs I mean he's the man no matter
what but you know let me see who else do
I admire admire like I would say the
creator of Ruby on Rails was a triple
each I go and Triple H cuz he's like
he's a developer he's like he got his
own company not only does he has his own
company everybody in his company not
only does he have his own company baby
yeah ehh you know basically he's like
legit like you know what I mean like
he's not a cornball he's not a square of
course you got Elon Elon Musk because
they're not squares you know what I mean
like these guys they're like yeah we you
know we'd be killing it we're smart but
at the same time you know it's like
we're not squares you know like that's
that's my problem with a lot of
developers is like if yours if you're
not a square they look at you funny you
know if like let me see like like this
guy then they look at you funny you know
what I mean like this guy you know you
know he got his thing going on he's like
hey I'm swaggin I'm a developer I'm good
but you know you come through and you
look like this guy you look weird
alright cuz everybody's expecting you to
look like this guy so oh definitely this
guy you know what I mean like and
there's nothing nothing wrong with them
but
that's why I look up to like I like Mark
Zuckerberg I like DHH I like Elon Musk
those are the people that I respect you
know they did things that are great they
build things from scratch they were
original they were you know maybe not
Mark Zuckerberg that much but DHH for
sure let me see who else that's really
that's about it let me see what else let
me see who was in here
he lied the developer without let me see
let me see let me see who was in here
I'm trying to read everybody's things
man
Khoda face barbicide coding face are you
gonna do office share I don't know I
might do it office share well I might
just get like like I said like you know
just a bare-bones loft you know just
nobody's in there just me myself and I
just there with them you know pump some
music make all my videos coach sharing
that I definitely don't want to do Co
sharing I don't know I don't want to
have like other people's on on there you
know man's like y'all day
word let me see
Adam run slow my HP core i3 that sucks
let me see what else what else what else
Scottie says how's being a senior
developer going it's fine
of course I find myself right now
currently because everybody else they
just started so I'm doing all the work
pretty much but it's not therefore
because you know I'm gonna do an
interview with them maybe somewhere this
week to introduce them to you guys
especially this kid Joe his name is Joe
so he's pretty cool he's smart he just
you know he just came straight out of
college he's never done web he's pretty
much learning the web with me at work
and I'm teaching him everything that I
can I got him on my website Conan face
comm so pretty much when he's done with
the website he's pretty much gonna know
everything and I could say hey that's a
success story from Cody face calm
because he's gotta know everything he's
gonna be able to build everything that I
tell him not to do because he's doing
the courses on my website
I gave him an account you know so he's
good so yeah man yeah I'm behind sorry
man behind I'm behind I'm reading
everybody's things I can't read
everything and still talk to them you
know hey Joe do you still have the
fought out a deal yes the fight out a
deal is up right now let me see I will
tell you right now I'm gonna post it up
on post post a link for you guys to do
it
hold on I think I'll be honest guys take
advantage right now
like I'm only doing this fight out a
deal this month to be honest with you
guys because I'm putting in a lot of
hours I'm doing a lot of stuff here so
you know I wouldn't be able to do this
forever I thought I was right but if you
sign up now your account is five dollars
forever period right so I will say guys
go there use that you know sign up now
for sure so you go at least half that
and be like okay I'm paying five dollars
while everybody else is paying ten
fifteen twenty dollars there's people
who are paying $20 on my website people
that found me from from Google people
that have gone through the website
directly and signed up and like they
don't mind paying to the whole twenty
dollars and to be honest with you are
those are the people that they giving me
like a profit you know but they know
what they're getting and I understand
people are not gonna be able to be
signed up forever even though the idea
is for people to be signed up forever
because I'm gonna be doing courses and
videos every day from now on so I don't
know so I die you know like that's the
idea like I'm never gonna stop learning
you know what I mean like yesterday I
spent the whole day I didn't make no
videos yesterday or Friday I spent the
whole two days learning this thing
called gold up right because I already
know what development right there's no
challenge there for me so what am i
doing I'm learning how to build all
video games I didn't like unity I didn't
like Unreal Engine but this gold dot
engine is pretty legit and pretty easy
to learn so I'm learning it and then
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna create
courses for you guys to start learning
how to build video games like for mobile
phones iPads and all that stuff and it's
pretty legit so even like let's say an
example even after I basically teach you
guys everything that's under the Sun
which I don't think is possible
to teach everything but if I was to come
in an example to teach everything from
the web everything that will get you a
job even after that I'm still doing
other stuff that people will find value
to stay signed up so if you signed up
from now for five dollars you're getting
a super deal because I'm still gonna do
you know design like a lot of you guys
might need that you know work with
Photoshop work with sketch how to
basically work with a After Effects do
all those things like I have a you know
my degree and basically like
communication design guys like I went to
college for this stuff like I've been
doing this for a while you know what I
mean so at the same time I'm gonna teach
that to you guys so it's like not only
are you getting a good deal for the web
but you're gonna get everything in there
that has to deal with coding and just
the tech industry and I'm always gonna
continue learning and always tell you
guys which are the best courses which
ones I like which ones I don't like and
then create my courses which are gonna
be in my own way breaking things down
cuz everybody has you know has their own
style but sometimes like you know what
you might go take let's say the court
was a cold steel's course right not
everything will get to you but then I
will come in and explain it to you in a
certain way that everything might just
click you know what I mean so I think I
found out is that price man you guys is
good leave a comment right there for you
guys let me put it here on the video for
everybody to see also guys like I said
those of you that I want to see I just
saved it right now guys so if you want
you can read if you want the code or you
wanna sign up for the website you can
refresh this video
or refresh the stream and you will see
the the code there on the description
but here man let me see what I was what
I was what I was kids let me close a
couple of windows I got too much stuff
on ok yeah man so let me see see what
else
the O Access Pass how long does that
last forever pretty much as long as you
you have you know the membership you're
gonna pretty much be able to to see it
you know see all the things that I put
up let me see what else what else was
good people leave a comment leave a
message yes I've been playing around
there's this program man let me see like
this is pretty cool I'm gonna show you
guys so I'm still learning I'll be
honest I'm still learning I'm gonna
share my screen but this is pretty easy
guys
like I'm not even lying to you guys like
this the first time that I felt like
hate learning how to build video games
is easy so let me share it let me share
my screen it's a pretty simple game you
know the good old classic flappy bird
you know what I mean so I'll just come
here eh eh eh eh you boy hey now this is
a very simple game but I'm learning
everything from it now the reason why
I'm amazed how simple it is to learn
this thing is because I've done this
flappy birds tutorial and unity I've
done it in Unreal Engine and both of
those engines it takes so much work to
just get one little thing done this is
super
simple guys you have one note you got
one sprite which is the little little
guy here right at the sprite matter of
fact that's the the background image the
bird is another sprite great and there
for me you have the camera now I'm going
to show you guys this how much code it
takes to build that that's it that's all
it took
if you guys wants to do this in unity
you guys don't understand how difficult
this is to build this so first of all
let me see how many lines of code 28
lines of code to move the little the
little bird right then you got about
whom see one two three four five six
seven seven lines of code to control the
camera guys look this up is coke gold
dot that's the name of the engine like
it's pretty legit man like now of course
the only bad part is is creating the
assets right creating your animations
creating your your sprites but it's fine
like you could buy online like for ten
dollars you can buy a bunch of sprites
or even you could go to let's say let me
see sprites Street Fighter that's a
straight five sprite string a fiver
so there's this website call
spiders
that's resources calm and pretty much
you could get any sprite out there so
let's say for example let's say Game Boy
Advance get the pokemon sprite okay let
me see
so a whole bunch of a different pokemons
like this legit guys like this legit
like you come in here take the sprites
you know build your own game or like you
could build this stuff on your own I
think I'm gonna show you this is like
pretty cool too there's this other
program called a sprite got the baby out
here so I'm making a a game about the
baby so you gonna come over here and
take like let's say in the image right
you can come here and pretty much make
the baby into a sprite well you could
just say hey I want to cream up my own
sprite let's say 100 right now it all
depends the quality that you want on it
I'm gonna build something super quick so
you guys can see the potential okay I'm
gonna do a little something I haven't
drawn in a while guys so don't kill me
but let's say an example wanted to do a
blue sky okay
now let's do that let me see they have
layers too so you can put a new layer
come here
create a guy real quick be like oops
create a guy let's see let's see if I
could do this real quick
let's see if I could do this super quick
kids yeah man so it's like there's so
many things man that to be honest with
you guys like I could definitely teach
you guys like there's like so much stuff
man and I that's my plan of what I'm
doing to Kona face calm you're not like
all right keep the super simple so rough
stage all right take this let's push on
what's coming here and put some extra
details to this okay
not so much all right let's see take
this put this at one pixel yeah yeah
like you know is definitely work but to
me it's worth it cuz it's like as you
start building your
your game right like now let's see put
some shadows to this okay come back to
this color put this a little bit let's
take this color from here I know you
guys probably man we didn't sign up for
this joke with we in sign up for you to
be playing playing around I just want to
show you guys how easy it is to just
come create your own look you know your
own little character super simple come
in let me see
I remember guys this is this is all like
there's just simple things guys oh you
got a little character here right yeah
take that
alright alright let's put it on see like
let me see like this is quick guys I'm
telling you guys man now we take this
start cleaning this up well let's say
that's making where should we're making
what a cape
now that's corny let's take the little
little purple as a coating phase on
there you go that's it and that's about
it guys like you come here you could
even copy this alright put on in putting
on your frame create your animations
like alright
see a little sat inside you know what I
mean and then you could do come here
take a little you know it's just simple
guys man but now I could take this
little character create a game around
him that's the coding fees guy you know
and we'd be good you know what I mean
like on you this is simply like it can
get very difficult and very complex if
you're doing a lot of animations but if
you're just picking like one little guy
who is just running just with the
ratchet you know come in it's not that
hard man you know do like a a platformer
you know kennis to do Thank You Man
thank you for the support are you
available for freelance work of course
I'm available for freelance man we
always hear man Missy

probably gonna start heading up guys if
you guys want to play some Paragon I'll
let you boy coding face my my account is
