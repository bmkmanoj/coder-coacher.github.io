again man coding face stop God
you dig being here man we chillin late
night I know I tell you guys I wasn't
gonna do another live video until maybe
Tuesday
 happens kids I just watch a video
from the real Casa Darrow and just
motivated the shadow me to just come
back in here and just like talk to you
guys you know like this rarely anybody
who gets me high but this kid he
gets me high man like I'm serious man
like the kid you guys should definitely
be out here like checking out his stuff
because he's just being honest just like
one thing that really you know hit the
spot was you know he was talking about
like how long it takes to to learn this
thing and like you know how some people
are lucky to just get in and be like oh
you know you smile at the right the
right person you gave somebody you know
that old joke from high school and
they're like they'd chuckled and oh I
like this guy and let me hire him right
so people's talking about that and I
think that's like so true man like you
know for you guys who think like oh man
I'm not gonna become a developer guys I
 did this shame I'm not like
 smart I'm just like some dude
who just I know how to play the game you
know what I mean like I know how to
finesse people like when it comes to
 interviews I'm like put him in
the pocket right it's just being
comfortable right so that's one thing
and then another thing that he was
talking about was about you know nested
functions right that's change cuz I had
the same issue he said it took him like
you know six months to really grasp the
idea of like having a bunch of you know
a bunch of four loops right and then you
have Nestor arrays right and
multi-dimensional array sorry for again
mixing up but that's hit home
because that should happen to me I
wasn't the same boat like there was
certain things like that it just took me
a while to learn but I didn't give up I
just kept going you know I'm like this
shit's gonna happen no matter what like
you know all these people have
done it so why can't I do it right
that's my my thought about it I'm like
y'all if this person did it I can do it
this is just about putting in the time
not giving up and then just like
searching for the right resource you
know sometimes we we keep
looking online and we look at the wrong
places or we're looking for the wrong
type of motivation sometimes you find
something that's right in front of you
and you missed it the whole time man you
know you might find a very good blog or
you might find a very good youtuber
sometimes you miss it you're like man
this is just another person who who's
gonna come in in if I can do the same
 but sometimes you find that gem you
know what I mean like that just helps
you and guides you through this whole
 you know that holds your hand it
helps you up and I don't know I was just
like you know thinking about that shame
listening to his video which I'm gonna
add right now to the chat for you guys
to go check it out it's called the real
Casa Darrow afk the witching hour
resumes job interviews part one right so
it's a really good really good video a
lot of people should be watching this
cuz it's just like he's giving his
opinion on it you know like certain
things and also sharing you know
that has happened to him and how he got
in the industry so the other people that
he worked with you know cuz it's like
sometimes you know you you work with
somebody right
like oh man I don't know what this guy
story he's super smart did he go to MIT
did he go to this and that and 98% of
time no it's just he was at the right
place right time and he didn't give up
right so that's why I'll tell you guys
just keep going go hard and just keep
 learning online man don't think
of like you know somebody's I don't want
to say it's day but somebody sent me an
email talking about like oh man I've
been doing cold steel's cords and I'm
about to finish and I started applying
to jobs and nobody's handing me back and
I'm like yeah he's like you know I feel
like you lied to me because you know I
said to do the co-ceo I'm like bro go
look up all my videos
I'm sorry acres I'm not mad at you it
but this hard so soon even my best
friends I'm like bro look at my
videos man like first thing that I tell
people is take the courses right the
course is only gonna teach you how to
 code right but at the same time
 is a job you got a goal there
with something on your hand you know I
mean like you can't just show up I had a
company be like hey take my word for it
I come call it no it doesn't work like
that you gotta have something there so
whatever he sends me his portfolio his
portfolio is full of like free cocaine's
algorithms I'm like bro like do you not
even listen to anything I told
you from the beginning like you got a do
websites real websites look around your
neighborhood find businesses that need a
website or create business you know
websites for businesses that are on your
neighbourhood just be like okay whatever
a general Seoul's Chinese restaurant
create a website for a Chinese
restaurant right and take their money
and create it in a better layout or
something right create real
website go ahead do that right there's a
recording studio around
that guy doesn't have a website reach
out to them be my hey can I build your
website it's gonna be free he's gonna be
oh yeah go ahead do it right you
thinking in your head I'm gonna work for
free for somebody the idea is not for
you to work for free forever
the idea is you need to have some type
of experience something that you gotta
talk to a recruiter or show to you know
a HR person I mean I hate I built this
this this and this this is my
resume like you know sometimes people
will oh I have this experience in my
career and I got I used to be your you
know in my time I used to be a you know
a manager McDonald's in and now
I'm a developer because I took a course
online nobody cares about that what they
care about is do you have websites that
you can show me if I ask you hey what
are the latest front-end frameworks
right now and you just freeze or you
just don't know what the hell's going on
with the community or you have no
opinions or you just like a dud
right if you're not gonna get hired
right like it doesn't matter like you
gotta have something you that late-night
 you gotta have either charisma you
gotta have the sauce right either the
sauce have a great portfolio the right
meaning have a bunch of websites are
legit good looking websites I'm not
talking about websites that look like
they were made in 1999 and
Angelfire or geo cities I'm talking
about real websites okay
sometimes people send me
websites that look like this like where
you guys are making portfolios that look
like this oh man
you think I'm gonna if I'm a person that
in a certain position you think I'm
gonna hire you with some like this
or like something like this no you need
real websites real I told you guys
check out yeah probably can't see right
now but let me show it to you like I've
seen people show up with portfolios that
they look exactly like this
like it was 1990 1992 or 99 like
you like you have four or five little
codes of a free coke amp no bro
like you gotta create real websites you
know the courses are only gonna teach
you how to code doesn't mean you're
gonna have this this thing where it's
like hey this person got a masters from
Harvard now you got a course you
did a course man you spend ten
dollars and you spend three months four
months whatever you did you know and you
know how to call it but why are you
gonna show up to a job or something like
this like like there's not even to
to be funny with like people show up
with with like that like is I hate
blue check on my portfolio and the first
thing you see some crazy like this
like the website doesn't even look like
a website from 2017 no I mean like
that's what I mean so you gotta trust
the process
man you gotta trust the process and
understand what's going on you know just
because you take of course doesn't
guarantee you a job what guarantees you
a job is the time that you put in and
the fact that you know your shame if
somebody comes in and but I hate do you
know any front-end frameworks and you'd
be like no I've been focusing on HTML
CSS they're gonna be like what so then
they're gonna be like oh do you know
jQuery no not really because I've been
kind of focusing on you know I'm trying
to master my CSS what and you think
you're gonna get hired yeah you could
get hired to a little job where
is like fourteen fifteen dollars and
somewhere because they desperate right
but if you want to get higher for real
as a developer even as a junior
developer lake
you never have something there
man something that people can look at
and be like yo we can trust this guy
that he's gonna come in do what we tell
him and not break the website
it's that simple you know so it was just
crazy so I was just looking at real casa
Darrell's video and also totally like he
was talking about you know he been gone
for a little bit you know he got a good
 with his family and people just you
know people that understand that
sometimes you just gotta take it for
what it is you know that's why me myself
I try to do as many videos as I can but
as you can see I haven't I've been doing
a lot of live videos but I haven't been
able to really record a video like a
long topic like how I used to be doing
it and then because I haven't had the
time you know it's like do I let the
people that have already signed up that
eight hundred something people are
signed up for my website do I let them
down and be like hey I spent $5 $10 on
your website and I'm not getting all the
courses that I want well I'm not getting
all the skills that I want so I say do I
let them down do I let my youtuber
YouTube subscribers now by not showing
my face on YouTube it's hard plus then
on top of that do I let my wife and my
son down you know it's hard is it's very
hard especially when you do like a
full-time job man I saw the government
this sounds are like I wanna cry
cuz I really want to do this shake so
bad man like I want to do this like
24/7 man like getting people to
call them people to be doing this
all the time
create really good quality videos for
for YouTube like that's what I really
wanna do man you know going to a 9 to 5
I'm like so past that
like I don't know if you I know this day
I'm like so pasty now I'm like so done
it's like I show up to work I do my job
but doesn't mean that when I leave from
there I'm happy no I am happy
about it because I'm like man there's so
much other cool in this world then
to just be working a lot spot but I
still do my job because I still got to
pay bills you know
now that's one thing that I do miss
about you know the freedom of like oh I
don't care about anything like you know
like I used to be like that where I just
I'll quit this job tomorrow like I used
to do like that hey I used to be
like I find a job next week but now I
can't do that because you know people
will look at me like I'm crazy I got a K
I got got a wife I got to care though I
can't just show up I'm gonna hey guys I
 quit you know with no backup
plan right that's the only thing that I
can say I missed that that freedom of
like hey I'm gonna just up but at
the same time you know she happens for a
reason man I feel like having my son has
motivate me so much so really go hard
because and really go hard for the
things that make me happy
Blaine what used to make me happy was
being able to be like to say oh I work
for this company oh I do this floor I've
achieved this I've done that now that
 doesn't make me happy
you know what I mean what makes me happy
is you know when I get an email from one
of you guys they're like oh man thank
you for you know for what you've been
doing all you know like look at my my
college boy my comments let me see
where's my keyboard in this
mouse I need a keyboard and a mouse like
it's I've been using this Windows
and that's because I lost the key before
this what I need to find it so I've been
using this piece of
 Windows Mac I need my my Mac
 well yes I'm looking at you know
my comments were like people
show love and I'm like where well that's
why I do this that's the things that
make me happy that's the things that I
wake up in the morning I'm like oh cool
man I'm okay my like today I woke up at
10 o'clock in the morning on a Saturday
my day off I code from 10:00 till like
3:00 something which you guys were were
seeing me live I finished the whole of a
game tutorial for this Pokemon game that
we're building right on the web which is
pretty cool did that hang down over with
wifey and then in between that while
we're watching TV I'm coding some other
 for this other tutorial that I have
for Larry about right now I'm doing a
lot of and people keep telling me
that
and I do feel like a little bit over
overwhelmed right because I am tired
you'd be surprised I am tired now I'm
starting to feel it now but it's the
fact that I know me busting my ass right
now number one is gonna help me get to
where I need to get to which is the goal
is to somewhere next year I could be
like okay now could just focus on
YouTube now I can focus on creating
courses now I can focus on go to
talks go to meetups now can focus on
that right and then then I could just
relax on the weekends weekends I've been
just relax chill but it's like right now
I gotta sacrifice it I know for this
next
it's gonna be hard cuz I gotta work
full-time come back here
don't videos for you to come back here
don't videos from my website but all of
that it's gonna be exactly how the same
 that happened to me in the
beginning what I was gonna become a
developer it's like I was either gonna
become a developer or go back to being
an IT right we might see you
know network administrator
connecting printers and so I was
gonna be that or become a
developer right so I say you know why
I'm gonna take this two three months I
 quit my job and from there I was
still living a little mom's I have no
responsibilities I didn't have a
car back there okay so I just said I had
no payments my payment was 100 $100 $60
for the Internet and $40 for MetroPCS
for that I had alright so that was my
responsibility
hundred dollars cool so I say it
this next to three months I'm gonna bust
my ass and I'm just gonna go hard work
hard until I learn all this and
then I'm gonna get a job right so this
I'm gonna sing a bulb right now I'm
gonna like you know against the wall
where I'm like do I continue being just
a developer and just nothing spent
another five ten years doing the same
 or take it to the next level and
become an instructor you know become
somebody that helps other people up guys
like dissing that in heels like to me
like my mom is a teacher my mom is a
teacher
my dad is a college professor my
grandfather is well was also a college
professor heat soy medicine he was a
doctor in Dominican Republic one of the
first doctors to have his all clinic
like his home like not talking about
some clinic
like oh you see some clinic in
the mall now he had like a
hospital like literally like he has some
 huge you know seven floors
 over 20 different doctors that
work under him like he he did it
up you know I mean so for me I'm like
I'm I have a lot of inside of me
where I'm like yo I gotta take it to the
next level I feel like every five six
years I reinvent myself right
I go from different stages I went from a
stage where I remember is my first stage
was I wanted to become an artist that's
one of our reason why I like Dragon Ball
Z because I wanted to draw anime like
that's one thing that people don't know
I know how to draw right so I want to
become a artisan go to Japan and
live the life whatever then from there I
started doing music I think music I was
semi I guess the semi successful but
then I got burnt out with the music
industry because people I
created beats there was this game that I
was I think it's called mb8 boulders and
like people stole my beats and
sold them to them and then they didn't
even give him credit so that's just
shutting me down I was like man I'm
never I don't want to make no
beats ever in my life cuz I got
burnt you know what I was def in there
took some time where I was like man I
was like lost after I was doing music I
did it for so long I like travel all
over the United States and I was like
man like how do you become a regular
person you know what I mean like I was
like no like like after high school I
was like smashing mad chicks like all
the dating like gone to studios
getting treated like it came I was
making beats meeting up with
different record labels
and I was like man that was all for
between 17 till 2021 and then I was like
man I got burnt out from the music
industry and say I'm not gonna with
it because everybody says snakes and you
can't trust nobody
so I left that alone I came back
and I said you know what I'm just gonna
go back into school do what I was doing
before and just be a regular person
right so I decided to become just a
regular person and I was like man this
 is hard it's hard being a regular
person especially when you is like you
 you drank off the the clear
water right from heaven and then now you
drinking that dirty water from the well
you know that dirty water from like a
regular life you know yeah I was like
man I hate this I graduated
from school became an IT
person and then I was like man this
 sucks
like I was just two years ago like going
on tour you know chillin in Arizona
chillin LA you know
going to cago Elena was like we
went all over man you know what with my
crew well that's why I still got the tax
wasting music you know it's always there
you know but definitely I came back
reinventing myself became a you
know an IT worker and just with
a shoe and tie all this was like I
reinvented myself right and then from
there I was like oh I hate this
 they reinvented myself and started
doing web development which I love
coding right but at the same time I
don't love working for anybody I'll be
honest I just don't because I don't work
like you arena like if somebody would
tell me hey Joe we want you to work on
our website do everything that we want
you to do but do it at your time like
they I have my time of one hour
work or something when I want our code
or something you know
so is that Grenada right now I'm act so
I'm ready to code anything you
throw me something I can build
it for you right but at nine o'clock in
the morning I don't have the energy for
that
this is boring you know what I mean
to me is like being in front of a desk
for eight hours but it's boring
for me now at this age thirty
I'm about to be 30 on december gonna be
30 so it's like now I'm like I want to
do something else where I have more
hands-on where I could say hey I'm gonna
create courses hey I'm gonna go to
meetups hey I'm gonna motivate people I
want to rent my own office I want to
have my own recording studio for film
you know you know like recording you
know that go a nice recording studio for
you guys and I don't care how much money
that shit's gonna cost matters if I can
spend the money on that but at the
same time I gotta figure out when is he
when do I make the exit Oh No so that's
where I'm at you know movie here I
haven't even checked the chatter oh yeah
probably like what is Joe gonna check
the chat room yeah I'm gonna check the
chat room but yeah man like that's where
I'm at right now nothing that don't love
coding I repeat I love coding
I guess I'm passing I'll pass you know
working for anybody cuz I don't need so
that's something that's where I feel
like yeah I don't need to work whatever
with anybody I don't work for anybody
not work with anybody work for anybody
cuz I know what I can do I know I have a
lot of ideas I'm not gonna make
happen
but yeah man so that's what we up to
Murray now man but yeah like like I was
saying the title of this this video is
fine motivation to become a developer
you know you have to check out
definitely check out the real cast
Darryl until this dude is legit man
because what makes him legit it's not
that his channel is gonna be about
tutorials that his channel is about a
whole bunch of but his channel is
about the core of what makes YouTube
YouTube right YouTube used to be a place
where people come in shared their share
the ideas share their point of views
hear what was happening to them and then
people could even come here and say hey
this is a response to this video like
that doesn't even exist no more right so
on his channel to me is like definitely
that's what I call a youtuber like he
does code but he's a youtuber at heart
because he he knows what the hell he's
doing
you know he gives you good advice he's
sharing pieces of his life you know and
at the same time you could relate to
it's the same sheis Christian that's why
I Christian on his channel
I didn't like Christian because he had
the best of toriel's or he had the best
 coding courses now that's not
what I was going for Christian when I
went and found Christian I was going
through some my sister had just
passed away and I was like you know what
I like this guy like his his vibe his
energy that he has you know it's just a
regular person like he doesn't try to be
something that he's not he's just a
really good that
found a way to become what developer and
somebody gave him the chance and you
know that's all he really needed because
now wherever he goes he's gonna you know
domani that he's getting paid right now
he's gonna double that wherever he goes
they're gonna come to him and be like
you're here because he has the skills he
learned a lot in that job that he's at
you know so that's just how it is and
then it's cool because you guys as
viewers can see the progress he's done
you know over the whole year seven
months you know from him recording in
his little camera on his camera fall so
probably Midori recording him for his on
how I became a developer in three months
like you know I mean like it shows the
growth so for me that's what I like I
see like the real cast Darryl I like his
channel because it just I've seen the
growth I'm seeing what I like what I'm
seeing right now you know there's like
people he was there are his comments
like Joey you gotta do a collaboration
with where your boy Joe went and Astro
man we got we got a link up man we
definitely got a link up we definitely
got a link up right now I'm looking at
the the chatroom
I'm reading what everybody's saying
what resources that I used some learn to
code and go hard listen if you ever take
anything from this channel its look at
the description look at the description
the description will tell you everything
it's gonna show you all the courses that
I took to become a developer right and
then you're gonna see also courses that
I'm teaching now if there's five years
that I have in the industry you're gonna
find that there it's right there right
below description right it's a little
thing that says more show more it's a
little button you click on that show
more and you will see it you know right
now it's a good percent off key so take
advantage somebody sent me a message
like oh man it's not far out it's no
more I was trying to come back in you
know by the end of the month homemade
bro you kind of missed out you know I
was like you can't it wasn't gonna be
photos forever you know the people that
signed up for $5 they did good because
for the rest of their life as long as
they are still members they got it for
$5 you know if they cancel it they
cancel it and then a year two years from
now they're like oh man I remember when
this used to be fatherless and as I
get man you cancel this that's on you
bro
there's no you know there's no
looking out yeah I was like that's my my
gift to all my subscribers is like y'all
hear it at five dollars
now I spit shine says you should have
follow your dreams coding isn't fun as
drawing or music I love coding
I'm not coding a super fun to me is like
one of the best things that that I can
do in because you're also creative and
also using pieces of your brain that you
don't use in the regular life type
you know what I really people don't
think about this they don't think in the
hair how to do a loop you know we use
parts of our brain that other people
don't use you know like gray now we look
at something right we could look at a
stop sign
now stops are you like uh the
light post at the corner and we could
see like oh how does that work how does
the light goes from red yellow and green
and then you could think in your head
how will you program it all right and
you've got always said timeout you know
for two seconds for the yellow and I
would say timeout for you know two
minutes on red and then be with three
minutes long on green like you started
thinking I should like that right that's
it is fun what's not fun is dealing with
other people's problems you know what I
mean like for me it's just like I don't
know I feel like in my head I don't
think I get paid enough in this world to
deal with other people's problems you
know what I mean like when I make a
mistake I'm fine with it but what other
people make a mistake and I have to deal
with it do you deal or solve their
problems or because they make mistakes I
don't like that because I don't do
anything unless I'm sure about it I
don't want to tell us I know I'm doing
it right so somebody goes and makes a
mistake then now I gotta go to fix a or
change it and it's like it brings a
certain type of stress that's one too it
gets you agitated and three is like
I feel like am I being paid you know
what I mean like in my head I'm like I
don't get paid enough to be dinner with
other people's shame you know what I
mean and that's just how I feel in
nothing that I don't get paid well I get
paid very well but in my head I'm like
even at that it's not worth it you know
for all the work that I do in order
that that I gotta be dealing with I feel
like I should beginning pay at least
half a million dollars a year that's how
for you now is a realistic law because
you know especially Hindu united states
they don't they don't give you like
let's say the time that you put into a
job or any job or any company you don't
get paid back what what that time is
it's really value that right like
there's people who bust their ass and
carry boxes around for FedEx and
doing a whole bunch of work
with snow work with rain work with 102
degrees weather like they go and still
bust their ass every day Under
the Sun under the moon under
whatever right and it's still gonna get
paid $12 an hour is it fair no it's not
fair you know I mean so is the same
for me I'm like yo I still have to is in
front of our computer that's one thing
that gets me pissed off because I feel
like a lot of people don't think about
about this they don't think that what
the type of work that we do is worth
that much because they think oh these
people they're right in front of a
computer they're not doing anything but
they don't take into consideration
number one distress number two this is
like literally like lifting weights with
your brain I'm not talking about and you
know html/css like how a lot of times
like people really think that this is
how it is when you get to a certain
level as a developer and you work at a
company you pretty much lifting
weights with your brain on how to solve
there's never a good day you know
there's never like a good day where
we're at
oh cool everybody gets to chill today
there's never a good day like you know
what I mean it's always like oh we gotta
solve this problem you gotta solve that
problem so at the end of the day for me
that is getting boring I'm like oh
is it every day I gotta solve a
problem I don't want you know what I
mean like I'd rather be doing other cool
 that's why my goal is to downsize
everything I'm downsizing everything you
know like the last bill that I'm gonna
have is gonna be like my car and nothing
in the car I'm thinking about paying it
off by the end of the year so I still
got to pay like I think it's like 38,000
and I'm gonna try to pay that about
the end of the year so I have no
payments or anything my bills
will be like less than a thousand
dollars and then I'll be good just
because I want to downsize like I want
to make my life simple where I could
work for two hours and make enough money
for the whole month that's my plan right
now how realistic is that less sink
let's find out how it goes I'll tell you
guys by the end of the year see how we
make it happen but you know that's why
I'm telling you I'm trying to leave New
York New York is super expensive it's
definitely super expensive yeah you come
here and you spend most of the money
that you you get to take half of
it on taxes because you paying taxes for
New York state taxes for a New
York City taxes for the federal tax so
you're losing so much you know so
reality you're making like half of what
you what your yearly income is and also
and then at the same time is just about
making your life simpler man it's like
that guy after his name mustache money
you know something like that
that guy used to be making 140 grand hey
met his wife every year and then he
worked for 10 years basically retired at
30 like I think I can make that
happen so like I'm not trying to be like
Oh super lazy that oh this guy just
doesn't want to work it's not that it's
just this a lot of cool to do in
this world you know then to just work
for somebody else now do I tell you guys
hey don't work for nobody no you
have to put in the work I mean like I
don't put in I already put in my work
and I'm putting in the work right now
this next six months are like super
crunch start like you're gonna see me
with the same shirts same
 hat I'm not spending a dime I'm
not spending
naca nothing only thing I'm spending on
is not advertising like and that's on a
sacrifice right working
full-time coming home doing videos and
doing for like another four or five
hours hanging out with my wifey for like
I don't know from 10 o'clock to 12
o'clock two hours that I get to give
them and then on the weekend I'm doing
the same work a full time but at
home and try to knock out a lot of
so for the next six months
that's what how it's gonna be okay
another because by next year I'm doing
something radical you know what
I mean like I'm leaving
everything behind moving to another
state are we we gotta make this
 happen man you know like every time
I put my mind to something I get it done
you know especially when I I know she's
gonna pay off right now like you know
like my website is doing good I was
definitely doing good I haven't even put
it on you to me yet so when I
put on any of the
choices on udemy is a wrap you know it's
like someone's gonna be like this piece
so so a lot of out here right but
just on the website alone we're doing
god people are enjoying it but once we
touched down on that you to me it's a
rap man cold steel's made you
know how much funny coast is making out
man
making like 2 million dollars a year and
they're like he's chilling you know what
I mean like Stephen Grodd is another one
making like a million dollars a year and
he got a lot of courses Cole still don't
have done many courses you just have
like three four courses and are like his
bread and butter right but that's the
plan the plan is I don't want to become
making a million dollars a year now I
want to make the same alarm that I'm
making right now but being able to
create content 24/7 that's the idea
behind it I'm not looking to become a
millionaire just enough of you know the
same amount that I'm making right now
work a full-time but doing it for myself
you know everybody gotta have a dream
man I'll tell you guys you've all got to
have a goal yeah yeah I gotta have
something that you you look out for you
know
yeah man let me see I'm reading reading
everybody's things I'm surprised you
know you guys are weird man
I'd do a chatroom at two o'clock in the
afternoon and there's like ten people
fitting people 20 people I'd do a chat
at on a set on a Saturday right
well Sunday now Sunday
so what o'clock in the morning 1 o'clock
in the morning and this is like 45
people are in here it says over
200 people have Kingman in and out of
the live feed so it's like it's crazy
you know what I mean like it's crazy you
guys are crazy
you guys y'all wanna show up Malik I'm a
fan named it's not at 9 a.m. 8 a.m. in
Germany where are you
11 p.m. on the west coast that's one
thing to like when you are developer
like you're nocturnal and you want to do
SH in the nighttime like like for me
it's like right now right now you give
me a task like hey don't code this for
me I'll go in a code it you know
from somebody pays me in the hey
man we wanna hire you at two
o'clock in the morning I'm not great
I'll do it
but that 9:00 a.m. I don't know what
that I'm not trying to be in the
place nine o'clock in the morning 2:07
Trinidad's
word so what's good anybody got any
questions man give me a topic anything
let me know
I wish and says I don't think even
senior developers I go go gay four
hundred thousand yeah you're right
they don't make four hundred thousand
but that's the thing that's where I feel
like we as human beings we don't get
paid what we're supposed to get paid for
our time you know what I mean like like
what's the price for you to be away from
your family what's the price away from
the things that you love to do like how
much is that worth right because
time flies by next thing you know you're
 40 something next thing you know
you're blinking and now you're 50
something you trip down the flue
and now you're 60 something all right
are you taking a shower you close your
eyes you're 70 something right next
thing you know you check
something's wet you pissed
yourself you eighty something right and
then you next thing you know you close
your eyes and you don't open it up again
because you're already too old
and you die right
so what's the price for your time you
know what's the value of your time who's
going to pay for that
you know what everyone like back in the
days people will be under the tree and
under the tree or doing something else I
don't know like it wasn't the
Flintstones insane hitting rocks and
people were happy and just doing
 all you need was just food to eat
and that's it food and some shelter but
now we're so much like material
things we get stuck to this material
things and when we start
you know if I can buying shake getting
yourself in debt for other if I can
now you become a slave to all of this
material you know thank you
now you're just a slave for it and so
now you have to work in the system you
know now you have to go in it and it's
not about hey can you grow some food can
you you sustain yourself
no now it's can you somehow continue
working forever until you die because
this is how the system works and here in
the US it sucks even worse because here
let's say an example of you your dream
was to buy a house you you bust
your ass forever and like working since
you was a little kid you buy yourself a
house that cost eight hundred thousand
dollars right that house the house is
eight hundred thousand dollars right and
then you come in and you say you paid
off thirty years later now yours 50
something thirty you know 50 something
60 something years old and then you
basically gotta pay every year even
after you already paid off your whole
 house you still got to pay sixty
four thousand dollars in taxes right on
that house you know I mean like or some
people who might have a better deal
where they might come in and they come
in basically get it at 0.3% and also
let's see how much is that eight hundred
thousand times 0.03 twenty four thousand
dollars
you know you still gotta pay twenty four
thousand dollars every year for the rest
of your life even though after you paid
it even though after you own your own
we still got to continue working for the
system so that's where is like you know
you think about that and you're
like man what the I gotta find the
exit plan right and that's where I'm at
right now where I'm like I gotta set
myself up to - basically succeed and be
able to continue doing the things that I
want to do like right now I still want
to learn go I still want to learn Python
I don't know Python because I don't like
it I don't like certain things about it
but I still want to learn it if I had
the free time I will learn it right so
Gold Python what else there's another
one that I wanted something I wanted to
mess around more with typescript
cuz I like tight skirt maybe mess around
with flow mess around with the new react
fiber but where am I gonna have that
time you know I don't have the time no
more so that's what we at man that's
what I tell you guys you guys gotta find
a motivation for it for you guys you
gotta find something that's gonna
motivate you and continue learning to
code because even now like this isn't
the end
for you guys once you learn how to code
there's a whole world out there one
thing that you're gonna notice what I
was saying is that one thing that you
guys gotta know this question throw me
I'm reading somebody else's thing man
over here on the chat
if you were to go freelance do you need
to know the backend I will say yes
because if you're a freelancer it means
you gotta know anything that people
could throw at you because nobody's
gonna come in and be like hey we just
want you to do the front-end like it's
gonna be rare that you're gonna find
that what you're gonna find the most is
gonna be people like hey I want to
create a store about sneakers or they're
gonna come to you I'm gonna hey can you
make a website for my restaurant and I
want you to be able to make orders
online and then send it directly to my
phone like those are the type of
that you're gonna get as a freelancer
and you need to know the backend for
that Joe what do you know about learning
SEO web development nothing I don't know
nothing about this yeah now I know the
basics but I don't focus on SEO because
I feel like SEO is a waste of time
Google doesn't care about that no
more
Google's algorithm is all up it's
not like how it used to be like you
could buy doughnuts calm and your
website will show up as donors comments
the first thing that doesn't exist no
more right now it's about who pays who
goes in and pays the most money that's
what that means that's what Google
has done to the Internet
okay what is the minimum maximum salary
of a junior senior developer okay I will
say a minimum would be $35,000 which is
like a bare minimum right and the
maximum that I've seen is a hundred and
eighty thousand and that's for a gold
developer a senior developer who has
knowledge of gold gold laying those guys
that do golang they get paid a lot of
money and go it's not that easy guys so
you get paid
how difficult and how advanced the
languages so yeah yes basically objects
are hashes and that's another thing you
gotta pray that the house doesn't lose
the value to Missy I'm reading
everybody's comments over here
Oh Missy what advice will you give
yourself now as a senior develop that
you wish you know as a junior developer
the number one advice would be don't try
to learn everything at once
learn everything you know one thing at a
time
because when I started learning this I
try to learn HTML CSS and JavaScript at
the same time and there from there I was
messing around with WordPress cuz I was
seeing like a lot of people need a
wordpress developers but it's like how
can I learn WordPress when I didn't know
PHP and I didn't know my sequel so it's
like you know like sometimes as it Union
developer you try to do so much and
it's like you guys are not gonna get
everything you know what I'm a mate no
matter how much time you put in you're
not gonna get everything on the first
year it's gonna take time like
everything that I know now is because I
have five years in this chain the things
that I know in the first year were
nothing compared to what I know now and
then the second year is nothing that I
know now but it's a process you gotta
keep going one step at a time so that's
what I will tell myself I'll be like man
stop worrying about what's the latest
framework was the
the best thing out there now worry about
making websites start building websites
that's what I would tell myself you know
and not to be nervous on interviews
because I will be nervous like oh man
like you know there will be like
sometimes this even now like this topics
like I know it like I know it I know how
to code it I know how to build
whatever whatever you tell me I
can build it but there's certain topics
that are more complex that don't come
out of my mouth as fluid as it should be
so that's something that I have that I
know I have that where it's like it's
harder for me to explain things to other
people when it comes to more advanced
things right
so there will be like certain topics
where I will be nervous I'm like damn
man I don't know if I don't if I don't
know this day am I gonna get hired this
and that and then know that I know those
things that I can explain them like
nobody has asked me this
question you know like I spent so many
times there's a lot as so much hours on
trying to learn algorithms in in sorting
trees and all this and
nobody has axe I mean all the
jobs that I've gotten hired for nobody
has ever asked me about this nobody
has be like hey man can we can
we have a hackathon of who has
the best algorithm nobody nobody has
ever asked me some like that you
know what I mean like
so I spent so much hours and into it
that it was a waste of time
