how the other channel basically became
the other you know the other chat room
became like it just became broke it's
like people instead of talking to me and
saying hey man this is why I like about

a simple question where you might be
like hey man what should i do should I

backend you got PHP node to be crystal
Lang golang Python so any other language
that you guys might want to add let me
know man you know so just let me know

currently I mean I just put PHP node
rubee crystal and golang Python maybe
you know what I'd done next I know a lot
of lot of you guys like are usually
asking questions about net so let's say
dotnet okay and yeah that's about it man
you know what I mean so we're doing good
man we're doing good man I'm trying to
keep this positive I'm trying to keep
this you know just just good man good
good energy you know the zero negativity
you know we we dealt with it with other
youtubers we dealt with it
within ourselves people that we thought
we was family whatever you know there's
no family on it's the Internet man like
people flip up people switch up man you
know what I mean if they killed Jesus
you know what I mean Jesus don't fret
everybody Jesus went into the party and
was like yo man you guys want to drink
y'all want to eat here's wine and bread
man and he held everybody down you know
what I mean but at the end of the day
Jesus still got killed you know so if
that happened to Jesus you know signs
gonna happen to me at the end of the day
so that's just how it is man but yeah
man we here man we're just doing this
life
make sure you add yourself to the new
chatroom guys you know definitely go at
yourself and like like I said everybody
from you know whatever the drama from
last night forget about everything
you've been forgiving you know you know
like you get the the cross on you you
know you forgiving you you know we wash
our hands off you you know what I mean
like you do it to yourself
wash your hands you know what I mean so
everybody else that you know people that
defended me people that came in and show
love whatever yay
we here you know how am I feeling I'm
feeling good man I'm always good man my
problem is like like I said man my
problem is when people just talk behind
my back that always bothers me you know
what I mean so it's not a big deal you
know I'm not a it's not like I'm over
you crying oh my god it's like is
hurtful when you trust people when
you're like oh not this person not this
to three people
you'll be like okay you know special
after like a whole years like you you
would think people would know you and I
think most of the most of you guys
coming here ya know me man you know it's
like it's forgiving face today you know
what I mean I was like here you go
here's some water is the Holy Ghost in
the holy water for you you know what I
mean we out here man
but yeah bro like it's pretty legit man
we just gonna keep it coin we're gonna
keep it pretty pretty simple you know
this cord is straight on my phone on
getting all the notifications we're
getting all the cool stuff here and
direct any questions you guys might have
basically just add it so yeah man it's
Jesus face today you know what I mean we
out here you know it's like we through
the holy water at them you know it's
like hey man god bless you
you know go on your merry go and go
around way you know what I mean is like
we're now banning nobody we're not
talking back by nobody we we just leave
it at that
you know what I mean it's like it is
what it is god bless you man but yeah
man download it I would say download it
because since I'm going to be putting
the notifications through the air when I
won't gonna upload a video or I'm gonna
go live man I think it makes sense if
you really want to stay in touch with
the community it's the best place
because I'm gonna come in and say I'm at
everyone and then when I wanna upload a
video or something so like that you
don't miss it you know it's like a
direct line to you you know and you
could get the notification because you
know how you to be you to be acting
funny sometime like they'd be like hey
man we're not gonna give them the you
know they'll show it to let's say 200
people don't notification like if we're
going live or whatever but with this now
we have control of that but yeah man
word we need the halo effect means is
Jesus face tonight you know what I mean

freaking subscribe to my website if you
can if you can't that's fine don't
subscribe but at least go in the chat
room so you don't miss no other
notifications and and we could all talk
about coding which is why we here man
we're not here for drama we're not here
for orders bs man it's just I saw the
guys like this thing follows me man it's
like you know we when you're doing good
doesn't matter
people's gonna hate on you no matter
what you know what I mean so it's crazy
so that's how it is man but yeah man
it's 1:00 a.m. if we do Bill shook what
the hell is that were you wet there's
one a.m. over there what is the best
purchase I made under $100 I don't know
that's a good question I think the best
purchase that I did was buy a $25 USB
Wi-Fi thing for my PC computer so I
could have Wi-Fi on my Linux Ubuntu you
know what I mean
so that's what it is man what's up fan
sup what's up what's up Charles what up
listen man nonsense diamonds what up if
you're using a framework like react
front-end then what is a good backing
language then ninjas should have let me
see listen man the whole thing ninja
that's not my channel you know it's like
there's a whole different community in
there man so it's like I'm just letting
that community stay there that's like
that's the rogue one you know what I
mean that's that's rogue one over there
you know what I mean that's like coding
phase rogue one if there was like
legacies there would be like seasons of
this channel and this is the community
that's like you know that's a let's
start that's the the Star Wars rogue one
but that's like coding phase rogue one
over there so you know we definitely we
we just switching it up man I need to be
in control my own thing you know I
appreciate everything that Matt did the
whole year show love and and you know
support it
putting the links on all the times so
yeah I really appreciate that
at the same time you know too bad it
didn't get to go down so well at the end
but that's how it is man you know it's
like there's people out there that you
know you become partners with and you
have a business thank God it wasn't like
we have a freaking you know thank god is
it's not really like a a business
situation it's more like you know man
that's it so that's just how it is man
come to Boston my G yeah man we could
definitely link up man I'm trying to do

know there's no point of like holding
grudges no point of whatever you know
it's like people gonna do whatever they
want to do in this world you know even
after you come in and show love no
matter what so that's just how it is
I've seen worse situations man I've had
dudes that you know I've let sleep in my

that's just how it's always gonna be man
you know you gotta bump into the type of
people's in this world and that's just
how it is man yeah now trust me man I've
been through worse that's what it's like
sometimes it's like that's what I said
yesterday it's disappointing
disappointing I come kind of you know I
see that all the time it's like it's
disappointing you come in you show love
and then it's like the people that you
show the most love is the people that
flip on you you know like the people
that you barely hit hit up or you barely
show any love or answer to or anything
they're like you know what I mean
they're just like oh like they don't
don't even do anything for you but it's
the people that always you show love to
that always it happens haven't you ever
noticed that haven't you ever noticed
that like even like back in the days you
gonna tell me like at some point you had
to fight your best friend that happens
all the time you know that happens to
girls constantly but so guys at least
once or twice
you always had like I for a couple of my
best friends a couple of times you know
what I mean like it's just how it is
like straight fistfights and hair all of
that you know but that's just how it is
is like it always happens
yeah man but that's what we oughtta here
with this whole drama stuff man I don't
want this to be drama phase man I really
don't that's why I stopped mentioning
any youtubers I don't want to deal with
no youtubers the youtubers that hit me
up it's people that want to collaborate
with me right those are the people that
I mentioned I only come in and show show
love to people but I'm no longer coming
in and be like hey man reaching out to
youtubers I came in we should collab not
I don't do that at all you know and even
you know we're subscribers and stuff
after this it's just like I'll keep it
you know I love every single one of you
guys but at the same time it's not it's
not gonna be like like you know how I
keep everybody on a pedestal I can't I
can't do it because it's just like look
how things turn out you know what I mean
like you never knows like people are
gonna be cool right now we don't know
how people's gonna be by next year you
know what I mean like something might
burn them inside and be like damn Joe is
our hundred thousand subscribers Joe is
blowing up Joe is doing this and that
like that blood might be boiling you
know what I mean so we just gonna leave
it at that it's like I can't even you

change you word man for real for real
but guys go check it out man we got a
couple of people were already in there

I've been telling you guys for so long
it's like as people pull me into it you
know what I mean
people people pull me into it is just
like damn and I don't want to be dealing
with this stuff because I really get
affected by this you know what I mean
like I really get tight like I'm not one
of those people that I'm not fake man
that's the problem and like I can't be
fake you know I don't have that in my
nature I can't be like man I'm just I'm
gonna be a fake Buster out here you know
what I mean like nah man I'm out here
just like bro if you will be here if you
talk about me meet me you know what
I mean that's who I am I'm pretty sure a
lot of people's like that people think
it's like man just because you do
development you do code it's like you
should conduct yourself a little better
Joe
but that's listen man don't disrespect

love him and my respect to everybody but
whatever man let's talk about something

and also too if I come in and I critique
your portfolio you can resubmit it again
and send it to me

redo a video like that's it but yeah man
we ain't here man that's it guys guys I
don't want I don't want you guys you
know gang yourself into drama for me or
for anybody else just leave it alone
whatever is dead you know we got a new
chat room man there's no hitting hitting
accounts no hitting chat rooms no no
nothing it's like everything's in the
open man there's a suggestion box if you
guys feel a certain way about my channel
just put it there you know what I mean
like I'm gonna go in there I'm gonna
read it you guys know me I read
everybody's comments like unfortunately
I'm one of those people that I actually
care about my subscribers and I want to
listen to everybody so I wish I could be
like you know I wish I could be a John
Thomas man you know it's like that guy
you could tell he's cold like you could
you could say you could curse John
Simon's mom and John summers would be
like this bro I'm counting to the bank
you know what I mean like you'd be like
lining up hundreds on his heart doing
the doing the color black doing the
correct black but like a I'm not
hundreds and not even care about if
people talk about him but me
unfortunately I care to read everybody's
thing man so if you like my channel if
you don't like it and you feel like you
want something better any suggestions or
any topics and also - if you have any
ideas of cool topics that we could talk
about you know you any ideas that you
guys might have like hey Joe the
portfolios are great but
can you do this type of topic listen put
in the suggestion cuz my brain I can't
do everything you know what I mean like
I need you guys I actually need you guys
to come in and give me ideas you know I
also want to bring back a competition I
also want to say out here you know my
bad to camp
you know cam was not really part of none
of this drama stuff he got dragged in
but at the same time you know I don't
know why people would be upset but but
yeah man
shoutout to camp I'm trying to bring
back another competition but this
competition is gonna be a little bit
different this competition I'm about to
bring in bring out money because they I
don't know like doing stuff for free
it's like it's cool whatever but what if
we say hey man the grand prize is $500
you get what I'm saying like now people
would really want to be part of it you
know what I mean
so we're 500 bucks then people come in
and create something cool you know what
I mean so I don't know I'm still
thinking about the idea I was thinking
about doing something like build a full
full application from start to finish
meaning user authentication logging in
and everything and then at the end get
like a hundred I don't know getting like
five hundred a thousand dollars or
something for for the grant price you
know but yeah man
Eggar Martinez a yo crystal Lang word
man I've been trying to get into crystal
Lang with you guys man but like I told
you in the last video like 90% of the
people here nobody touches back in like
there's such a few amount of people that
actually go and try the backend courses
that to be honest it's just not worth it
not right now now to our elevate
everybody that's here and everybody
that's on the website that subscribe to
the website you know I mean five hundred
million five hundred is good man I mean
listen if somebody told me Joe hey build
a website for 500 and I was gonna build
that anyways for my portfolio hey that's
like a extra 500 in my pocket you know
especially like you know when you look
on Craigslist like this there's people
out here hiring people for developers to
be like hey build me a website for 500
bucks like you know 500 bucks is
actually legit man actually found it
might be a little bit too much I would
do it I think the first competition I
would do like a $500 prize you know just
to make sure that people come in and get
motivated and it won't be like for free
you know yo hey you know what's cool is
like nowadays you know people come in
and throw the hate throughout all of
this stuff throughout all this drama
you're my channels looking crazy right

Udacity is cool it's cool man

Barbara's gaming that might be like the
only person that was holding me down on
the Rogue rogue squad so it's like you
know just leave it alone
everybody is kumbaya man everybody's
come by yeah you know that's a what was
said was said it is what it is you know
unfortunately things have to you know
end up this way you know I mean so
that's just how it is but we good you
know it's kumbaya right now I'm out here
you know I'm out here like Jesus you
know putting I'm putting ears back on
you know to me I grab dues and put the
ear back on for them you know what I
mean
kumbaya man chit chit chit chit chit
true stories true story Jesus did that
word he Dame and I believe it I believe
it why the leader there no videos
because I'm doing a way better known
video and I'm gonna do it with cloud
nine because the problem is a lot of
people have issues when installing node
and installing doesn't that like I don't
have time to be debugging everybody's
computer because they use Windows right
most of the people use Windows so I
don't have time to be in there trying to
debug your computer so what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna teach you know GS with
cloud nine and they're from there
basically it's on you you know
make money from YouTube for the X videos
channel word man yeah windows this crazy
man if you if you can guys install
Ubuntu man definitely an install boom
tool man and get yourself a USB go on
Amazon and search a USB Wi-Fi because
most of the Wi-Fi cards that come with
computers Linux cannot read those so you
have to use the special one so that's
what happened to me I mean if you have
your your Wi-Fi card and it works on
Linux then you're lucky for me I had to
pretty much buy a separate little USB
thumb drive that has Wi-Fi on it chit
chat chit chit yeah man we are in here
that's it man stop with the the snake
stuff man we it's kumbaya man it's come
by accident you know what I mean no
Wi-Fi that's crazy yeah that's how it is
the graphic caught it on a graphic card
the Wi-Fi card is not gonna work most
computers so like let's say you have a
Lenovo you have a adel whatever you have
most of the time that Wi-Fi is not gonna
work so you're gonna have to use a
separate USB to get Wi-Fi on your
computer but that's just how it is man
do I
have a favorite Linux channel no I don't
actually I was trying to find one but
most of the Linux channels they all they
do is just reviews of the Linux stitch
on Linux distros and a lot of those
distros don't even work like they work
for a day but they're not like reliable
like they look nice but it doesn't work
that's why you stick to the basics I
said - boom - or was a Linux Mint I say
stick to the basics man John G Fisher
what up man go check out your boy John G
Fisher man
yo John G you should be doing like
everyday you should do videos man like
what did you learn that day so John G
right now is in deaf Mountain he went to
the boot camp he got the opportunity
somebody was gonna hold him down and and
basically pay for him to go to school
and that's great man if you have the
opportunity go to deaf Mountain and
somebody's gonna hold you down and you
know personally I wouldn't advise it to
somebody who already has like a whole
bunch of like loans and a whole bunch of
things but if you're young and like
let's say you got your mom or you got
like a grandpa or somebody holding you
down it's like hey kid instead of me
wasting money and giving you a brand-new
car how about you go in and learn some
something useful in your life and they
want to pay for your school listen take
advantage and go for it you know I mean
so John G he got the opportunity so now
he just started I believe yesterday as
developer at deaf Mountain and I think
it'll be cool for him to actually come
in and just share that share that
experience I mean you guys could check
out his channel I did a live video with
him yesterday you know it came out
pretty legit we have fun you know we
freakin we talked about a whole bunch of
topics at the end of the day somehow you
know somebody disconnected the Wi-Fi you
know how it is you know when things is
good people
that down the highway hold on he's on
coding face shut it down
John Jesus demand man he's from
Connecticut so when he gets back I'm a
link-up with him man you already know we
got the CT squatting here man
CT you know it's all blew up in here you
know what I mean like word man who are
some of your role models down now
developer technology guys I don't know
man
role models I don't know it's crazy to
me man I don't even know like to me I
listen to a lot of hip-hop you know that
motivates me you know I mean like I know
a lot of the rappers don't have that
money I know a lot of rappers don't live
that life but I definitely gravitate
more to like hip-hop like you know
motivation you know whenever I feel like
oh man I got a lot of bills I got a lot
of stuff going on I listen to a song
that just makes me want to turn up like
bro like bro like you you freaking you
joke bro like step your game up go
outside get that money you know what I
mean like flip that you know so that's
how it is man so that's my motivation I
listen to a lot of hip-hop you know
those are the guys that motivate me
outside of yeah Hustler's ambition and
stuff like that you know I have an
opportunity to learn react with a friend
should I still be strong in JavaScript
before I get all excited learning
something like react I mean all you need
to know is the basics of JavaScript and
this thing how things work then you can
learn the framework
