it boys jump back out of the game man
your boy is back yeah
all right listen guys man I was just
gonna talk to you guys about this shit
is crazy alright so this is what
happened you remember the day before
yesterday I want to go by this new back
book right this MacBook Pro and then I
bought it so me being fucking cheap as
hell
I bought the cheapest one and then when
I have it here in my house then
everything works fine like that's what
was crazy like even the base model is
super powerful but then I'm there man
and I'm thinking about him like yo why
the hell if I have the money for it why
am I getting the cheapest one and then I
started thinking about him like wait you
know why is because fucking being poor
sucks it's that simple
like being poor fucking sucks and it
kind of stays with you
you know like that shit stays with you
for a long time you know like it was a
point where I didn't have no money at
all and I'll be like yo I will fucking
axe my mom for some money I'm gonna come
out let me hold twenty dollars go get a
haircut real quick cuz I didn't have
money and I was like already like what
like 20 21 at that point I didn't have
money I was like yo and all of my life
I've always been knowing like oh man I
know I can't afford that
I want that bar can't afford it
and then now you know I'm about 29 years
old I'm a 29 year old man and I'm still
have that mentality of like man I don't
know if I can afford this even though I
know I can afford it but in the back of
my mind it's like this ain't got a
fucking little voice just telling you
like I don't know man I don't know if
you go 40 you know what I really like
and it kind of sucks cuz I know it's
from becoming from nothing you know what
I mean like that shit I hope that shit
doesn't stay with me forever man because
that shit is really annoying that this
times I I want to buy a lot of shit for
myself well I want to get give myself
something and I don't get it because I
think about that didn't have that type
of money and I'll be like man I'm not
gonna buy this because when I used to
earn you know $9 an hour used to take me
three to four months to get this type of
money together so now when I think about
my pain you know like yesterday I just
went out I said you know what fuck this
shit man why am I getting the cheapest
one so then I just want I got the most
expensive one because I was like you
know what if I'm gonna buy this MacBook
I might as well get a really really good
one that's gonna last me five years like
my other laptop my other laptop lasted
me from 2013 till now so that's like
wallet for years and I bought that shit
used even though I had the money to buy
a brand new that year but I never buy a
brand new I always bought say of like
Craigslist or Ebay just to save her a
little money
which is stupid it also is like coming
from a poor background
I can't even say I was like super poor
you know growing up but I knew that I
couldn't afford a lot of shit you know
thank God like you know my mom she
always was like a hard worker and they
always had us in good areas but we was
always like the poorest people within
that area you know
we never want to know no projects we
never lived in in public house and never
lived with sectioning you know so it's
kind of crazy thinking back at it now
and I'm like because of all the
situations that I've been through in my
life even now I fucking almost 30 years
old I'm still thinking about shit like
that and like I'm just being like cheap
not being cheap because I'm making
something
forget that you know like I - so just
buy it and you know be good yeah I might
be in a situation right now is messed up
and you're like man I can't we'll talk
it out of this but it's kind of crazy
those things are still gonna be in the
back of your mind like should I buy that
$50 and say you know $100 like the other
day I was in the fucking Pergamos store
and I'm like man I want to buy that help
man I really want to buy that belt and I
want to buy that fucking there was a
wallet
that they had and I'm like man I fucking
love the way that water feels the
leather everything and I'm thinking
about it like man but in fact parties
this thing is $350 so I'm thinking in my
head I'm like yo this thing is how much
I used to earn back in the days a week a
whole full week forty hours a week for
to get come home for $350 you know what
I mean and enter the wallet is like I
think it was like 400 something and I'm
thinking I'm like a fucking wallet $400
I can't afford this shit you know I mean
even though I can but I'm thinking in my
head I'm still thinking as if I can't
afford it you know in some ways is good
because you get to save a lot of money
in this stuff but at the same time man
it's kind of like a fucking
some shit that you always gonna have
with you like you know that's why you
know for my kid I'm a given everything
that he needs and not everything that he
wants just because it's like you can't
give somebody everything they want but
everything that they need I'm gonna
definitely give them and then you know
should give a good life you know just so
you don't have to live with this type of
fucking baggage of like oh man I
remember when Paula Cole for was $5.00
you know if I die Chinese food from the
Chinese spot make I don't want my kid
walking around with that shit
and just fucking sucks it kind of sucks
you know
when you think about it these fucking
people who have everything they have and
they live their lives in shit and then
there's people out here who just don't
live that type of lifestyle they live in
in in a lifestyle where they live
paycheck to paycheck or fucking dealing
with how you call is like dealing with
hunger and there's people who are even
here in the United States who wake up
hungry you know what I mean like because
they don't have money to just go out to
buy themselves a meal or buy themselves
something yeah man so it's like that's
why I wanted to make this video about
before I go to work as I Drive to work
oh that's how how crazy it is you gotta
see how long it takes me to get to work
it's literally like eight ten minutes so
yeah man like it's freaking crazy
walking around was like you walking
around with a fucking chip in your
shoulder like oh yeah I was I didn't I
was fucking poor I couldn't afford this
shit you know some people is good
because they're like they're gonna be
able to save money but man you're still
gonna be thinking about shit I'm like
you can't really enjoy life when you
have for extra baggage on top of you you
know there's people who are able to do
it but then there's people like me who
overthink things like I'm constantly
overthinking things I'm like oh man I
shouldn't do this because you know back
in the days I I couldn't afford to go
here or I shouldn't do this because you
know you never know when this money's
gonna run out you know like fuck that
shit man you only live once
look at my system and my sister didn't
bother nobody she was good and you know
she passed away out of nowhere you know
it's like she enjoyed her life you know
but what if right now I could be doing
so much other shit even right now I got
I love
what I'm doing at my job but I don't
love going into work there's a
difference I love doing what I'm doing
but I don't lie and you know I don't
love going into to work
I really don't and it doesn't matter how
much somebody pays me is because I have
a feeling there's better things in life
meaning this other shit that I want to
be doing like I would like to be
traveling right now going somewhere else
gold seats people had a cold go to you
know talks and conventions or shit like
that and you know cool shit or even have
my own company or something I don't know
but I still feel like
I'm always gonna be held back by the
fact that I come from the bottom so I'm
always gonna be thinking about that shit
I'm always gonna be thinking oh man
maybe I shouldn't do this because you
know I can't take this risk I have come
money now and a half a fucking you know
good benefits and it's like man those
fucking guys that get to live their
lives and and be good and be successful
like they're not worried about that shit
but most of those people they they don't
have the same background as me you know
they'll come from from the bottom those
people think they already they come from
a certain level but they don't come from
the bottom bottom like like me you know
what I mean so it's like I don't know
that's why I'm wanting to make this
video about real quick and let me see

cheap computers is is better it's just
it's the thought of it you know what I
mean like you know you go for something
but because you come from nothing and
you think about all those moments where

holds you back

vacation and go somewhere but in my head
even though I have the money in a bank
I'm like man I'm gonna spend at least
two thousand three thousand dollars in a
fucking vacation so I'm like I don't go
