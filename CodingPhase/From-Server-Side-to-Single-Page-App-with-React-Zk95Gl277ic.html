gonna integrate react Jes to our
Adonis's application so we're not gonna
be using edge for certain parts of this
basically the application soon as you
log in is gonna be made with react now
the homepage is fine if we have a
server-side rendered and there's other
pages that we could have that we can say
hey man we actually want this for SEO
purposes and we want this to be crawled
so we could use server-side rendering on
that but for this part here this is more
like an application this is more
something that we want it to be dynamic
we want us to feel fluid we're you know
we get a notification up here and like
let's say we're sending a message to
somebody we want this to pop up
automatically using WebSocket it's like
you know we want this to look legit
alright so what we're going to do is
we're basically gonna start integrating
a react okay if we look in here into our
resources assets and then you go into
our JavaScript I already have to set up
for you okay remember although in the
beginning we were setting up the what
developer starter kit basically right
here this is a react component okay so
what we're going to do which is very
simple we're gonna come here and gonna
close this down a little bit we're going
to go to our app that edge okay and what
I'm going to do here is basically let me
find the beginning of this is the app
container okay here you go
all right so we got app container here
let me come in here and do a little
something like this we're gonna say div
ID app
close this down I mean we could actually
put it just in one line if you want to
now I remember we dropped the database
when we did a refresh so what we got to
do now we got a register again so make
sure you go to localhost 3000 slash
register then from there we're gonna say
Joe at gmail.com when I say car one two
three four
car one two three four we're gonna click
register all right and here we are okay
so this thing that is showing right here
is actually our react component okay but
not now
so when I come here and I register right
if I come to our first component I
change this and say changing this
component automatically is going to be
saved we refresh this so that's changing
this component okay
one thing that you got to notice is that
the reason why I took a little delay is
because now since we're using react
remember that our yarn run watch needs
to compile the react code so showing
this again I'm gonna say generous
component to save that remember this is
a so they'll change
you got a compile everything and then
once it's done it's complete all right
now I just notice a bug that is inside
of our gulp that file so basically the
reason why the web pack is running so
slowly and loads multiple times is
because of this plug-in called cons cell
so what we're going to do is we're gonna
come here we're gonna change this up
we're gonna come to where it says web
pack at the bottom of our gulp that file
we'll go filed ijs sorry okay and what
we're gonna do is we're gonna take
everything from here from this
function and we're gonna override it
with this okay you're gonna save that so
what that's going to do is is basically
just run web pack as if we just we came
in and we say what pack right and look
how quick it loads okay it's pretty fast
all right so that's what's gonna do when
we run web pack now the next thing that
I want to do is I want you guys to copy
this from here where is it so it's not
this one
it's Gope exact okay so this is where I
got this from this is like a fix to it
all we have to do is copy this and come
here to the top and override this show
because we're no longer gonna need it
now if you're watching this in the
future I'm most likely going to be
fixing this in the web what developer
starter kit so in reality you might not
even see this mistake that was there but
if you do you know how to fix it okay so
it's really not in my hands it was
really more of like the creator of the
shell plugin for gulp so this is
actually a better way to doing it so
yeah alright and it's cool because we
don't have to use no plugins alright so
now to make sure this is running
perfectly what we're gonna do is when I
run again yarn run watch okay and as you
can see it started what pakka finished
it and that's it before it was doing it
multiple times although I want to three
it was like a major bug alright so to be
honest I never really noticed it cuz my
computer is pretty fast but I know for
some people they'll be like man my
computer slow I'm on a Windows computer
why this webpack take so long so
basically that's why I find that a
little quick fix for you guys alright
guys so now let's go to our first
component I'm gonna change this too
testing okay save that come over here
when I finish it should change okay yes
it does
there you go so as soon as they're
finished compiling then it basically
jumps all right so see there you go says
finish we're back after four seconds and
we try to run this one more time Yaron
watch
you
okay so that's fine go one more time
testing one two three save that we on
this page
and they now guys what I want you guys
to do is go on Google and search HTML to
JSX you will find this where it says
HTML CSS react yes react magic just
click there and what we're going to do
now is we're gonna go to the app dodge
okay Alon okay so I've that edge and
you're gonna copy everything that's here
from the app container and down
I can't copy everything until the last
day now here you're gonna come and
you're basically going to paste this in
okay so you're gonna paste that in and
then now what you're going to do is
you're gonna come here copy everything
that you see
on this side okay copy this and then
we're gonna go to our first component
Jes and we're going to copy it from
there to there and just paste it okay
now next thing that we want to do you
want to come here wherever we see at
section or like the @ symbol what we're
gonna do is we're gonna change it so
this section right here we're gonna put
in home page alright like that you put
this in a single line scroll down see
down here this content area what we're
going to do we're going to actually
basically copy what we had on our home
top edge we're gonna copy this okay and
we're gonna copy everything that's
inside of this okay all the way to the
bottom onto the end of the section now
I'm gonna copy this okay we're gonna go
to the C have the edge okay
we're going to go to the first component
now in this section with a section
constant area that's what we're gonna
paste in the new JSX that we just got
from the home that that edge so come
here select all
and we're gonna basically paste that in
okay now all we have to do we're gonna
copy everything that's here until the
section copy it and just paste it here
okay we're gonna go select all and we're
gonna right-click and then we're gonna
format with prettier okay
so what that's gonna do is gonna just
format our code in a more clean version
where we could see things more clearly
okay now let's go back to our Tokyo
social network and as you can see we
have basically the same layout into two
spots okay so now what we're going to do
is gonna come here we're gonna duplicate
this and we're gonna say app - and then
on this app - we're gonna say app - old
or you can put server all right now on
this one what we're gonna do we're gonna
right click it rename it to app that app
- let's see react okay so we're gonna
have two of them okay so I've - react
I've - server okay now on this I
app server app - server we're gonna
actually just delete this this ID app
that we have here and for this one where
it says the - react one what we're gonna
do is we're gonna delete all of the HTML
except the ID app that we have over here
okay tell me everything and now what I
want you guys to do is we're gonna say
pages slash react okay we're going to
create a new file we're gonna say or
even better we could just duplicate what
we have on the home that edge so come
here and say duplicate this okay and
here we're going to put in react the
edge alright now for this we're just
gonna copy this cut it out and go to
react that edge and
since area we just got to delete
everything here
okay paste that in and our app that's
react we're gonna come here we're going
to do some changes we're gonna say at
section and then pass an content area
okay go to the react that edge okay and
the layouts that we're gonna use we're
gonna say app - react okay now let me
come back here refresh this
seems pretty good let's check something
we got everything in here now you see we
got this
so I got the F ID / app
you have this container now we got to
figure out why isn't this going 1400
pixels
and it's probably because of this diff
so let me see what's going on okay let
may be seen the CSS
okay I'm put in with a hundred percent
you
okay so this is fine so we got away 400
percent max with zero
Auto
okay so that's what we got it though so
pretty much in our CSS we gotta say ID
app with 100% so let's go to our CSS we
gotta come here I'm going to say ID
well ID app with 100% save that okay so
that's fine
now for our app container
we just gotta say the wave a 1 2 percent
that's fine
we gotta say margin:0 so that container
margin:0 auto okay and there we go so we
have our application running with react
and this is like the the first part
we're gonna break down everything into
components okay so I'll see you guys in
the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
