into project number one project numero
uno alright so the idea behind us is to
get you practicing JavaScript doing
something that you're going to be doing
all the time which is you click on
element and that element has a function
that basically tells something else like
hey I just clicked this button or hey I
just saved this item to a list or hey
I'm posting this information to the
back-end server right so what we're
gonna do this basically is just
something simple we're going to click on
the album when we click on an album
basically what's gonna happen is that
album is going to receive a class that's
going to say selecting when I selected
is going to have that little background
right you could choose as many hours as
you want once you're ready you click on
save and when you click on save you
basically see a notification right
that's going to tell you how many hours
you download it so it'll say hey four
items saved right now this might be
super simple for some of you guys who
have experience but for the ones that
have now seen is done with JavaScript
this is a very good tutorial for you
guys to get started you probably think
we're in there like oh man do I have to
code all of this another page and do
this from scratch no because all you
have to do is come here you take this
URL you come to a new window right you
paste this URL in there and now you
pretty much got everything all you have
to do is say run in the next video what
I'm going to do is break down this
project into various steps so you guys
can actually know what to do how to
break down a problem and understanding
more so you can think like a programmer
alright I'll see you guys in there Wow
hey guys it's simple jump back at it
again guys this is video that you saw is
actually part of my course future proof
JavaScript listen guys you're gonna
learn JavaScript the right way the money
wait the easy way the way that you're
going to understand it I know you tried
some treehouse I know you try you to me
I know you try you to it's fine
but you guys know me yeah I know how to
basically nobody is going to explain
JavaScript the way that I do and I'm
making it easy for anybody who wants to
get better with JavaScript or people who
are just starting from scratch all right
so you have to cause here man check it
out man you will not only go from coding
phase calm but you will go directly from
the link that's on my description which
will give you a 50% off automatically
for the personal original price okay and
if you're really really smart with it
you will actually do but all-access pass
right for ten dollars right that's what
I would do me for ten dollars get access
to all the courses you can't go wrong
guys all right so I'll see you guys
around
