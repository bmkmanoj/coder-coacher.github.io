hey guys so now we're gonna talk about
the requirement and what do you need to
get started to set up alright so
basically one of the basic things that I
will say that you need to know is HTML
and CSS alright
even JavaScript you don't have to be an
expert to start working with jQuery
jQuery makes it life easier I've even
seen that people start learning jQuery
before they even learn JavaScript sounds
weird but it happens guys cuz it's that
easy it just makes it life easier
alright so what we want to do is first
of all we want to go to coding phase
calm apologize go to github.com / : face
calm all right and then when you come
here what you're gonna do is you're
gonna come to the starter kit you're
gonna click here to download all right
you're gonna download this alright
then from there once you download this
you're gonna have to start a kick master
you don't zip it right
remember the zip file your zip that file
there from there what you're gonna do is
you're basically going to move this into
a area where you have your projects
right for me is right here I have on my
projects inside the projects folder
alright makes sense right so we're gonna
name this to jQuery alright let me see
jQuery let's say inquiry tutorial I
don't know whatever you want to name I'm
gonna name it
jQuery - all right okay cool
once we're in here we're going to use
something called Adam if you don't have
Adam which is a text editor people -
Adam that I oh alright and you download
it it's for mac is for windows is for
Linux you download this you basically
have this
program here all right well we're gonna
do once you open it you're gonna go to
file open right find the project folder
where you put in your jQuery type folder
right so for me it's here click on open
automatically is going to open it in
that project you see here jQuery suck
all right if you don't have platform
you'll IDE you come here preference or
you go to I believe on Windows this medi
and then it should be somewhere around
here
accessible settings or preferences so
you come into the settings you come to
install and then from there you search
platform you and you will search for ID
terminal you install this it looks just
like - you click install and then now
you have a terminal here inside of atom
so you can see npm install all right
once you install this then from there
you're going to have everything that you
need to get started all right now this
is gonna take a little while while this
is basically downloading all the
packages and everything that we need to
get this this project starting I'm gonna
show you another way for those of you
guys who are gonna have issues I don't
know if they have issues with Windows or
they have issues with whatever system
you're on right if you have any issues
of doing it through here what you can do
is you can go to code panda I oh all
right
register for this website called panda
io go to create you click new pen name
it jquery suck all right and then what
you're going to do is you're gonna
search jquery CDN
you're gonna find folks in this one and
you're gonna find us here so what you're
gonna do is you're gonna come here and
choose jQuery man all right
you know copy this you're gonna come
here to jQuery tech all right and what
you're going to do is you're gonna come
to this thing here and you're going to
add the library so the add external
javascript library come here
alright and then save it and close so
now you have jQuery now let me see
I'm gonna write some regular jQuery to
test this out we're gonna say by CSS and
then they're going to say background all
right okay all right cool so do you see
jQuery is already working here all right
now everything that I'm going to be
teaching you that I'm going to do here
on Adam you can do it here so right and
you will get like live reloading and
everything so there's for the people
that are having issues with you know for
whatever reason they might have an issue
to installing the project right if you
have any issues of installing this
project and whatever reason you don't
have no J yes you don't have cope you
don't have none of these things or like
I said any reason that you have a
problem don't let us stop you you can
come here to basically to cope and IO do
what I told you come into the door screw
on JavaScript you put in your your CDN
from JavaScript right for the
hurry you put that in there you save and
close and now you have access to jQuery
here alright guys so I think this is
pretty much done
all right cool so this is done now going
back to this once this is is complete
all you have to do is say NPM run watch
ok so there you go
one thing to when you guys come and use
this this starter kit make sure you
click on the star
alright you click on the star you come
here you see that if it's not if it's
not clicked yet click on it give me a
star that's all I want okay alright so
alright cool so now that you're here
right what we're going to do is we're
going to come here and we're gonna set
this up for us to be able to use it
alright so what we're going to do is
we're going to come to public index dot
HTML all right we're going to need this
stuff from here well this one this right
here what we're gonna do is we're gonna
paste the CDN link that we have here
we're going to paste this here alright
ok cool now the next thing that we want
to do is we want to come to this gulp
file we're going to remove this thing
that says web pack because we don't eat
web pack with this project we're gonna
save that when I press ctrl C here and
then we're gonna run NPM run watch one
more time all right cool all right so
now you're gonna work here on our index
all right now to work for with our
JavaScript we're going to create a new
file a new file is going to be called
let's say app that GS and then here
we're going to come here and see J yes /
GS
app that GS this is where we're gonna
put in our code for the jQuery all our
JavaScript right so let me move this to
the side everything that I'm doing on
this you can do it on your cold pen it's
up to you you could use my starter kit
which is gonna be good because you're
gonna be able to do this locally and you
don't have to use the internet but if
you have any issues like I said you just
a cone pen and just write everything
here alright so we're gonna copy this
now we just did over there
we're gonna paste it here when I say
like that now let's go to local let's
see if this works okay close this I'm
peeing around watch start it okay so
everything is working now let me add
something here to this gulp file
alright let's say we want this to be
look sleepy yeah okay cool
so everything is working everything is
fine alright all you have to do is like
make sure you come here to stop it and
you go npm run watch and if you follow
all the steps that I just did you're
going to be fine and everything's gonna
be automatic reload and you're gonna be
good
alright so let's go back into just
explaining what's happening right so you
have your page write your HTML and then
we have this library called jQuery so
we're importing jQuery to our browser
right and we have an access we're gonna
get access from jQuery by doing this
alright so we have to imagine this is
the same thing as if we had this locally
right we can also come to this page here
copy
we come here we paste it here on the
browser and as you can see we have all
of this JavaScript we can come here say
save page ass now we're gonna save that
file you go to projects jQuery tight we
can go to public you can go to J yes
save it in there so now we have access
to jQuery right but locally so right
here what's happening is like we're
importing it from another website to our
website right now if we want to have
this locally basically running jQuery
directly from our files and not having
to worry about hey am I connected to the
internet might gonna be able to get
access to this the best way will be to
just come here and say like this okay
yes app time Jes well sorry it's my
fault
jQuery you name exactly what this file
is so jQuery that man that JavaScript
now as you can see you see how we place
this on top of the app that is it has to
be before it because think about it like
this you can't use a library unless you
load it before the code that you're
writing so it goes in order so it goes
like this
it loads JavaScript and loads the
JavaScript from jQuery and then from
here now we have access to jQuery and
now we can use our own jQuery file right
along jQuery JavaScript and come in and
say hey body that CSS background blue
let's say in purple save that it goes
further but if we want to put this the
other way around our JavaScript will
load before the library runs so if we
come here go to inspect to check the
console lock is giving us a
uncaught reference data sign is not
defined that means that the dollar sign
whatever you use this which is the
dollar sign which means jQuery it means
that hey this doesn't exist this
variable hasn't been declared anywhere
so there's a library has to be loading
before we even use it okay all right
cool so I think we pretty much set up
right now nice we can definitely start
working on jQuery now guys all right
