it again man : face comm missing
employees back I didn't did it again
dick alright so let's get to it so today
we're going to talk about layouts and
why would you care about a layout and
views and content right what will you
care about well I'm going to show you
this an example on bootstrap beans right
so say in a head super simple
this way guys could get an idea let's
pick out this theme right live preview
let's get it all right now imagine this
when you create on a page you know
there's a header right and the header
usually is not going to change
throughout the the pages right so like
let's say when you go to the about page
technically the header is going to be
the same thing the sample pose is going
to be the same thing contact is going to
be the same thing the only thing that
changes is this section which is your
your content area right so what you have
like your CSS or your JavaScript usually
if it's just a simple page is going to
stay the same throughout every page
except the middle part right so that's
where may ups and contents come in all
right so we're going to go into this
we're going to go into the source folder
right click in there we're going to go
to route we're going to create a new
route we're going to say let's call this
get and then where the rel is going to
be layout test all right and then we're
going to do and then inside of it we're
going to put in surrender with it and
render source view news pages and then
we're going to say god
testing creates testing picks right
we're going to name it testing page that
ECR remember that okay then we're going
to put a comma we're going to say source
views slide layout slash testing layout
okay now cool people told me to actually
zoom it make the letters bigger so there
you go guys so Long's I can't see there
you go okay so we're going to create
this views now right we're going to
create one side the layouts which is
going to be just hosing ruining the
testing layout that ECR and then inside
of it we're going to do the full regular
HTML right so we're going to say make
this thing into our regular HTML okay so
now that we have basically the layout of
the page which is just regular you know
HTML the stuff that you write every
single time and you know that it won't
change throughout the page we basically
place you now inside of in the body
that's where the content goes so now
let's say we want to put in the contour
we're gonna say this content and it's
close I believe just like that I gotta
look at my own documentation you know
yeah exactly
cool so this content right in there from
there basically we're gonna create the
views so this the layout guys remember
this remember right what are you sold it
this whole page is full of HTML right
it's a whole HTML page now
the only thing that changes in while
every single page is the content area
which is this the Harris face the same
the meta tags stayed the same basically
all the information on the head usually
stays the same right so all the stuffs
here always takes the same most of the
time and set up the title which I'll
show you later on
right but usually the photo tool stays
the same right so let's go back into it
so imagine this there's a header and
then here folder is bigfooter all right
okay I hope you guys understand what I'm
doing here the reason why I lay upon for
it is to keep your cold dry not to
repeat yourself because let's say you
wanted to do a change you will have to
do a change of every single page and I'm
going to show you right now the easiest
way of of this right so we did a layup
right now we're going to create the page
so I forgot what we named it on the
routes we named the testing page is that
ECR right so we say okay testing page
the ECR right and here what we're going
to do we're going to put it in a dish
usually you know somebody might call it
content you could put in whatever you
want here I'm just naming it like that
just because I want to be fast what
enticed okay so cool now technically
once we run yard
drawn server
right it should be working okay cool so
let's go to localhost port 3000 host
port 3000 and this still has a layout
test oh there's an error what's the
error I'm supported template engine for
extension testing there once again the
same issue that I had before even now
make mistakes I forgot to put in the dot
ECR right so we got to put the extension
to it so let's say dot ECR all right now
we come back run server again well I did
that on purpose
by the way sure alright so you see now
dynamically basically the server put it
up altogether I'd say okay he is the
earth your header here's your collar
your footer he is a continent in between
few guys understand what's going look at
once again I'm repeating it again you're
gonna have four pages here right now if
you want to just do a change for
whatever reason on the menu or the
footer whatever it was you have to go
into every single page to do that change
now because you have dynamic views all
you have to do is do it on the layout
you don't do it on all the pages because
all the pages are being served
dynamically so you have one day up you
do your changes there and then now it
shows up on every other page you will
see a better example as we go in the
tutorials okay now let's say for example
you have a section on the page that's
inside the layout that needs to change
with every single page that the user
goes to for example like let's say we're
on the about page it's supposed to say
clear lot / about right and then we go
to the contact is supposed to say clean
block that's content how can we do this
chemically because remember we say okay
only the content area changes but what
if you wanted to just change you know
little sections inside the layout well
I'm a teaching right left remember that
the documentation was right there you go
let's go back to it and check it out I'm
going to put in the link below so you
guys take a look at it alright so here
okay so you have to calculate for and
yield conflict so what this is saying
we're going to have constant for tile
right so we're going to copy this right
we're going to say inside the view which
is this intestine page we're going to
say constant for title and si testing
page yes now we're going to put it in a
CSS style if we're going to say and this
thing is supposed to show up in the
header you could put this anywhere I'm
going to show you how ok style I'm going
to say background sorry body background
right right now for the footer we're
going to copy the same thing we're going
to say well we're going to change this
tool testing page footer all right and
then I think we're fine for that content
area for testing page now we've got to
copy this page and we're going to
duplicate it yes a
this is the contact page times I change
that you see our right now we're going
to say it's the contact page okay
testing for copy for contact page the
page site contact page header okay
that's very important we're going to
take this here and we're going to name
it accordingly we're going to put this
from the head and this in the footer so
we got a name a accordingly to how we
wanted to use you know show up all right
now we're going to do something called
yield content right which means hey show
this content here so we got a copy this
we're going to put it into the testing
layout and we're going to say okay
believe this we're going to paste that
there we are say okay right here the
yield content is going to show off for
the head right and here the yield
content is going to show up for the
footer so what this is saying is okay
when I get to this page come here
whatever it says on sorry this one so we
gotta change its head so when it gets
here it's going to say okay take this
content you're going to come here
get the little assess head and place it
with the year constant sense head right
now the same thing for the footer is
going to place it will sense you
contents and for now nothing is inside
of a council for then that means this is
content right so we could actually put
this anywhere like I don't know wherever
the hell you want you can think this
paste it here you can paste it at the
top you don't face it anywhere right so
I keep it like this organized so I know
that okay just ahead there's the content
in the middle and the footage below
right
which is almost the same thing at the
mayor you see so whatever it's inside of
this page that is not a side of a
console for it's considered content all
right so this is what it is guys all
right so let's go back in here make sure
everything's good everything's good here
okay cool
now let's run the server sure that if
you have this contact page delete it
guys just in case you have it to just
delete it for whatever reason okay so
we're going to make sure that the
testing page is blue and the contact
page is red also we got to make sure
that on the contact route we're going to
make sure that this has the contact page
okay so what we're going to do is run
the server address okay cool so contact
page is red and layout has to be blue
you see so technically is the same page
everything's it's same but the only
things that are changing are now the
head and the foot seek testing page and
also the content area cool now what this
does is just saves you the time of like
you know doing a whole bunch of changes
on every single page
imagine this let's think about Google
right so Google has like freaking I
don't know like 20 different services
already they have Gmail they have
YouTube they have a whole bunch of them
right but most of the time if you go to
Gmail most of the time they usually have
the same you know the same headers or
like let's say ign.com doesn't matter
what picture on it usually have a very
similar header
so what what do they do they actually
just use dynamic views and dynamic
layouts so that's why you know if they
want to change something on every single
page all they have to do is just do a
change on the layer now every individual
page now of course if they want to show
something completely different like this
area is different then you know in other
places like if you go to ps4 that's an
area that might be you see like this
area it's more different than the you
know there's a Nintendo Wii area or
whatever right so of course you're going
to see this more and more as we keep on
coding and you're going to understand
this more but least now you could play
around with it and you can play around
with the layout views and understand how
a framework works you know okay so let's
see what else can I teach you guys okay
we could do actually include so some
people might say hey we already have
everything here why would I want my use
encouraged why would I want to include
anything right so like let's say I have
Google Analytics right and I want to say
okay here's my new new page right so
let's put into the agents we say okay
here's the navigation right now I want
to include this on the layout but I want
to have this separate from the layout
page but I still wanted to be there I
want to include it wherever the hell I
want all right so what I want to do is
basically going to come here and you're
going to say render you're going to
render it right on the page and you're
going to come you're gonna say okay cool
let's go to the testing layout and we're
going to render the navigation here I'm
going to say okay cool source views
includes navigation die you CR so what
I'm going to do is going to include it
on the page and a lot of people's going
to be like why would you want to do this
well sometimes you might have multiple
different you know layouts like I say
you might have the regular layer which
is where people come in and then you're
going to have a layout where it shows
things when they're logged in or you're
going to have another layer for the
administrator right the person behind
the scenes controlling the posing you
know blocking people whatever right but
they all have to send money right so
what do you want to do do are you going
to go into every single layout that you
create it and start changing that no
what you're going to do is you're going
to split it up and you must okay cool
I'm gonna create a navigation include
right and then inside again I'm going to
put in the menu and now I could include
that menu anywhere on the page right so
here's intestine layup we render it
right here full and then now if we stop
the server run the server again let it
generate the pages dynamically now we
should see a navigation see navigation
right there of course it doesn't look
like a navigation but think of it as a
navigation all right now we go to
contact it should be there to see
navigation with that alright guys so you
got a little quick view of you know the
dynamic views you know part two and of
course you know make sure you subscribe
make sure you like this video um I try
to make this tutorials as simple as
possible dummy proof not calling you
guys that means but I just I like my
 easy you know what I mean so any
questions make sure you leave a comment
let me know what you think follow this
tutorial guys man and also we got to
another tutorial right after this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
