so now that is submitted there's a
process there's going to be me and
there's gonna be other moderators who
are going to look at what you added and
then accept it so because we can't have
any crazy in there right there
could be some crazy dude with a hey
let's create a porn channel there's not
gonna be no porn channel like it has to
be about technology or has to be about
coding in general right so let's say for
me I could come here but I hey alright I
put in my password cool so I'm in so me
because I'm an admin or moderator I have
access to this this background so I
could come here and say hey let's view

stay
basically dashboard and it's gonna be
completely different just custom to your
your liking Orion custom to whatever you

that now we got the channels which is
where most of the people are gonna be
able to post we're gonna have also the
register right so we have people were
able to get people to register there and
everything's good manda the database is
pretty much final of course as we see

so yeah let me see um yeah and also guys
I need you guys to send me an email
coding face at gmail.com whoever wants
to be part of the website and want to
become a moderator like anybody can

know is just if you're gonna take a
serious just send me a email I'll create
you an account make you an moderator and

little snip on him right now so let's
see how he comes back you know she's
scared
he she's petrified he's like what the
hell happened I lost my skin yeah baby
mom says she's gonna do a special video
for you guys yeah man so I just want you
guys to register let me know whoever
wants to become a moderator um it's fine
it just is not gonna be it's not like
you know Stack Overflow where you gotta
be just this moderator asshole who was
just like hey this what we let in this
what we don't let in
we're not gonna do that here we're gonna
basically just make sure that the links
work to the logos make sure that the the
titles are of the channel hasn't been
created already or the channel itself
hasn't been created so yeah pretty much
that's it we're not banning people we're
not doing no crazy like that this
is just like it's a loving community
right this is just for people who who
want to be in here and yeah and like
once I got so you got this version one
right so there's gotta be multiple
versions coming out in the next few days
you know stepping it up fixing little
things you know any bugs you guys might
find you guys let me know I'll fix it as
I can and also to there from there
you're gonna see you know don't get
annoyed when you start seeing
commercials on YouTube like hey I come
on a video like hey guys do you know me
Joe Santos aka coding face calm
da-da-da-da-dah
check out coding phase comp if you get a
commercial like that me being annoying
is a riot you could skip it all right
that's for the people who haven't seen
the channel who don't know about this
and you know it's like we're gonna
promote the out of this thing man I
want this thing to go as far as it can
I want this website to be successful arm
and I'm putting everything behind it
that's the future right there that's the
bread-and-butter arm and yeah it's just
it's gonna be good man we need another
community man because sometimes you know
you go to stack overflow those people
who are there who just you know they got
a freakin B in the high horse where
they're gonna be assholes to you or
whatever here you know is like everybody
that's here you know that they're brand
new developers right or people who are
trying to make it right it's not this
person whose are oh I'm a developer for
10 years and you know I'll answer to
whatever I like or oh you don't know
about HTML that's the easiest language
like you know how sometimes you go to
four rooms of our places you ask a
question and you don't even want to ask
it because you're gonna feel dumb
because
by commenting a leaf on crazy stupid-ass
common like oh my god have you you don't
know HTML like I hated that when I
was starting this thing when I started
to learn how to code I used to hate that
 because I'm like yo like that's why
the formula is there that's why the the
currents are there for people to ask
questions so why is you acting like is
wrong for me to ask a question like a
beginner question you know it's like yes
I'm a beginner who cares like I'm a noob
all right so yeah man so like I said
like I said many times guys it's like a
much a lot of stuff that's gonna get
it's gonna get fixed yes the responsive
is it's not gonna be like perfect the
whole website is not perfect was perfect
is the back the back end right so
everything we're backing is perfect so
that's where I focus on the front end
view I wasn't focused on that because I
could fix that any moment what's
important stuff the functionalities work
the databases is working basically I
added the most expensive the database
from Heroku the most expensive hosting
that they have so then from there
everything's gonna work flawlessly
doesn't matter how many people not again
how many people are on it it's always
gonna work so that's what's important
the view and everything else the front
end all those things that I'm gonna fix
it as we go and yeah that's what we are
right alright kids and yeah let me see
let me see who else any questions let me
see let me see
consuming models we can't attend okay
good oh thank you
I'll come back a hero to figure out to
be a tagine okay just seeing all men
ever enters it into me this is created
oh thank you yeah you know that's one of
the things man it's like people
constantly come in here I haven't been
able to record anything because it's not
the baby crying not letting me sleep
or you know it's my baby like what could
you pass me this could you give me that
can you help me up yeah man we're gonna
do a full video you guys gonna see it
man from the baby shower to all the way
to the kids birth I'm doing a pretty
nice video it's being recorded
Oh as we speak so yeah ran oh yeah man
let me see what skills does goes good
yeah bad no that's what I'm like you
know that's all we need a moderate is
because there's definitely there's gonna
be like you know how people come in this
trolls man like even though you try to
have a clean community there's gonna be
some guy who's gonna be named I don't
know a big dick Johnny or some
and it's like all he wants to post this
about you know poor hugs and so I
was like now we got a moderator because
he's a he's like a little kid he's like
a two-year-old who who has to be put in
porn videos online so he's like you know
so that's why we need moderators is not
to be some moderators assholes in
song but yeah man
they're forcing here
where's bad fat yeah man
we in here man your big coat thank you
