he got a design concept okay so he has
to this cold pan okay this is cool you
know so he does listen to what I tell
him
as far as create your websites from
durable designs cuz this looks nice
we got nothing like uh somebody was
gonna come in as a employer might look
at this and say oh cool so it looks nice
looks pretty good everything's working
pretty good only thing I wish that this
was interactive meaning like I co
actually dragged this a
actually search for a movie oh it
actually is nice so if I click here duh
okay nice but J all right cool s see you
okay nice
so it does work the search works don't
think that I don't know if this is
working is this part which is the IMDB
rating besides that everything seems to
be working it's pretty cool I like it
let me see what else he has Facebook
designed this is why we built on my
website you see this is legit because he
took a project that we built right and
then what he did was he actually went
the extra mile and created it so this is
nice I like it
alright the next thing that we have let
me see we got the rest of our website
let's see what he has here it is pretty
good man pretty nice see that's what I'm
talking about like going to extra mile
just it helps you guys like it just
makes you look like a more professional
developer like yes this is somebody
else's design but all the
functionalities and the fact that he
could build it through HTML CSS is
impressive for people because they were
ok so we could give from anything and
he'll be able to build it all right and
all of this is real fun since it's nice
man I like it I like what he did here
okay you got a digital agency damn I
think he he listened to almost
everything that I told him well
everything that I tell all of you guys
man
this is cool it's pretty nice I like it
let's see you got email template yes
this is very important guys wow you
might think like oh it's just an email
template i'ma tell you something later
on right I'll tell you something about
email templates in knowing how to create
HTML emails you might think that audio
is just you know some tables and that's
it but trust me it's needed in the
industry okay this is nice right website
looks good I like it this could be like
a nice theme for like a wordpress site
you know somebody who has like a
magazine online magazine so that's cool
so as far as the projects it's pretty
legit man he has really good projects
for his portfolio the next thing that I
would do is add some more like real
businesses like the restaurant website I
like it digital agency I like it
email template like a Red Bull I like it
I will say create another business like
all you're missing here is ecommerce and
then this will be a perfect portfolio
