couple of comments you know about
different subjects so since we released
this new video what is it half an hour

freaking out you know and the reason why
I made is because people are freaking
out about net neutrality and everybody's
using it as a way to get hits and
everybody's is spreading the same thing

like Dominican Republic Dominican
Republic a lot of fucked up shit happens
over there right the Internet is
actually like that you could actually go
to a store a corner store and the
Internet's not the internet from your
house because people forget nd they
don't know how to distinguish things
right when you're talking about mobile
data that's a whole different system
than your regular internet from your
house people forget that I don't know
they kind of put everything together
right there's a very good image out
there where they show oh you know five
dollars for Netflix five dollars for
twenty dollars for whatever for Facebook
whatsapp guys that exists all over the
world is not just in Portugal all right
that works thing all over the world but
people for some reason they're holding
on to that and they thinking man that's
not my internet is gonna be no that's
not how your internet is gonna be it's
just people are out here forgetting like
this isn't like they thinking like this
is like a fucking third-world country
like this the fucking United States

been using you could use it you could
watch your movies you could watch your
stuff but you know what if you want the
4k into a fucking cake you're gonna have
to pay for ounce ten dollars for it

out here oh my god my internet is down I
got a
slow down I gotta watch 1080p you're
telling me that's what that's what the
fuck you're talking about right now
that's what the fuck you're crying about
out here you get what I'm saying like
people are out here crying about this
net neutrality and all this fucking
bullshit when there's so much other shit
in the world that they should be worried
about you know that if you go to a
hospital right now at the same moment it
doesn't matter you break your arm right
now you walking down the street you
break your fucking arm you go to a
fucking hospital automatically just to
see you it's like nine hundred dollars
that's not even counting a thousand
dollars if you call the fucking
ambulance all right and this is what
people are fuckin worried about that's
what the video is about if you didn't
get it if you didn't get the fucking
video that's what the video is about you
get what I mean like we we get to deal
with fucking people out here sometimes
that cry about every fucking little
thing out there in the fucking world
stop crying
start fucking worry about the shit that
really fucking matters net neutrality is
not gonna fucking hurt you at all you
live in the fucking United States I
understand if you live in fucking a
Dominican Republic the Philippines you
live in in Costa Rica you live in the
fucking United States shut the fuck up
you get what I'm saying like these
people that are fucking crying about
this shit and talking about it as if the
world just ended for them
guys we have fucking internet in 2015 we
had incident from 1990 till now probably
even before that I don't even know
exactly what was the date the exact date
that the internet came up nobody was
fucking crying for this shit they put
this shit two years ago let her fucking
go who gives a fuck are you are you
fuckin part of Netflix are you part of
Google are you part of fucking YouTube
Amazon no you don't give a fuck about
that shit so why are you fucking crying
about this shit you get what I'm saying
and
this video is just another real video
from your boy that I don't care about
the ads or I don't care about making no
money on this video but I just wanted to
let it be known out there like you have
real shit going on in the world and
you're worrying about this you're out
here putting time I've seen people send
me emails I don't know if I'm gonna
start to become a developer because you
know it's like with net neutrality man I
think you know as an entrepreneur
what the fuck are you talking about
you're gonna say like Berto like you if
you wanted to become a developer you
just become a developer are you fucking
building the next Netflix like this is
the same shit with people who talk about
Ruby on Rails or like nodejs there's
like or even PHP right they work with
PHP they're like the shit on PHP because
they're like oh man it doesn't scale
that well and it's like they said on
Ruby on Rails cuz it's like oh Twitter
switch from Ruby on Rails - you know
SCADA because they couldn't scale at
some point and it's like first of all
sit your ass down and understand the
business that you're in understand what
is it that you're building are you going
to fucking build the next Twitter people
are looking to create stores right
you're gonna create a online store to
sell things online the most you're gonna
guess like 2,000 users at one time and
you're fuckin worried about how is it
gonna scale once it reaches - Twitter's
numbers do you think you're fuckin
website is gonna get to that level you
get what I'm saying
and with this whole net neutrality thing
my problem is it's just like man every
fucking body that's out here they all
repeating the same shit the same shit
the same shape the same shape the like
man they kind of fucking they're gonna
band freedom of speech they're gonna
fucking bad people or sharing things
online they're gonna do this and I was
like Brody
just got put two years ago were we
living in China two years ago you got
what I'm saying like in 2015 they put
net neutrality before 2015 what's you
living in China with a freaking block
your internet from checking any type of
type of website you get what I'm saying
like sometimes people gotta use their
fucking brain now here man
that should be a requirement like
fucking life like use your brain man and
I'm not pissed off and people probably
think I'm pissed off because I'm cursing
no because I was like you know what
today I say let's do a video like one of
my old videos you remember where I used
to come in here and just cursed
everything out and break the fuck people
are talking about ok so you go what I'm
saying so all I'm saying is man is like
this she just got put in 2015 why are
you worried about this shit you got what
I'm saying like if they were gonna if
they really wanted to do is dirty they
would have done its dirty before we even
got used to the Internet you get what
I'm saying like now that we're used to
the internet and we know how things are
and how we have this freedom and how
everything works and how we could come
and share things and videos and photos
you can't take those rights back you
can't be like oh man guys hey guys by
the way you can't share videos on on
Instagram no more they're not gonna do
that to you because it's like you
already got a taste of it they could do
that shit to people in China not to us
cuz we already got the taste up for it
you know what I mean so it's like
sometimes you gotta be realistic out
here man
don't let this this people come in and
put you in this this world of like
stressed out like oh my god net
neutrality net neutrality this shit just
got put fucking 2 years ago I was
on MySpace I was still on Facebook I was
still freaking watching porn online I
was still watching YouTube I was still
doing a whole bunch of shit in 2015 now
what's the difference from 2015 to now
right now we see that basically Netflix
YouTube Amazon or Hulu all of these
companies have been taking over the
content space right so the eye space is
like yo man we used to sell and we used
to make our money from the cable that's
what you know people used to give
internet as an extra they used to give
the internet as the extra people keep
forgetting this back in the days when
the internet just got started
not even the internet that you know what
incident got introduced or America
Online and all of this stuff like the
internet was like an extra in your house
right everything was around the freaking
cable box right so now what happens
companies all of the big companies in
the tech industry came in they swallowed
up all the smaller companies you know
twitch TV is owned by Amazon like Jackie
forgetting that um YouTube is owned by
Google so they came in they swallowed up
all the small companies that were
popping up with video and creating cool
stuff and then they basically have an
monopoly of content now they've taken
over everything and they control it
right now on this video I probably get
you know blocked or I probably get
whatever you can't say anything online
no more especially on YouTube because
YouTube controls it Google controls it
you got what I'm saying so to me as a
human being in 2017 where I have real
issues and real things going on in the
world what the fuck am I wasting energy
on net neutrality when the only people
are being affected by this are really
the big
Panisse same way how theirs are you know
the ISPs spent a lot of money to lobby
this thing to go away it's the same way
that all of these big companies they
spent a lot of money to have people on
YouTube have people put up shit on ready
have people share content online I've
seen on Facebook freakin post about net
neutrality being promoted now who the
hell is promoting this shit
most of the who the hell's being who
what the hell is being affected by this
it's the big guys us is the consumers
they're like all whatever they don't
give a fuck about us Netflix could
definitely be cheaper right you two
could definitely take care of that
content creators you took it definitely
take care of a lot of people right but
why are we crying for something that has
nothing to do with us
it just doesn't people keep keep on
bringing this up like us if we in 2014
we was being freakin censored or
something like we we was living in China
or something guys two years ago I was
good so what you know what was another
thing that's coming up - if you guys
haven't noticed next year the new TVs
are coming out with 8k right who here is
gonna be able to buy a cake TV right
people with money right now for the
people who have money and who don't care
about you know paying $4,000 $5,000 who
gives a damn if they have to pay five to
fifteen dollars extra for that ache a
package on their internet do you care no
like let's be honest like this this was
a it's all about and people just like
you know like acting like this thing is
like the end of the world man what the
hell you was
in 2015 man were we living in an under
rock where we walking around with the
big Motorola cell phones no like it's
not that serious you get what I'm saying
it's Matt is like oh it stops
ISPs from censoring if they wasn't
censoring us before why would they start
now maybe in England they will delay
this is the United States people be
forgetting about this shit people act
like this is not the US there's the
fucking United States like people don't
let shit go they don't we don't let shit
like that happen here in this country
there's the United States remember that
like there's the problem with people
yeah over here
yeah letting yourself get worked up for
something that doesn't even work
I think it's never worth it you know
what I'm saying like
there's the United States man like
people forget forget this thing as being
in the United States you know saying
like it's the United States man like
straight up like the United States
people here have rights people here we
know what we have here like I'm telling
you right now if they were to be like
hey man we're gonna charge five dollars
for Netflix ten dollars for YouTube
twenty dollars for whatever do you
really think people are going to be up
for that like people go and fucking riot
people go and do whatever they need to
do for their rights out here like this
the fucking United States yeah be
forgetting they're like stop worrying
about big business problems like that's
not that's not my business you got on
saying like I don't make no money with
Google at all like I'm here on YouTube
bottle you know it's like if they'd be
like hey man you uploading too much you
uploading your shit is in 4k could you
open load it in 10 and 1080p cool I
uploaded 1080p sometimes so we feel like
we are entitled to everything and I've
never hate that mentality people feel
entitled for everything like you're not
entitled to shake you know what I mean
like that's just how it is you're not
entitled to shit in this world you get
it and you make it happen you're not
entitled to say hey you get you're gonna
get unlimited internet for the rest of
your lives like what happens there's the
part where people don't put themselves
in the other side of the coin
tomorrow's 8k right the next generation
four years from now four or five years
from now we're talking about 12 K do you
know how much data they
and who's going to maintain who's going
to maintain the infrastructure for the
internet like you guys complain all the
time why Verizon is shitty and I don't
got service out here where I live
right and this is one of the main
reasons these companies don't make
enough money to be saying hey we gotta
fix up the infrastructure this is the
same infrastructure that was been here
since the beginning of fucking time they
have the same light post the same wires
everything is the same shit they have
the same towers they don't want to
invest into spending any more money on
the services haven't you guys noticed
like you guys remember when there was
back in the days there was like there
was the the gee that was a G right
and then there was 2g and then it came
up with 3G and then I don't know where
right after 3G came out that was 4G
where the fuck is the 5g at is shit
of this internet right for cellphone
towers and all that shit where the fuck
is to find G some I say it's LTE LTE is
not to fight G because if you go to
Korea they have way better internet at
us why because those ISPs they spend
money into those companies in too long
the infrastructure of the country here
in the u.s. they haven't spent no money
because they really don't make no money
like that like they used to back in the
days back in the days they used to have
cable phone they had the internet they
even had satellite now they barely
eating with just regular incident who
uses cable anymore
you got what I'm saying so me as of
somebody who is logical I have a brain
we just I feel like a lot of people
don't have one I feel like a lot of
people they have one but they don't want
to use it they don't put themselves in
other people's situations in other
people's shoes and it's like okay cool
we put in this service we put in our
Internet
we put we give people that internet we
give people access to the Internet we
pay for the wires we pay for every
single thing that maintains it and then
third parties come in and take that what
we used to do which was where we used to
make our money in content and in cabling
all of this stuff and now they create it
and then now they take all our customers
over there we lose all our money but
then we still gotta cater to them and
give them hey you want a cake cool now
we gotta upgrade everything and give you
a cake and we still making the same
amount of money that we did 10 20 years
ago - the cable - the phone you got what
I'm saying like people don't put
themselves in other people's shoes so
you get what I'm saying like that's all
I'm saying man like none of this shit is
gonna save money - nobody none of this
shit is gonna do anything good for none
of us so why would you why would we be
over here like crying I've seen people
leaving comments seeing people literally
with tears on their eyes the Internet is
gone where the fuck was you in 2015 you
know what I'm saying like put yourself
in 2015 what was you doing in 2015 you
still had your internet you still had
your Xbox run your Xbox Live you had
your PlayStation 4 Network you still had
your Netflix you still have your Hulu
you still have all your shit but I guess
that's what they forget to put in all
the videos and all the comments and all
the shit it's like hey where were you
this should be the fucking question for
everybody where the fuck you was at in
2015
somebody explains that explain that to
me
where was you in 2015 like come on man
exactly it's trendy to cry about that
shit like this other shit man this other
shit that's really wrong right now that
we need to focus on like why are people
crying about this shit why nobody's
crying about the hospitals why nobody
crying about health insurance
do you guys know like look I have to
I'll take three medications one for
migraines and two for high blood
pressure right
it runs in my family that's just how it
is both pills for high blood pressure
one is it's very cheap one is very
expensive
the one from the headache is very
expensive right now you go to another
state it's cheap over there you go to
another country it's cheap over there
right here in New York it's expensive
right
why aren't we all talking about the
health care system why aren't we all
talking about you know freakin tax
regulations right people the people at
the bottom should get taxed way less
than the people at the top right if I'm
making if I'm making $100,000 why am I
getting charged way more than somebody
who's making two three million dollars
nobody here needs to be walking around
with excess of money if I when I was
working for you know a bullshit parking
lot they used to come in look I was
worked a whole fucking week it'll be
like 450 for the whole week $450 for the
whole fucking week right and
after that 450 they come in and they
take taxes and the taxes is literally
leg I don't know I will always end up
with like three hundred and five or
three hundred and ten dollars so almost
a hundred dollars they take away
automatically and then I will get paid
every two weeks so then that's a
different a different system and then
they will come in and charge you again
when somebody comes in from you know
this million is this is multi million is
multi billionaires like and that's why
I'm always against Google Amazon all
these big companies because they scheme
their way through Shea and even with
this whole net neutrality they fucking
making so much fucking money and yet
people are so fucking dumb that they're
crying for them people are so fucking
dumb sometimes
they're crying for fucking big companies
to make money all they're doing right
now is passing in as I hay they passing
the baton is like hey buddy you made a
lot of money in the last ten years here
you go here's your baton back you get it
back now you make money again that's all
they do it us we're not making no
fucking money out of shake we're not
getting anything so why are we crying
about this net neutrality now when it
comes to our rights like censorship and
shit like that
if there were to get to that point
people will rebelled people will come
out here and be like yo we're not fuckin
with that that's a you get what I'm
saying so stop stressing about net
neutrality stop stressing about all this
BS like nobody shit matters man like
worry about shit that really does matter
you get what I'm saying like people
should be making a bigger deal so the
fact that this guy just gave he's well I
don't know if he gave him yet or he he
he basically thinking about giving
people you know
the big companies a bigger tax break
like don't sort of shit that people
should be pissed off about like we live
in the richest country and we don't even
have health insurance like you know what
I'm saying like people don't even
freaking half no people don't have no
fucking health insurance out here this
shit should be free you get what I'm
saying like if we all gonna be working
here we all gonna be supplying all these
big companies with our hard-earned money
there should be a universal um Michael
is a universal minimum wage those are
the things that people should be crying
about there shouldn't be people that
work at McDonald's and having to work at
McDonald's and go work at Wendy's right
after you finished working at McDonald's
Eli hey man he's like I gotta put on my
other hat I gotta put on my Wendy's hat
I gotta call across the street yeah cuz
you know the the money that I made here
is not enough so I gotta go across the
street to make money that's what people
should be crying about right now you
gonna say like there's net neutrality is
a fucking joke anybody that's still
talking about this shit you guys don't
even know what the fuck you're talking
about you gotta get your priorities
straight in your life you know what I'm
saying like if you worry about that like
you got nothing else to worry alike if
net neutrality is such a big thing to
you you got to look at yourself in the
mirror and basically say man there's
something I live a very good life for me
to say hey this is a problem in my life
you will have to live a very good life a
very privileged life because there's
people out here that don't have no
health insurance they have to work two
or three jobs and nobody's crying for
them I'm not gonna cry for fucking
Google or YouTube or Amazon you could
cry for them if you want you know what I
mean so that's all I'm saying man
like people will be like Oh Joe do your
research on this
no you do your fucking research I don't
need to do not fucking research on this
thing I got other shits to really worry
about I got other shit and real issues
that if I wanted to go in and be like oh
man we gotta worry about this I will
worry about it
that's a fucking net neutrality some
dumb shit that people have been making
it bigger than what it is because
there's an agenda behind it this people
fucking putting money behind it
you got Google you got Amazon you got
all these big companies putting money
behind it and be like okay guys we need
to freakin we need to keep this here
like to me if it stays or it goes I
don't care you get what I'm saying like
and it's intense when you know what the
fuck you saying then cold
yo it Santana I'm just saying sign like
let's be honest
your internet you paying higher for
Netflix $5 extra even if it's $20 extra
if right now they tell me Joe you gotta
pay $20 extra to get a way faster
internet a way more reliable internet
will you pay I will say yes I will pay
are we going to take away all your your
fucking rights that you have as a human
being as an American no but since you're
no longer coming to us for cable and for
content and we still need to maintain
all of those fucking services you have
to fucking pay $20 am I gonna cry for
that No
that's a throttling listen guys if they
wanted to throttle the fucking internet
that would have done that shit before
before people got used to all this shit
before people enjoyed the internet like
this they would have done this before
they're not gonna do that now all right
talk about this because people sound
like ice water guy you guys sound like
yeah part of Google yeah work for Google
yeah make money with Google like she has
nothing to do with you guys and you guys
are worried about it no I put myself in
everybody's shoes because I've been in
every single situation from the fucking
bottom to the top I put myself in both
fucking shoes and like you know I see
the whole spectrum and it's like hey man
yeah
pay $20 for unlimited internet unlimited
access whatever $15 whatever that's fine
that's fine to me
as long as my fucking internet really
works because even right now I'm paying
I'm paying fucking Verizon my internet
is not even that great out here you get
what I'm saying and one of the main
reasons why is because they haven't
updated the fucking infrastructure to
the whole fucking country in over 20
years but people forget about that
like it's just this a lot of shit that
we need to worry about and I've seen
people come in and just literally try to
kick in on this topic of net neutrality
and sharing sharing this misinformation
to to get people like so worried about
it like the fuck are you worried about
you live in the United States like get
what I sound like
yeah man this is crazy Matt it's tight
where's like Joe you're a fucking
hypocrite you're sharing misinformation
you sound to the yo I'm just saying
people are fuckin worrying about this
like way too much worse somebody tell
Matt to come to Fort down you do not
work for Google you do not work for
Netflix you make no money with those
people like at all
you get what I'm saying like you make no
money with them no because that's the
thing look this is the thing I want to
hear from the people who live in other
countries here on the chat the people
that go to the store right in Dominican
Republic my cousin to use facebooking to
use um hi coalition to use Facebook and
to use my college it was it whatsapp
yeah so use whatsapp he has to go to a
store paid a freaking card get a card
and then basically charge his phone with
five dollars to be able to use
facebooking or all of this shit right
but that's because that's a mobile phone
right but that doesn't mean that they
don't have their fucking unlimited
internet it's just a different price if
all you wanted was just access to
Facebook you could pay for $5 access to
Facebook I know a lot of people who just
use the phone they're like I don't even
use the fucking internet they charging
me for Internet 4G or all this out of
the extra shit pay for whatever the fuck
you need you know what else you get what
I'm saying like there's people who don't
don't hike honest they don't even watch
fucking videos they know your watch
online why do they have to pay a premium
of like $50 $60 to $100 on Verizon
I don't even fucking watch no videos why
do I still gotta pay the fucking premium
you know what I'm saying like those are
the things that people are not putting
themselves in those other people's shoes
I put myself in everybody's shoes I
understand what Matt is saying what's
antennas saying what everybody's saying
my point to this is you guys live in a
fucking developed country what the fuck
are you doing complaining about it what
the fuck are you doing complaining about
some shit that in reality it doesn't
affect you like you tell me you live in
the u.s. you live in England you telling
me you don't have fucking five dollars
in your fucking pocket you got what I'm
saying like those are the things where
I'm like what the fuck are you talking
about like if it was somebody who's
somebody who tells me hey man I'm in the
Philippines I'm over here fighting
fucking tigers and bears and shame and
you know I'm a fucking Indian fucking
riding around and a fucking elephant
like I will understand that I'll be like
yo son you live you live in a really bad
situation it's gonna really affect you
as far out as is really gonna affect you
but when you live in a fucking civilized
country and you live in a fucking
country way you have everything at your
fucking hands at your fingertips and
you're crying about this shit like come
on those are the things that I'm like
this is ridiculous
I'm just saying I'm just one of those
people that I'm not focused on notice
shake you get what I'm saying like I'm
above this shit that's how I look at it
I'm like man people are crying about net
neutrality like why are we crying about
fucking health care why are we crying
about taxes why are we crying about shit
that matters you're worried about a
fucking Internet like hey next year you
won't be able to get a K because you're
gonna have to pay five dollars extra if
you live in on your United States you
can't fucking pay five dollars extra and
you want a K that's on you stay with the
fucking 4 K what the fuck you need to 8
K for you get what I'm saying like
that's all I'm saying like Matt you know
I love you man there's like what those
topics was like you know how you hang
out with your friends and you just like
yeah all talk shit like this is one of
those topics man nah nobody's worry
about none of these topics trust me
because the way how people have been
talking about net neutrality and people
are talking on on channels that have
nothing to do with net neutrality
everybody wants to talk about it that's
why I'm even talking about it because
it's like I don't want to talk about
this shit you know what I'm saying like
I'm forced to talk about it because
people keep asking me about it but I'm
like man if I come in here or some
righteous on some walk shit to this
channel people some people is not gonna
like it because some people live in this
this lala land that I just don't live in
world you know what I mean like I just
don't live in this latter name I don't I
live in a world where it's like I know
what it is to be fucking dead fucking
broke to being fucking middle class so
fucking going to city schools going to
you know having fights to fucking doing
everything that's wrong in the world
I've been through the whole shit man
so when I come in here and I see all
this there's so many clowns I'm not
saying you guys I'm saying the clowns of
the Internet the clowns of the internet
that overhyped things and it's like man
why we can't over hype you know like
other stuff stuff that really really
matters you get what I mean
I think look at my for net neutrality
yes do I give a fuck if they take it off
I don't that's the truth that's just me
being honest I just don't give a fuck
and today for all of you guys are coming
in today just because I'm cursing
doesn't mean that I'm mad does just
because I'm cursing doesn't mean
anything this how I talk to my friends
I'm hanging out with my friends out here
I'm chilling with my boy man we having
conversation channel where Philippe we
chilling with Jenna we chilling with
Keanu we chilling with my suit yet we
chilling with Casey we got cam somewhere
in there cam should be out here
oh shit camera's not here today whoa the
world is over maybe net neutrality took
fucking camp off net neutrality you're
so bad that cam can't even show up to
the chat room no more that's how bad
Shay got back kids I'll take it back
she's so bad that for the first time cam
didn't get to show up oh wait my fault
cam is right here word cam is like I
don't even got a 4k TV yet like you get
what I'm saying like this people who
have real shit out here like we fucking
worrying about like the dumbest things
out here man Matt is like you don't give
a fuck is it you haven't done the
research man I done the research man I
done the research and I compare 2015
till now what was the difference between
2014 and today somebody explained that
to me
you know what I'm saying like how many
of you guys are going to build the next
Netflix the next YouTube how many of you
guys are going to build a hide call is a
application that's gonna need millions
and millions of gigabytes per second
let's say for example right how many of
you guys are gonna build that right I'm
not so why the fuck would I care about
hey my frickin flow of data is not being
passed a certain speed and I have to pay
extra no I don't have to pay fucking
extra those big companies they have to
deal with the ISPs now they have to deal
with that this happened oh look it up
and this is why I get pissed off at the
fact that people will say hello Joe you
didn't do the fucking research I've been
fucking doing a fucking research on this
shit for almost a year since people
started talking about this shit I've
done the same research that you've done
the research and probably a little bit
more because I'm actually love fucking
tech and I'm constantly reading fucking
blogs and reading what other people say
and I'm like oh wait what like did you
guys know that fucking Netflix had to go
in and make a deal with a lot of the the
providers because they're like hey we
want a stream of you know especially now
with the 4k they're like you know in
certain areas our 4k doesn't work that
well can you guys pay pay for that and
can you guys build that for us and the
ISPs is like wait what what the fuck you
want us to build a system for YouTube
half steady 4k and you're not fucking
paying us anything you get what I'm
saying like nobody's and people need to
stop acting like people are entitled to
shit you're not entitled to
shit like I'm providing you for Internet
doesn't mean that I need to fucking give
you a que whenever the fuck you want it
doesn't mean that I need to fucking give
you a constant ache a connection and I
gotta pay for it because all the
internet is created equal all the data
that passes through the internet is
created equal
Noah's not even back in the days when
you know people will have yeah you
already know my first web site was a
Dragonball Z website right I had to
create a website where basically I will
share videos like full movies of Dragon
Ball Z and full episodes Dragon Ball Z I
used to upload it and it costs a lot of
money too so fucking hosts at right now
the ISPs back then they will let you run
a certain amount of bitrate and
everything was fine so it's the same
shit as now the only difference that now
technology is going really fucking fast
and now instead of us you know back in
the days there used to be uh you know I
don't know if you guys remember like
real one player was like hey 200k beep
per second and you will have a little
nice video no now people want 4k ak-12 K
content and then they expect the they
expect the the fucking is fees to pay
flashing like hey it's internet it
doesn't matter if it's you know if it's
super fucking 2 terabytes per second
it's the same shit as 1 megabyte no it's
not alright so we spent already 48
minutes on this bullshit we basically
get on and gave us some time to this so
whatever now let's talk about this
bullshit Star Wars movie man man
it's kind of ridiculous man like the
this goddamn Star Wars man like like I
love Star Wars man I really do man
I really do freaking love Star Wars man
but like there's like so much bullshit
and thank God thank God I don't even
freaking you know like I was gonna take
my whole family take everybody to this
shit it's like I wasn't there by myself
man yeah I know exactly now that's
another thing too like Star Wars is
garbage now man that movies fucking
garbage guys oh my god watch or no watch
don't watch that shit wait until that
shits on DVD you're gonna see that share
Netflix pun intended next year $5 for $5
kids you get the 8k version of Star Wars
the last Jedi full access through
horizon on Netflix you go sailing now
but that movie so fucking bad man I mean
the last movie was fucking horrible the
last Star Wars movie is horrible and I
was like looking at it and I was like
man this thing is not going to be worth
it and I say this thing is they try to
make it for little kids
and what they don't understand is that
yes you could try to make it for little
kids in bed okay now we get it to sell
them the little toys and their little
games and stuff like that
but that's not the core audience for
Star Wars that's not the core audience
like parents are taking kids to go watch
Star Wars because
they are fan of it they are fans of it
you wanna say like it just doesn't make
fuckin sense like all the bullshit that
I've seen on it it was just like man
like smoke okay
spoiler alert spoiler alert if you
haven't seen it if you haven't seen the
movie this is when I guess you can walk
away from this one
yeah fucking major spoiler spoiler alert
flagging Snoke dies and you're like wait
what like this is the fucking bad guy
like kylo Ren is not the movie star like
like this is the thing that had me
pissed off I was like kylo Ren is not
the fucking movie star of this fucking
movie well it's not the star of the
movie whatever ya is he's not the
fucking star of the movie
like he's just not sorry you guys
spoiler spoiler in there sorry
oh I thought you guys watched it it's
not my fault like what the hell how can
you be a Star Wars fan and now watch it
already you know what I'm saying like
it's Sunday it came out Friday you
should have already went to go see that
it's Sunday by Sunday night come on you
should have already seen the movie right
now that's not my fault I'm not
responsible for that
but Snoke is dead
I guess kylo and array I guess kylo is
gonna blow her back out or something I
don't know what's going on there how
they setting up this movie for them to
have sex or what is it that they want
but this movie is it is ridiculous
it's pretty garbage is garbage it's like
straight to straight-to-dvd type of
movie the animations the graphics and
all that stuff is cool you know effects
is cool but it's just bad man it's just
really bad I don't know why and I don't
understand why they will kill smoke who
is actually the bad guy it's like you
can't fucking kill the bad guy like and
then on top but I not tell us where he
came from how the the new order was set
up how you know like he came from the
outer regions fucking like where the
fuck he came from sorry I know cursing a
lot in this video this is one of those
videos you guys are getting to see a
video that's probably gonna get deleted
so I hope you guys enjoy it but yeah man
it's just really fucking bad man that's
one of those movies where he's like wait
why like this whole this whole like
series is like going to shame like I'm
sorry but I liked episode 2 I didn't
like episode 1 episode 1 it was so
fucking slow it's like they could have
done that whole movie in 15 minutes then
episode 2 was pretty cool there were
parts that were good in episode 2
episode 3 is my favorite movie of all
time out of all the Star Wars movies
episode 3 is my very first he was like
y'all don't delete it we gotta see Matt
get it trigger man I got tight yeah nah
man this is one of those video I'm not
gonna keep
video of me cursing over here going on
crazy it's all gonna about some shit
that's meaningless but um yeah
definitely deleting this video but like
I said episode 3 was my favorite man I
actually cried in that movie that's how
much I love that's how much I love Star
Wars I cried in episode 3 like cuz I was
like I seen the whole thing from Darth
Vader from being a little kid see him
grow up in episode 2
he loves this girl and it's like if you
ever loved somebody and you know what
love is you would do anything for that
person right even do bad shit and that's
what happened to me that's what happened
to him you know y'all talk about sexual
harassment one of these videos I'm not
gonna talk about that because it's just
I just don't want to talk about this you
know but I do say for that subject I
would say that you know you can't harass
girls like girls like I find it to be
annoying when guys are thirsty for women
like you know how many girls are out
there for you to be thirsty for a girl
at work like you don't need to do that
at all you know I mean but that's all
I'm gonna say about that but at the same
time I do believe that there's a lot of
crazy stuff going on you know man now
I'm going back to Star Wars yeah man
episode 3 was freaking dope man I
definitely I freaking cried on a shit at
the end when he was like he's like Eric
don't oh okay I got the higher ground
he's like masked he's like oh we won you
you fucked me up lv.1 it he's like yo so
he was like okay you were the chosen one
right there just a tear came out like
why like why you you you gotta fuckin
you gotta fuck it up and again why you
gotta fuck it up like you don't have to
fuck it up don't do it that's it guys
leg off do this on the ground looking
like a fucking Judy's on the ground
looking like a fucking a burnt-up hot
dog you know how you live you leave a
hot dog for too long enough on the
fucking grill and you come back you like
oh shit was just a minute I left it in
there for a minute you come back
Anakin's looking like a fucking bird up
fuckin dried-up fuckin right up fuckin
hot dog on the floor with no legs
it's like bro you did the shit to
yourself man man it's fucking really
good man yeah so there's like that's
what George Lucas left us at the end
right so that was a really good a really
good fucking you know that was a really
good fucking movie right there and then
you start seeing to me the first few
star was doing their fucking I don't
know like I like the idea of Star Wars I
like the idea of the movies but to me
they're kind of shit you know like
Episode four four or five and six matter
of fact I like I didn't like the first
one how do you like four I didn't like
four there's certain things I like for
them you know from the robots a little
the little droids coming through and
fucking it's like
the avi1 we need your fucking help
come help me come help me come help me
like when the bitches just just stuck
there like there's certain parts of it
that I like it but then from there what
was it six six was I six was I I like I
like which one wasn't that yeah I think
six is the one that no was it six no
five five five five my four five was the
one that Boba Fett was basically he put
Han Solo into into the fucking the
fucking sandwich maker they put him into
a sandwich now six was dope
six was dope that was another freaking
dramatic scene to which was good where's
like you know guys like yo I'm your
fucking father kid like I took the DNA
test and and the fucking the Emperor's
in the back like the test came back Veda
Aveda
you are the father it is like and then
at the end they were like yeah that's
your fucking case huh so funny man I
know yeah probably
oh my god going from net neutrality to
star wars and guys I do this shit for
fun man when I come here do streams I
like this is not from us to argue and
fight with each other like when I curse
is this how I talk to my friends man
like you guys are part of my crew you
know like Matt Phillippe cam can Jenna
you know you got Edgar Martinez you got
Santana never seen him before - now so
he's I guess he's new you know like you
guys are all part of the family you know
what I mean you know what I mean so yeah
man Felipe yo get the corona out I want
to drink so bad but I gotta do a lot of
stuff today
so I'm not gonna drink I haven't drank
in like two three like two weeks I never
drink so that's just how it is but one
day man one day we'll drink together
guys for sure
yeah very key team is just like laughing
about it yeah man like you got a laugh
about it you know what I'm saying I hope
people understand what I what I'm
talking about man like we have like real
issues in the world you know
saying like this real problems in the
world you know like this a lot of stuff
that's going on that I wish people would
talk more about like you know freaking
people getting killed by cars people you
know that's like a touchy subject for
people like oh man you can't talk about
that it's like if people get killed by
cops people should be talking about it
like everybody should be against him but
like you know you shouldn't be getting
killed like one thing that I like about
the you know the UK is the fact that
cops don't even walk around with guns
they got you know they got the little
night sticks they got their their taser
they got shit to keep people under
control but not to kill them there's
really no need to kill people when
you're a cop and you're out here and
you're walking around with a gun like
you I don't know I find that wrong
because the cop is supposed to keep
things in order
you're not supposed to show up to places
and think like oh it's us of you know us
against them like there is no us against
them it's just us you got what I'm
saying like they shouldn't come here and
be like talking about stuff like that
you know what I mean so when I talk
about this net neutrality I'm like young
man like we got shit to really talk
about like real situations real things
that's happening out there
Felipe's like yeah we got real problems
in the world like people using hyper
hyper app is legit man you still haven't
done it yet
Philippe you still haven't used it
yeah man PHP is easy man to this so
Jorge
Jorge's I go flipping Brown flipping
blowing through your course I'm starting
my project after a few sections of PHP
PHP is what's up it's easy PHP is easy
man like if you want to become a web
developer like the easiest thing to do
is just like learn PHP man you know
people come in sometimes so they they
take this higher ground where it's like
oh I want to become a software engineer
I want to become a software developer so
I don't want to touch PHP it's like shut
the fuck up like you getting money like
you get into code you getting paid like
it's easier for you to get a job like
why wouldn't you want to learn something
that's gonna get you in the industry
easier you know what I mean so yeah
Linux is definitely much easier it's
better it's better than Windows trust me
man
I feel bad for all the people I get so
many emails is not even funny guys so
many emails of people trying to install
nodejs on their computer or even doing
the you know setting up like the web
developer kit man like people have
issues with those things and it's not
that and that freaking difficult but
it's because there are windows I can't
do nothing about that like you're on
Windows like hey buddy you gotta go
through hell to install this I'm sorry
like that's on you think you gotta go
through hell installing all of that
stuff make it just sucks
and you can't you can't just do a switch
man
ya know and I hope you don't go and
start switching all of your coats who
use flex boxes for leap2 because that's
another issue that people are having man
people are how can I say this people
cannot separate the fact that CSS grades
flex boxes are using a floats using
waves by percentages they don't
understand that not everything is
supposed to have flex boxes now
everything is supposed to have CSS grids
like is good to come in and build
something but if you're gonna spend now
let's say an example something takes you
20 minutes to do with Flex boxes and
you're trying to figure it out and try
out an online it the perfect way and
it's like if you could have done the
same thing in one minute with floats
then you should have just done floats
you get what I'm saying like a lot of
people come in here and just be like man
something new came out all of my code
needs to be done like this and it's like
nah skeletons like yo I'm a fedora user
I got this word come in is like y'all
might change like a hundred websites man
everything using CSS grids like no but
you know how it is all the new kids man
you know winter I appreciate it man I
really appreciate it yeah well all the
new members to coding phase calm guys I
hope you guys are really taking your
time on the website building cool stuff
like
right now like this to be honest there's
like one of my favorite favorite courses
right now because this thing teaches you
how to use API it's out of fake a
routing system you know cuz that's
another thing too with react everybody
thinks that you need to use react router
like sometimes you just need something
so simple that you don't need a real
freaking router you don't need a routing
system like it's so simple and such you
know like a single page app that you
don't need a routing system so why are
you putting react router on it making
you build even more more fatter than
what it is you know what I mean so
people just gotta gotta definitely check
that that out right there man like that
one the Largo PHP this one the final
project of this is legit I don't even
know if anybody has gotten to the into
this thing a lot of people have gotten
like up to halfway through it it's a
long course I think this is my longest
course in the whole website let me see
how much yeah it's definitely my longest
course
hell yeah this is my longest course
there's like so many hours into this
it's never funny let me see what else
got new videos that I've uploaded to
this coding phase uncut I'm uploading a
couple of new videos today so if you're
a member of the website if you just
register and you wanna watch this it's
completely free all you have to do is be
able to register and you get to watch
the uncut videos videos like this where
I curse I just be honest on certain
topics right like it's not me being
professional it's just me fucking
sharing my opinions on certain things
Jason ey framework are you using if
you're not using laravel what do you use
let me know Jason let me know what are
you using
man like once I finish like all my web
development courses like I want to jump
into creating like game development
courses like sorry
it's the IO there's like a couple of
games in here man all made with html5
like it's pretty legit like this is so
easy to make it's not even funny let me
see let me see
can't press to see somebody's see some
people they suck man they don't know how
to code it gets me pissed off like if
you gotta release it like there's a
website it's called HDI alright people
get to release their their indie games
here and they get to sell like like
let's say you who come in here create an
indie game and then sell the full
version of it on your own website so
it's a way to make money for those of
you guys that really want to get into
this but it's crazy because it's like
some people they post games that are not
even ready to be shown
see the goddamn music is horrible
ok so ok so Z is to move to - hey oh
shit
alright see this game is mad easy to
make oh you know about that and what's
cool that you could take this games and
basically release them on iOS store oh
body now you could release this games in
the iOS store create created by was a I
forgot wasn't even a that company that
converts it to something come over
konoba yeah what's the name of the
company I keep from forgetting the name
man missing html5 to iOS Cordoba
yeah Cordova you can use like Cordoba to
pretty much convert our html5 game into
iOS and it's not that bad
look at this pokemon war
yes oh I can't wait once I finished all
my my courses I want to create like a
phase in Jes course I want to create
like a gold course because I have a
couple of games that I've released and
and launched and I've actually taken
classes from school on doing like game
