you're gonna learn everything from HTML
CSS to sass to JavaScript to the whole
shebang right just check it out
description is right below support your
boy you know I do everything for you

coning face calm right github.com slash
coating face calm alright that's what
we're going right now
cool we here we live I don't know if my
my video got stuck a sign alright um so
basically we're gonna download this
starter kit 2018 okay we gotta start
this up you're gonna download this
alright download that zip alright let me
go back to my desktop go to my downloads
folder come here let me see where is it
let me see kind
okay starter kit 2018 I've downloaded a
million times every time that I do a
video I tell you guys to download this
but yeah you start off with this starter
kit you open this up put it in a folder
that you guys are comfortable with for
me it's projects so I'm gonna put it
here okay we're gonna come here starter
kit 2018 and we're going to name this
let's say dashboard right at some point
you guys gonna have to build a dashboard
so pretty much you can start here with
me okay
alright now now that we here we're gonna
open up Adam we're going to open up this
project right here we're going to go to
projects we're going to go into
dashboard and open it up let me close
this close that and then now what we're
going to do is we're going to basically
open up the terminal if you guys don't
have this package download this package
is called platform you or is it platform
you IDE terminal it basically gives you
a terminal for Adam alright if you guys
have them was a visual studio so you can
do the same thing too so alright so now
we have this this amazing terminal here

say NPM install right of course you
gotta have no Jes install on your
computer and make sure you have gulp
install right so that's it that's about
it that's all the things that you need
to get started if you ever done any of
my projects you already know all of this
stuff right now of course you can do
this on your own if you're expert and
you know how to do it yourself instead
of using my own starter kit you could
have your own starter kit in
do it on your own all right so let's
start this up kids all right let that
load a lot of stuff got a download man
especially no sass I don't know why no
sass like they took out no sass out of
like I forgot what package I don't know
first node version 6 or 7 or something
like that
like after version 8 like now every
single time you have to download no sass
and it's really annoying because it does
take a while I don't know why but it
takes a while to basically get started
so yeah man he's gotta win soliciting
downloads after the sting downloads then
we're going to start building this
project so I'm gonna put the link for

colors those are our colors right there

could share this and give it to you guys
so whatever okay cool let me see and a
copy so first of all we're gonna come
here to our SAS alright and we're going
to create one file call underscore
variables that s CSS all right and here
what we're going to do is we're gonna
take one are we gonna say purple okay
purple light
a purple light I don't know yeah
camelcase capital T capital L purple
light and then we're going to say we're
gonna paste this in what we just copy
put the little hashtag okay now for this
one we're going to say purple dark
alright we're gonna copy the second one
okay we're gonna take this green I'm
gonna say neon green kind of okay
hashtag paste that we're gonna say light
grey then dark grey okay cop it is from
here paste it there hold on copy this
and paste it there all right Bagon
there's five different colors okay now
the first thing we want to do is we want
to make the the background okay so we're
gonna come to main delete card
we don't need card okay you're gonna
come here delete everything here I'm
gonna throw the first thing we want to
do is we want to come here and say like
this one say
box-sizing border-box that's
automatically that should be automatic
for every developer period now the next
thing we want to do is we want to come
here and see background and we're gonna
put in our variable of light gray
okay what's the issue
oh yeah we haven't imported it so we got
to import this first so you're gonna say
import variables okay cool
now come here okay so it's like great
now the next thing that we want to do is
let me close a couple of things cause
that close that close that close that
let's just leave this two windows open
right now all right now let's look at
the image see what we want to do the
first thing we want to do is this side
menu so let's say let's name it ID side
menu
okay side menu and we're gonna say
background background what was it mostl
variable purple light purple light let's
change this around I like having the
colors first lowest gray light and then
change it here and the variable so I'm
gonna do gray light and then gray dark
now save this and then save this okay
now let's go back here so first of all
we want to create a section and I know
people's gonna well you could use the
side you could use this you could use a
div who cares use whatever you want to
use you know I mean you use whatever
you're comfortable with right it doesn't
matter it's just elements like nobody
cares all right me I like to use
sections so section we're gonna say side
menu okay cool now the next thing we
want to do is look at the image again so
you got one two three four five six
you got six elements there so what we're
gonna do is we're gonna create a side
menu and then we're gonna say you well
you are right or even we could do nav
nav for navigation and then put anchor
links inside of a-- and say H ref just
put in like that and let's say item for
now it doesn't matter what what we call
them so we're gonna copy this and I
paste is six times
okay three six all right cool
so you can see right now it's currently
on a block level we want to change that
so we want to come here to me and we're
gonna come inside of the side menu we're
gonna say something like this I say max
wave and let's look at the image they're
just estimate
okay 280 so max width to 80 pixels
okay and then we're gonna say you will
you will or no we changed it to an F
right so now and then side a the anchor
tags we're gonna say display:block okay
each one okay we're gonna say let me see
I think what was it we got a light
so purple light all right and then we're
gonna say and if it has the class active
we're gonna say background is it's a
purple dark okay so that's if it has the
class active right now we're gonna leave
that alone
okay we're gonna come here we're gonna
say something like this we want to say
color white all right
text-decoration:none
okay text-decoration:none let's see what
else
look at this image let's see padding
padding we're gonna say 20 pixels for
now all right 20 pixels maybe 15 pixels
on top of right and then from left to
right let's say something like this
let's say 30 pixels all right that seems
right yeah
30 pixels okay cool
now what else we want to do to this if
you want to look at the image again you
know sometimes it that's why it's good
to have like two three screens or you
put move this up a little bit for now
okay put that there like that okay so we
got that let's see the color of it it's
not white it's actually the same great
light great dark you have great dark is
a little bit better fright and then from
there let's come here and on one of them
too let's put a class of active okay
cool now what else we want to do today
is we want to say nav margin-top let's
say for now so we can see a difference
under pixels
okay side menu should be an effect of
padding let's say padding top for now
you know sometimes using shortcuts can
be really annoying you know you think
you're saving yourself time but
sometimes if you make a mistake it's
like you you're really wasting time okay
so we got that all right for now let's
see what else we want to do to this so
we want to say
if it's active we want border right
let's see five pixels for now five
pixels solid and then we're going to put
in the color of neon was it wasn't young
green neon green
let's change that's a green neon okay so
green neon and then save that save that
okay now it's supposed to be bought or
left sorry okay but I left five pixels
now what you want to do is you want to
subtract that five pixels that we put in
from the border so we want to say 30
pixels is fine thirty per school 30
pixels to the right now let's do 15
pixels at the bottom and let's put in 25
pixels to the left let me see copy it is
supposed to be on this one 15 pixels
dirt okay so delete that on this one you
put in padding 15 30 15 25 so there you
go okay so now we have all of them even
let's go to font awesome awesome
CDN on Google to search that bootstrap
CDN to me is the best because they give
you everything already there for you all
you got to do is copy it so pasty
paste it on your on your index now let's
go to the Google Fonts site
well not Google font font awesome icons
okay here let's get the home okay let's
get the home alright let's get let's
just write down MC notes from now
doesn't really matter which ones we get
because there's just prototyping you
guys this is just like for practice this
is just to see if we can do it
you know what I mean okay you got that
let's see bookmark ok bookmark okay and
we see what's the other one I research
schedule so there's no schedule let's
see calendar let's just put this one all
right paste it here put a space what's
what's the other word users search user
I actually like the little circuit board
user you know it's kind of ridiculous
that font awesome they basically they
got like a million dollars and they
still have a released version five a
font awesome like it's kind of
ridiculous
like a million dollars and you're
telling me you can make this little
simple fonts they come on man
sometimes that's why I get pissed over a
lot of people because I'm like man come
on tell me you got everybody to pay you
money pay your million dollars in what
four million dollars and you guys still
cannot create like new fonts like come
on man all right cool
so we got all our icons here all right
now what we're going to do is we're
going to edit those icons so let me see
you're going to come here and I'm gonna
say f8 so this is gonna target all the
icons and we're gonna say color green
neon make sure you put in a dollar sign
for variable okay now the next thing we
want to do is let's do this let's put
font weight of 300 okay and then we're
going to say to the FA we're going to
make your font size let's say 1.4 Ram
1.4 run
it's down a little bit too big nah
that's fine
you're gonna put padding of no not
padding margin right of let's say 0.8
grams okay now hold on let me see my
seat so we got a issue to make all of
this icons to be on the same size hmm
this well we got a global CSS trickery
guys let me see I want all of them to be
in the same size so what we going to do
is we're going to actually split this up
we're going to come here we're going to
say span your purse pants all right let
me try hold on before those pants let me
try this
save this we're going to see
display:inline-block right and we're
gonna say with let's say 30 pixels oh
there you go that's what I'm talking
about
you see so now what we just did was we
basically put this into an inline block
and now we say hey this is the whiff of
this is gonna be 30 pixels and
now we're not really pushing things by
the margin of the size of whatever the
icon really is
we're just saying hey this is 30 pixels
so now push everything you know point
eight Rams to the side now one thing
that we want to do is we want to Center
this so to Center it what we're gonna do
is well say position relative and we're
gonna say top three pixels make it 2
pixels data wallah kids now one thing to
that we want to do is we're gonna put a
little animation on this because we want
the side menu to to animate so how can
we do this right how can we make this
animate we're gonna do a hover right so
on this anchor link we're going to come
here we're gonna say and when you hover
on this anchor link want the background
to be green neon okay we're gonna say
transition all ease okay all and then
point five seconds and then we say ease
in and out now put this at point three
seconds save it all right maybe not then
the green neon is too much but let's do
it for
let's do it for what was it it was a
purple purple dark background purple
dark so then okay and then let's put in
the border water left let's copy this
stuff all these things that are here
we're gonna copy it into this okay all
right cool
so I'll see if you see all right there
you go kids
cool now the last thing before I leave
and we leave this this thing along and
we continue it tomorrow it's going to be
let's make this wave 100 percent of the
screen okay so we're gonna say something
like this we're gonna say position
enough fixed say relative say top:0
bottom:0 okay matter of fact absolute
okay
session absolutes now we're gonna say
wave two eighty pixels which makes the
maximum wave useless all right
so there you go we saved that and now we
have the side menu guys it's a quick
little side menu now oh you know what
let's do this the FE way we're going to
make it great great dark and then on
active we're going to make them so just
say here when it's active when it has
the class active the FE we're going to
make color neon green neon alright so we
can see hey is active and we're gonna do
the same thing for when we hover it okay
so you can see there you go kids that's
