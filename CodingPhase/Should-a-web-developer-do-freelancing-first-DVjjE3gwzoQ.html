back at it again man : face calm here
back again with the questions man listen
so today we got for this kid Nano he
said hi Joe I was wondering what your
thoughts are on starting out and
continuing to doing freelancing versus
starting with a company to get more
skills
this is the main goal of working for
yourself thanks in advance what do I
think about it
pretty much I would say you got to start
with a company man I always start with a
company because what you're gonna do is
you're gonna get so much experience from
other senior developers or other
developers that in reality you won't get
that from freelancing you know
freelancing is like learning by yourself
in your house like yeah you can learn
all this stuff by yourself
but at the same time you know if a
senior developer is there he's gonna
save you that time and of like doing the
research checking through Stack Overflow
checking through you know XYZ website
whatever right when you work with a
company basically if you're lucky and
you have a good senior developer there
then you're you're learning can be you
know you can level up exponentially like
you go up so much more than if it was
just you and your house trying to solve
problems right so that's what I would
say definitely try to go for a company
plus you get benefits and you know a
steady income when you working by
yourself you got to think about it's not
study it's always gonna be like you
working on it but you don't know if a
client's gonna come in and gonna oh can
I pay you next month or whatever you
know I mean like it's not the same thing
that's working in a cup
everything steady and you know what
you're supposed to get paid every two
weeks so that's a big difference right
and like I said from the beginning most
important thing about it is just the
fact that you can learn with other
senior developers you know people that
might know more stuff than you you know
sometimes that's like the best cases you
know you could come in and be like hey
man I don't know how to do this and then
the senior developer his job is to help
you out find the solution you know not
only is to do his job but he also has to
do your job in case you can't do it so
most senior developers will rather teach
you how to do it so like that the next
time you don't bother that's how it is
but yeah like I definitely would say try
try to get into a company that's your
first job and then jump into something
else don't try to do it the opposite way
where you're like you trying to catch
freelance gigs and stuff like that
unless you live like in a country where
there's not that many opportunities and
that many jobs then that's different you
know because if you live in a country
where there's no jobs there's no tech
industry then that's totally different
you have to do it like that you have to
go in and start with doing stuff on your
own but you live here in the u.s. listen
just go to a company apply for a company
show that you're interested so that you
can do the job and yeah just go hard at
it man and like I said guys check out my
website coding phase comm make sure you
subscribe make sure you like this video
make sure you stay up to date with
what's going on and yeah I love you guys
take care peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
