methods that you can use with your set
okay so let's come here and let's
declare a set so we're gonna come here
say numbers so there's a variable that's
gonna hold this set I'm gonna say set
alright
and then after that we're gonna come
here and come to the bottom we're gonna
say numbers odd and this is to add
something inside of the set so we could
come here and pass in a number of one
alright and I'm going to print out
numbers so we can see what happens as
you can see basically numbers got added
to the set now we could come here and
add two
and you see that'll give us an error so
it's expecting only one alright so to do
this we will say numbers add two and I'm
gonna just copy this over and over so
you can see what happens but in three
five six okay and I'm gonna put in two
number three
I know it's a lot of numbers but let's
see what happens we run this and as you
can see it says one two three four five
and six even though we have a lot of
duplicate ones the only ones that are
gonna show up is just one of each so
basically it keeps only the unique ones
okay now we can also do this with let's
say letters come here and I'd say a
we're gonna copy that do it a couple of
times if we come here put in capitalized
say B B let's say C and let's see what
happens we run this and as you can see
it has B C or you know capitalized a
capitalized a lowercase and be
capitalized we run it again and say you
see is basically randomly showing it to
us but one thing that we can definitely
see for sure is that it basically
returns one of each okay so another
thing that we can also do if we wanted
to find out how many are inside of it
right because like let's say we could
have a whole bunch of duplicates alright
and we come here and we have all of this
stuff right if we want to find out how
many are there
right that are unique we literally if
you just say Len okay
passing numbers okay and that would tell
us there's five unique letters in there
okay even though we have a whole bunch
of duplicates and this is really useful
like I said in the last video they're
saying a situation where you have in a
list I was about to say array but a list
right and you have all of this different
you know different letters in there or
numbers or characters or names whatever
right you know numbers like that 2 3
right you have all of that you can
actually see for example if this was in
its own list
you know list so we're gonna say all
right and then we pass in original list
and then now you're like okay I want to
know how many are in there that are
actually unique so then you will use
this so actually figure it out right say
okay part on line 1 name a is now
defined and that's because we did not
put them inside of strings okay so let's
do that now okay
and that's one thing that's cool about
Python like it has a lot of errors that
it tells you exactly what's going on and
what's wrong so you can come in and
debug it pretty quick so as you can see
you have a list of a whole bunch of
different data types in there but it
tells me like hey there's eight of them
two are unique okay so we got one okay
we got - we got three four five six
seven eight
now let's say we had a couple of
different ones in here so I'm gonna do
this I'm gonna say this set and I'm just
gonna declare the set right
okay so there's nothing inside of that
set of numbers all right take off the
land let's say I wanted to update this
in add a couple of different ones so I
could come here and say numbers and then
say update and then in here I could pass
in two three four five if I run this
says it's an error right but if I was to
put this inside an array like you saying
array in Python it's co-list I wish they
would have just kept the race just
sounds so much easier okay so you got a
list right and then you will have that
and automatically that would get added
into the set now you can also come here
and say hey I want to add a couple of
different ones so I can say three four
let's save for a seven or an eight nine
do it like that and let's see what
happens
run this it's taking a little bit longer
than usual but it says two three four
five seven eight and nine so as you can
see even though you have different
arrays it basically merges them and
finds the original ones basically the
unique ones and adds it to the set of
numbers all right something pretty
simple pretty easy all right
you can call so come here and discard if
you wanted to remove a specific one so I
can come here and say numbers not
discard and I wanted this card number
two or yeah so the same two
and automatically two got removed all
right you see what happened right now if
I wanted to get some errors in case it's
not there the best one to use is remove
so if I come here and I say numbers that
remove and then I come here and I pass
in let's say the number 17 see what
happens
says most recent coal python line 5 and
module key error 17
so pretty much 17 doesn't exist inside
of this list of numbers so I cannot
remove it all right so it's pretty good
because it gives you that information
now if I come here putting 4 as you can
see it removed four
all right now there's all the wood
things in here that if you want to go a
little bit deeper you can definitely
look into it you know but a lot of times
you you won't need it I'll be honest
it's just like every other programming
language now every single method that's
there you're going to be using on your
everyday life as a developer but at
least is good in case you ever do need
it you have to documentation if you want
to go a little bit deeper all right so
I'm gonna see you guys in the next video
