at it again coding freeze comm we live
right now so basically what i want to
talk to you guys about is adam so
there's this new features that adam came
out with so let's go to ID adam that io
right so pretty much is it's called adam
ID as you may know Adam it's a text
editor and now pretty much is bringing a
couple of things to basically show you
guys that's like it's pretty legit right
just makes your life easier
alright so let's see let's look into
this I haven't installed it yet I just I
read an article on it they just released
I think yesterday or the day before
yesterday
so basically install the Adam ID - UI so
let's do that
preferences okay cool so let's do this
let's install this you know Facebook and
Adam got together they had this baby
it's pretty cool
anything that Facebook does is legit
like I really love Facebook especially
after creating react like you can't go
wrong after that you know what I mean
but yeah so let's see when still
installing let's see what else we got in
store so I deal with PHP but I don't
know if I have the PHP runtime running
on my computer I probably do but for now
all I'm gonna install is this write the
typescript okay so it says you both
Linton you school both displaylist
okay this I will enter
right now let me see the settings will
taper settings they have okay hyper
click online diagnostics called
formatting let's see what else okay
got a couple of things all right so let
me see let me check this out
what else we got to do here this one ID
type skirt this you know just for
JavaScript it doesn't really matter if
it's if you using typescript but not
it's mostly for for JavaScript so let's
see I just want to try it out I've been
using Adam for awhile it's my favorite
text editor this like so many good
packages here people tell me that oh you
should try vs code you should try
sublime whatever guys listen I don't
know people saying all that Adam is slow
listen guys I'm being honest like if you
have a good computer I'm sorry I don't
know what what the hell you guys are
running if you're working with Windows
XP then that's on you you know what I
mean
I'm working on top of the line computer
so you know what I mean so I'm good Adam
runs amazing for me so let me see okay
so we got this in let me see
I think it's option option oh no see
no it's not that control oh oh okay
there you go
all right cool so pretty much all it has
is a couple of new features you know I
don't know exactly all the features that
has but let me see let me see what what
exactly has it has auto-completion Co
navigation features such as outline view
go to find all references as well hover
to review information Diagnostics errors
and warnings and document formatting
that's pretty cool
alright so it's just I guess it's like a
a quick little update
it's nothing dramatic it's not gonna be
like oh my god it's a brand new brand
new software but it brings in a couple
of new things so it's like crawling to
go to filter for the class or like the
sand water to go to render it'll take me
directly to there so I can just do it
right here to the outline and I don't
have to spend so much time searching for
things so that's cool that's definitely
cool I'm pretty sure what type script it
has a whole bunch of different this
different new you know things to it so
you know that's that's cool all right
let me see composing header I think this
course is an amazing man but it's fine
so it's like you hover on top of it
gives you some info let's see what else
you know it's pretty cool I like it
definitely I can see myself using this
for sure my favorite thing is definitely
the outline because you know how many
times I've been like man I need to use
this thing like I'm trying to find a
class or a function so now everything is
here and it's telling you like ok so
there's a loop listening and then here
tells you there's a variable
now this is render another method inside
of this class shows you the component
what's the variable this is another one
so it's pretty cool of course once I get
used to it I'll show you guys everything
that I has right now I just wanted to
record this little video of me basically
installing it the first time so it's
pretty cool I like it
alright so I'll see you guys later
I love you guys are check out the
website : face calm right now I'm
basically working on the react course
like we're pretty far right now so let's
say we come here all right click NPM for
our watch
so this will be working on right now
there's the real estate app that I've
been telling you guys the stylings are
not 100% there but that's because I
believe that for the end right now like
we built all of this stuff I build the
components we got the header done we got
the footage done the pagination so now
all I really want to focus on is the
JavaScript and basically start filtering
out the apartments depending on whatever
filters we put through here so that's
what we're working on next all right
guys
so I'll see you guys later come to my
website : face calm trust me it's legit
we killing the game right now all right
love you guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
