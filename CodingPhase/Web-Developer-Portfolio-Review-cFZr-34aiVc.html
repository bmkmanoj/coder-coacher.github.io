man coding face.com your boys back and
out and did it again all right listen
guys we hear about to look at another
portfolio okay so this is what we gotta
do
I mean I'm gonna be honest with you
leave my legit legit I mean I like the
fact that you have your name for a
dot-com which is rare it's very rare for
people to be able to buy their own
economy if you can make sure you snatch
that up because this it's not gonna be
there pretty soon right so try to get
that I'm looking at the portfolio the
portfolio has I guess Stack Overflow Oh
God Stack Overflow I got github got a
couple of projects from github which is
cool I got your Linkedin also cool you
know so you got your social media stuff
here that's fine that's great now the
only thing about this is as far as your
programming like I don't see anything
here I'm being honest like like this
nothing here that ever tried checking
here about me okay so I guess there's
the portfolio well there is the the
about me page matter of fact oh man it's
hard to to talk about this its portfolio
because like you might have the skills
you know you might have to be getting
skills but I'll be honest with you like
it's really bad for CENTAC like I'm
looking at this page alone and this just
looks like I don't know like bootstrap
to the max like don't strap gone wrong I
don't know you know I don't want to be
hard you know but
I wish you'd have better portfolio
something better to look at Mikey like
I'll be honest guys there's another tool
if you're not a designer you don't have
a design background like I always say go
to dribble comm find designs there get
inspiration of things that other
designers might have and then you say
okay I like this I'll see how typography
is I see the colors works like you don't
have to try to create in a regular you
know original portfolio you know this I
gear your resume right that's like if
you we come in and we give our resumes
and our resumes look you know like all
wrinkly and light and just doesn't look
good like somebody's gonna look at them
at all this person is not a professional
you know what I mean like you have
professional images you know I feel like
you still in the beginning of learning
and maybe you're actually more advanced
but this website tells me like you're
like really really up beginner alright
like I always tell people if you want
people to believe in you you have to
look like you're worth four million
dollars like you worked for major
companies this website it just doesn't
give me that it doesn't give me that at
all like I'm looking at it and I just
don't know I just don't know no I don't
know how to how to help you with the
site besides the fact that you need a
better design you don't have to create
it yourself right sometimes we just
we're not good designers and that's why
what I will say is try to go to even see
where is it Dean Forrest I think if you
like like necessay for now like this
isn't something like forever right but
let's say you wanted to get a portfolio
right like let's see personal portfolio
horrible - what like you go through this
right and you go through the portfolios
and you start coming in and you have
something that looks decent you know
what I mean
something that works cleaning something
easy and you could actually use this
portfolios you know it's fun only $14
right and some people might say hey but
you didn't build it yourself that's fine
sometimes while you're still learning
like let's say right now I just started
learning right there's really no point
of me having a portfolio that looks like
really bad you know that's not gonna
help me alright so it's better to have a
portfolio like that looks nice and clean
so when people go there they'll be like
oh this guy has an iportfolio he could
actually cold even does a little bit
deceiving because it's like I don't know
like it's not really your ear coat it's
fine it's like a temporary thing where
you have a portfolio up and then now you
just focus on your projects or personal
projects you don't have to code
everything yourself on your portfolio
it's not a must you don't have to go and
design it yourself now it'll be nice but
you gotta understand it's a process you
can't go from learning HTML and creating
a top portfolio like it's gonna take
some time you know to get the skills
that you need so while you're still
getting those skills you might as well
give the person who views your portfolio
a nice website to look at in land on
right and I will see you as far as your
projects you gotta try to get more
projects than this because what I'm
seeing is you have your project and you
have I guess your wife's project which
is good because that's what you're
supposed to do supposed to help your
wife out and try to help them out but
it's just me looking at this websites I
can tell like you just started you get
what I'm saying
I can tell like you just started and to
become a developer when you have a
portfolio portfolio it's like it's like
your house it's like if you can go to a
housing it's like you let's say you're
an architect right and you tell somebody
hey let me build your house but then
when they go to your house your house is
like a trailer park you know what I mean
I'm sorry if it sounds harsh but it's
like somebody who's trying to give you a
job to hire you to build a a a building
or you know a mansion they go to your
house and your house is like a trailer
trailer park you're like wait what your
architect though you're you know what I
mean like you're supposed to build my my
house and your house looks crazy it's
like a high E coli like it's an indoor
designer and I forgot something like
that you know the the people that come
in and fix houses and you know give
people the best design so it's like if
you come into somebody's house and their
house it looks like a mess you like I'm
gonna pay this person to build my house
Oh or you know - interior design my
house like you know what I mean so
that's what I will say about this
portfolio you know and I don't want to
go hard and I'm sorry if I sound like
I'm going harsh on you it's just the
website just looks like a whole bunch of
bootstrap things put together all right
and that's how I'm looking at it and
even with this like the black font I
would say put it with white font I would
look better there's a lot of stuff here
that you gotta fix but I feel like your
skills is not really InDesign your
skills probably in programming so that's
why your website looks like this so in
situations like that when your skills is
more about programming then you have to
actually use somebody else's design you
know it's that simple
all right so I'll see you guys later
