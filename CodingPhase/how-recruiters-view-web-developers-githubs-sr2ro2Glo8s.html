Cody face calm today we got something
special okay today we're going to create
a personal v card for Joe back at it
again man coding face.com your boys
backing out and did it again so today we
got an email by Tiffany Rob straight
from England London London tell you dick
I don't know she's exactly in London but
I'm pretty sure she's from the UK but
yeah so pretty much she says steer Joe
hoping you are well I have just passed
the halfway stage of your web developer
and timeline and I would like to know to
add the restaurant app to my portfolio
website as well add all of my projects
onto github
I have watched numerous tutorials about
pushing pulling and committing files on
github but I'm a little confused as how
to view the road code in the browser I
know that github pages is an available
resource but I don't want to use a
template SS as I have created my own
during the project process also could
you shed some light on how other users
recruiters collaborators see the
front-end /ui of the road code and
github I'm baffled confused calm many
thanks for your help and thank you for
being a fantastic online mentor or the
best if any aka Jones Jones you need
alright guys listen
let's let's talk a little bit about
github right we're gonna take for
example this guy who I follow on
Instagram and I also follow him on oh
yeah yeah so pretty much what he does is
he creates like cool low projects in in
JavaScript he also does stuff for the UI
of the MacBook Pro you know the tests
cool the transport touchscreen whatever
he also does like he has his own atom
browser which is super cool because it's
like you have a browser inside of
which really works so he has a legit you
know set of projects that he has created
now one thing that you can see here is
he's like super duper like active on
yeah right now I'm gonna take a look at
his projects and explain a little bit so
when you have a project on your computer
you could keep track of you know the
history of your project and even like
let's say an example you created
something on your project and then you
made a mistake later on right you could
revert back to what you did the day
before
if you commit your changes that day okay
so it's like a way to keep track of your
whole project okay now there's what
github basically is useful you know for
everybody now at the same time people
could come in and like let's say you
could upload your portfolio upload any
type of project that you working on and
then at the same time you can paint them
here and say hey this are much six top
or my six favorite projects that I've
worked on or that I'm currently working
on so then now when a employer or
another developer wants to check out
like what the hell this guy's working on
they could literally come here and say
okay there's other projects that he's
mostly active on and the ones that he he
cares the most to show for okay
so let's say we come here with clicking
here as you can see you got the name of
the user the name of the project
okay a little message I hate work
personal site for projects and notes so
pretty much this is his website this is
his website being hosted by github he is
I'm pretty sure yes so there's all kick
up pages and as you can see just like is
a pretty simple portfolio but at the
same time it's it's pretty legit cuz he
got like a lot of cool things in here
that you know people could come in and
use for their own code okay now one
thing that I will tell you is never
use github as a place to put in your
private files if you want to put in
private files you go to here bitbucket
comm bitbucket lets you put in files
that you don't want nobody else to to
know about or files like let's say
you're working in your company most
likely your company is gonna have a big
bucket okay they're gonna have a set up
for you and all you have to do is pull
and push into that that repo okay now
let's go back into this so there's our
Sean codes website so he also has a here
so now anybody that's coming here and
said okay here's his portfolio
okay here's his portfolio I want to know
how he did it
okay you could come here and say okay
I'm gonna go into his his SAS so you can
see all his styles you can see the way
how he puts in comments the way how he
codes you know see how he does his media
queries if everything is good and you
like it you like okay this person he has
nice documentation his code is clean
he's using SAS somebody incoming and but
okay we like this developer right
you could also say hey if they want to
check out your other projects and but
okay ACS engine you know he has like his
own game engine that he created to
create games and somebody might be like
oh cool this guy he is very
knowledgeable in JavaScript to be able
to create this okay now this where is
very important to have a portfolio okay
guys this is why it's important because
as a developer I'm gonna come to his
projects on github and look at it and go
okay he used this technology maybe look
at his package that JSON and see what
he's using but I okay cool is a nice
little setup but to be honest with you
guys do I have time to install his
project and and basically be like okay
cool him let me run through his whole
project or his whole game I'm not going
to do that recruiter is definitely not
going to do that right so that's why you
need to have a portfolio with all the
projects that you
have pinned up okay so you wanna have
like for you guys especially because you
guys are brand new and you're getting
into the game and you're trying to find
your first job what you need to have
here it's not like little BS no projects
like not to you know on Sean coats
I love it stuff but for you guys if you
were to have this on your projects this
doesn't make sense for you guys to have
it all right because what you want to
show is real websites real real things
that people could say okay this person
has worked with this client this person
hasn't worked with this other client
this person work with this other company
you want to have all your major websites
that you've built here okay now why
would you have it there because if a
developer decides to say okay this
person worked on let's say bubblegum
calm right you could have that bubblegum
calm the source code in here and then
you could actually share it with that
with that developer right but at the
same time like I said you need the
portfolio because a recruiter the person
who's going to see you before you even
get to the company is not a technical
person that person's gonna be okay he
gotta get up check that's it but he's
not even gonna going here he's not gonna
look at your code this means nothing to
him what means something for him is
having a website something that you
coming here but I oh he was all cool so
this is website he lands here and be
like oh cool James Johnson has her
website and the first thing they're
gonna do is they're gonna be like oh let
me check is a responsive because they
don't understand anything they
understand the very basics so they're
gonna be like oh is it responsive okay
cool is responsive so right there you
got a big check alright
they'd be like okay he's responsive you
know but all let's check maybe his
resume was his education or any type of
work experience or what he has done I
mean I okay cool that's that's nice but
the most important thing your highlight
is your portfolio when you click in
there and they'd be like okay cool
this looks nice it's a nice animation so
to them is your professional your
some K just showing up and like hi guys
what a sign like please hire me no
you're a pro you're like okay I've
worked on many websites or have a lot of
skills here are the things that I can
show for and then when you click in
there it takes you to the live website
right
don't do this where like let's say for
example you have your your portfolio
right and then you click on an image it
doesn't take you to a live website you
need to have that live website either on
your own hosting or connected to let's
say bubblegum calm if this website that
I'm showing here is a bubblegum calm
when I click on it it needs to take me
to bubblegum calm okay or you could have
another way of doing this is like let's
say when you click on the portfolio
it creates not creates but it shows your
page fully explaining what you did in
that in that project okay so like let's
say I work for Nike right I can't just
be like hey man nike.com me I sent him
to Nike common and then have no
explanation what the hell did I do in
Nike calm you want to break it down you
want to be like okay nike.com and they
have a full page explaining all the
things that you did on that project okay
you could be like okay we launched the
new we launched the last Easy's and we
had a brother on this and then you
explained right here I did the menu I
did this and that I was part of a team
doing this and that I set up the gay I
set up this you know so you you
basically you create a story around your
project okay so you could do it like
that or you can do it in a way where you
can say hey I worked on this page and
then when they click here and links them
directly to that page itself okay now
feels like like I just said if it's like
something that you worked in part of a
team and it's a huge project when you
click in there what you want to do is
take them to a page inside of your
website that you explain all of the
things that you did on that project okay
right now
currently we're looking at the portfolio
course that I created and to be honest
with you guys this is like a freestyle
course that's why it's free right I'm
calling them like freestyle courses this
courses that i'm gonna create ty it was
his name
Tyler so Tyler Fleming I think Tyler
Fleming or Tyler he told me say yo
you're supposed to be saving this
content for your paying subscribers and
he's right there's a lot of stuff that
took me here forever
like I this whole website might be
simple to some of you guys and you might
be like oh man I could do this right
away but to do everything how it was in
the design and make it responsive it
takes time okay and there's a lot of
details in here there's animations
there's a whole bunch of stuff that we
did to this website to make it look nice
right so there's a few hours into this
so Tyler is completely right time is
like oh yeah this should have been just
for your paints subscribers because it's
really good but at the same time this is
something that all of you guys need to
see all of you guys need to be building
your portfolio right this is what I call
like a freestyle portfolio where I just
came in I said okay I contacted the
designer designer said hey go ahead and
build it we built there for you guys and
I just freestyling right it wasn't a
something that we we planned it it
wasn't that I built before it or like
let's say a lot of instructors come in
and they build the projects themselves
before it and they have everything in
one screen that's already complete and
everything in the other screen is the
one that you get to see as he's copying
it for a long side of the screen to the
other that's not what I did on this
project this project straight freestyle
is just like me when I bump into roads
when I bump into a dead end you see me
going into the data and finding the
solution finding the way to build this
website sometimes I forget certain
syntax that's why it's there right it's
free for a reason right but at the same
time it's more of like a guide of
following how to build a portfolio and
at the same
time seeing how you know when you bump
into that dead end and you don't know
what to do you just don't stop him but I
okay I'm just gonna leave this alone
no you continue cuz in even though it
might take you three more minutes to
figure it out and how to find the right
position area right what technique from
CSS you should use for you know
different situations like those are the
things that you're gonna learn from this
and I decided you know what this needs
to be free because this is mostly a
freestyle like I really just came in
freestyle this whole thing all right
there was no I didn't prepare for it I
didn't come in and did anything else
besides just me looking at design and
building it with you guys it's like
one-to-one it's as if me and you were
there in the same room that's how I
decided to do it it wasn't pre-planned
it wasn't editing that the errors out it
wasn't a hole okay we're gonna cut out
the mistakes know is this is pretty much
just meeting you sitting down building
this portfolio okay now all of you guys
can definitely use this portfolio and
just give credit to the designer and
give credit to me just for helping you
out right now it's up to you I don't
even care about credit you decide if you
want to give me credit
you could put in it yourself and
whatever because in reality you built it
right you just helping me out at the
same time we both building it together
that's how I did this whole tutorial
this whole course okay now going back to
what you know Tiffany was saying here
you know it was like how is it that
collaborators work on github and
everything well pretty much it's like
okay you have github right so let's say
an example I created this this github
repo right I can give access to somebody
else to download the whole project
alright and then they could push their
changes into that project too so pretty
much like I could be doing the front end
you could be doing the back end right
what I'm doing the the back end well I'm
doing the front end and you're doing the
back end we communicate with each other
through sky
or emails and say hey I just finished
building the whole front page and then
you tell the the back-end developer I
hate could you build the rest API for
the project's on the portfolio and then
the back-end person comes in and creates
the the REST API where you can
communicate with it through either Ajax
or something like react angular whatever
you decide to use or just vanilla
JavaScript so it's like a way to
collaborate you can have as many people
as you want you know when you look at a
project like let's say react which has
i'ma tell you right now how many
contributors it should be okay
eleven hundred and sixty people are
working on this project okay so whenever
they see something on the issues they'd
be like okay somebody left the issue
here said oh this thing doesn't work on
Windows XP right it doesn't work on
Windows XP for whatever reason they go
in they figure it out they try it out
with Windows XP and they basically the
fix fix the changes push it up to the
website and then now somebody who is
responsible for the project checks their
branch and says ok this branch works and
this branch did not break anything on
the code right so if it didn't break
anything on the code what they do from
there is they merge it from that branch
to the main branch which is the master
branch and that's it
that's I mean that's like the simplest
way to to explain how people collaborate
with gay and github
like is it's not in crazy I haven't
really created a course on github or
having really explained it that well
here are either on my website or on
youtube because there's so many people
that have already done github you know
what I mean it's like github in and get
itself it's like you do one search on
online like get tutorial and you're
gonna see like that's like hey how do
you search on Google you get what I say
like it's that easy
like everybody has done it you know what
I mean so excuse me yeah man so like I
said you know check out the website
check out the new course that we
released on on our site coding face.com
and like I said this thing is free
you're getting a whole bunch of content
that's for you creating a great looking
website you get to see one to you CSS
grids when not to use it when to use
flex boxes like we use all of them in
this project right but at the same time
it's like you get to figure out when to
use it and when not to use it
now of course if you want to be just
like one of these hackers like if you
just want to be a hacker and be like hey
I want to use everything on the site CSS
great go ahead that's on you if you
wanna be one of those people is like hey
just because it came out yesterday and
now it's hot we just gotta build every
single thing and CSS great go ahead
everybody has their own their own way of
coding I'll teach it the way hard
teacher because it's the easiest way for
a beginner to understand it those of you
guys are more advanced then others
please don't complain please don't
complain it's really annoying
it's like people hit me I was like why
do you use this on this distance in this
and it's like bro you are more advanced
than somebody who's just starting are
these are the people that are beginners
are the people that don't know anything
so I have to make them in a way that
it's gonna be easier for them to
understand you know if I come in and
start explaining CSX upgrades and flex
boxes from scratch people is gonna be
like wait what like for us that we've
been here for a while this is easy for a
beginner the way how to do certain
things is like wait what you you adding
all of this extra knowledge all of this
extra information so my brain is about
to explode that's how people work so I
don't like to give people an overflow of
things one is I got such a beginner
project because I want to make sure that
number one they don't think like oh this
is
over my head I can't do it number two I
wanted to give up you know what I mean
so I have to take care of those people
that are just beginners okay so yeah man
and like I said everything here you can
figure it out your way if you say hey
man I got better ways to do it go ahead
do it right so yeah I love you guys man
and I'm out of here I'm out kids all
right so yeah it's a Tiffany Mann like I
said this this was a really good
question like how does it really work
with github and like how the recruiters
get to figure out which projects are
good you know just to go over it again
if you go to like song codes right you
got his getup you got his his main
projects these are the projects that he
wants to show for now mind you this
guy's not a beginner this guy has like
you know cool JavaScript projects and
that's why he hasn't on his his arm his
getup
it's not his his projects that he's
showing up when he's looking for a job
he already has a job he works for a
pretty big company in in Chicago so he's
good he's chillin you know what I mean
but for you guys you guys are in a whole
different level you guys are beginners
you guys are getting into the industry
so all of your projects here that you
pin should be like major projects that
you already have on your portfolio which
is your website like I said if you don't
have your you know websites here in your
portfolio and I start singing like all
this you know a little quick algorithm
to to sort out some phone numbers or or
like here here's a validation for
validation like guys people don't care
about that the recruiter don't give a
damn about that I'm being honest with
you guys the recruiter don't care about
that the recruiter don't get excited
about that because what they need to see
is that you already building real
websites and real projects that they
could say okay hey this guy he needs to
get hired and we believe him so when
they go to that company to tell him that
they're like okay this guy that we saw
their portfolio he's legit
they'll even lie for you like I've seen
it
the recruiters live for four you know
developers I've seen guys who are junior
developers somehow end up in like
$80,000 jobs or $90,000 jobs I've heard
stories of people in like San Francisco
getting like a hundred and ten thousand
dollar job on their first job right just
because they had those those right
projects on their portfolio and pretty
much the the recruiter came in and just
you know repackaged a you know put a
little big stamp on their back and say
hey man this guy is ready hire him
sometimes the recruiter will basically
give you such a big clout that in
reality it doesn't matter how how long
you've been working in the industry okay
so I'll see you guys later
superboy job back at it again coding
phase comm send me questions questions
guys and I'm sorry for everybody who's
using windows guys I've been telling you
for a long time you know people keep
telling me like hey man I'm having so
much trouble with Windows I can't even
get this this stuff running guys I've
been telling you guys from the beginning
this is not nothing new there's some
people that they're very comfortable
with their Windows computer it doesn't
matter if they were doing code that
we're doing other stuff that we're
probably you know hacking that we're
doing a Photoshop they were doing other
stuff I like you know I don't know doing
command line stuff on their Windows
computer I don't know what you're doing
Windows right but um they have an easier
route to becoming a web developer
because they already understand their
computer they understand how to find the
answers to things but I feel bad for a
lot of you guys who are just your
average Joe some regular do some regular
girl who was like hey man I'm again into
web development and yeah you can learn
HTML CSS and JavaScript but the more
advanced things you know even starting
the web developer starter kit you guys
are having so much issues because you
can't even install nodejs on our windows
right and that's because it's not that
easy people who who are
comfortable with windows and being
around fall on something is super easy
no it's not as easy as a Mac it's not as
easy as a Linux so let's be honest here
but yeah man send me questions I'll try
to help you guys out anything that you
guys might need let me know simple job
