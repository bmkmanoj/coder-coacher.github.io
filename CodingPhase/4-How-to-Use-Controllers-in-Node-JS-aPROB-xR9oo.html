joke back at it again man make sure you
subscribe and make sure you like this
video man cuz I'd do this for you guys
alright so we're gonna start with
controllers right how do you make a
controller very simple you basically run
this this command on your terminal right
so clear right alright so you run this
command ace make controller and then
what you do is you say hey we're gonna
do a pages controller no matter if I
just run pages right and then you click
enter what that does it creates the file
for you you click HTTP request that's
what you want you click enter and then
that created that file for you so that
file is right here right now we're gonna
make a change to the routes you're gonna
come here and we're going to do this I'm
gonna delete this and we're going to go
like this I'm gonna say pages controller
dot index alright because what we want
to do instead of us telling it from here
render the about page we're gonna do all
of this inside of the controller alright
so we're gonna switch this to get
instead of on we're gonna switch this to
get so it could be a get request for all
of them right now we're gonna save that
file alright right now let's see what
happens at the moment right now is
giving me an error saying ok undefined
method so what that means is we have to
create a method right here right so to
create a method we basically use es6
generator a function generator right so
what we do is this right what this is
saying this is a generator function
right and then what it's saying okay
this the name of the method which is the
index and then here we have a request
and we have a response
so we land on the page is going to run
the pages controller and is going to run
the index method so what that does is
saying okay I have this request give me
something so what you do is you give it
to them here right so you give it to
them here inside of the function you see
this this brackets that's how you know
you're inside of a function and then
you're basically saying hey the response
is going to be I'm going to send you
this view right now let's see what
happens
see now it's giving them the the view
the welcome page view right but another
thing that I want to do is I want to be
able to send it send to the view
basically the title and to post titles
to post titles right so we're
gonna do that by doing this you're gonna
come here you basically that's just an
object alright the other parameter here
of this function is just another object
right so we're gonna come in and say
blog title right I'm gonna say this
comma you wanna put in an array pose so
then we wanna come here you want to say
okay post one alright alright now that
we got those or basically those
variables that those variables are now
gonna be able to be seen in the view you
know and the only way to do that through
the template so we're gonna go back to
the Welcome page right and we wanna say
okay we named this one we named this
block title right so we're gonna put
this
so the blog content we're gonna say okay
curly braces blog title what that does
is yeah Joe's blog right so now let's
see what else what can we do was a blog
post so block pose alright so the reason
why I says to is because there's two two
titles in here right so what I'm doing
right now is basically running
JavaScript in the HTML pretty much in
the template so before the page loads
this runs in the server and basically
says okay get the title from the
controller and get the blog post so blog
poses this one you know
without it this is what's going to show
it's going to show both of them post one
post to right but what I want is two
lengths so how many are inside of that
array so it's going to give me two total
amount of posts I so remember that's how
controllers work is that simple right
you land on the page the controller
basically you know it gets to the route
and the route is you know the home page
now you're saying okay pages controller
run the you know the index method right
so you have this index method
there's don't pay attention this is
something that I'm gonna create next you
just showing you that you could actually
create multiple different you know
different methods for this right so I
could come in here and change this to
contact whatever I want right so
remember it comes to the pages
controller run start index method it
says okay here's a request
show me something so what you're saying
okay once this happens right here it
comes to it starts running the function
right so it comes running through the
function and then you basically you send
a response your responses go
be hey send the view welcome and inside
our view I want you to pass it this
variables alright so you have the blog
title and the blog post so pretty much
that's in then from there you come to
your view and then here it basically
shows you what you have you know your
blog title and your blog post and then
that's how you get you know basically
variables passed down through the
controllers right so it's that simple
alright guys so I'll see you in the next
