back at it again man coating face calm
your boy is backing out and did it again
listen guys yep
today's topic is if I had to take
another job what will be my dream job
what will be my dream job as a developer
right my dream job would be working
remote right
I think nobody likes core to work
doesn't matter if you love your job it
doesn't matter what it is nobody likes
the idea of having to go somewhere else
besides your house and stay there for
eight nine ten hours and a day away from
your family nobody likes that trust me
even if you love coding nobody likes
going away alright
that's one number two it would be a cool
language I don't know something like
crystal lang or Ruby on Rails crystal
angle or Ruby like I really love Ruby
I mean it's dying out I could say now is
dying out Ruby but oh yeah I really love
for a sake it's simple it's easy I love
how it looks this object-oriented
programming
yeah it's an amazing language and I love
it
and now I love crystal lang let me see
what else you know it has to be earning
at least a hundred thousand a year what
else has to be what a cool team guys who
are smarter than me I hate working with
people that I mean not that I hate him
but
I do enjoy when I'm not the smartest
person in the room because then that
means I got to learn instead of me
teaching like it's fun to teach but at
the same time if I want to be selfish
hey I want to learn I don't want to be
always doing teaching I want to learn
from somebody else so you know what I
mean so that's definitely one of those
requirements for dream jobs you know
working with people that know way more
than me so that I can learn I can step
my game up and yeah what else working on
a cool project you know the worst thing
is when you working on an old technology
guys when I really hate that I hate when
I'm working on old technology like an
old framework or old programming
language or like let's say you just like
fixing old cold legacy code and you know
and I want to create new stuff you know
that's what makes you happy well that's
what makes me happy when it comes to
work creating new stuff but let's see
yeah medicine that's definitely the the
things that I wish I had for you know
for a dream job those are like my
requirements
definitely remote working with cool
people working with something like Ruby
or crystal a
and working with really smart people
people dr. Mary from that's definitely
my requirements yeah man this video is
