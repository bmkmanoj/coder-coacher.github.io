again man : face calm some of you guys
know me from you know YouTube some of
you guys know me from chora some of you
guys know me from other forums like
Stack Overflow and basically the whole
community you know in general right I've
been doing this for about five years
professionally but I've actually been
making website since the age of fourteen
so I have a lot of experience I've
actually been doing it for a long time
so trust me when I tell you this I'm
here to give you the best experience for
you to learn HTML CSS and JavaScript
basically the foundation to what develop
me let me probably ask myself what am I
doing here what is this program what if
it's page what's going on right listen
guys I'm going to teach you how to build
a web page by basically building with
social network it reminds you of
something right well we're gonna leave
it at that but basically it's a social
network and just it's actually a little
bit better right than to other guys
alright so you know sometimes people
come in and they teach you with you know
websites that are a horrible looking
designs that are not up to par well I'm
actually going to teach you guys how to
build a great looking website right
straight from the design because this
how it is in the industry whenever you
work in a company most likely there's
going to be a designer those going to
come to you'll say hey this isn't design
that we basically came up with into me
the owners or the managers whoever it is
that's actually in charge of that
project and then as they did the final
design can you build this in HTML and
CSS and you're gonna come in and say
yeah I can actually do this all right
so let's start</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
