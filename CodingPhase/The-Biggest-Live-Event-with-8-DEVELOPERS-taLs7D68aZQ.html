Google hangout okay so whoever hasn't
been on the live stream has never done
this live with me come in come hang out
let's talk about code you get what I'm
saying like come chill don't be scared
we don't bite we just hang out this is
now I'm not trying to test here I'm not
trying to test your knowledge in code
like this is not what this channels
about this channels about you know
sharing stories you know answering
questions and you know helping people
out so react the laravel what you like
more I mean two different things but I
like react I like to work with react
because it's just cool
react is is pretty legit it's like you
could do phone applications you could do
you know like last night I'm working on
this new react native application that
I'm working on and I'm just setting
everything up
I think the setup takes longer than what
it needs to be but I'm just working on
it so this like
some simple stuff let me see if I have
it here
my stuff going on is pots of fries how
can you joined the stream man go to the
description the description of this
video you should see the link for it
okay let me see
it's going like super slow so yeah it's
like I was working and stuff it's like a
whole bunch of errors but I'm just
setting up some some things here I'm
basically I'm creating a new react
native course on the side what I'm also
doing to create the corrects of this app
man the Craigslist app is so deep guys
like if you guys haven't looked at it
before go check it out man like there's
so much working into that application
I'm also working on crystal I do a lot
of stuff guys like you know when people
come in and be like hey Joe you didn't
answer my email or you the answer
doesn't down I'm like bro I'm doing like
30,000 things at once man like I can't
really answer everybody but I don't get
that trash out of him listen fiasco is
garbage man you must be a Windows user
buddy I'm sorry you know I mean like hey
sorry Ramsey get that windows shitty ass
computer you know the ceased freaking
30s computer freaking 30s now get that
dough up out of here
yo man can you go over Tech interview
questions and scenarios I mean I'm not
gonna go over algorithms and bullshit
like that but like let's say stuff that
people's gonna ask you you know I was
like hey what are you interested on you
know as far as like development and from
there what you gotta give them is like
something cool to open their eyes so you
could say hey I'm into react I mean to
react native I'm into you know when I
was out there that's buzzing right
because it just shows them that you're
actually in the community and you wanna
get you know you want to get somewhere
within you know the community of web
development or programming right what
else they're gonna actually about your
job your job history like let's say
you've never worked before as a
developer you know that will ask you as
far as let's say your previous jobs even
though you've never worked as a
developer how can they relate to the
position that you're gonna be applying
to so like let's say for example I don't
know you worked at retail right you be
like hey I know how to work within a
team I know how to basically communicate
with others you know I'm very open to
taking criticism like those things are
very important when you're working in a
team of developers yeah so that's
something that you want to definitely
point out what else you know it all
depends of the position too if you're
going in for front-end
they might ask you things about
JavaScript you know what I mean like I
wasn't mad they don't you know what
exactly is the prototype you know let's
see what else something that probably
asks you I don't know to be honest like
I don't even know what do they ask like
I'm not gonna lie to you guys like what
exactly people ask every single junior a
there you go there you go a shout-out to
whoever donated on the super chat I
can't really tell coding connections
yelled thank you man I really appreciate
it
we hear man so listen um maybe promises
JavaScript promises they might ask you
about es6 you know like they might say
hey could you tell us about maybe three
new features that es6 yes explains in so
your your workflow and you might come in
and say hey yeah
yes six classes what else you could say
the dot map our arrow functions that's
it you got three of them
so you Gucci right what else I don't
know man this is a it's a whole bunch of
stuff that people could ask you you know
the old depends on the company and who
was actually interviewing you like let's
say if you were already an established
developer somebody who has a lot of
projects like they already know all the
stuff that you can do it right so what
they ask you is things that is related
to the project they'll be like hey
listen we have like for me I'm giving
you an A in a an example of like house
my interview right I don't know how your
interview will because I don't know how
junior developers can interview now in
days you know but let's say for me most
of the time and usually be like hey we
have this application you know how
comfortable are you with laravel you
know like I usually apply for positions
that are very specific I don't like to
apply for positions that say oh fern and
developer or Oh back-end developer I
don't like to apply to those positions
because I don't know exactly what is it
that they want me to do I like to apply
to positions that I'm already
comfortable with meaning hey if I'm
gonna apply to a job I'm gonna apply to
Lera I'm gonna apply to react I'm gonna
apply to angular I'm gonna apply to
let's say something like Python or
nodejs something that I've already
worked extensively right and I know
exactly what I'm applying to it sucks
when you apply to just a job that says
front-end developer is like okay what
does that mean what exactly is your
stack it doesn't really tell me anything
that I can come into the job
interview prepared right so I usually
just apply to the ones that are very
specific you know but yeah so the most
of the time they'll just ask me like hey
how comfortable you were react or how
comfortable are you with laravel let's
say if I'm a plan for like a react job
he'll be like hey how long have you been
working with JavaScript I'm like oh five
six years so they'll be like oh so
you're pretty comfortable and like yeah
I know like the back of my hand and then
usually I'll crack a joke you know what
I mean I'll crack a joke just to open up
the room a break the ice because
everybody usually is like number one if
you're a developer and you've got to go
into a job interview like oh man I got
work to do I gotta interview this guy I
don't know this guy you know what I mean
so if you come in comfortable you crack
a joke you you in there like you're one
of the boys that's what I do when I go
into a job interview I'm acting like I
said I worked there you know like I'm
talking about hey man like you've seen
the game last night seeing every game
some basketball game whatever something
something relatable right so you could
break the ice and you can feel at home
and they could feel at home with you
because now all the time is just about
the skills it's also about do you really
want to be working with this dude you
get what I'm saying like 99% of the time
most people that interview me they'll be
like yo we want to hire this guy that's
one of the reasons why I don't like to
go to job interviews because unless I
really want the job because all the time
if I go to a job in two don't give me an
offer and a lot of times I'm like I
don't know if I want to work there you
know what I mean so well I'm in a
different situation than most of you
guys like I'm comfortable where I'm at
you never know saying so it's like it's
hard for me I'm not gonna come here and
lie to you guys and be like oh one of
these youtubers like this is what you
got to do you go in there put your back
straight you you know you go in there
give them a smile like no like I'm not
going in there you're gonna say like
like I don't know what to tell you you
know to help you out as far as like the
interview all I could say is do
exactly what I've already been telling
all of you guys half solid projects so
your skills cannot be questioned right
when you go in there to a job
interviewing all you have is a github
page then that shows that all the
develop person and the people that are
interviewing you is that basically
you're going in there and they don't
know what's your skills they don't know
what companies you work for they don't
know if you could actually do the job so
what they're gonna do is they're gonna
come in and test you with a bunch of
bullshit like a bunch of algorithms a
bunch of dumb questions of like how many
objects
how many methods does Java Script have
like you get what I said somebody might
be an asshole and just ask you some
crazy shit like that you know and that's
because they just don't know who you are
they don't know like what what work have
you done what projects do you have you
know people show up with little projects
that they've done in courses right and
that don't even look like real or like
like real life businesses you know
that's why I focus on all my courses or
whatever to Tory I'm working on so give
you guys like real life experience like
a project that looks like a real website
that you would do for a business right
so you could actually show it to a
developer or employer and be like hey
man this is the type of work that I do
don't test my skills you know what I
mean that's that's my route that's the
route that I take you know there's
people is gonna tell you out there but
like oh study every algorithm on the
Under the Sun do it this and that
freaking spent two weeks studying
JavaScript like you don't have to do
none of that stuff I'm being honest if
you go in there secure and you go in
there like yo listen this the projects
that I've done this is everything that
you're gonna have me do at this position
and you can see all these projects do
that that means I can do the work so
don't tell me with anything like I don't
need to be here I mean but that's my
attitude I are going to places I'm just
gonna be like yo I just don't need to be
here you know I love coding but I just
don't need to be at the job and be like
oh like now it's like I don't know how
explain it to you guys no it sounds like
a little bit cocky or like an asshole
move but when you get to a certain level
it's like I know I'm hot you know I mean
it's like you know you have skills that
not everybody else has right like I work
hard I busted my ass I still code a lot
I still work on a lot of different
projects I even teach you guys you know
what I mean like if I wouldn't know all
of this stuff I wouldn't be even show my
face to be teaching it you don't say so
if I go to a job interview I'm going in
my head already I'm like bro don't even
try to test me with anything like you
see all the things I'm doing I'm
teaching people online
I'm freaking doing every project that
you could throw me from e-commerce too
flashy digital agencies to video games
through html5 games like I've done it
all like you don't test me with shit if
you warn me the moment you start testing
that means I don't need to be there
because you don't trust my work and
that's it that's just me being straight
up
but anyway so anything else man let me
see yeah man
share my share my videos when I share
with the people man share with the squad
whenever you see people out there that's
just the truth man and there's a lot of
developers are like that man like it's
like right now like what's the guy's
name
the I forgot his name but he's the
creator of homebrew right excuse me he's
the creator of homebrew a tool that
everybody in the world uses a tool that
that that freakin that how cool is that
a tool that everybody uses a tool that
every single person that's Under the Sun
that has a Mac has to use to install
programs and you know a whole bunch of
services right and he went to a job
interview in Google and they started
asking him a whole bunch of questions a
whole bunch of algorithms shit and the
guy's like yo bro like I don't need to
be here like if you if you
planning on treating me like a new like
a new guy keep your job you get what I
say like you know what I mean so it's
crazy
listen man joined the livestream man the
link is right down on the description
guys the link is right there in the
description you click the description
you click there and that will bring you
directly to the thing so yeah what's
this guy's name homebrew let me see
homebrew creator rejected by google
right now
there's like there's like somebody else
who who wrote this then I yell 90% of
engineers used theirs like Google's this
Google's like sort of answer is like hey
90% of our engineers use the software
you wrote homebrew but you can't infer a
binary tree on a whiteboard so fuck off
there's like that's how Google treats
treats people who are like talented like
sometimes he came in you know
let me see where is it I can't find it
you
you
yeah his name is max hawa like
also he write this so this is like his
thing
so basically the guy he's just talking
about he's like yo he created this this
amazing app that everybody uses so it's
like you would think like hey he's
already smart dummy like don't try to
test him with some dumb shit you don't
know saying like
you know it's crazy but sometimes you
gotta have pride in this world you know
what I mean like you don't need this
companies you know what I mean like if
somebody comes in but hey Joe we're
gonna hire you for Google or Blake I
don't know I don't know if I want to
commit to that you know what I mean like
I don't know if I want to be going into
office I don't know if I want to be
doing meetings I don't know if I want to
be doing all this stuff when I'm doing
so much other cool stuff that most
Google developers are not even doing so
it's like why would I sacrifice myself
and my personal time to dedicate myself
to another company that I'm not even
honored that you know like I don't own
that so it's like when you think about
it I mean so I'll Gucci so yeah man let
me see was good was good was good was

got the kids straight from school we got
your boy in the office frozen
here once again we got your boy sonic
somebody don't need a helpful to him he
is back your boy Sonic and your videos
your boy Joe back at it again coding
face.com
your boys all your damages wheel it
right now man I'm gonna sure got by the
way coming here like I'm on that sauce
Dunkin Donuts you owe me a check send me
a budget you dick so we in here man so
what's good man damn we got one two
three four five six seven eight eight
developers let me know who could do that
nobody could do that man all your boy
Joe go really just bringing everybody in
here we got the community you guys hear
me yeah Ramsey John is like having a
cell where man week we coming up in this
world man let me see if I can set up
this just make sure my mic is working
follow me let me go to this this event
because for some reason I don't have I
don't have control my own event so let
me see am is the event
let me see coding the phase live with
the subscribers it was the thing as this
one live dashboard
I gotta check this out whole oh we gotta
we gotta set this up so it was good guys
what you guys is up to man man where do
I begin
well
a lot bro a lot you gonna kick it off
Sonic yeah so I tried like a lot of
different uh backends
I've tried nodejs I've tried Django I
tried PHP whoa PHP yeah boy
I tried I tried all that's what's up man
I mean how comfortable are you with the
front end um
so I'm familiar with the basics of
JavaScript but I'm taking it to a much
higher level with es6 getting familiar
with arrow functions generators promises
stuff like that yeah I think Joe had a
video on this Joe when did you release
that video it was uh believe it was on
like transferring it to back-end you
said it was better tab like a pretty
good understanding of JavaScript before
we went ahead and got to the backend
stuff what do you think about Sonics
problem there yeah I think personally I
think like you gotta first like be
comfortable with just the basics like
the backend you could go into the
backend and like let's say for example
you do HTML CSS right I could give you a
design and you could build anything out
of it right if you can build anything
out of that design with HTML CSS that
means you're ready to move on to your
JavaScript right now with JavaScript
once you understand the basics of
programming with JavaScript you know
adding classes removing elements adding
elements you know changing text stuff
like that like the basics right there
from there my advice is to jump into PHP
right because web development is between
the front end and the back end right so
once you understand like the basics of
the front end which is everything that I
just mentioned then you want to jump in
to the back end and say hey
I want to be able to understand how to
render a page how to use a database how
to use coaching sessions right so to be
able to do that right you you have to
actually be able to understand just the
basics of the backend so PHP is perfect
for that I'll be right back it's that
going try to try to close up maybe you
have another window another YouTube
window just you might want to mute the
YouTube yeah yeah that was the problem
yeah so if if you have two YouTube
window open just make sure you mute it
oh my bad yo my bad real quick though or
the dreaded dev said he had a special
date with his lady does so he couldn't
make it yeah wife you say yo I'm gonna
do you I'm gonna do your dress tonight
come home you say you say i'ma do your
dress tonight I got you know one thing
that you mentioned no bro um I agree
though getting familiar with JavaScript
like getting really good at it because
there's so many frameworks in people get
caught up real easily you know you know
I I took a lot of courses on um you know
just trying to understand like
frameworks and everything but without
that foundation of JavaScript there's
not really much you can do like you can
learn JSX you can learn how to you know
you know how that works and everything
but you need jobs given order to
actually implement it well so I learned
my lesson when it came to that you know
I'm just strictly focusing on JavaScript
vanilla JavaScript and I'm focusing on a
query I know you know angularjs
available react is available but and - I
feel like until you get really good
which we know the JavaScript then you
focus on those uh those frameworks yeah
definitely man I agree with that sonic
try to explore a little bit of like you
know making API requests a little bit of
object-oriented stuff with a node
is definitely not definitely gonna help
when you get to the other frameworks I
mean you can if you've got a good
understanding of Anila jsut could pretty
much jump into any framework that you
might want to learn but not get too
caught up in the whole framework fever
because you know there's a new type like
Joe says all the time there's a new shit
the Harry Potter framework will come out
tomorrow I mean it's the same thing um
was doing courses cuz I i I've done like
at least eight courses based so I'm like
front-end web development I've done a
lot of courses but what happened with me
was once I did those courses I stopped
like practicing for a while because I
felt like oh I know this is no big deal
you know I could take a break from it
but that's the whole point in JavaScript
is you're supposed to actually practice
it's not just about doing the projects
and the courses you gotta actually put
into practice and create you know actual
projects so yeah and that was my fault
you know cuz um again like you know
courses what they what they do is they
allow you to feel as if you're kind of
comfortable with everything but in order
to actually get like a full
understanding of JavaScript I think it's
really important to actually build stuff
on your own so everything that Jill's
been saying up to this point you know
I've agreed with it you know yeah i mean
i i've been following joel for a while
and everything he said since i got my
first internship it's been pretty
spot-on right now we're using Ruby on
Rails at my internship and you know I
wonder when when I first started what
coding people were saying you know
Ruby's is that Ruby's dead you know but
then I started following Joe and you
know like there for junior developers
there's there's always people hiring for
Ruby on Rails especially in my area
right now I'm in Boston so you know I
actually fell victim to that though um
like looking at articles online you know
and just like you know people always
talking about oh no js' is this is that
this soul is highly performant its
I feel like it's too it's too new right
now mm-hmm
and some people also mentioned golang so
I started checking out golang and
actually all actually agree with Joe uh
it was this course on on golang like web
development with go by Tom McLeod and I
tried like I tried like at least eight
times to take his course and try
something stand it I just couldn't get
bro that's like the the worst the worst
course that anybody could see and I
loved the guy the guy the guy is super
cool the guy is super nice and and even
sent me a message I have made a video
about the course of me reviewing it and
how bad it was and I was like you know
what like this is not for the format of
self-taught developers people who are
just starting and getting into this
industry the format that he had was like
it might be good for somebody who is
like a computer science major right but
most of those guys they're not learning
online on on udemy so it's like it's a
disconnect with the audience the people
that are really buying your course are
people who are beginners guys who are
coming you know hey man I'm a mechanics
today I'm trying to get the hell out of
here you know what I mean like those are
the people that are really buying udemy
courses so you want to create a course
that is gonna go for their audience and
I felt like that course alone was like
the worst one cuz it's like everything I
felt like I was in school again like I
was in college again and just reading
off from the slides and and just like
everything the whole structure is I
broke that's not how people learn online
you know what I mean like is it is great
for material for like a six-months
material where you come in and say okay
I'm gonna spend an hour on this on this
course you know for this semester before
a a course that you like I'm gonna spend
20 hours into this I'm trying to learn
everything that I need I don't want to
learn how to help the bites once in zero
got mixed together I'm trying to go that
deep like you know what I mean you don't
even know if you really wanted
you know what I mean like you don't even
know if you really want to be a
developer and do this out here throwing
you like ones and zeros and hexadecimals
and it is a bro calm down like this our
online course if I want this I'll go to
a computer science major you know I mean
exactly it's like I understand why in
college they teach you that in if you
take a computer science major but online
people are not looking for that people
are looking to learn the framework learn
the language I don't need a history and
when was the first time that this lady
from the Navy created programming
language I don't care bro you gotta say
like you could keep that you know keep
you know where you're from Jose from JC
your boy straight from the gutter
straight from straight from Newark where
you cross the street you might get shot
straight from you know right next door
from the freakin what was that show on
TV right next door to the Jersey Shore
your boy Jose was good oh we got oh way
from the West Coast we got your boy
straight from Arizona
once again the boy scorned all actor was
good man everybody else was going on I
actually agree with what Joe was saying
earlier though about you know the
computer science degree
like I went to school for computer
science and none of the crap that I do
us but I do I work it's actually what I
learned in school so I was kind of like
this there's a huge disconnect about
what computer scientists and development
you know what I mean so really like the
majorities that I learned like web
development I had to learn it on my own
but I didn't learn that shit in school
right yeah well say what happened you
care man
oh no I was just doing to say it's a
piggyback on a few I took a computer
science core or a computer science
science in college and I learned
anything pretty much I've learned all
the stuff on my own so I'm just being
back off you that you know what you're
saying is pretty much true so it's
actually related to I mean I I learned
to program I learned to code like you
know how to write a little loop and here
and there but how you put a whole web
application together that's the new
t-shirt new merchandise coming soon you
know st. Joe st. Joe ah you know kumbaya
aka yo kumbaya you did there like Joe
noser what would you do you know what I
mean you know but yo listen to go back
to what frozen and Sonic we're talking
about basically as far as like jumping
into the back end basically listen once
your your your basically you know the
front end you know the basics of front
end right you know front end development
I could give you a design build whatever
one of the biggest mistakes that people
do is like hey they try to master
JavaScript in one shot it doesn't work
like that you got to give yourself time
you got a
build applications and as you find the
problems you find the solutions and then
you black oh wow what I just solve right
now I could have never done three months
ago because your brain wasn't working
that way your brain wasn't in that state
of mind of like oh this how JavaScript
works this how objects work you know etc
right and then one of the biggest
problems that I notice is when people
come in and they focus just on
JavaScript and don't don't even touch
the backend they don't even understand
how Ajax works between the front end and
the back end right you could say I'll
skim through everything through every
single framework out there and then
somebody tells you how cool we need you
to connect it to the API get this data
display in a table and some people
they'll be like oh why I don't even know
how this works if you know how in the
backend of the developer actually builds
the JSON for you for you to receive it
in the front-end then you understand
okay this how I want my the API to work
like you who actually tell the developer
hey I want you two to have a JSON data
that that works like this and it has a
an object here it has an array here
you know so things could be easier for
you you know it's weird but a lot of
people don't don't even know that so
they just focus just on the front-end
instead of saying okay once I um I know
the basics of the front-end I have to
learn the basics at the backend you know
in PHP is perfect for that you know I
wouldn't tell somebody go learn with
nodejs as your first back-end experience
because there's so many errors and so
many problems and so many different
libraries there's a million libraries
that do the same thing but which one is
the right one to choose so now you spend
more time looking through blocks looking
through tutorials and now understanding
what's happening and the worst thing
about it is that everybody in JavaScript
does it differently what you gotta
understand nobody there's really no
consistency I can build an application
in react I could build an application
with no GS the quote/unquote of myrn
stack and everybody has a different
folder starts area everybody has a
different way of naming the components
or where they put their settings where
they put their environment of
environment keys like there's no
consistency so it's a junior developer
you're constantly looking at this and
you're like oh wait which one is the
right one I learned this on ho steel I
learned this on Steven Grady I learned
this one on Joe but which one is the
right one now when you choose something
like PHP and laravel everybody who uses
PHP Arabelle they code the same way so
no matter who's teaching it to you
they're all teaching you the same thing
so it's like now your brain who actually
grasped the ideas in the different
content that there has but if you're
constantly looking for which one is the
best one you're not learning either the
the concepts you're not learning how to
code and you're not learning to build
any applications cuz you more spending
more time looking for which one is the
best way to do it you get what I'm
saying
so as junior developers my advice is
focus on PHP at first or Ruby on Rails
things that have been proven or even if
you are if you love your Windows
computer and your windows guy go learn
net this probably more jobs and donating
anything else out there you get what I'm
saying but you have to be a certain type
of person to work with net dotnet is not
for the guy who wants to be creating
cool startups is not for the guy who
wants to come in and be like oh I want
to be in a cool trendy company no you're
going to a spa if you're a developer
most of the companies is like hell you
see people with the same blue shirt the
same the same slacks the same shoes
everybody got a little pen right here
you know what I mean and then the other
thing right here they have their ID and
everybody talks like this is hi buddy
how you doing is like if you're isn't it
you you know what I mean if you want to
join that community thing and you're one
of those people they not nests all about
what type of company you were what I
work for it's all about what's your
environment whatwhat's happenin
vironment you'd like to be in if you
want to be in a trendy environment in an
environment that brings in new new ideas
you know like that's how you choose a
programming language or like as far as
the backend which one to choose you know
choose the one that fits to your
personality in your type of community
that you want to join you know yourself
free food man yeah I like to add a
little bit to what Joe mentioned so I
built crud applications in all three PHP
nodejs and I'm also a Python Django and
I want to say the reason why I did that
was because I was like but my mind fell
like it was going in different
directions because I would read you know
on online like should I learn PHP should
I learn note should I learn this and
that and so what ends up happening is
even though you're doing that it's like
kind of like you kind of like wasting
your time because you're it's like you
kind of know just the basics of all
three but you haven't really tackled you
know one and just actually you know did
you know more than just you know the
basics so one thing I want to say though
is that to be honest how I would choose
a framework how I would choose a
framework would be if you're looking for
like a job or something I would just
take a look at that instead of just
always reading articles and stuff
because I fell victim to that constantly
reading Quora you know trying to you
know just fit with the hipsters and you
know do what they're doing no js' I will
be honest I underestimated it it's hard
you know it's easy when you're doing it
with the instructor on video but as far
as trying to memorize how to do
everything from scratch that's hard I
promise he'll PHP PHP isn't too bad I
would say that Python Django is pretty
easy to learn
um also I have I don't have any
experience with Ruby but I'm definitely
inserted in it because Joe kept
mentioning as far as JavaScript is
concerned no I just wish that we could
just be able to use the language I wish
it was kind of a little bit more like
Java for it you can just import what you
need without so many new frameworks
being created um I wish it was a lot
more like that cuz there's just like
thousands perhaps millions of frameworks
they're available for JavaScript I just
wished there were just like it was a
little bit more curved to be more fit
from just being able to uh you know just
use the language without having to
depend on so many frameworks and you
know so many different api's and stuff
like that um but as far as um you know
web development so sorry I would just
choose what I would just choose
depending on my location and you know
the jobs or stuff that are available and
I really pay attention to all this stuff
because you might be in an area where
Ruby is really hot you might be in that
type of Korea so but I do have
experience with all three and I will say
that I believe that um yeah you should
just choose what you know like which
jobs are available for whichever snack
that you're interested yeah now that you
guys mentioned it man I'm definitely
gonna you know try to learn PHP for the
backend
I really haven't touched up on the
backend yeah and I think you know I mean
I know JavaScript and I feel like no
note is still all over the place so I
think PHP is more grounded right now so
that's definitely where I'm probably
just you know gonna start learning there
what do you think about that job you
think that's a yeah I think right now if
you look if you are doing your developer
right you already have your internship
right so they're already a company
already trusting you right so that's
gonna once you start going to the job
force it's gonna look good for you you
know what I mean
so from there what you want to do is
look in your area find out
where are the jobs right if you see
despite on a lot of Python developers
over there then do Python right but most
likely which you gotta find us a lot of
PHP jobs right
so if PHP is hot in your area then what
I will say how long some somebody's out
here being will be inside no homo hey
but yeah but my fault
so anyway so going back sorry malformed
immature okay
Oh but yeah so going back to the topic
so pretty much with PHP find in your
area which one is the one that you know
it's popular there and the one does that
people are hiring now as far as PHP PHP
is just great because you could go in
there and find jobs quick there's so
many different companies that need a PHP
developer
let's say there might be a company there
that they created our website seven
years ago right seven years ago and they
need just a developer who's gonna go in
there ask some extra features you know
you might not be working on like the
coolest laravel framework or you know
whatever's new right but it gives you
the opportunity to say okay I got hired
now in the next six months to the next
year now I have this company behind me
where I say hey I worked at XYZ comm and
they hire me for a whole year and now
I'm looking for a job and it looks even
better when you're still working for the
company and you're looking for another
job because it means that you're not
fired or you out and quick it just means
like now you're looking for new
opportunities you know somebody told me
the other day like Joe you know I hear
your story that you was working at a
company for like three months and then
you quit don't that look bad and I'm
like no it doesn't look bad because you
know why because my first job I was
getting $13 an hour I know I should have
been getting paid way more money than
that but I nobody was gonna trust me so
I'll say whichever job gives me the
first opportunity I'm
thank you and as I'm still working there
I'm gonna apply to other places it
happened that the first job was just $13
okay who cares I got the opportunity I
got there my resume I got that step
there from there all I had to do was
just keep on applying cuz I know I had
but the skills I already know what I
could do is just I needed to find the
opportunity now what do I do
do I stay home and be broke have no
money it's better to have $13 in your
pocket then you haven't nothing you
gotta say a lot of there a lot of
developers that are coming into this you
know unless you you're in a situation
where you have you have family you have
kids you have a lot of overhead you say
man in my job I'm already getting 70
grand I can't leave this for anything
less that's that's on you you switching
careers you get what I'm saying like
that's on you you're in that predicament
but if you are a junior developer who's
like 20 years old 25 years old even 30
years old no kids no responsibilities
take that pay cut do that shit for three
months and be like yo I'm out you know
what I mean once once that another
company comes in and offers you what you
need to be getting paid then you get out
of there because companies actually like
it when a developer is working at
another company because it shows them
that oh he's already working there you
got our saying so it's like they already
trust him he has the skills and if he's
trying to leave is because he's looking
for a better pay and a better
opportunity so now because he's a great
developer is better for us to snatch him
than us having to look online and start
finding guys that don't even have a job
yet you know you know Joe I got a quick
question all right so so now that I have
this internship I have this guy that's
messaging me so when I was looking for a
job he interviewed me and he sent me a
rejection letter but now that I have
this internship he wants to hit me up
and say hey listen I know you Congrats
on the internship is it okay if we
re-interview you for
coming opportunity at the company you
got what you think I should go for that
or what's your take on I mean the type
the type of person that I am I'm pretty
petty like right that's what I was no
I'm petty poppins you know what I mean
like I go I'll go in there like you're
bad thing you didn't know me now how are
you all yeah yes that's the problem cuz
they it's a big difference you you
should try to talk to them I don't know
if you really want the company right
like right now if you're going you know
it's like let's say some crazy company
let's say NASA right NASA passed down on
you two years ago
and then now they call you of my yo what
up you coming through that's nicer you
know what I mean like that's NASA you
you'll be like nice I'm coming back
right but yeah but if it's like it was
like you know no Johnny selling freaking
selling glasses online saying is his
little bullshit sneakers on an
e-commerce website as I broke like I'm
getting way better opportunities in you
like you passed out well you passed on
me is like now I passed on you there's a
at the end of the day yeah while I was
gonna say just a lot of times people
come in and what they try to do is like
they could either see you as desperate
meaning like that's freeway there but I
oh you remember that kid that came in
six months ago you know was like we only
have enough for like 30,000 you know
what let's call him he's desperate let's
try to get him back in and it's like
that's how they try to play you you know
so when you go back in they're not gonna
give you like a good position that I'm
gonna give you something that you're
gonna be like oh I'm getting a good pay
it's most likely something where there's
I oh now we have a little extra budget
well we was gonna pay fifty sixty
thousand dollars to a developer let's
pay him thirty thousand he could do the
job you know so that's what their only
advice it's very telling it's very
telling that they did that you know yeah
man
when they ass a little bit when it out
when it happened I'm just idea there's
no waiting fuckin how manly man be you
have so much power like you can work for
pretty much anyone who needs to develop
her and you can even free line it's like
just so much you can do so if his
company's like oh you don't want you for
both a lot like okay cool move on to the
next one yeah look my advice for
everybody out here is you know when you
you start looking for your job if you
don't have if you don't have the
experience and haven't worked for any
company yet right your first job for a
second job you're super humble go in
there humble do everything that you know
if there's a senior developer it gives
you advice go in there take it you know
they want to hire you take it right but
you gotta understand after Wow after you
already have your skills and you know
where you can do you have to give
yourself that value where you gotta say
hey man like like I don't need you like
I like I go outside I bump over jobs you
know I knees like I'm tripping over jobs
I'm like god damn it get off me you know
what I mean so like that's how it is you
know once you have the skills you have
all the things that that you need to be
successful as a developer you know it's
like whatever you know in the beginning
you gotta take the jobs cuz you just
need that first job everybody who hasn't
worked as a developer needs that first
job you guys have you guys seen the
advertisements where's this asian dude
he's like that's where is that
technology now he's he's everywhere man
he's everywhere
we must be really good though because
they wouldn't want to split his salary
with two other people a question for
whoever has some input how important is
it to learn SEO because I've been
applying to a lot of jobs lately
and a lot of them I've been wanting to
meet no ser OSU oh yeah it depends what
exactly is it that you're gonna be doing
in a lot of times when people come in
with OS vo this SEO that SEO is bullshit
man
Google puts up whatever they want
nowadays you know people that thing like
oh this is how you get to the front page
listen nowadays Google puts whatever
they want on the front page right there
they make their money from actually
getting people to pay for advertising
and get to show up on the top of the
Google searches right now as far as CEO
for a developer what you gotta know is
all your meta tags right put it in your
meta description meta keywords which
nowadays doesn't mean anything um also
too you know I'm not gonna say on all
your images you gotta put alt tag you
know and put in the information if it's
like let's say you're building a website
for a like let's say a car a car
dealership right you want to make sure
that in every image there's the alt tag
that has a title for what type of image
it is right let's see what else you want
to also want to make sure that you use
all the the right titles like let's say
h1 to h6 depending on how important the
title is if if it's like the most
important the most important title or
the most important thing that you want
to focus about our article or a page
that should be an h1 tag there's like a
whole bunch of little things that you
can learn that literally in like five
minutes
you go in and put just say yes to be
honest buster so um any
yeah pretty intricate like it goes
pretty deep so and that's like it's
filled on so I was like yeah just say
yes just be like yo let's say yes you
know I mean like somebody comes in you
know SEO yes that's it move on Nega so
yo Joe got a question nothing what do
you think these cats be doing I'd be
seeing guys going to seminars for SEO
man I'd be seeing I'm like going into a
building like oh yeah we gonna learn SEO
what what are they doing detects a niche
niche business man it's like people that
show up to like a man how to buy a house
with zero down payment and it's like is
is like how to buy a house with no
credit no nothing with this show no
money down just show up you know it's
like like those are the people that show
up to those listen man I know whatever
there was a company that I used to work
for and one of the guys they used to
come in he was like whatever he he's
like a unknown SEO guy but he's known
for it for things that were very popular
before right like I did like after Panda
there was an update called panda that
Google did I just messed up every
business out there before people used to
have keywords on their website alt tags
they used to have our fake little
bullshit Twitter account and shit like
that so become you know in the top 10 of
like the front page of whatever keyword
that they searching right so this guy
would work for them and then he worked
part time not part time but his company
was a consultant to our company right
and he will be like oh this
is how your you become popular on on
Google and this this and that and then
we will be like yo like what is this guy
talking about like he this guy doesn't
know anything because nowadays all of
the things that people you know the so
quote-unquote gurus of SEO know that
shit works no more so now their services
is only for the people that they used to
have right that you used to be like oh I
used to get you into in the top you know
top ten of the fucking fuck the front
page but in reality that doesn't exist
no more that doesn't fucking work you
know it just doesn't because Google does
whatever they want the algorithm nobody
knows the algorithm nobody knows how
things show up in the front page besides
the obvious have a catchy title have a
you know everything that's gonna be the
page about having in the description
that's about it that's all we really
know Google does whatever they want you
know what I mean so don't even worry
your focus on SEO man your job as a
developer you don't have to be even
thinking about that like you know it's
like they're gonna come in and ask you
know make sure you put the alt tags in
and make sure you put this dissing down
it's like okay cool I'll add it you look
at the Ducks rhyming clean yeah exactly
you think it's like writing frickin
regular HTML taxes like that you've
already been doing so there's like you
know what I mean yeah
which to UM mentioned before about PHP
yeah yeah I I agree so I just saw I was
just checking on our freelancer and I
typed in all the different backends
typed in nodejs Python etc and the
number of jobs for node I was I believe
was like five hundred and something but
for PHP it was like six thousand and I
was like whoa yeah you blew my mind bro
like
like I know like maybe some people
they're like oh I don't I don't like PHP
because I hear that people were already
developed don't like PHP so I'm not
gonna learn it but actually like PHP is
what's up cuz yeah here where I'm at
right now like there's a lot of jobs in
like Java and shit but its legacy
applications that were written like in
Java 6 so if you know Java you could get
a job there fairly easy yeah there's a
lot of PHP jobs don't get me wrong but a
lot of the times it's like they require
you to know so many other crops pop of
you know whatever you're doing not for
you to say like oh ok I know this I know
this framework I know that frame what
they tell you they give you a lesson
framework that you know the day when you
tell them you know it's the same thing
like if you know if you know Java and
you can learn c-sharp
ferny easy what sample right if you tell
that's where we could either be like but
if you talk to a higher man or someone
that develops you know they know the
code so they know you can learn it but
recruiters don't see that so if you
don't pass that barrier you don't pass
that barrier yeah that's why I always
tell people you gotta you gotta like do
the research of like what's out there
right and number one like a lot of times
you might see something on another
scription of a job and that job might
come in and they might tell you hey
let's say for example some sounds you're
killing me with the sounds like my bad
but yeah so what I was saying was like
yo if you go into a job right to a job
interview or even before you even get to
sorta job interview you dealing with the
HR right number one you always want to
make sure to look at the description
find out all the things that they have
they're like this frameworks that you
might say like let's say for example you
might have taken react right and
somebody might come in and tell you
and let's say the Betty Boop framework
right when when you show up right the
next thing you know is like you look at
it you don't have to know it you look at
it you know this they can't be a lot of
the same concepts that react has so if
somebody comes in and tells you oh do
you know the Betty Boop framework and
you'll be like oh yeah I know it it's
like yes like I just ran into that
situation you know what I mean like just
say yes because that's always trying to
explain earlier I just wish that instead
of like creating framework out the
framework they could just somehow you
know add this stuff directly into the
language you know cuz i enjoyed
javascript like I enjoy pure JavaScript
I wish that we could almost like to run
involved and actually you know framework
says it seems like they're always making
new frameworks yeah that's what I'm
saying look you go to a job posting
right the job posting you open it up
you're like oh cool there's five jobs in
my neighborhood you open it up next
thing you know it says no Jay yes Python
PHP asp.net ASP Pro ASP or whatever the
core or freaking jama Lisp what else are
Perl
Haskell binary ones and zeroes do you
know ones and zeroes like they give you
a whole list of the whole history of
programming right they give you the
first the original freaking programming
language to like the latest whatever
that just popped up right so you got
this whole list and then when you go
into the interview you you go in you
talk to the person you have all your
little nice little portfolio so now you
got through the the bullshit recruiter
now you go to your job in so you do your
job interview when you go in there then
they tell you that oh yeah the job is
PHP is like so what fuck you put all
this shit in there you have me nervous
you get what I'm saying like you go in
there with
wait cold sweats guys is like hold on
man do I remember everything from Java
so now even like that you constantly
like trying to study a whole bunch of
different languages and you get there
saying oh yeah you was gonna do PHP like
you could've just put that shit on the
top I said there's a lot of issues
actually I've seen that a lot of times
would they'll be like all years for
future future examples we later or we
might you know might want you to do some
nodejs and isn't that when I learned no
js' was because I was going to a job a
job interview right because they say oh
we need somebody who knows no Jes and I
really wanted to get this job right I
learned no js' I busted my ass did the
whole thing I was there for like two
years I never touched nodejs in my whole
fucking life so what was the point of
then I owe you for future reference you
know maybe let down the line we're gonna
we're gonna do some nodejs
and joe it's like that for every job
that happens every job every job on a
platform like that it's really really
misleading yeah and I mean and not just
programming jobs I mean any kind of job
it's like that you know they'll be like
all you need to know this you need to
know that you know what you're working
with companies with government
clearances and stuff like that
you show up they're like you gonna be
doing that net learn nowadays a job if
there's like 60% of it that I know I
apply and Danny other arrests love it
they can just try me on it thing about
it is it's like you know you're not
gonna meet every requirement that they
ask for but you have like say 5% of what
they're asking for
I'll even push 50 percent it may just
take a chance on you so you know it's
good to just apply anyway you may never
know how the you know the tides of turns
as far as I'm concerned yeah no I agree
with you on that I definitely agree with
you on that because it's like there's no
way you know everything you don't know
saying like sometimes people come in and
be like yo they trying to test you on
every single language and every single
thing that's under the Sun and it's like
yeah bro like I'm not gonna be doing
this shit on the job you know what I
mean like that's why sometimes I get
pissed over
I see it as a game like um like let's
say interview I'll see this like a
medium right some asshole goes and
writes down 30 questions that he will
ask somebody to see to test them to see
if they know JavaScript right that's
that you do so that dude is a JavaScript
snob so so it's like so it's like you
know what I mean it's like there's
certain questions in there that okay
that every developers should know if for
the position that you're applying to
that you should know those things but
then you find yourself in situations
where you're doing things like let's say
or in the the interview questions online
or medium whatever that nobody needs to
know I mean you could know it right if
you want to be like there's like you
know it's like a fun fact do you know
this about JavaScript it's like cool
people know that right but it's not the
the you know the estimate you know what
is it and whatever like it's not the
fucking ending of this shit like you
have these questions that don't die
you're not gonna be needing for your job
they should just ask you like regular
questions a lot of times because there's
a problem like let's say I know this
because even my last company I was
working with that we was about to do
interviews in and people was like you
know what questions should we ask them
sure so we asked them like you know some
algorithms we should we ask them some
stuff that you know to really test them
to see if they could do the job and I'm
like I'm just gonna ask them about the
things that they're gonna do on the job
if you guys want to ask any crazy stuff
that's on you guys but I'm just asking
exactly what we're gonna be doing so you
know in my sequel
yeah do you know my sequel do you know
um that do you have any type of history
with dealing with security online do you
know about you know do you know about
react do you know about es6 do you know
about using a bootstrap because the
website we have was built them on
bootstrap have you had any experience
with that if we know those things and
you show me the right projects and it
shows me this
is my proof then you are hired now when
you go into companies where there's guys
who is like they try to one-up you on
everything like oh but you forgot this
you know what I mean it's like I'm not
trying to deal with those type of
companies you know I mean like these
guys that be like but do you know how
many how many objects are inside of
array methods do you know how many
methods are inside of an array is a bro
I'm not I'm not there counting that shit
you gotta say like and it's like if you
give on three years like but wait
there's four you know what I mean is
like Jo like come on that's a nightmare
man like that's the problem rate though
any anybody familiar with them anybody
familiar with us Steven miss Chuck yes
mm-hmm
one thing I agree with what he said was
you should learn on a knee to nerd basis
I definitely agree with that and I want
to actually touch on a video that Joe
made a while ago he was talking about
UJS and basically he felt like jus of
you has Thank You UJS is like a reed
like a remake of um what's already
available react and I agree like I feel
like there's just so much stuff and then
like people like putting your face like
oh you should learn this you should
learn that and I actually fell victim to
that because I was doing more learning
to actually apply to jobs yeah so when
you start doing that gotta like look
like wait like well I mean like how many
of you don't abs are even out there like
if you do a simple indeed search mm-hmm
how many few jobs are even out there
even in people's area like 9 sold that
doesn't even apply to you yeah I fell
victim to that you know people were
saying oh learn no door or used to learn
PHP so I was spending time learning both
of them and then you know I wasn't
applied to any jobs cuz I was too busy
learning you know I yes but so much time
learning that I wasn't actually making
any money with none of my skills so I
was like gosh but
I I snapped out of that now I'm just
focusing on a few technologies I'm
narrowing it down when it comes to
frameworks just focusing solely on react
I won't be doing any view or angular or
anything like that unless you know I
have to actually do it for you know a
company that I'm applying to but I
definitely agree with what both Joe and
Stephen said you know learn on a
need-to-know basis you know there's no
need to learn every single thing out
there yeah I definitely agree with him
because it's like you you don't need to
learn everything that's under the Sun
and that's one of the things that I try
to do on my courses because one of the
things that I do there is I give you the
things that you need according to where
you work as a program right like there
are certain things that are in like
let's say for example the future-proof
JavaScript that's there for a reason
right but they they don't have the same
things that object-oriented programming
with JavaScript has because you don't
need to know object-oriented programming
at that stage of your career of learning
right you know you don't need to learn
object-oriented programming until later
on until you understand the concepts of
the Dom understand the concept of you
know adding removing changing elements
you shouldn't be doing any complicated
stuff because now you're basically
making your life more miserable you're
trying to do stuff a whole bunch of
different content into your brain and
it's like you haven't understood the
basics yet you know what I'm saying and
as far as far as like with UJS my
biggest problem and I was gonna continue
to repeat it it's the fact that a lot of
people view was specifically creating
for the main reason that a lot of people
don't want to write GSX right which is
just basically writing your HTML inside
of your JavaScript so there's a lot of
people that are completely against that
they're like oh I just don't want to do
this I want to have my own HTML file I
wanna have a HTML file on the side and I
want to have a JavaScript file
on the side that's cool but what you
don't freaking think it's like hey
people have been doing this since the
beginning of frickin time when you
create an element you have to write down
the HTML you know what I mean when
you're creating an element you have to
create the HTML like let's say in jQuery
people have been coding jQuery since I
don't know when you know what I mean
so since back then right so it's like
you've been doing this for years you
know and for people to say oh we like
this way of angular so then review they
was saying okay we like the idea of
components we like the idea of life
cycles we like the idea of props so then
let's take that and merge it with what
angular already had right and so many
even have UJS the guy that creative UJS
he was working for google so he knows
how angular already worked he was
already working with them and then he
went to a meteor j/s and was working
over there and for some reason the guy
the company that he was working for did
not accept vue.js into this system which
is meteor j/s because as like hey we
already have angular and we already have
react why are we gonna add the baby of
both of them into you know into one
framework good so it was like then from
there he goes to laravel and laravel
pretty much was like oh cool this will
be nice for us to promote something and
then here we are now in days there's no
jobs for it every freaking blogger every
youtuber has talked about it people are
writing books about it and it's like
Bose is gonna be on the shelf nobody
picking that shit up don't waste your
time you know what I mean but that's
just how it is you know I mean so I try
to help people out with a realistic view
of things you got to come in and be
realistic of things you know you got to
come in and think about all things that
are that you can apply to real life
situations like you know I'm not gonna
tell you guys guys everybody needs to
drop everything that you're doing right
now
Golan crystal Lange right now as I broke
they're probably not gonna be no jobs
for crystal lane for at least
three years so for me to tell you a
junior developer to say stop everything
that you're doing just do crystal it's
like me choosing what I like and forcing
it upon you and that's what all the
youtubers and all the bloggers do
because every single two three weeks
that a new framework comes out that
gives them a lot of views you guys are
the junior developers you guys are the
guys searching for the answer searching
all these questions online and it's like
which one is the best which one should I
choose which route should I do and for
them is beneficial to actually have you
guys searching for that because they get
paid for it you know what I mean when I
come in and I create a Python course I
don't make no money for with that
because everybody that already got those
keywords they already got it well if I
come in our creative UJS course or UJS
video there's not that many views on
that many videos on it so now I will get
more money per per view you know what
I'm saying so people have to also think
about that you know what I mean when you
come into a website think about oh
there's advertising here so this they
gotta be getting paid to basically write
whatever is hot not really what I need
it's a huge difference between choosing
what somebody needs and then was gonna
make you money you know what I'm saying
but what do I know you notice a new
sonic just to kind of go off you I
actually fell for that trap myself I was
trying to learn everything like you know
PHP Java asp.net c-sharp all those
things when I first started to learn how
to code and the thing about it is is and
this is kind of embarrassing for me to
say but because I was just so spread out
so thinned out it took me three years to
land a job because of that and this is
me kind of coated on my own and not
really having a community that can rely
all telling me hey you know you should
just stick to one niche you know like
for example PHP so after finding that
out after three years later now go back
learn PHP get good at it just stick with
it and ignore all the fluff about the
next WYSIWYG Harry Potter framework is
concerned I just focus on the skills
this is gonna give me in the door so I
noticed that PHP is a very very valuable
skill that you can learn and that's
going to get you hired quicker so I just
focus on PHP was there a comfortable PHP
then I went on to JavaScript and I just
kind of stuck in those rounds of PHP and
JavaScript because those are the most
highly sought after skills a programming
skill so and thanks to that I've
actually landed a job so hey guys I want
to give a second to you know we want to
welcome in a new member
Harold hell away from Harold from Miami
Beach with the short sword and a pink
shirt in a blue shirt and the Miami Vice
Jackie we got your boy Harold you know
just junior web developer and trying to
you know learning things like that I
mean and I've been going I've gotten so
much like overwhelmed with so many
different languages I've learned
golang you know Nokia's in that but I
have noticed in you know in my own
experience that I see frameworks
framework is is like it's a way of
thinking for a company that's how I see
it you know it's like a library away in
format of you writing code you know and
a lot of these people you know they make
it probably like google my angular and
react so it comes out to me how I see
it's like a private way of you writing
code that it's impossible to catch up
with because so many framers coming out
and it's hard you know as long as you
can stick to the basics I think it is
what what is really important and what
you guys were saying about PHP and all
that I mean PHP is being
forever and he's been a language that
had been developed you know it has its
course its training and all these quick
technologies you know they keep catching
up and we're getting so much over one I
mean don't get me wrong I'm not hating
JavaScript but I think that JavaScript I
mean you know the web changes all the
time but I don't think many frameworks
are actually helping us to develop
things I mean I think it should be
something specifically for your
companies the way that you organize your
code like angular maybe they say okay I
want I think creating companies is going
to escape vacation and make it better
that's working this and then what did
they do they just publish that you know
to the party and everybody everybody
wants to write editor
but if you don't understand JavaScript
what's the point of learning their thing
what is that flame who is not supportive
what if it goes down you know I really
love Golding I think what's behind : you
know how you compile your code the
format that it has how much organize in
it but it's it's there's no jobs in that
it's really hard for me to find a job in
bowling so I got a stick to PHP you know
so what's the point I mean as soon as
you understand the basics of any
programming language you know look I'm
gonna I'm gonna show you guys this I
don't know if you guys can see this so
um this is the other day Shaun T Larkin
cool guy very smart guy
part of the web pack team basically let
me see if you guys can actually see this
I'll show it to you guys maybe under
thing so basically they announced a new
version of web pack right so web pack 3
came out around June right now
officially and then six months later we
got web pack for which has a whole bunch
of changes and for everybody they're
always brand new stuff new cool stuff
and it's like to me I'm looking at it
I'm like you're wait web pack is
one of the worst things that have
happened to to JavaScript period and
then you're constantly updating this so
then I say there's like the you know I
put a comment where I was like yo I'm
just glad that you know I'm about to get
the hell out of here of JavaScript like
I am really fucking with it
um so whatever he wrote down he's like
yo this is what we call fixed mindset
you know because I say yo people are
tired as people attire of like the
constant upgrades that were unneeded
right that breaks every code and it's
like wait we just learned this six
months ago why we got a relearning again
so then this guy comes in he's like yeah
I prefer to work in an ecosystem with no
evolution that's that sounds fun and of
course in other ecosystems they are know
breaking changes hello wasm game
development hello react native iOS
development hello
electronics software development right
so then I go listen man I guess you are
too butthurt for this but people are
tired of every month a new framework
coming out web pack 3 was just released
six months ago and let not mention this
web pack is the worst part of my of
modern fronting front-end development
any new developer coming into the
industry has to go through the nightmare
setup why why you think every framework
has a CLI right and what do you guys
think that because nobody wants to be
doing the bullshit of web pack back in
the days Navy back in the days a year
ago people were just creating this stuff
with what gold would grunt or browserify
and just they create their applications
and move on right now
people's decided hey we're gonna make
web pack that standard web pack is a is
it's a fucking mess it's nothing but
just like gibberish basically you have
to go in there and decipher what the
hell's going on with with web pack so
then I go like you know why you think
every framework has to see a lie because
it's fucking ridiculous to spend hours
setting all that shit up for little to
zero benefits it's true you get zero to
little benefits like
you have nothing so personally I can't
wait for whoever comes up with the next
bundler with a decent documentation in
an easier way of doing things to me I
don't care by a few bad for new
developers coming into the web
development now I'll leave you with this
link you probably have read this or read
it again you guys need a refresher ok
it's cool
how it feels to learn JavaScript in 2016
that was in 2016 it's worse now with
every library changing every three
months like we don't have projects and
products to do piece and then I just
left so you know coming from there well
there is like I just I just leave it up
to him to understand because the problem
is a lot of these people everybody's
looking for you know nor be famous
pretty much it's like everybody want to
be the Kim Kardashian of coding you know
what I mean like everybody wants to be
out here you know
oh I created the the freaking framework
that you know that made you change
stringing reverse it is like okay we
could have done that with JavaScript you
got one saying like people want to
create with the same shit constantly
redoing and redoing and redoing it and
some might say oh this is how innovation
happens yes that's how it happens but
for some reason every other language it
doesn't seem like every week that's
another one it does work it's just it
just Jo yeah hey man I just want to say
I must get out of here and get some food
it was yes hanging out with you man
and nice to meet you guys as well stay
up yeah nice to meet you bro the code
and all that and just keep coding man I
believe in you guys boy bro take care yo
Carlos Carlos out here Carla's just
finished smoking a blunt like he's just
been he's been Jesus martyrs lil a he's
been like yo
like you know they gave them the hard
shit they let you know that you know I
had the purple I just know this right
now I'm like I'm looking at everyone I'm
like okay cool we we got everybody in
here everybody's talking I'm like yo
where's Carlos at Carlos say what up to
the peoples man was going just working
it working hard
that's cool cool cool just making sure
you still alive we can show you you're
still awake you know it's like making
sure you're still here man but yeah man
so it's crazy how long we've been here
we've been here for a while man we've
been here for like what like damn like
almost two hours I also want to thank
two other people that donated money on
the super chat we got I'm gonna tell you
right now I'm reading or reading or
reading so we got every spark man you
know I really appreciate it every
department donated some money to this
super chat you know sponsored by Eric
Sparkman you know I mean oh let me see
yeah how long is your own react course
on udemy held are we the react course on
udemy is I don't know to be honest is
like nine hours you know an hour yeah
cuz this am I am I you know what I would
say is do it through if you want to do
the course man do the membership man to
be honest with you go to the website
sign up you take you click on the link
in the description you get 50% off and
it's actually better because if you want
at the end of the month you cancel it
and this is something that I tell people
all the time is that you when you go to
you to me yeah you could buy from you to
me and you own it but at the same time
it's like you're paying $10 for one
course when you could have probably had
three to four courses in that one month
that you had a membership you get what
I'm saying like this
site is not for me to become a million
and this whole thing is not for me to be
like we out here ballin we out here
getting that coat we out here getting
that cold money you know what I mean
like we're not doing that you know
everything that I do here is like
straight up for for the people you
already know Superboy kumbaya so I do it
for the people so it's like if I could
save you money then you know come to the
website you're gonna save way more money
than you actually come in in so you to
me and at the end of the day it's even
freakin worse because when somebody buys
a car from from you to me I get like
three dollars I get three dollars which
is horrible which is like it's like the
worst you are you three dollars three
dollars from whatever gets sold like I
used you to me now now as a way to earn
any type of money just to put it out
there and let people know about coding
fees I usually as a method to like tell
people that want to continue learning
I'm gonna yell coding phase calm it's
like I'm using their platform to promote
my website you know what I mean so but
definitely so for you to save money just
go in to the website and there's like a
million courses in there if you really
want to learn react listen man I'm doing
this freaking Craigslist app which is
I'm still not done cuz there's so much
work like I'll be honest it's a lot of
work when you start working on it you
gotta realize that it's like damn Joe
there's like a full freaking application
like it's not though it's not really
like that bullshit that people come in
let's create one single block and it's
like now there's like a full application
some shit that you would have went to a
company it would have taken you six
months to build and like you know a big
budget for you so I'm just doing this
thing I think right now it's like
already like 14 hours and or more so you
got the react quick and easy which has
to the beginning of react you win
why if you came through
shush it down
let me guess that was that was my mom
why he came through my mom just snatched
my mom to snatch my headphones like what
are you doing yo some deuces are yo we
are here we live is coding phase doctor
this money more I get that money stop
yeah yeah I'm definitely on by that and
I've been following you for quite some
time you know join the community I tell
people all the time people send me
emails and questions like Joe what
should i do what should I learn
listen just follow the timeline like if
you follow the timeline you're gonna
come back and you're gonna actually
thank me there's what happens is a lot
of times you spend more time on learning
shit that you didn't need to learn you
spend more time on finding the right
resources you're like which one is the
right blog which one is the right
youtuber that's gonna guide me through
this and this it's like listen I'm
actually a self-taught developer I'm
actually somebody who learned this shit
the hard way it took me a whole year to
get higher it took me five years six
years almost six years to get all of the
shit that you see Dino now goes like I
can tell you eat that Denny's know what
I mean but yeah so so yes I was like I'm
trying you know
just come in listen to me yes you give
me a give me a chance
listen to your boy I'm not a
professional I'm not an expert I'm not a
frickin do it out here it was like hey
guys how to become a developer in 12
hours like I'm now trying to do that you
know what I mean if you're looking to
work and try to you know you gotta put
in the time
you could actually get this done in two
months and a half all of the courses I
calculated everything on my website it's
two months and a half right and then you
give yourself from another month to
build your portfolio right so you have
the first two months and a half of
learning to code the last month which is
just for people to build solid or solid
projects for their portfolio at least
four solid projects because you never
want to have like little you know here's
a JavaScript clock or like here's a you
know here's how to connect to a API in
and show you the search results it's
like now you don't want to show that you
want to show a full application
something that looks like a business you
gotta say something that looks like a
business would have paid you for it you
know something to make some money Joe
exactly something that makes some money
and at the same time that took time
because people come in and show me stuff
that I'm like bro - that shit took you
like an hour and I have to do like come
on like who is he kidding right now if
you go man you you do a full application
even if it's like a full
you know either PHP PHP Ruby on Rails
whatever a full application from front
to back right that's gonna take you at
least a week to do so that's something
that any developer or any recruiter is
gonna you know respect and say okay this
person knows what the hell he's doing
but if you come in and you just show
them here's my little clock that goes
tick tick tick tick tick tock you know
what I mean like nobody cares about that
you know so that's my advice for
everybody but yeah man I think we've
been here for like well almost two hours
two hours yeah I think like two hours I
think we bout to call it a date you know
Carlos bout to pass out so we try to we
gotta make sure this thing don't don't
have their own lives you know how to
incidentally you know what I mean like
you pass out on the internet that's
there forever you know I mean you know
we are here Harold thank you for coming
through
you know sorry you came in like almost
at the end but uh you know really
appreciate that you you got to come in I
want you guys to look when I won't do a
live stream whenever I'm doing a live
stream guys coming here again just go
into the description you could join the
chat at any moment you know to me so
that's the whole that's the new format
for coding phase comm a new format is
nobody's doing this but yo listen right
I'm talking to all you youtubers don't
take my ideas man every time I do say it
yeah over here like this now here hold
on my name is Bam Bam Bam Bam Bui 23 in
here chit chit chat this your boy Joe
coding face I could change this to
programming face.com in yeah it'll be
similar
you know don't copy what I do you know
what hyperope what's hyper out ok so
hyper app is between is it's like react
with Redux oh oh integrated into one
framework so ok where's the ice trace
somebody got an ice tray somebody that's
on whatever a ticket attraction no my
mom was like why do yo Saturday game you
suck
yeah your sonic sonic came with a look
like y'all like you know how when you
just like broke a window outside your
monkey swinging what was the question
what was the question
hi Brett okay so hi Brad going back to
hi perhaps the hyper AB is like react
but makes with redux so instead of you
having to use two libraries to basically
do the same thing that you would do with
reactive redux now you just have it in
one library right now it also makes it
very easy to understand for somebody who
has never done react or has ever done
any type of framework to me it seems way
easier to learn as a brand new developer
right so what I tell people is try to
learn hyper at first just as an
introduction doesn't mean that you're
gonna get a job with it doesn't mean
that you're gonna come in in and be like
a hyper app master you know what I mean
like you're not gonna be a hyper a
master but at least is gonna make your
introduction to react easier right so
and at the same time you can use it for
your own personal projects or even once
you work at a company you know once you
work at a company you could literally
say hey man I actually know this other
library that we can use for smaller
components right whenever you don't need
something that's heavy yes react you say
all we need is just a search result that
creates a little drop-down you could do
that with hyper app right without you
having to go in and put in the full
application of react all right so it's
just a tool all right it's pretty cool
go check it out I will definitely
recommend to anybody trying to learn
react learn hyper at first and I said I
think I have a I have a for free on
YouTube like for most of the people that
I all want to you know I want to join me
ask you like is there any courses or
anything on it yeah it's like for free
on YouTube I got it on YouTube right
there introduction oh you mean you could
go to my website it's completely free
go hyper Abbas $0 zero none so let me
ask you one permanent yeah yeah it's the
topical well have you played any have
you play around with any of the
frameworks for building mobile apps
meaning react native something like that
or ionic something like that oh yeah
what are you doing of you yeah alright
so I will say for me right I have done
both of them I did ionic and I'd they
react native and I've also done native
script right
I don't like native script at all this
is a piece of shit so the top two are
ionic and react native now ionic is for
angular and react native is for react
right so what I will say is for somebody
who knows react react native is react
you're basically door read/write and all
of your elements you're doing it and
styling them with CSS flexbox --is so if
you know those technologies then you're
good to go to start building
applications with react native now with
ionic is the same thing if you know
angular and you know how to look at the
documentation of ionic then you're gonna
be good to go to build applications for
it the only difference is I believe
ionic uses a like a Windows browser not
it's not a Windows browser but it's a
browser window where your application
shows up right react native actually
compiles into code and to native code
for it for the system so iOS and Android
what ionic does ionic just it's like
using a browser it's like building
something with HTML
and you will basically use a Windows as
the application you know I mean so it's
not really natively it's more just yes
more like an application cuz you clear
it out yeah I set it up gosh exactly so
it's like that's pretty much it because
I was wondering how would it really feel
native when you actually installed on
the device react native to me feels the
most native out of all of them well the
ionic it seems like I say it's actually
just a browser windows is that if you
open Chrome fullscreen and then you have
this application there and for a user he
could download it through Android right
but it's really just some HTML CSS stuff
you know wave like some libraries that
connect to to the Android phone and to
the iOS but react native actually
compiles to native code so it's a better
experience it's more smooth more fluid I
mean they created some new stuff called
stencil jes the guys that created ionic
so they their next system the next
framework that they're working on is
going to be using a stencil Jes which
goes into the same fucking loop that we
was just been talking for the past two
hours we're now fucking we're now using
some shit that somebody created because
they wanted to fucking create it like
there is no there was no reason behind
it it's just a hey instead of us
supporting what react already has or
supporting what angular already has like
now we want to be cool and want to
create our own language I won't
framework so everything that you learned
you got a relearn there again somebody
wanted to keep their cousin on staff and
just yeah exactly right here phalanx
exactly that's how it is I mean welcome
to web development this is how it is
when it comes to anything with
JavaScript everything else out there
like if you're not into like constantly
learning or a different framework
what I will say is focus on the back end
and whoever is making that sound
yeah driving me crazy yeah driving me
crazy do this out here somebody's like a
professional poker poker player he's
like hold on man I gotta I gotta learn
how to do this thing now what we do is
it six I gotta turn around and I gotta
get I got us right I gotta stretch my
fingers out you know what I mean like
those is nervous they can't control
themselves so say well I'm glad they
don't react native exist because I
actually do come from a job a background
like I've been making Android apps for
quite some time so imma definitely dad
it's a react native later ya know that's
what's up man I think like this is what
I think I think everything's gonna go to
the weather rain no matter what the
certain things that's gonna be done like
natively because you can't do it on the
web there's certain stuff that you're
just not gonna be able to do it in the
web period because you gotta understand
javascript is a clusterfuck so because
javascript is a clusterfuck and it's the
language of the the internet basically
you know whenever you're doing any type
of programming it has to be done with
JavaScript so what I will say is it's
gonna go to the net online right
everything's gonna be online and that's
just how it is you know even now like
you start seeing just a lot of companies
that are investing into react native
because not only can you do you know
your your website but at the same time
you can go in there and say hey there's
a bug in a in the full application look
little Billy could you go fix that you
know what I mean so it's like Billy the
junior developers oh yeah also react
buddies and then now he goes in there
and fixes it right you wouldn't be able
to do that five years ago five years ago
you had to go pay some guy like John
Samus so what would I hey guys
so hundred dollars hundred dollars an
hour gonna say you know love John Samus
but you know he cashed in on that you
know as I heat when he came in he was
getting like
hundred dollars an hour because he was
doing like C sharp C and C++ and stuff
like that but it is the same thing
that's like Objective C there's guys out
there Objective C for eating you know I
mean like you know everything you know
garbage no Johnny okay today you know
today's was today you know today's
Tuesday right garbage the garbage comes
in tomorrow morning you know a garbage
man comes in tomorrow morning you want
that these were Broncos compiled chicken
what you want before burger

get real after an hour and a half you
know only so much coal we could start
talking about I just wanna like I just
want to say though I appreciate you know
all things Dom is that you're throwing
out a smack because you could easily
charge us for this information like all
these technologies I should we should
learn you know just a general advisement
you could charge let's imagine uh what's
the name of this company if something is
something called blocks something like a
block something I can't remember is a
block is like an online boot camp type
place so they want to be at some point
they wanted me to go work over there
right yeah I was like I'm good I got my
youtube channel I'm doing good you know
it's like cuz I already know how they do
it they try to say hey we gotta give you
100 K you could work from home give
people advice and then at the end of the
day but can you give us a little
shout-out on your channel and I'm like I
like now I'm good I appreciate the
opportunity well is like no no no yeah
they try to get that break because at
the end of the day it's like when you
come in and you're real with people and
people appreciate that people respect
that from you right you could persuade
people right and that's what I try not
to do I try to give people just the real
advice and just be like just be honest
with them right I don't want to come in

mean no more you said Dave Mountain I
didn't go to dev Mountain the logo is
not the little Mountain the the logo is
a mountain broke broken right in between
broke every you had when you have
mentioned code and boot camps and I was
like cuz I know anything about it there
first but when you mention it and when
you said people pay like 20 grand
anything with it but you mean to you sir
that's what I mean I think I think look
I try to help people out some people
