Conan face.com
today we got something special okay
today we are going to create a personal
v card so now we pretty much got this
part done now this basically work on
this area okay shouldn't be that hard
okay so let's do this now
alright first of all what we're gonna do
is we're gonna start with the profile
okay let me move this to the side so I
could see this and try to make this a
little bit bigger
okay so you got profile you got an H 1
and H 1 let's say the height is say fun
size let's say 12.3 Rev okay that's fine
soup 1 3 room works let's say font
weight is 700 okay now the side of the
h1 we're going to say span color is
going to be let's say what was the name
of the color thing is color 1 okay
so inside of this I can come here and
put this inside of a span say like this
span safety and a though now
think I'm gonna make it a little bit
less heavy so 500 yeah that's fine
so now we're gonna say something like
this and say line-height 1.30 get one
point two okay now after my height we're
gonna say for the margin say
margin-bottom say 30 pixels let's say
margin usually light two doors like this
margin:0 0 let's say 30 pixels and 0 so
when it's 30 pixels coleslaw think we
could do this like this we could say or
1.7 room that should work here 1.7 room
and then it says web developer what
developer I believe is what each five
okay so we can see each five is going to
be font size of 1.3 m
I was a little bit so big let's say one
of ram 1 REM is fine for now
say 1.1 ok welcome 1.1 of ram is fine
and then we could say 44 is let us say
margin:0 0 and then okay so 0 times 0
right and let's say 1 point
well let's say 2 to ramp to where m
should be fine there we should make this
a little bit smaller so 1.5 1.4 ram they
say I'm gonna mess with this a little
bit
I'm just scrolling on top of this to see
how it is so 1.4 REM works just a little
bit so much
you see wrong room yeah one room is
perfect okay now let's say for this
which is the paragraph you're gonna
command I say color we're going to come
in and I say color is color - I don't
remember if it was color - okay color -
color three it's the white color for
style color five is da one color 6 is
style one so I think you might be color
five yeah now we're going to say font
weight 300
okay for this we're gonna say profile
that's create I don't know Laura Epson
or hipster Epsom to get some texts if it
goes a little bit slow right now or you
see anything because I'm literally
recording this video and exporting a
video at the same time so it's taking a
lot out of my computer right now so let
me see what else you're gonna come here
we're gonna go to the index.html pace
like a little a little quick information
okay why did it go all the way down
okay this weird
why did that happen okay I see what it
is so it's the whiff sighs this is
getting bigger than what I needs to be
so the profile section we got to put in
a maximum width so we're gonna say is it
the profile section in its container
profile section yeah it's a profile
section we could see max wave 250 pixels
okay that's 250 I say 400 pixels say 500
pixels okay so there you go that's the
maximum width okay now we're gonna come
here and say line height - it's a little
bit too much 1.4 okay and then what else
we're gonna put in a margin at the
bottom of let's say 36 so let's say tool
rims margin:0 0 to r + 0 okay so that
makes sense
all right so let me see what else what
else should we do here got this got the
user
now we gotta bring this down so let's
say we gotta bring this down we're gonna
say profile section maximal with I'm
gonna say padding the MSA 30% zero zero
zero okay it's a little bit so much say
20% and now of course all of the stuff
you gotta fix it and responsive once
they become responsive you gotta fixed a
lot of this stuff here okay see a
situation like that if you really wanna
go deeper into it you can and like I
said everybody has their own ways of
coding HTML CSS and laying down their
website to be honest with you I've never
heard a client to come to me and be like
hey man make sure you use a flex box
like nobody's this worried about that
okay if you're thinking like peoples
gonna be hounding you because you know
using CSS grade or or flex boxes for
every single website I don't think that
they work for every website I think they
work for specific situations like let's
say you have something like you use a
bootstrap just for the grid like you
might as well use CSS grids alright if
you have something where you need to be
vertically aligned or in a certain
position like of a square or like a
element you could use flex boxes it
makes sense
but in the situation where somebody
comes in and hands you down a original
design not like in a bootstrap way and
what I mean in a bootstrap way is like
bootstrap way would've been like okay
there's the left side there's the right
side and everything that's inside of
this box like it works perfectly when
you say hey it's just working inside of
this box but now we're actually working
with something that's in the air like
this element right here just throws it
off because technically it's just
element in the air you got what I'm
saying right guys so because of you know
a couple of sounds I hear and the babies
up and the fact that pretty much all the
other videos that we've been making have
been like 25 minutes half an hour long
I'm gonna cut this one short and we will
continue this on the next video where
we're gonna set up the buttons okay and
every day we move on to the other pages
all right cool
see you guys later bye guys this video
