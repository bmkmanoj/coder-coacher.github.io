it again man : face calm listen God
don't say I never told you anything man
so today we gotta go over you know
basically event stop propagation and
events prevent default right and when to
use it this is very important for you
guys are trying to learn JavaScript so
you can understand this concept and yeah
let's get started
all right guys am i doing this you have
a bit right is your parent did and then
have a link inside of it what happens
when let's say you want to create
something a certain click action on the
link as far as you know jQuery or just
regular JavaScript right when you click
on the link it's also going to be passed
down to the parent that same action so
let me say an example let's say let's
run this once right so we have to parent
it and then we have the link now when
you click on the link it starts right
and okay essentially to Google because
that's what it was a possible but it
basically does lmn was clicked in the
continuous clip meaning you clicked on
the link and whatever action we put on
the dish it also happened there and also
got trigger remember that the parent div
is on top and basically the link is
below it so when you click on the link
automatically whatever was the parent
class it gets triggered to so how do you
stop that very simple right you do
something like this like let's say we
want to stop the propagation right which
means we only want whatever got clicks
so we only clicked on the link that's
the only action we want to be triggers
all right so you're going to run this
again and we got to clear this so if we
click this the only action should be
clicked is the link not
parentage so alright now what happened
the element was clicked before it was
saying the element was clicked and the
container was clicked so both actions
got triggered now let's say we don't
want to show actually open up a new lake
right in a new window so what we will
use is something called prevent deform
so what this is saying hey whatever is
the default of this this tag this
element casually don't do that right
stop the the default of it and basically
whenever you want to give it that's a
new action of it right so the same
example save this you let's clear it all
right now we're going to prevent this
peaceful let's see what happens you see
you click in it but it's no longer
opening a new window alright so this is
super useful like methane exam we making
something a react or whatever framework
you're using and you actually want to
stop the defo of whatever element it is
it could be a submit form it could be a
link it can be anything and all you want
to do is prevent the default of it right
now
events that propagation what it does is
it stops you know basically the action
that event so being propagated to
everything else on the elephant right
meaning if you click on a link inside of
the div you don't want this action when
you click on it to be passed down to the
parent it and so also on all right guys
you already know if we joke back at it
again make sure you subscribe make sure
you like this video man and also take
your time and look at the description
below I have a couple of Link's there
make sure you go to coding freeze calm
also make sure you click on the link
below where I have of course like couple
of udemy courses that I've taken that
made me into a developer so check them
out
trust me if we look at the comments a
lot of people have bought it and they
like oh my god
Kujo we love it alright guys I'll see
you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
