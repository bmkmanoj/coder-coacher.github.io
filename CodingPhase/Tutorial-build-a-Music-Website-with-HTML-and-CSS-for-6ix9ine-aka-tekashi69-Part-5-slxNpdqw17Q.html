the next section that we're gonna build
is the album section so this is latest
album that he is selling right now so
we're gonna create that section okay so
to get started let's just do the HTML
just how I like to do it start with the
HTML keep everything simple okay close
the last sections okay so we're gonna
have some extra space of things so okay
now come here create let's say section
dot or section light ID and let's put it
in album oops
there you go owl so now the next thing
that we need what is that we're gonna
have a title we're gonna have two
sections so you got two sections in here
okay
got one here one here okay left or right
we could do like the CSS great or flex
boxes it's up to you okay so we've got
two sections one section is gonna have a
title then the albums and then the logo
of the streaming services where you
could get the album so let's do that
right now
let's start with the first section so
here we're gonna put in say a difficult
info and here we're gonna have let's say
a title oops
okay so it's not letting me because of
how things are so let me just put a div
title oh my god is this all annoying
like because there's a title tag and
things like all this a title okay
whatever
so let's just do it manually as you see
this title sometimes you know every
doesn't work perfectly especially when
the browser or sorry the editor already
have like set things by default so
sometimes it messes up so here we're
gonna say they six nine oh my god
day six nine okay day six nine okay and
then we have singles so singles okay so
that's gonna be a section called singles
and then for each one of these there's
gonna be let's see a lie so when I say a
lie we've actually changed this to be
you well you well okay and then here
we're gonna put in all the singles so
let me move this to the side so we could
see them okay there you go
so we got which once we got we got Gummo
those like this a lie so I was five
okay so we got Gummo and ngati kuda
Rondo keiki belly okay save that next
thing that we have is the streaming
services so I'm just gonna call this
logos and then for each one of these
should have done it the other way I
should've just went like this put in you
well and then logos okay so now here
we're gonna put in Li times six so six
allies and here's what we're gonna put
in the images of the logos okay image
source for now just gonna put in the
tags cuz I don't even know where the
image is we're gonna have to get it from
the Internet
okay so for now I'm just gonna leave it
like that okay until later on we put in
some some actual images there okay so we
got this whole section done now now the
next thing that we want to do is the
next section which is the album so we're
gonna say div class album cover
album cover close the div and then
inside we gotta put in another image so
here we're gonna put in where is it this
is actually the actual album I put in
another image there but that's actually
the album so we're gonna put in oops
album it's an image well
slash image slash album dot jpg okay
save that and I'm pretty sure we already
have all the the HTML done okay now it's
about putting in the styles
so let's come down here let's close this
and we're gonna come it is come down
here do I'm gonna say it was an album
the idea of album let me make sure
that's what we put yeah idea of album so
alright we could just put music let's
put music lowercase so we put music
change this to music okay
just in case later on he drops another
album we could add it to that same
section so we just have music okay so
now and here we have one that's called
info alright another one that's called
album cover
oops album cover
okay and now what we're gonna do in here
for this this music we're gonna say
display flex
okay we should also put this inside of a
container I totally forgot this again so
here we're gonna put in container like
that and then copy everything that's
inside of info and inside of album cover
cut it and paste inside okay
save that okay now the next thing that
we're gonna do so we got music
this is flex now we want this to be
inside of container so the container is
gonna be the one that's gonna have
everything inside of it displaying flex
okay see how it is now what we want to
do is for both info and album cover
we're gonna say with 50% okay wave 50%
with 50% okay perfect
all right now the next thing that we
want so we got this is like that next
thing that we want to do I'm gonna put
in in here for the image to be 50% oops
with 50% of the element so it won't be
that big okay now
think that we also want to do let me see
okay cool so instead of album cover I'm
gonna put this as display flex now to
sensory right in the middle we're gonna
say justify content center and a line
items Center save that and that centers
it okay now the next thing that we want
to do its work on the info section so
let's open this up right here and let's
look at this okay so what we're gonna do
here is we're gonna make this into let's
see we got the title so first of all
let's start with the title on the info
so we're gonna say title I say font size
I say two rim right we'll probably tweak
it later font weight let's put in like
maybe 500 okay next thing that we're
gonna put in oh we forgot about this
section 6 top 100 singles so let me see
how we gotta do this where is it I'm
gonna just copy this and paste it here
and I'm gonna put in subtitle so I'm
gonna say
six top 100 singles save that cool all
right cool
now the next thing that we want so we
got day six nine dah-dah-dah okay we got
the title I'm gonna copy this I'll put
this to be text-align:center
text-align:center we gotta make this
font size point eight REMS and the font
weight is gonna be let's say 300 I want
to change this to 700 so it could be
thick we could know like hey that's the
the title itself okay so let's see why
isn't this this changing let me see okay
that's why the subtitle okay there you
go
so that's how we want it now
the next thing that I want to do here is
basically create this UL of singles okay
so let me see subtitle we got the title
subtitle okay
here we need the UL of what was it
singles
so singles we're gonna make each thing
go into display grid and then and here
we're gonna say grid template columns
let's say 50%
save that okay let's scroll down let me
see
so we got ul da singles hold on why is
it a changes a subtitle
let me try removing this okay and there
you go so that's what we want
alright let me see something
okay alright so that's fine let me see
something we wanna see with say 400
pixels margin:0 auto you know what take
this out save this and what we're gonna
do is on the info we're gonna say
display flex flex Direction you're gonna
say column ok flex Direction column and
then I'm gonna say justify content
centered oops hold on
where is a flex Direction Center save
okay
currently it's not being set up I wanna
make sure this thing isn't on a
container
yes it's inside of the container see
we're gonna put in padding:0 fifty
pixels left or right say if that okay so
now it's all aligned where I wanted to
see a line items Center okay all right
so we got everything that we want
now I'm gonna do on this I'm gonna put
in padding eighty pixels top and bottom
zero left or right okay so that's fine
next thing that we want to do we want to
start giving this things a space so I
also change the font size so we're going
to change this font size three okay
they're six nine that's fine
this we're going to change it to font
size two Rams I'm gonna say text
transform uppercase
font way of 500 okay now the next thing
that we want to do we want to bring this
down gives us some space so I notice the
subtitles a little bit different but
that's fine it's because I'm actually
seen like I want the subtitle to be
bigger so let me see what else so we got
this then we got the singles which is
the allies so I'll just come here we're
gonna say Li font size will say 1.5 1.5
REM save that okay
font weight say 300 okay now what we're
going to do we're gonna give some space
between these so I'm gonna put in margin
bottom on this say 100 pixels okay 100
pixels on down one okay how's it looking
good all right so let me see where is
the singles ally I put in
text-align:center
okay now we're also going to put in
margin bottom of 20 pixels
okay so this is looking good it's a
little bit different than what we have
here but it's fine it's because I'm
noticing certain things that are in the
design this is like a prototype
everything that we have here is a
prototype as far as the website itself
what we gotta see on the website is
gonna be the finalized version I usually
do it like that like I get ideas in the
design but then once I start coding it
they're not really fine doing it okay so
let me see what else we have
we got this now we're missing the logos
so I'm just gonna get iTunes Music logo
okay
images I think was a link there was a
that's a thing that they have so let me
see WorldStarHipHop calm say gotti
Bacardi like that as if things ain't
that - okay so this has all the logos
that we're gonna need so gonna come back
I'm gonna expect this and I'm gonna get
the logos from here so next thing that
we're gonna do I'm gonna come to here
we're gonna put this right here we just
get the logos of different online stores
to stream it or to buy it
all right okay a lot of freaking Lobos
copying this and there you go saved now
let's go back to our website so we have
all the logos here okay we're gonna do
the same thing all right let me see so
there's the album covers let me see what
I named this logos right so singles
right here we got logos let me make sure
I'm not excited of something else okay
this yeah that's where we need to put it
low goes inside of info so here we're
gonna come in we're gonna say display
grid and then we're gonna say grade
template columns the grid template
columns okay great template columns and
then here I believe is repeat repeat
three 1fr I think that's how it is can't
really remember the syntax yes I think
that's it okay repeat three 1fr and then
we're gonna say great gap
and we're gonna say 15 pixels in fact
that's giving a little bit more than
that 20 pixels okay so we got all of
them here now we're gonna give to some
space so for the singles we're gonna
come here when I say margin-bottom 80
pixels okay and what we're gonna do is
we're gonna change the background all
right so we're gonna do everything that
we did before same thing that we did
before we're gonna do it again remember
how we did the gradient right here we're
gonna do the same thing on this section
so we pretty much we could get this from
the top section so we got blurred
background we put position:relative on
the parent and then the blurred
background okay so let's go all the way
to the bottom come here let's look at
the beginning the idea of music so we're
gonna set position relative if we're
gonna remove this height we're gonna
come here and there's the blur
background so this we're just gonna say
height 100% okay now we don't have a
blurred background right now so what
we're gonna do is we're gonna pretty
much
come here create a div put a class
called a blurred background okay save
that and there we go so that's what we
have okay
currently all right now what we have
here this container we're gonna come
here and we're gonna basically say a
position:absolute on the container we're
gonna say z-index three and there we go
so now now we have what we sort of what
we want but let me see something
because or is it the blurred background
let's see blur background it's too small
you see that blur background is
definitely too small so we have to do
some changes here okay
so to get this effect how we want it
with all of this elements
we're gonna have to do a couple of
changes okay so to do this we're gonna
have to set up the HTML a little bit
different so let me close this up here
so we've got the blur background like
this
I'm gonna put inside of this no I can't
do that
I totally forgot I can't do that so miss
a container okay
all right how long cuz we the issue is
that we gotta tell how big is the
elements inside of it I saw on the Missy
blur background so 100% let me see it
blower background okay I just remember
sunny so for us to be able to have this
blur background know how big this
container is what we're gonna do is
we're basically instead of putting
absolute because absolute kind of
removes it from the space what we're
going to do is we're gonna make this
position relative and we're gonna say
the index three and that should fix
everything and there you go okay that
gives us exactly the effect that we want
now next thing that we want to do is let
me come back here instead of that one we
want to actually change this to yellow
okay so let's do this right now
let me get what's the color copy this
from here oh I know I know guys I still
gotta activate this windows I know it's
annoying
I'm gonna do it probably this week I
have a USB stick that suppose I already
pay for I just don't want to pay for it
twice I had in another computer so I'm
trying to figure out how to remove the
license from that computer to this one
and I'm not a Windows computer user so
I'm trying to figure it out and so don't
judge
all right so let me see okay
we're we're worried okay we gotta change
this thing
the colors are red so what are the
colors so in RGB is 255 250 360 so let
me see 255 to 5360 okay so let me just
copy this from here and paste this here
okay
let me see paste this right here paste
this right there paste this right there
let me save that let's see how that
looks okay
and what control-z change this back safe
this okay there's a little bit too much
it's not what we want so change this it
is change this to that save that I think
like the colors are are in this thing is
like a grayish I could put it like a
grayish but it's fine for now this is
fine so what we're gonna do we are also
going to change the background instead
of Dow on the image top we're going to
change it to what was it album six nine
okay there you go now on this I'm gonna
change this to put this at 20 percent
okay there you go so that's what we want
so we want like this or yellow yellow
and then this one we just put that 20%
and then now we get that a nice effect
there okay all right cool what's the
next thing that we need here let me see
oh we got that stay six nine we want to
make this a little bit smaller so the
subtitle put at one point one point
eight or one point seven six
400 singles okay cool I want to give
this a little bit more space so the
title so margin-bottom
let's put in 10 pixels marching at the
bottom 15 pixels yes so there we go
all right so we are good guys we got the
first part bio latest video they 6-9 to
album and we got all of the different
icons here okay so we are good to go
we're done with this section I'll see
you guys in the next video bye this
video is brought to you by coding phase
