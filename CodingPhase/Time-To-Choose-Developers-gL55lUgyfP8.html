coating face.com you did why your salary
you know this my what developers lunch
break right now hey listen guys the
reason why I call all of you guys in
here
sighs there's a link
right now this is just for people there
are
on both boards to you
this one alright cuz right now I just
finished the job
kind of stick right so now we jump along
to the next big thing right what should
I teach you guys laravel so a lot of
people keep telling me lerigot right
they want to jump to lerigot some people
might want to jump into you know
advanced CSS and I'm talking about CSS
grids flex boxes and a responsive design
right what else we could be talking
about I don't know
go you guys might want to learn go you
know do you guys know that jobs for go
right now going for $180,000 literally
they like the highest paid people right
now in the whole industry so if your
your goal is to get a lot of money then
I will say start studying going
goal and that way all right
the link is in this description is just
a forum just like I've done it before
then what this does is it tells me what
you guys want to do
I'm here for you guys I'm not here for
me I'm here for you guys I'm over here
exposing myself out here you know it's
dangerous of talking while driving
looking - gonna take it a
summons which if I get one more summons
I'll lose my license I'm risking it all
for you guys and all you have to do is
just go on the link click on the forum
and say which course you want to learn
next that's what I don't want nothing
crazy I don't want you guys to buy
anything I don't want you guys to
support me I don't want you guys so you
do whatever you want right but all I
want from you is that information what
do you want to learn next I know a lot
of people are gonna watch this video and
some of you are gonna be like oh my god
the quality is horrible because of the
internet connection and this and dying
who cares about that it's the message
was important right of course I'm gonna
give you guys to the gif video later on
you know the little bring out the camera
give you guys that good quality on a
single topic I'm gonna do that later on
for you guys but right now this mine
what developers lunch break this is when
I hang out with you guys just wanna I
get to talk to you guys and and find out
oh that's my fault my fault I did not
add react to it that's my fault I should
have added react
so my fault
why lunch is so dirty why because I
don't like taking early lunches cuz you
know like right now it's 2:30 right and
then oh whatever
I ate a lot of stuff for breakfast like
I had a sandwich like a little you know
raisin bagel way what butter this
morning I was four I was on fire so now
I eat a little rap a little chunky wrap
with some bacon and then I should be
good too like the time I get home plus
what's cool is that now when I come back
it'll be 3:30 which means it's only an
hour and a half for me to go home you
know what I mean so that's how you do it
kids like whenever I take a lunch break
early I feel like I still got the whole
day left so come back right but and go
home but at least if I let go at 2:00
2:30 then I know
at 3:30 I'll be back and I'll be good
you say you know best in JavaScript now
then I say I'm the best in JavaScript
nowhere I don't need to say that I do
what I do in JavaScript I'm really
 good in JavaScript am I the best
known because there's guys who are way
better than me this guy's creating
libraries frameworks and a whole bunch
of shape you know they have free time to
do that
me I'm just a regular guy just trying to
help people who just happen to have 5
years in this game and who happens to
now people and actually just
come in and just give you what you need
because unlike a lot of people whenever
I'm trying to teach you something I
don't teach you the long way I don't do
it you know you remember back in the
days when you used to have math class
right and then the professor will come
to you and be like teach you a formula
the super-hard and then at the end of
the course it'll be like oh yeah guys by
the way this the this the shortcut me
I'm the guy that teach you the shortcut
first I'll be like here's the shortcut
kids like there's no need for you to
learn the long way you know so that's
and that's why I'm an just a regular
dude out here chillin is the 8:30 p.m.
over here
oh is it is 8:30 p.m. before oh
- Russia my people from Russia what up
what a piece that app alright with that
piece down I need some peace that so I'm
sure to send me the pista laravel should
be the next course
Redux for sure mo backs nobody uses them
I'm being honest nobody uses them that's
like one of those things that's online
like it's like the alternative like I
should make a video about this because
this is really important sometimes you
see online like libraries or things
that people are talking about and
there's a big difference between what's
going on in companies then what's going
on on the internet right on the internet
you know like crystal Lang is super
popular in this everybody's talking
about it
you know it's popping right now but in
the industry meaning at jobs and
companies nobody's using crystal lane
because it needs more time now it's the
same thing as mobitz mo backs a lot of
people saw the body on the internet that
I oh yeah this is great this is amazing
this you know it's better than redux but
yeah those guys when they go to work do
what they're using is Redux you know
what I mean it's like that's why I tell
everybody is so different worlds
there's the world of work in the
industry and then there's the world of
ready github and the Internet
yes
that's a perfect thing right there
Prince
prince said this is not me saying prince
said yes I wasted two weeks learning
view and view acts and there's zero jobs
in my country this is something that I
tell people all the time and there's
like a huge huge like disconnect between
the internet you know cuz on the
internet we put whatever we want we we
do whatever we want like when are we
creating or a brand new project I'll
create my own framework you know what I
mean like this time so I don't even want
to use react I don't want to use
anything like that and I just create my
own framework just for that
little project just to mess around with
it right now am I gonna do that in a
professional environment
no you know so it's like the same thing
that's all another guy earlier today it
was on Chris Hawkes wanna Chris Hawkes
video where I left a comment it was
about vjx where Chris was talking about
how people are are talking about view
like oh they they build this amazing
website with view Jas and it's like nope
wrong like they use the framework they
could use any framework just because the
website looks good doesn't mean that you
jes made it good
it was just like literally it was the
styles and the animations and the
 the images that I had so
whatever I left the comment there I was
like yeah I agree whatever and some kids
like giving me a essay of like
you know like oh what I was
something about you I don't even
remember
and I'm like bro everybody here on the
Internet talks about like view is the
 but then when they go to work they
use react or angular you know what I
mean like that's where it's like for me
as a disconnect when I'm like wait what
like when you go to work and you
work in a real shame professional
you use something professional something
that you know works but then on the
internet you want to defend something
constantly that to me is like it's
something
experiment with something news like
right now is I gotta tell somebody
use the Rakhi stack right somebody will
tell me hey I'm gonna use the Rakhi
stack for my application great use it
right now if I tell you hey I'm gonna
use it for my company and I'm gonna
implement it into my company I'm gonna
tell them hey don't because there's
better frameworks out there that have
you know people have better teams bigger
teams you know they're my little
rocky stack Rockies Tigers I got an
experimental thing you know it's a
one-man show you know you can't compare
that to like laravel or Ruby or rails
where it's like hundreds of
contributors like it's hundreds of
people working on those projects
you know what I mean it's like reacting
angularly there's hundreds of
people working on those projects you
can't compare that to one person or
or 50 people working on it like hundreds
so what else you guys want to learn man
let me know man
turn on your phone to the side they
don't let you do that you can't do this
it tells me rotate device and one let me
do it you see I rotated the device and
tells me no I can't do it
javascript or PHP
you guys gotta let me know man what you
guys want to learn next
are you like messing with this thing
all right
react please
I know the babe store that's what I'm
gonna do the babe store on if when when
I jump to laravel I'm gonna do the babe
store in la riva so all of you guys that
actually worked on the babe store and
y'all really got something out of it you
guys gonna be able to enjoy because now
you're gonna see that code that we
created that time we're gonna see it
with Larrabee but I have to give you
know everybody's an opportunity to vote
and let this rock right I want to see
exactly I want to see exactly what you
know what everybody wants to learn you
know so I have to do that
how to use PHP and JavaScript to talk to
each other that's super easy man those
now you could learn down w3schools
now I could teach you that that's easy
through JSON basically send JSON send a
post request to the server with JSON
data then whatever you want the server
to return back when a basically says hey
I received it then you can return
something back that's easy I can show
you guys how to do that with laravel
super-easy
I don't know my coworker was telling me
I should just jump to an arrow but I
don't know you guys let me know man it's
on the description description click
right there man there's a little thing
there even if you don't click it now and
you want to click a later on you got two
things that you got to do first of all
you guys should be ashamed of yourselves
right first of all we got 33 people in
here and we got four likes
there's how much love you got for me
there's some I'm out I'm out
that's first of all that you guys should
be ashamed of yourselves
it's the web developers lunch break and
you know that's how that's how we eat
over here we eat likes we eat the
 lights out here man that's how
we eat all right so that's first of all
second of all you have to go on the
description click on the link that just
is like some Google long-ass link so
it's a Google form where you just fill
it out and you say hey there's my
username on YouTube just like I know
which one of you guys actually is the
one that that wants to learn
I don't know react or laravel or
JavaScript or anything so look because I
forgot to add react if you go there and
you add um if you see es6 click es6
because I'm gonna teach ESL
were free act together so that's gonna
be both of them at the same time even
though it doesn't say react if you click
on es6 that's the one it's like you're
voting for react because I'm gonna teach
both of them together but yeah man
we ain't here man we head on with the
dab-dab
yeah man is it right if you don't want
to learn react you can learn es6 and
then not do the other chapter which is
reactive you don't have to do it if all
you wanted to learn es6 don't worry
the s6 is gonna be one chapter and then
react is gonna be another chapter inside
the same course so it's up to you
o to you guys you don't have to do the
second chapter nobody got a gun in your
head but you do need to learn es6 in
this world and especially for your boy
Steven Greiner got a great course that's
also in the description but steven
griles gonna teach you the steven
graduate right Joe's gonna teach you
project-based we're gonna create a
project for each different little thing
so like let's say arrow functions why
would you need the arrow functions when
will you use net const or VAR which one
when is it that you're gonna use it what
else the spread operator when would you
use that let's say another one
when will you say of art or cost or let
and then you say curly brackets and then
you you come in and putting all the
variable names
well will you use that what would be a
good idea to use that you know what I
mean a littlebeautiful young is
crazy a little girl a beautiful little
girl right what a crackhead ain't that
some
that sucks the world is up all
right I don't know it's just not right
man
the world's not right
let me see the things Joe reassurance
the best salesperson yeah I'm not into
sales man
I'm into supporting you guys Dorian
laughing right now it's true I just seen
the most beautiful little girl in this
world that little girl could be like a
 model for like Baby Gap Kids or
some right and then the mom looks
like a crackhead I'm like yo why people
do like that like to me I'm like
man if I'm if I'm a crackhead right if
I'm a crackhead out here if I was a
crackhead
alright and I have a kid I'm gonna get
my together man I'm not gonna do
crack you know what I mean I would do
the something else I was smoke
weed or something sophisticated
do some coke don't be a crackhead come
on you got kids you got a beautiful kid
put that kid through school get her to
become a I don't know actress or
actor or something put that kid to work
alright but give a saying don't be like
hey my mom is a crackhead that's not
cute
yes that's true
addiction is not easy to overcome but
the only thing that I'm saying is I
think everybody here has at one point
experimented with something right
everybody here has experimented with
something at least liquor a cigarette
something right just when you get that
first hit or you get that first
something you get drunk when do you
decide I hate I love this I'm gonna
 throw my life away cuz I love
this nah man like I'll be honest I
went through a stage when I was like 20
from 22
yeah from 22 like 22 that I used to
drink almost every day right and that
was because I was I realized I was
depressed because my sister had gotten
sick and I was just drinking constantly
I wanted to party constantly I wanted to
hang out I never wanted to be home and
then I realized man I'm like what am i
running from what am i trying to escape

party yeah I could blow a couple of
backs out you know what I mean but what
am i running from you know like let me
come back to my family and face the

man Donald Trump is like crack
to America you know what I mean
America was a beautiful girl now she in
the back of the bar giving that out
for a couple of drinks but yeah man
