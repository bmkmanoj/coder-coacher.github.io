the past four or five months and I want
to give something back to you guys like

time I'm going to do something different

go over the survey just pretty much so
we could be transparent and we know
exactly what's going on right now
let's talk about the giveaways what is
it that I'm giving away there's no thing
that's specific I'm not giving out just
one course I'm not giving now all
freaking a trip to the Bahamas I'm just
giving you exactly what you need to get
you started and become a know what
though ever mean I'm gonna choose to
r-25 people here I don't know if it's
gonna be one I don't know if it's gonna

your last name the reason why I want
your first and last name because number
one I want to call you by your real name
I want to call you by you know cyber
sound or whatever or something else
I don't know sorry so sagres now I'm not
talking about you I want to know exactly
who the hell I'm talking about you know
I mean so it that's why their email
because I need to contact you I can't
send your message through youtube or
leave a comment like hey man you wanna
or hey you you wonder
you know the giveaway I'm not doing that
that's extra work it should be me you
know finding you we're doing what is
crazy Shane just give me your email I
will email you and I hate you want not
state that simple right state of
progress I want to know will stay you
from because just for logistics I just
want to know exactly where you ask
you're in another country also to make
sure you fill out country because I want
to know if I'm gonna send me something
physical why I'm gonna send it to you or
if I decided hey this person lives in
freaking Zimbabwe like I'm just gonna
give you something like that Amazon gift
card you know $50 gift card or hundred
dollar gift card whatever it is right
now another thing is are you interested
being part of a beta testing right
pretty much I'm going to be doing coding
phase calm and I'm gonna need some
people that are just going to go in the
website sign up they're going to
register they gotta go through the site
and they gotta test it out see if
anything breaks your job would be to go
into the website and break things so if
something breaks things tell me hey Joe
this links don't work hey I'm trying to
upload something and it doesn't work so
I'm gonna need a couple of people I need
at least 15 to 20 people to go in there
and just test it out you know I'm not
saying I'm gonna have you 24/7 testing
things out it's just like hey give me
your honest opinion go in there
something breaks you know let me know
also how long have you been coding you
know so that's very important so I can
know exactly what level you are um what
are you interesting front-end back-end
full step if you just you know you want
to learn everything under the Sun just
put in full stack alright of course it
goes to say I don't know yet right so
what do you like about Colin Fitts chair
tutorial advice stories ranks what
developer lunch breaks or you know you
can say other and type in whatever
exactly that you like about it what do
you think concrete means to improve the
same thing satori advice stories Reds
what developer
freaks user side right you tell me why I
need to improve on that you buy any of
the courses that Joe recommended which
is me um because I took do you buy any
of those if you did I want to know
exactly which one you bought so like
that who actually know you know what am
i working with you know what courses
people like what courses people did not
like you know what I mean if nobody
bought the PSB my single cause that that
means I got you know maybe we look into
another piece be my single because I
still believe it PHP my sequel there's a
million jobs for it so PHP is not going
to where kids so you still gotta learn
that like it or not that's still under
your homework right so um yeah depending
on which one people bought I would like
to know if Jill created a unit course
when you buy one for ten dollars right
most likely because I will probably get
an extra coat if I was to sell of course
I will try to send it for five hours so
now like I always say I'm not here to
you know be here like hey guys so I'm
promoting my course in every video I'm
not gonna do that I'm gonna put in the
description but I hey guys I created a
course whoever likes a going by of
course like I always say the main reason
why I haven't started my own course and
you're the New York promoting anything
that's dinner with me is because why not
create a course is not taking me a long
time
meaning I'm really gonna put in time I'm
going to put in Tommy creating the
course I'm going to put in time and
editing we're going to put in time
making sure there's no errors there's no
mistakes everything that I say to you
guys is going to be very clear so it's
going to take a little time I don't know
it might be somewhere next year when I
create a course right but I would like
to know who out of everybody here would
would buy a course you know that's just
me all right so if yes what type of
course you would like to to see
basically
to them we like me to break down basics
of html5 css3 how to build a site from a
design basics of JavaScript the run
jQuery the run JavaScript framework the
react which is what I'm super
comfortable with I'm not gonna coming
here and start teaching you guys
something like Vijay s or you know I
don't know what was the other one a
polymer or something like that because
I'm not comfortable with that you know
I'm not going to teach you something
that I don't use on everyday basis you
know so yeah so that's why I put react
on the water wearing the full stack with
PHP I want me to do a complete course on
PHP teaching you how to build a site
from the ground up everything from HTML
CSS JavaScript and PHP mi sequel we like
to see that now if you would like to see
something the full stack with nodejs
something you know like you know nodejs
express react and also MongoDB or even
my sequel would you like to see that if
you do or you have any other idea that
you might watch you can also click on
others so yeah that's the survey right
it's not that bad it's just multiple
choice or you can click on multiple
answers and you're gonna care about this
this is this that's it
and then just click Submit that's it
pretty simple now going back to
giveaways like I said it's not just
going to be in one course so like how I
used to do it where I used to say hey
guys you know giving away free courses
yes I might be giving away free courses
but it's not just going to be that
because what I'm going to do is I'm
going to choose one to five people or
maybe ten or maybe 15 I don't know but
I'm going to choose that a large amount
of people and then I'm going to get in
contact with you through email I'm gonna
ask how you know actually hey what
exactly do you need at this moment to
get you started to
code or it's something you know let's
say an example your computer slowing
down you say Joe my computer super slow
and I would like to just improve it a
little bit better I will say okay cool
what type of hard drive you have you
have an old-school
700m I don't know megabyte gigabyte of
hard drive right so then I was a you
know what here here's 250 got our
gigabyte SSD just to make your computer
faster and you could get to code right
now also if you say hey I have a great
computer right but I would like to just
make you know a little bit faster memory
or have more memory because I only have
4 gigabytes of RAM or 8 gigabytes of RAM
and then I actually hey what's that per
computer you have I find out what the
type of computer you have then from
there I'll send your brand new Ram you
know what I mean
now of course if you tell me hey Joe I
just want to be able to have my
portfolio online you know what I'll go
buy your domain and also pay for your
whole years worth of hosting right now
how much is that going to be probably
like $60 it's not much but you know some
people they can't afford that you know
what I mean or they just means that
little push to keep the focus and got
you know what I got a domain now I got a
portfolio I got my you know all my code
in there and now I can show it all how
to tell people hey go to Josh Smith's
car whatever it is right so that's the
point of this giveaway the giveaway is
not really for me the giveaway is for
you guys I just don't want nobody else
to have any more excuses you know in the
sense of like hey why aren't you coding
on my computer slow ok cool let's make
it faster oh man I want to buy your
courses bar I can't afford it hey ok
cool which course you are here you go
ticket I'm gonna give it to you right or
you be like man you know even it is like
if I have to chat and you know this
thing's gonna go good this this month
with everything that I'm doing right now
and
hey John you honestly tell me Miguel I'm
from you know I'm from Houston you know
I live in public housing I do this and
they're like I don't know me I can't
afford to buy myself a laptop I've been
wanting to get into code are very
interesting or homeless whatever it is I
don't know it doesn't have to be to the
extreme but if it's like being honest
and you tell them like hey man
well I'm just a college kid man right
now I can't afford to buy a new MacBook
or anything like that I will get you a
MacBook right now if I get your MacBook
it's not going to be brand new it's
going to be used or I might just even
send you my last one the one that I had
my 2012 MacBook Pro which has you know I
think it's one terabyte hard drive and a
500 gigabyte SSD and there's 60
gigabytes of RAM which is more than
enough to pretty much be dangerous out
here
right so it's up to you guys but I just
say like you know this whole video for
11 minutes anyways guys I'm sorry
it's the devil you know how I am EMN but
I'm putting this survey right on the
