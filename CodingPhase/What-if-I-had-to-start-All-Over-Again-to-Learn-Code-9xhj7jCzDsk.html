at it again man : face calm listen your
boy is back I didn't did it again people
been asking me Joe what if you started
today as a branding developer I just
found your channel and I'm just
wondering what would you do right what
would I do was a developer and somebody
who just got the little bug in their ear
like man maybe I could do it if I was
that person in 2017 what would I do
right right now in the Sun right so a
lot of you guys are in school you have
or you know summertime is off right now
vacation time or if you are actually out
working you know you work a full-time
job man the best thing to do right now
I'm just being honest is to get a course
in general or Coast school calm you know
just to get your interests out there
right even if Rico camp free code camp
is going to show you a little bit about
programming and you're going to
understand a couple of little things
it's not a it's not a really help you
build a website but it's going to give
you an introduction even Udacity has
like small little things that you could
do for free right now like I would say
anything that's free is a reason why
it's free right it's not the same
quality as something that's already P
personally I will take one of the
courses that I put on the description
right now I'm thinking about adding the
new my sequel course from cold steel as
one of my go-to core courses that people
need to take because it's like if you
like nodejs
like let's say if you've been doing HTML
and CSS and you've been practicing it
you're like you know what man I'm trying
to learn a little bit more of JavaScript
so go ahead learn nodejs it's good to
practice with you know nodejs
your JavaScript right but the same time
my sequel is so important guys you guys
don't even understand it my sequel is
like you know the heart of the incident
everywhere you go almost every company
uses my sequel or sometime
a sequel database it could be Postgres
it could be mario DB it could be a whole
bunch of other ones right so you have to
learn sequel that's like it give it like
you have to learn it the idea that in
2017 you're not going to learn my sequel
man trust me guys that would be a really
big mistake I would actually just try to
learn you know one of the courses that I
have in my description or if I'm just
like really iffy about it I'm like man
if you're one of those people that you
know it's like you signed up for the gym
you go and pay $80 at the gym for a
membership and you never go to the gym
if you're one of those people don't even
buy a course go to freak okay try it out
see if you even like to cook I'm not
going to tell nobody hey spend money or
something if they're not even sure they
want to do it but if you know you want
to do this the best way to do it is
straight up buy a course man of course
is like $10 $15 the most right that's
the best thing that I would advise
anybody to do and that's what I would do
because I actually wasted a lot of time
and I speak about this in all my videos
right I would say always a lot of time
looking for the best resources you know
they're like sometimes you fall into a
trap of or what's the best language
what's the best framework what's the
best instructor what's the best a
freaking youtuber who has the best
tutorials like now you fall into a trap
the trap of looking what's the best
right what's the best resource out there
when you fall into that trap you do less
learning and more looking for the
resource right so I would say men don't
even waste your time out here if you
know for sure you want to learn how to
become a web developer right the course
is right there in the description right
those are the courses that I took
there's certain people that you've got
to follow in this in this industry like
when it comes to instructors or people
who's going to give you good advice
people are going to give you real advice
because there's a difference between
someone is gonna come in here and give
you a a pretty cute story and be
like you know you could do this in one
week you could do this in two weeks know
it takes time it typically takes time
and takes hours right so when I say it
takes hours is you know you could do
this in a month you might actually do it
in a month if you go and spend the whole
month only on web development meaning
you're going to wake up in the morning
and from you know from 8 o'clock in the
morning to 9 o'clock tonight you're
gonna freaking be coding right if you
can do that then yeah you could do in a
month because it's a numbers game it's
how many hours you actually put it you
know that's how the brain works though
you get to remember things tomorrow you
you repeat it the more your code then
you get to understand it the idea that
you're going to come in as a you know
the dishwasher who's doing this
part-time and you're going to be able to
do this in two months in a month that's
a that's a dream guys I'm telling you
right now that's just a dream yeah I
rather just be honest with you guys you
know so that's not that's my advice
that's what I would do is 2017 you know
it's very simple you know the courses
are right there I don't put them there
if they're not real if they're not like
the real deal man like that's just how
it is man now of course like I just said
if you if you like I'm sure that you
want to learn how to become a web
developer don't buy a course don't be
like a lot of people that teach you know
they go to you to me that bio course
because it's cheap yeah you could go in
there and buy you know freaking 20
courses $200 you bought 20 courses
alright but are you going to finish them
are you going to do the projects are you
going to create projects after you
finish a course the idea that you got to
keep on buying courses on it and
learning more and more that's not how
you do this the way that you do is you
basically come in you take a course you
finish one chapter you go and do the
other one
right and create a new project that's
the way how you got to do it man
well yeah that's how does my advice for
today man
2017 and why would I do if I had to
start all over right that's just what I
would do man because I spent so much
time guys I was family
someone's found like three four months
just looking what is the best like back
then when I started
and it was angular it was backbone and
ember right and I was when I was like oh
I gotta learn angular I gotta learn
backbone I gotta learn ember and I spent
a lot of time trying to figure out which
one was the best instead of learning the
foundation and learning you know good
tutorials getting good tutorials or good
courses because it's like you find
yourself looking online all the time and
you're like man I can't find the right
resource so at least you can listen to
me
take one of the courses that I tell you
something that's proven to work you know
hundreds of people keep on leaving
comments and sends me messages like oh
thank you for showing me this
courses and it's like yeah they work for
me why would I work for you guys like
nothing you know so that's what I would
do man because like I say man there's
nothing worse than just wasting time
because nobody's going to give you time
back it's like if you're going to do
this go hard at it do it the right way
man don't waste time looking for
resources you already knows your job
back at it again man listen make sure
you subscribe and make sure you like
this video man by the way if you want to
know exactly what courses I took to
become a web developer they right there
in the description it's no secret it's
nothing crazy is no secret gift that I
had is just pretty much I took the
courses they're pretty cheap they're
like $20 beads on specials and just this
mess change your lives change your
lifestyle do something fun and something
cool that you could call a career I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
