again get in these videos up just for
you man you're gonna build this Netflix
man listen we're gonna start with
something real fun today you know sign
quick you know a little bit about CSS
gradients right so you want to know what
the hell is CSS gradients right unless
search what great use gradient color
grading colors is just pretty much as
like a mixture you see how things go
from red to blue yellow to purple to
green that's pretty much what gradient
means it's just pretty much as I can
mixture of like colors you know you go
for one angle to the other angle and you
mix two colors sometimes three sometimes
four whatever you need just to create
something you know something either
create a gunmetal or create just like a
pretty image in the background
how would you wanna you know you want to
mix up colors you know I mean so we
don't assert color adobe.com right so we
gotta start out and then this was just
gonna give you this right when you get
here we're gonna mix two colors we're
gonna say okay basically the logo of
Netflix's you know red and black so
let's come here and say okay I want to
mix this to read right
and then I'm gonna say this color I want
it to be black whatever we're gonna keep
black and red so we're gonna say okay
234 31:17 so this is colors in you know
red green and blue and then this is
hexanol covers basically hexadecimal
color it just pretty much colors in
computer language pretty much it's that
simple okay so we're gonna say
I'm gonna come over here I'm gonna say
give me CSS gradients right and then
there's already a generator for you to
create this almost nobody knows this
thing by heart you know I do but a lot
of people don't know this so the best
way to do is just get the generator
you're always gonna find this whatever
you need like something that's fairly
complicated or a lot of numbers or a lot
of letters that you're not gonna
remember just google it in its you're
gonna get the generator trust me all
right so let's say we're gonna move this
down all right we're gonna say get this
ready get this black and basically you
see here this the angle that's gonna go
so it's gonna go 4-0 to 100 from you
know from the bottom to the top you know
from the bottom left to the top right so
let's sing let's get the WebKit you come
here your copy this you say okay from
there to the end right here you copy
that and then you come back here and
then you paste it
I need to stay here so now you have the
color that you want on top a little
image and then the image after meaning
is gonna go under the color so now what
you do is you replace this color series
okay here's the 45-degree so what I
saying is coming from here to here and
then zero starts here a hundred starts
here right so you're saying okay 45
degrees then you want to remove this
color right in yourself clean was red to
34 31 17 you come here you click rgba 31
31 1717 and then the Alpha means how
much light can go through the color so
pretty much it just makes it you know
translucent right so it goes from zero
to one so what you do is you say okay I
want this to have the color but the same
time I wanted to be able to see a little
bit was behind it right so let's start
here right you got the color you're able
to see what's going on here and at the
same time you know you have the color
which is at the end which is black I
have 100% now it's all up to you however
you want to work you know sometimes you
might say hey I want to make this thing
180 degrees so it's the opposite right
or you could say hey I want to make this
90 degrees you see it comes from the top
you start at the bottom and go to the
top
all right for now let's just keep it at
45 because I kind of like this like that
yeah yeah so pretty much the same man
does a little bit intro to CSS gradients
man it's just pretty much you mixing one
color with another color you know
sometimes if you want to go all out like
let's say you wanted to create a metal
or you know a button you'll create
something like this like back in the you
know early 2000s a lot of people used to
use gradients a lot now it kind of went
away you see like it gives you different
effects like if you wanted to use a
button you could just come here and just
pretty much copy this and say okay I
want to copy this whole thing like let's
say we wanted to create this right here
this class right so let's say we have a
gradient you will use that you know it
has a background but we're not actually
gonna make it like that cuz it looks
like me so you gotta keep this there and
we're gonna go to the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
