gonna happen and that's life we we can't
cry about it right so there was no sound
for what for like a minute I mean all I
did was just say shit shit shit shit
shit shit you already know your boy Joe
back at it again
coding face.com your boys back and out
and did it again and once again we get
another follower you dick so yeah we
poppin right now so anyways what I
wanted to talk to you guys about was
basically you know I'm gonna be doing
this live videos once I know in a while
it's gonna be cold you know dropping
gems with coding face I don't know what
you guys think it's just me randomly
talking to you guys about whatever it's
on my mind how I feel that day whatever
inspired me that day and yeah so I
wanted also to share with you guys if
you are a writer if you have a story if
you wanna talk about why you became a
developer if you want to talk about why
you becoming a developer send me a email
send me an email and I will set you up
basically what what I did was create a
medium account right so we created a
publication for the community of coding
face calm so pretty much we are going to
help you promote yourself right
help you share your story help you come
in and like let's say you have a good
story hey you want to share it with the
world or you have a tutorial or you have
anything write anything that you want to
share to the world
right I will show it on medium.com so
let me see if I can show it to you guys
I'm gonna write a story later on later
on today
I'm gonna release it there but I want to
show you guys the publication okay so if
you go to medium.com slash coding phase
you will see this curly is just an empty
empty page but we officially got a
medium okay so it's medium.com so that's
coding face send me any tutorials that
you want to do right even if it's
something simple just send it to me
right it has to be all text-based also
too if you have any type of blog that
you want to share to the world or you
have something that you want to promote
you have a I don't know a project that
you want to show to the world you
created a website you created a product
you create a startup whatever you have
right send it to me through medium we
will share it to the world
okay so yeah we got that poppin so now
we got a blog okay so and what's cool
about this is like let's say right now
you created a startup right or you
created a website that generates CSS
grids let's say for example right and
you're like man I don't know how to
release this to the world how to get as
many eyes as possible
well now you have coding face as one of
your ways to promote yourself and
promote whatever topic or tutorial or
software or product or whatever you
built right this is like my way to
giving back to the community it's also
to get you guys more involved I want to
build this thing let me see I'll make
sure of between free code camp a mixture
of hacker noon a mixture of who else a
mixture of levels that I owe a mixture
of product can't calm so that's where I
want to build coding feast you know I
want people to be part of the community
I want people to be able to share
orys I want to actually turn this
channel into more of community-based
right where it's not just me
here talking all the time I also want
you guys to come in if you have a video
you have a tutorial you have something
that you want to share and you say hey
Joe I want to post this on your channel
you're more than welcome to write
there's only so much that I could talk
about right there's only so much content
that I can create so I feel like this is
bigger than me right this is bigger than
just Joe we want to give you know open
door to whoever wants to come in and
wants to join the community but at the
same time it's not just like coming in
and say hey I'm gonna use coding fees
and I'm gonna try to steal all his
subscribers guys I'm not worried about
people trying to steal my subscribers
like you could come in you're more than
welcome to come in and do like a side
hosting like hey hey freakin chit chit

you know share a product that you
created you created a web application
you're like oh man
I'm not getting enough enough people
using a hey if you have something cool
and we say hey this is legit why not
share it to the world right like that's
why we're here for it so support each
other and so basically help each other
out on this journey of becoming
developers and becoming entrepreneurs
and all
revolving code right so around code
right so yeah that's what we're doing
here so yeah man does I wanted to share
that with you guys so you guys could
send me an email send me an email coding
face at gmail.com I want you guys to you
know if you wanna come in and write a
blog you wanna come in and and show some
love go ahead man you know what I mean
so yeah that's what's new for today oh
god
zombie bite says I know you built a real
estate and restaurant sites are you ever
gonna make an e-commerce digital agency
site yes I am right now I'm finishing
the Craigslist clone which is an
extension to the react course
rachel is basically you learning react
route are you learning some of the
basics of no J yes working with data
working with JSON data and being able to
do get requests and post requests so
once I finished with that then from
there we're gonna continue I think I
might do the ecommerce I don't know PHP
or or Ruby on Rails one of those two or
maybe I might just do it in no GS cuz I
some people being asking me is like
yellow finish the the nodejs
I had a no js' course I took it down
because I was like you know people are
having way too much trouble learning it
and I said you know what it's to me it
wasn't worth it right because it was
like only like 20 people learning the
nodejs course and then every single one
of them had issues on installing node or
you know they were having problems with
like like didn't understand a lot of the
stuff is like I just don't want to deal
with it right so now I'm gonna set it up
in a way where even a beginner could
come in and understand no GS cuz the the
problem is that people want to jump
ahead of things man sometimes you don't
even know JavaScript and you want to
jump into no GS you know what I'm saying
like sometimes the guys don't even
understand
the whole process you know like you
don't even know a lot of stuff right
like that's my problem too so this thing
is like man you gotta know the basic
stop trying to jump into frameworks stop
trying to jump into you know the back
end if you're not ready you're not ready
you haven't built enough projects in
JavaScript to understand things and
people is trying to you know it's like
oh wait but they they hiring for angular
they hiring for reactive hiring for well
you know nodejs is like I have to learn
this things and it's like now you have
to actually know what the hell is going
on you know before you even jump to no
js' nodejs is not something that people
make it seem like it's magical like it's
super easy for people to learn it
because it's like oh yeah it's just
JavaScript and there's like if you don't
understand how HTTP requests work you
don't understand how you know requests
and response work you don't wanna say
how modules work you don't understand
how JavaScript how to program JavaScript
how are you jumping to no GS so I
learned from that I said you know what
I'm gonna take that off so I took out
the nodejs course I said you know what
guys whoever needed a refund I gave him
the refund and I say you know what I
just don't want to deal with it but if I
do what no js' course is gonna be not
like a beginner course is gonna be like
the e-commerce site something where is
like hey man I'm already expecting you
to know JavaScript I'm not gonna babysit
you I'm not gonna babysit you to install
no GS and I'm gonna make you very clear
in the beginning of the course like hey
if you're jumping into this you are
expected to know all of these things you
know so that's that's how I feel about
it because I just don't wanna I don't
want to deal with all the headaches of
everybody has different computers
everybody has a different version of
Windows Windows 10 or Windows 11
whatever they have
right so I don't want to deal with that
so what's good regular web guy what up
skeleton what up we in here guys listen
if you got tutorials you got blogs you
got a product that you just create it
send it to me man send me an email send
me an email so we could get you inside
of the medium slash coding face right
get you in there man is good for
promotion is good for you guys to get
your branding out there getting your
name out there man and trust me
trust me you want you want to get your
name out there man you know when people
google your name and they say they
looking for John Smith or whatever your
name is
little Juanito ain't no whore neato like
you you want to have something out there
that shows like oh this person is part
of the community he's actually been
building you know projects building blog
poles he's actually you know know now
here right it's like you giving yourself
more value any good design courses I
want to make a jaw-dropping site with
designs I mean all of that stuff is
gonna come in later on I'm trying to
focus I'm trying to knock out all the
things that I need to knock out as far
as courses by the end of the summer then
I'm gonna come in and start building
more advanced stuff or maybe I focusing
in design or maybe I focused in game
development ill depends you know it's
like I'm working on this new tutorial so
let me see
so this is something that I'm working on
so this is golda I mean I'm already
creating the the course I'm just fixing
up so a couple of bucks so it's like hey
he's like you know a little flappy bird
just for people to be able to learn you
know so there's like a couple of little
bugs out I'm knocking out but it's
pretty simple pretty easy if you ever
looked at how you call this a Python the
programming language is so easy man it's
just like this man it's like everything
is already built for you you could come
here move things around you say okay
there's a collision right here I want to
move this here and then from there you
use programming I mean this is the
things that get me excited right now
right I got this and this other course
that I'm doing on the side for react
native those are the two things that I'm
excited about right now right those are
the things that I'm working behind the
scenes you know doing doing little
things here and there right now
Craigslist app is cool because they just
it teaches you everything that you need
to become you know really really good
with you know react that's it then after
that I'm moving off from react I'm not
doing no more react projects unless I'm
doing like something like like the
e-commerce right maybe I'll do that
ecommerce to be with Adonis GS in the
back end which is no js' right and then
reacting the front-end and then that's
like the last project that I'm gonna do
for react there from there I want to
start working on other stuff that that
people are waiting for
so let me see
well why are websites needed I feel like
what development is fluff I guess
Americans are over privileged that makes
no sense
and these hey could you do a tutorial
how to build a chatbot landing page in
one in the bottom right corner of the
page using javascript that's pretty easy
let me see what else Joe working on my
portfolio I'm using some inspirations
from the portfolio course on your site I
don't have lots of projects show to show
off yet but I'm eager to get my name out
there should I launch it yeah you gotta
have a portfolio you gotta have
something out there even if it was ugly
if it's the worst thing that anybody's
gonna see you wanna have a website that
somebody's gonna look at it you know
what I mean
like when they search your name
something should pop up on the internet
you know
all 2017 without without without what up
handy handy probably because there's a
lot of companies tried to grow and then
he at least a website to show up yeah I
mean think about it guys if you have a
company right how are you gonna make
money nowadays right you need a website

which is the the zip up Hoodie let that
load for a second take out a little bit
too long T spring what's going on with
your API T spring I'm about to say so

but I have already told nobody you know
go ahead and copy the gear yeah because
this is just a logo I feel like I don't
know who who's gonna want to walk around
with just the logo you know what I'm
saying like I want something more clever
something legit then just like having a
peril with your logo on it you know so
that's the thing let me see I've been

to make it like some corny stuff like
I'll be seeing some people create the

you
you know I know there's really off-topic
running list which I have a friend

dashboard so I can see your message is
what it says Joe I know this really
off-topic bomb writing a letter to a
childhood friend that's locked up I want
to put in some motivational shit in
there any advice just tell him like yo
man when you come out just focus on you
man don't let nobody sidetrack you you
know focus on you and just when you come
out work hard man you know show society
that you're a different man you know
doing the same thing it's not gonna get
you anything so yeah man let me see
any more questions any more messages you
guys wanna talk about I'm trying to
catch up see what you guys got in here
how's it going
brother I'm good I'm good man
la Blanca Monique what up what up what
up what up what up we got the squad man
we're getting the squatting here man
yeah man yo you guys are crazy man I'm
reading some of the comments and people
are crazy I have this question about the
santa cv to a company but there's no
open vacancies entry level so Sunday
still Sunday like stop worrying about if
they have junior developers position
like don't worry about that if you're a
developer and you could do whatever they
tell you then you good man I stop
looking for those key words like has to
say junior developer if now I'm not
gonna apply to it don't worry about it
because most likely they they waiting
for somebody to come in they need
somebody to come in right a lot of times
people send resumes and they're not even
half as good as you write so you'll be
surprised you know there's guys that's
been there for like 10 20 years and they
they're like oh yeah I'm a Perl
developer and as I broke nobody uses
Perl anymore you know what I'm saying
so it's like you coming in with knowing
all the latest things you know like PHP
laravel knowing JavaScript react like
you're doing way better than a lot of
other developers that's gonna go in
there and be like mid-level not like a
frickin bad ulcer I don't even know how
the hell this thing happened to me man
I'm really pissed off I could have
caught anything else out there but to
have a freaking also that's hurt it's
not you know you old man this
it's a little teary got my eyes teary
but yeah anyways you know I'm thinking
about moving back to the US the job
market here in the UK for web developers
is poor I don't know man I don't think
so I looked at this website called read
I was looking to basically tutoring
somebody was a developer from the UK
who's trying to find jobs that's another
thing that I haven't told nobody I don't
really promote it out here that much but
if you want me to do a one-on-one with
you and our tutor you help you out with
whatever you send me an email there's a
price to it but I work with everybody
right so me and this guy we was
yesterday going back and forth with a
lot of things and he's from the UK and
actually he's I think he's Italian and
he lives in the UK now but I've never
heard of this website called read that
code that you came if you live in the UK
this website seems to be legit where you
could come in here and just put in HTML
okay and it will search for the jobs for
you okay taking a little bit too long
but yeah
so as you can see full-stack Java
c-sharp HTML
application software developer darn a
Java laravel developer 30,000 to 40,000
I mean how much is 40,000 in u.s.
dollars 40,000 pounds
you
oh damn only $55,000 that's crazy
damn you guys don't make nothing out
there that's bad I mean maybe the cost
of living might not be that much or is
the cost of living the same as here in
the US
cuz that's a little bit bad that kind of
sucks I mean some people I see here
developer engineer and programmers
software look they're looking for SCSS
70,000
but that's the thing too is like
Coventry so I'm guessing this is like
outside of like you know of London I
don't think this is like right in the
major cities
it's crazy 25,000 pounds for PHP HTML
CSS developer and another tool that I
tell people - there's a hey man
sometimes it's not the the pay that is
important it's the fact that you're
gonna get a job right like if you love
doing development and you love to code
and somebody's gonna pay you thirty five
thousand forty five thousand pounds in
England all right and your rent that's
not that much but you see Oh in the u.s.
to pay a hundred thousand it's like bro
you don't live in the u.s. you know stop
worrying about what they're paying in
the u.s. you know somebody sent me a
message to the other day
this Indian cake they're like oh man I
feel like we're getting exploited here
in India this isn't daya because in the
u.s. developers get paid a hundred
thousand dollars and here we're we're
getting paid thirty five forty
I'm like bro like you don't live in the
u.s. like stop worrying about the u.s.
worry about what you have at home or we
would but you have in your area you know
like your cost of living is like nothing
like you get what I'm saying like a lot
of times people's like man if I live
here and you know in the poll and they
pay me how they paid the you know the US
developers I will be a millionaire out
here it's like yeah but it's like the
job that you're working is not worth for
you to become a millionaire in Nepal you
get what I'm saying I don't know if
people understand that I mean it's the
same thing for people in South America
or Africa is like worry about your life
over there and worry about how if you
get like a job that's thirty forty
thousand dollars in your country and
you're good
why are you gonna be constantly thinking
oh other people are making more money
than me somewhere in the world like who
cares like people are always gonna make
more money than you right like I could
be here say oh I made a hundred seventy
four thousand last year
this year I'm gonna make a hundred
thousand I lost 70 thousand on things
hey just by doing YouTube and doing all
the stuff I'm losing money do I worry
about that no I'm happy I'm happy to
chill with you guys happy to work on
things so it's like I'm not worried
about that there's another developer out
there making a hundred fifty thousand
two hundred thousand like who cares like
that's good for him you know what I mean
like his course of living is not the
same thing that's here you know I mean
so stop worrying about everybody man
worry about yourself try to get as much
as you can in your area and your first
job you're never gonna find like a high
pain like it happens once in a blue moon
but you gotta be like amazing right now
you have to look at yourself in the
mirror and say am I an amazing developer
or am I just a guy that's getting into
the industry and I need more time to
develop my skills right sometimes you
gotta be honest with yourself look at
yourself in the mirror and be like yo am
i amazing or my guy getting in the
industry so somebody comes to you with
thirty five forty thousand dollars even
here in the u.s. is your first job you
can't complain because nobody else
trusted you to touch their code or touch
anything on their on their website so
you gotta be grateful that you got in
and then your next job there now you
start leveling up and getting more money
you got I'm saying
Joe where is the best site to purchase
of the main I mean the one that I go to
is namecheap.com it's pretty simple
pretty easy so
yeah oh yeah guys listen once again I'm
gonna repeat this anybody that wants to
come in and you know send me a blog post
sharing your story anybody that wants to
come in and send me a tutorial that they
created even if it's something simple
like this is how you do a HTML table
like something simple whatever you want
to do send it to me I will add it to the
the medium website that we have there
with you know coding phase which is like
our blog right if you have a product if
you have a project you're proud of and
you want to share it to the world send
it to me on my email coding phase at
gmail.com I will add it to the blog okay
and that will help you get more users
that will help you get more people to
your website you know it's gonna be
better for you right so yeah man AJ I'm
I'm gonna make a video about that about
crystalling why I haven't really been
effing with crystal lang that much
lately
and crystal is I love it I love crystal
but there's certain things that have
turned me away from it for now I'm
coming back I'm waiting for now okay so
I'm gonna do a video on it
so yeah man I think I'm about to start
heading out guys
your boy is back I didn't did it again
dad I love you guys go to the website
Cody face comm subscribe to the channel
like my videos leave a comment if you
feel like hey you like the video that I
did sharing come on guys
why not so much love for the view GS
because there's a copy of angular and
react it's the same thing that they're
doing
I don't like copies I don't like you
know a lot of the stuff that is behind
the scenes of UJS I don't like when
people come in and scheme it I'm not
into that you gonna say I didn't like
the promotional ways that they did
things I didn't like how laravel came in
and and basically pushed it down
people's throat like hey guys make sure
you go and study this framework is like
now like bro like I ain't fucking with
it you know what I mean like that's just
me that's just I have my own opinions
and there's no jobs for it so it's like
why are we even talking about it you
know what I'm saying like that's my
whole thing is like there's no jobs for
it it's like we're gonna talk about
something that nobody's hiring nobody
cares about and it's like okay why
because on the internet people give us
stars like people give stars every day
be you know what I mean like you get
github stars every day be you get what
I'm saying like the right promotion the
right blocks you get a whole bunch of
stars man it's not really that serious
yes now one thing that you I kind of
wish I should have put this out there
the reason why laravel now supports
react is because basically I went to the
laravel arm
Larrick ass and I created a full a full
message there for them and I was like yo
this is so much BS how you
guys are forcing down people's throat
your view Jay yes that's coming with
larvae automatically is like I never
asked for future yes so why are you
adding it for you it's the same thing as
when when Apple created the iPhone right
now even when they created the iPhone
but when they made I think the iPhone 6
I was having around there and then they
put the u2 album and people is like yo
this album is garbage why is this album
on my phone automatically installed so
look it up go to Larry cast maybe search
I don't even know was my name on there
but maybe Joe Santos Garcia look it up
had a huge discussion with the guy that
created Larry cast and I was like y'all
bro like you guys are scheming it you
guys are promoting this this framework
when nobody knows this framework and
this framework is not good its framework
is mediocre there's some framework is
basic like if I was to say hey I'm gonna
use view Jes I'd rather just use jQuery
you get what I'm saying
so yeah man that's that's why we don't
talk about you up in here and so if you
guys want to do the research search on
Larry cast I think it's like Joe Santos
Garcia something like that or jsg or I
don't know what was my name there but I
basically put them on blast and then
after I put them on blast then like a
month later they decided to add access
for react access for for angular if not
if it wasn't because of me they would
have never added it that's the truth
look it up so this is your boy Joe back
