back at it again man your boys back
coding face.com
damn all right listen man I'm just
having fun out here man
I just want to let you guys know you
know your boys still out here and I'm
still doing one video a date at least
I'm in them all right so I'm doing a
little 360 in my room this is my room
where I just come here to chill but yeah
so um let's start with this right so
when are you ready to start applying for
jobs all right
somebody asked me that he said hey Joe
how do I know if I'm ready to start
applying for a job pretty simple right
if you who actually are you know create
a website if I give you a design right
just a regular design and you're able to
make a website out of that design like
right now come to dribble calm write and
say the same example realistic right cuz
this how most of the time this is how
you gonna get you know designs like
somebody's gonna come to you and gonna
give you a PSD it's gonna say hey can
you make a design out of this all right
so what you're gonna do is you're gonna
come in well basically you're gonna
sculpt it out see everything that it has
you say okay there's a header um you
know there's a side menu well there's
like you know filters here you have
departments whatever right so if you go
actually build this then you're ready to
be hired you know what I mean like if
you could build an HTML and CSS you're
ready to get hired as a junior developer
you know just to come in get your feet
wet into the job I can't guarantee you
you're gonna make a lot of money at
first you might get something like $12
$12 tool let's say $18 right
and that's fine because you gotta
understand it's a process most companies
is gonna you know that's gonna hire you
for $12 $13 whatever they're gonna hire
you for you know for you to get your
experience you know in the company and
basically it's testing you know in three
months to three months you know at that
price right for example sometimes you
could get way better than that you know
better offer than that but I'm saying
for people who who have never worked in
the industry you gotta take whatever
comes your way
you cannot say hey you wanna be all
picky and say hey I want to make a
hundred thousand dollars in my first job
that I applied for like you're not being
realistic now because number one example
you might not have a degree number two
you don't have enough experience for you
to be able to get a higher paying job
because a higher paying job means more
responsibilities they're not gonna come
in and give you a whole project by
yourself you're pretty much going to be
helping out other developers so if you
co actually come in and make this design
into you know a real webpage you're
ready to get a job and you know you
start going to indeed.com
alright you go to Andy calm and you
search are the same example whatever it
people live wherever you live here right
I see you live in whatever
San Francisco right this what kind of
fornia and you put it in so start
checking for junior developer right
and then you see it there's a lot of
high-paying jobs but in reality I can
guarantee you that you're gonna get
those jobs I'm being honest with you
guys so what you do is you say hey HTML
then from there you see even if you if
you see this jobs are like super
high-paying jobs
apply to it because that's another thing
to make you also you're not ready don't
so you start taking interviews like very
few people get hired on the first job
that they apply for very few people I
didn't get hired on my first job that I
applied for what I did was I just kept
going to interviews I used to go to
senior developer positions like
interviews in it like I would be
embarrassed at times I will be
embarrassed cuz they'll ask me questions
that they don't know but then I will go
home and be like oh this is why I gotta
learn you know what I mean like even if
if you can't get the job apply for it
see if they hire you be like hey I
already have my my portfolio see you
know come check out the websites that
I've made look at the small web apps
that I've made my HTML emails whatever
whatever you have done put it into a
page so you could have something like I
don't know a Joe a freaking Raul dot-com
I don't know whatever you're in your
name and your last name is right if you
can't find that then do something you're
variations I don't know but have a
dot-com guys like Viacom put used as
opposed your portfolio put all your
websites and everything that you've
built put it there and once you start
going to interviews appeal I hate this
is what I did now in the next job that
my ex you hate like do you have any
experience where angular you be like no
no I don't but I'm a quick learner
just keep it you know keep rolling you
know what I mean like keep on with the
conversation don't get stuck don't be
like
like a lot of people that's what happens
to people like they get scared
just go to the interview and then pretty
much just you know see what they want
you know I sometimes even stay in
contact with them and be like hey send
them a little email but I hate how you
guys doing like even if you didn't get
the job like hey thank you for the
opportunity dadada and then what I was
oh just stay in contact with them just
send them an email like just so say hey
thank you for at least giving me the
interview but I'm telling you guys like
you could find a job is like it's
freaking easy like I'm trying not to
curse I'm trying to control myself Jesus
Christ but yeah um yeah man just trust
me like let's say right now for you guys
like HTML right junior front-end they
have you know sometimes 60 grand and the
reason why you know maybe San Francisco
is not a good idea because San Francisco
is like super expensive so what sixty
thousand in San Francisco is like thirty
thousand over there you know what I mean
like it's so expensive that you need a
lot of money they need to pay you a lot
of money even for junior development the
development on positions like it's super
expensive out there maybe let me see uh
let me try here in New York see maybe
give you guys an example
see like this is more so New York is
more more reasonable you know HTML
design like dull little jobs like that
that's like super easy
that's just dealing with HTML tables and
you get paid for it like you know if you
guys could I'm telling you you guys
could pretty much just you know get a
design building in HTML and CSS and then
sometimes they might actually hey could
you do a little slider this and that
yeah you could do a slider on jQuery
like it's simple guys like you are ready
trust me just go ahead stop being scared
just are applying if you're able to
basically turn any PSD or
any image that's a design and you could
make into HTML CSS stop playing like go
ahead and just start applying stop
thinking that oh I'm not gonna get
higher
who cares if they say no on the
interview like who you so I try to
control myself who gives a like who
gives a if they don't hire
you man I'll try not to curse man what
the hell guys what can I do man not to
curse man I'm trying trying so hard not
to curse but yeah man just go ahead just
do your thing and your supply man and
let me know if you have any problems I'm
gonna continue making videos for you
guys anyways you already know it's
coding phase com make sure you subscribe
um this videos are not conventional
videos this is what I call my rants
videos that pretty much is just ideas
that I get and I just you know start
burning it out for you guys and and
helping you guys out and hopefully
somebody gets something out of this you
know what I mean anyways your boy Joe
back at it again Wow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
