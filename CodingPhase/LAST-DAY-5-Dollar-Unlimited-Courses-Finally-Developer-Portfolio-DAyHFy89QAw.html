time for your boy - yes we taking that
spot its 2017 2018 2019 it's a whole new
ballgame but like I said guys look I'm
gonna show you guys exactly what this
what I've been working on for you guys
all right everybody that's subscribed to
my my channel all the guys that
subscribed to my my website this is what
I'm working on for you guys remember I
told you guys you need a portfolio so
that's what we building right we
building this whole thing from scratch
we basically coming in we're using
nodejs to build all of this so it's
gonna be a beautiful portfolio for you
guys you guys can go and change the
colors change the images change it
however you want
right you could even just use the back
end for whatever design or style that
you have alright later on after we
finish this whole course you can edit it
however you want it the fact that you're
gonna have this whole CMS system already
set up for you is just great and at the
same time you learned no js' in and out
right so pretty much you got here the
home page
then you're gonna have about page then
you can have a projects face then you're
gonna have a blog page they can have
contact speech currently we only have
two pages done well two designs done
which is the home page the about page
and then everything else is using the
about page layout but all of these are
gonna be different now right now we
already did like I think like three four
hours we're three four hours in right
now you probably think man we only got
like two pages done trust me guys this
is a very deep nodejs course meaning
like we're basically going from learning
nodejs learning routes learning how to
deal with errors how to deal with bug
for template engine how to deal with
sass how to setup sass how to set ups
gulp
pretty much we doing everything in this
course alright if you guys want to check
it out go to my website kobi5.com
like you know working right now I finish
all the basics I did the introduction
how to install to the atom understanding
how website works and it's like super
high level meaning I'm talking to you in
a way that you're gonna understand it
right I'm not trying to hit guys over
the head I'm not trying to hit you guys
wait a whole bunch of details that has
just got to make you your head spin I
want you guys to hit the ground running
start building things right and the only
way that you get to learn how to build
things is by doing it it's not by me
telling you hey this is what a route
isn't it's you know spending an hour
explaining how routes and requests and
you know headers work you don't learn
like that you learn by building it and
seeing what happens when you change a
file see what happens when you work with
things so that's what I'm doing here and
there's no js' course you know talk
about folder structures
cleaning up the routes moving our logic
into controllers you know a lot of
people like to have the logic in nodejs
I see this all the time
tutorials to keep everything right there
on the same page it's like nah man you
noticing something called MVC man thing
so you could have your your code more
clean and easier to find things
definitely we're setting up templates
you know creating our layout laying down
the header and set up gulp style the
header lay down the home page style the
home page make the about page fixing the
menu like all this stuff just this this
right here is half an hour literally
like you have so much content guys and
what you guys don't understand is right
now all of this stuff you're pretty much
getting everything that I'm building
everything that I've got a bill for you
guys in the future for father's like
there's like the ultimate thank you for
you guys like at five bucks you pretty
much just paying for like hosting you
know what I mean like he's paying for
being able to see all of the stuff and
saying hey I own this so it's like you
holding a space for five hours like all
this stuff takes a lot of time to do
takes a lot of space to do a lot of
bandwidth you know and it just makes
your life easier man like this is just
the beginning somebody send me a message
like Joe are you gonna work on Python
yes are you gonna do the Gold Line quest
yes are you gonna do look you know more
into the PHP because I started the Larry
like a boss
but Larry like a boss is like a a
beginners tutorial it's the first step
to learning it but I haven't told you
guys a whole section a whole course on
PHP and I'm going to do that too all
right I'm doing all of that guys all
that stuff is coming so it's like a
reality when you come in you let go all
this courses and you say okay let me
come in let me see the ones that are
already completed this is completely
there's a whole
that's completed pretty much I'm on the
last video of the react course my Dallas
completed the first project and like I
said yes it's completed but I'm doing
way more projects I might do six seven
projects by the end of this year on just
react
I'll be honest up to six seven projects
it's like this is what I'm doing guys

doing this full-time
I'm here for you guys when you come in
here and you sign up to the website

I do it for you hey Joe I want to learn
this can you explain it to me in a way
that I can understand I do it for you
you know what I mean like I'm doing this
full-time
think about it like this I'm like your
personal instructor when it comes to web
development right for five bucks you
can't go wrong you know 3,000 people on
udemy alone buying courses

this can you do this and that then
you're out of the loop you're not in in
the group in the sense of like you're

that from 90 to 150 I don't know exactly
the same price but lifetime of courses
that's it
like you guys know me I'm here to just
basically knock all this stuff out and

what I mean
but at the chance that you really like
it you really don't want to be out here
spending 15 20 bucks a month for this

now we bout to take it to the next level
into promotion and spending some money
into advertising and spending some money
in a lot of things right you know me

year me you're gonna see the things that
I do you know what I mean I got I come
here every day you see something I knew
Newton that I'm working on new growth or
new courses I'm working also on the
framework which is is gonna call Johnny
Rui which is gonna be like a CSS
framework so I'm doing that it's gonna
be super light it's gonna be nice design
cuz I mean haven't you guys ever used
like something like bootstrapping
bootstrap look like like ish you know
what I mean it looks bad like bootstrap
the the styles of it looks back I
understand why they did it they wanted
to have things like supernote or like
neutral and whatever boy looks it just
looks bad you can't use a bootstrap CSS
anymore like I use it for the grid
everything else looks horrible right now
I basically created my own framework
we're gonna be doing that I wanna
freakin promote that out there to have
more developers using get all the stars
in the world half a whole bunch of blogs
talk about your key like things are
coming up like right now I told you guys
just the other day I just got a mention
on a major on a major blog about hyper
app right and I'm redoing the whole
project that I did for hyper app because
now I'm gonna take it to the next level
a lot of people told me like yo this
this is a legit course I said hmm it
wasn't when I did it it was more like a
first reaction to hyper app it wasn't
like I wanted this thing to blow up so
what I'm gonna do is I'm redoing it in a
proper way breaking it down explaining
it better showing it to people like hey
you know cuz when I created the low six
videos on hyper half it was just so
quick it was like like you know it's
like my reaction so I should call
instead of a tutorial should call it
hyper every action right or you know
react to hyper app whatever so but right
now we go hard man
today's the last day guys it's that
simple
I don't know what to tell you man today
is the last day you will now be seeing
the 5 other specials no more we gotta
eat man I'll be honest I gotta eat I'm
starving you see me I got I can't even
afford right now to get a haircut that's
how bad things are right now you know I
mean like I'm doing bad kid I'm doing oh
god yeah man let me see let me see let
me see who's in here let's see the
people that's in here now man Freddy
Martinez you got your boy David yang we
got your boy Charles
we got yo Charles I wonder if that was
you do like last night I'm up working on
things I got 4 o'clock in the morning
and I see Charles logged ain't Charles I
think Charles hunter jr. is something
working at 4 o'clock in the morning like
whoa why is Charles working at this time
like why are you learning at this time
it's 4 o'clock in the morning go to
sleep
like I understand me like I'm working it
in knocking tutorials out for you guys
when it's like it's 4 o'clock in the
morning go to sleep let me see who else
is in here we got will it will H Tyler
Benton let me see creative rod he'll
Hodge yo Tyler I made sure that you're
in I know you use the PayPal so you're
already in let me know if you have any
problems you should be already in it let
me see who else
clone Leroy I told you send me an email
man I told you if you're under 16 years
old
listen if you're under 16 years old I
I'm giving it to you for free like
you're getting the the free access man
if you're on the film you know 16 17
years old
alright automatically free just because
I know how it is when you're like in
junior high school in high school and
you're like interested in this stuff and
you like man I can't even buy anything I
don't even have a credit card so I'm
giving it out to all the juniors in high
school and you know in high school
students and also to this like everybody
who's here
think about it too like that like you
also like doing something good like I
don't even throw this out there that
much but I pretty much give out for free
a lot of courses to people who can't
afford it or just won't be able to log
in or won't be able to buy anything I
give it out for free but you're doing
like some charity work and it's just
like karma comes back to you like I'm
doing all this work I'm sometimes I'm
tired whatever but good things are
happening to me because I'm doing good
stuff for other people you know for you
guys when you guys signed up for this in
reality this is like an ecosystem right
you know the people that can't afford it
will afford them by in sign up for it
right the people that just kept a 40 or
they're just too young to even have a
credit card they get it for free right
now some people want to be like oh man
why why I gotta take care of the you
know the people that can't afford it
whatever guys it just is good karma man
trust me it's good karma is like you
know is the money's being put into
something positive right so when I come
in and I just get something I pass it
down it trickles it literally trickles
down to everybody here right so we just
can't buy into this course what came and
signup these people don't even have
credit cards they don't even have credit
cards in certain countries that they
could use you know I had to open up the
the PayPal because a lot of people don't
even have credit cards it sounds crazy
but it's true so I did that for those
people but there's like a whole bunch
you know like Quan Li
there's a whole bunch of young kids who
are like you know 16 17 15 years old who
hit me up all the time when I go I want
to learn I want to get into this what do
you think 16 years old should do should
I quit high school I'm like now finish
it high school go to college you know
but here's a free course he is the free
courses he's done the membership for
free just so you could continue it and
you know you know by the time you get
over your first year your second year of
college you're able to get a nice
internship or a nice job and then you
can say hey I did this because of people
from coding fees calm in reality you
know what I mean so it trickles down you
know so that's the thing man we here to
help me we there's no point of me doing
this if nobody sees it you remember when
I was doing a lot of tutorials here for
free on YouTube
nobody was seen and nobody was using
them right I'd go in a post a a freaking
free course on udemy over two thousand
people going there taking it right now
you know it's like hearing you to lose
like some people might watch you some
people might not watch it I dropped
something on udemy for free it's like
piranhas you know it's like eating
everything you know it's like they
trying to learn so that's what I wanted
to do from the beginning let me say yo
Casey say you're doing the six seven
projects and react and I hear that right
I was until we did the survey the survey
says that more people wanted to be mixed
and it's it makes sense because in
reality if you come in and do six
projects and react yes you're really
good and you become really good and
react right but if we come in and we say
hey my portfolio has multiple multiple
frameworks and not even frameworks but
programming languages because in reality
is we're gonna have CSS HTML CSS bug
we're gonna have react we're gonna have
PHP
and we're gonna have no GS that's where
we doin the five projects right now for
react react by the end of the year by
the end of 2017 should have six to seven
projects individually the first project
that we did was a major project of three
on the real-estate app right it's just
filtering searching sorting is a lot
right there from a we doing other other
other tutorials inside us that same
course so deal because I finished that
project doesn't mean the react course is
complete like you you're supposed to
come back to the website and every day
look at what the new things that are
there you do a it's like you signed up
for a subscription you're supposed to be
able to come here and see new things
every day that's why you are supporting
the channel where that's why you
supporting the website it's not supposed
to be like oh that's it the course is
dining that's what I got nah because
every holiday you guys are not gonna be
able to become masters of react by just
doing X you have to build other projects
right in multiple diverse projects for
you to really get good so that's where
my website comes in whereas like hey I'm
constantly doing projects for you guys
like forever you know what I really like
you're gonna start seeing things that
you're gonna make yourself a better
developer you know it's like it leaves
out the mess of like coming home going
to like say in example do a free call
can you finish freako camp and then
you're like oh what project should I do
they are freaking hundreds of projects
on my website you have enough projects
to do you know what I mean like instead
of just buying a courses on carefreeness
of course now what projects that I do
should I do
nah this are a whole bunch of projects
on the website you signed up for it now
you have all those projects to do by the
time this really no nothing where we say
hey this is complete this is finished
when I say complete
it means learning is complete react by
the end of the real estate app is
complete the course itself is never
gonna be completely because we're always
going to be adding new projects with
like guys there's only so much that I
could do like I could come here and be
like hey I'm gonna do all the courses
right let's say an example if by the end
of the year I go and do HTML CSS
JavaScript nodejs angular react in our
laravel I do all those things right I
just said my my butt off in my house and
just be like oh hey guys I finished all
my courses huh that's not gonna happen
because then I'm gonna be boring you
think I wanna be home it would I had
nothing to do nah I'm gonna continue
doing and adding projects to each course
saying you get what I'm doing with this
whole website like this is like a never
ending site you know and that's my plan
that's what I want to do and what's
crazy - I've got two other developers
who have hit me up and they want to add
courses to the website I have this guy
who who does c-sharp who's pretty good
which I liked them about that he's like
yo I got the sauce too bro I want to do
c-sharp videos for your website I'm like
oh shoot coming - you know what I mean
like it's coming together now like now
I'm getting other people that want to
come in
put courses on my website put it in who
ever like Johnny front of block I'm
putting people that's gonna be legit and
people that's not gonna bore you to
death you know what I mean and real
projects like don't come in here with a
freaking hey let's build a to-do app you
can see sharp now I mean make a real
project you know what I mean so that's
what we're doing right now man
I hope you guys really yeah I really
appreciate what we're doing man so let
me see who else is saying here we got am
cold
we got Charles we got cattle gum I don't
know who's that but thank you for
signing up
we got Phillipe relented gomez let me
see
but they'll come bro who else
Tyler Brent and I were to say let me see
who else is in here
Casey Ben say Casey already let me see
am code Barbara let me see who else
let me see
Ramsey Jordan we got O'Brian we got
ak-47 we got Christian go can't find the
PayPal option go back to the page it
should be there for the people that want
to see the PayPal option show you that's
right now she had a screen going to get
all access pass
hello Access Pass let me do it in there
incognito okay all courses get all
access passed and then down here at the
bottom technically you can enroll right
here but the problem is PayPal has
special rules when it comes to
subscription so teachable Candle
subscriptions especially at sir
prices so if you want us to do a
one-time purchase like let's say an
example of course it's not 300 you guys
get 50% off but that's the real prices
that people are paying online right now
you see this you got the credit card you
got paypal your options right now if
you're signing up for the five dollar
special or the $45 special which is the
yearly you basically get it right here
right you come here you click Subscribe
and then here you go
$5 US dollars each month right now any
moment you can cancel it is up to you
personally I will say guys leave it for
a month or two reminding you guys like
this website is brand new they might if
you see a bug send it to me that's fine
there was a bug I fixed it I talked to
the people from teachable they fixed it
right away
um first like we can say the first month
of like legit like a lot of courses in
there so I'll be honest I would say
leave it for a month or two if you're
thinking hey I'm gonna cancel and I'm
gonna sign up for $5 and take advantage
for one month and you're gonna cancel at
the end of the month
leave it to at least the next month
because what's gonna happen is the
moment you cancel it it's no longer a
five you know what I mean is no longer
at five like you cancel it it's gone you
know what I mean so what I will say is
keep it at five and you're good it's
like a it's like you're paying five
dollars to have unlimited courses every
month it's like a personal the Spotify
of web development you know what I mean
think about it like that right
the moment you you cancel it is gone as
like back to whatever the price might be
at the moment
and it's all about how icon is demanding
whatever I forgot them
what's that saying the man said the man
but somebody helped me I was the same
yeah you guys are really good with this
stuff where it's like demanding and some
supply and demand right so the whole
pricing is done on supply demand the
more people that want to sign up is
gonna be at you know 10 15 20 bucks
right right the last people I want to
sign up then I'll come back down to ten
is its automatic the pricing is
automatic I set it up that it's out of
my hands because in reality I'm I'm
putting in you guys know me man I'm very
transparent right I'm coming in I'm
making three dollars out of the five
dollars that you guys pay right from the
three dollars the USP oh pretty much I'm
just using it to pay all the stuff that
I gotta pay you know to survive in this
world I need at least seven thousand a
month right so I have other income all
right thank God I have savings too but I
need seven dollars all right the
earnings that I'm using from this I'm
not really earning anything yet from
everybody that's signing up right now
this is not me
earning anything yet if I do earn
anything like let's say profit is gonna
be after the third mark because all the
money that people put in now
I'm using that to pay advertising to pay
for you know advertising other websites
and other places I'm using this now by
way to pretty much help out others and
also make this into you know some type
of community that we could all eat from
this you know what I mean like there's
people here who I want to make
moderators people who I want to say hey
you're moderated he's a
upset you know a set on payment you know
for every time that your Madhuri about
the website you know the leaked comments
or whatever you know the whole shebang
like I'm trying to do this legit for the
next there is no profit right I'm not
making a profit at all because all that
money is being put into for advertising
so we could go to the next level right
like by next year you ain't gonna see
this
you ain't gonna see the the raggedy
raggedy Curtin no more yeah I ain't
seeing that Kareem no more it's gonna be
a studio we're gonna have a nice studio
we're gonna have a nice recording studio
I also want to have a nice filming
studio with the nice lights and
everything I want to have a section
where I could bring in all my my
students or the subscribers or anybody
who's in the New York area you guys can
come in it's chill hang out we do live
videos too you know life tutorials like
that's the whole idea of this and the
only way for me to do it is to really
take it up a notch we already we killing
the camera on YouTube right I'm thinking
in my hand like y'all you know I look I
calculate how I look at things right at
a hundred thousand views make five
hundred bucks for me to write in my head
okay
I look at Chris hogs I look at all who
else
Chris Hawkes that's a simple programmer
those guys they and a couple of other
ones you know traversing media a couple
other ones they already got like 200
hundred thousand two hundred thousand
subscribers right I don't know of things
it's completely different from ours
mine's is unity I want to get more
courses out there and I want to go live
in life sessions like know if people
meet up with people things like that
they're doing something completely
different they're more into the
views you know like oh I want to get
more views I want to get more
subscribers 100,000 subscribers because
if I I'm being honest if I was to make
and get a hundred thousand subscribers
everything that I do is free
automatically right everything that I do
is free automatically because I know how
to flip things and make things you know
it's like there's a good line man from
my favorite rapper this you know let me
see
i'ma show you I'm going to show you
you'll know something this is a very
good line this is why I tell you guys
you guys the people that don't listen to

about rappers people that come from the
bottom and make something out of nothing

you a good line you know cuz it's like
there's a line for everybody you know I
mean like when I tell you guys a few

tell you guys all the time you because
you had developed but doesn't mean

in you do what you got to do you use
your talents for what you have and make
it into something even greater you know
it's like I don't even know what to say
