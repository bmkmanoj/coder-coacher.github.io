part which is the area where the
messenger is going to be yet so as far
as like people sending you messages and
who's online who's not online etc
alright so let's get started
so let's look at the section let's see
what we have we have messenger we had
the messenger header now let's come here
and basically create another div this
div is going to be named online users
okay
so online users or I don't know should
we do it online users or let's just say
users okay cool so here we're gonna come
in and we're gonna create a a spot where
we're basically gonna say class user and
then div like that okay cool
now the next thing that we want to do is
basically coming here let me look at the
image so we got image here and then we
got the name of the person okay so let's
do this like that so div class user
image you guys should be used to this
already so we got user image then below
it we're gonna have user name I just say
user name and yeah
so I'm gonna put here
James doe save that okay now we're gonna
copy the same thing that we've been
doing we did this before you got the
image okay yeah I copy it from here just
to make our lives easier this is the
same thing that we've been doing this
whole time so don't be surprised by it
technically in all this user images
that's like this we supposed to put it
in a style so inline it okay come back
do it like this make sure you align it
so you get the syntax highlighting okay
there you go
now the next thing that we want to do is
we want to put in single quotes it's out
of here there you go we got the image
okay now so let's say for logged out
users or users you haven't started a
conversation with okay users you haven't
started a conversation with we're gonna
use this color which is like a little
bit lighter so we can come here go all
the way to the bottom find when the
messenger starts okay we will close this
up through here just make a little bit
smaller
okay so we got users
okay users and then we have a container
code user a div then we have user image
and we have user name okay now we're
gonna say color it's going to be this
all right we're gonna say font weight
let's say 300 make it a little bit
skinny okay
we're also going to come in in let me
see what else can we do to this make the
font size a little bit smaller so point
nine Ram okay now inside of the user
we're gonna say display flex okay let's
play flex we're going to also say inside
of user display flex and then justify
content center align items Center so
there you go so that basically centers
it on the side of that container okay
next thing we want to do I say padding
padding left same
15 pixels okay
we're also gonna make the images a bit
smaller so let's come back to two here
we're gonna make the images to be high
30 and with 30 so it could be smaller
okay the user section so this user
section that we have here this whole day
in a padding of 20 pixels top and bottom
and then 15 pixels left and right and
you know what we don't even yeah I think
that's fine okay cool
now let me see how this is okay that's
fine this is fine now I want to be able
to say what we hover on top of the
username right we hover on top of the
username let me do this hold on I'm
gonna put opacity opacity 0.8 okay point
8 on the opacity of the image now when
we hover above a user we're gonna say
hover I want the user image to basically
user image become opacity 1 so it'll be
like full
city okay so it won't be see-through
okay hold on and then we have the
username I want this to become font
weight 700 let me say color is going to
be white okay when we hover on top of it
I also want this to be I say
cursor:pointer so meaning it shows the
little hand when we go over it as you
can see okay we also want this to be
like this we want to have animation so
we're gonna say transition 0.5 seconds
ease in and out usually I like to do
animations like later on but for the
situation is fine we could do it right
now so let's see how it goes let me see
transition Oh
so technically we were supposed to put
it in the user image and also the user
name so I'm just gonna put it here save
that see now you see that animation see
how it goes like that there you go so
good simple it's nothing crazy but you
know it just makes it look a little bit
better you know what I mean so that's
fine now the next thing that we want to
do is we want to add another class to it
so
basically you see how we have here if
we're having a conversation with this
person we want to have the little chat
showing up okay so let's do that now
okay we have two username let's add
another element here which is going to
have see the chat icon let me see if I
could get it from font awesome actually
comments that's or let me see how that
looks
okay you know nothing usernames is gonna
be message or convo conversation
conversation okay
all right below here I'll put in
conversation color white okay gonna cop
still the same thing so it could be
centered I say display flex okay so now
is centered okay we're gonna say
justified content let's say flex end so
it could be at the end okay we also want
to split this up so we want this to be
all the way at the end so we got to give
this a couple of whips so user image
let's say with that's gonna take is
gonna take twenty percent this is gonna
take twenty percent and then this is
gonna take a whiff is gonna be sixty
percent
okay now for this we're gonna say flex
start on the username so like that I can
move it all the way to the left okay so
another thing that we're going to do let
me see we're gonna say use an image we
want to
another class so if user has the class
of active ok if user has a class of
active then what we're going to do is
basically show this this little message
if it doesn't have to the active thing
we're not going to show the message so
we got to come here you'll see if it has
the class of active conversation will
display block okay
our display flex can't display flex
now if conversation doesn't have active
right it's not gonna show it it's going
to say this plain none okay so as you
can see doesn't show anything also we
want to make sure that if it's active we
want let's say let's say for display
active oh let me take this off like this
so face active display user name display
user name and display not display user
name and the user image aren't going to
be showing 100 percent meaning opacity
is going to be opacity is gonna be at
one and then user name font weight it's
gonna be at 700 and color is going to be
at white
okay so refresh this so far right now
this is what we're seeing now the next
thing that we want to do is basically
create a couple of different users so
come in here let's add a few of them so
I'm just pacing a couple of them just so
we could have a whole bunch of users all
right okay now if user has the class of
active then it's going to show the
little message okay so and she's going
to put it in randomly in different spots
so we could you know get something more
more realistic
all right now what we want to do is we
want to give this some padding so as you
can see this thing has padding around it
so let's give each user a padding so
we're gonna say padding top to bottom of
10 pixels zero left it right
I don't know if that's too much
you
okay let me see what else what else we
gonna go to this I think for now I think
this is fine let's focus on the next
spot which is creating the the search
area okay
also - I want to be able to see what's
gonna happen when we create a whole
bunch because it's probably gonna be a
whole bunch of users so let's continue
pasting more users so let me copy this
from here and copy it there okay let me
see how long make sure we got the right
ending and you know what yeah I'm gonna
do this he's gonna continue pasting a
whole bunch of those so I just copied
and pasted the user and pasted a whole
bunch of times okay so as you can see
we're having the same issue from before
where this right here is going over and
now is stretching the page we don't want
that so to fix this what we're going to
do is we're gonna put a set height for
now okay so we're gonna say users let me
see so users the height is going to be
let's say 7
pixels and then overflow is going to be
hitting for now okay but now is gonna be
hitting technically we've got to do the
same thing that we do here where we made
the scroll over we got to do it on this
section here so let's do that now okay
so let's look at our HTML how things are
set up okay so we have the user's
container now let me see hold on users
container okay
still got we got a whole bunch of users
okay so close this now how was it that
we did here we say constant container we
had a Content area which was the the one
from the top and then we had composed
section and no matter of fact we had
updates which was the name of the area
then we had the update container okay so
we're gonna do that right now so we're
gonna say users and put this live class
users container
okay I'm gonna select all of these I
know it could get confusing after a
while you're like wait where exactly am
I the best way to deal with that
situation is make sure you put in
comments I mean for me I can actually
tell exactly where I'm at so my HTML
doesn't really break or it doesn't
really go off like I know exactly where
I'm located but for you guys that
probably don't have too much experience
if you want to save yourself from the
headaches of like having a whole bunch
of HTML issues just make sure you just
put in a comment and say hey this is
users um
this area here starts to use a container
like you could do it like that I say
okay use a container and then you
separate it like that so you know
exactly where you at it's up to you okay
so yeah so we're inside of the user
container okay and we're gonna go to the
CSS
so let's say users user and then here
we're gonna put in side of users users
use our container users container and
we're gonna see overflow:auto and we're
gonna say height 100% save that and as
you can see we get the scroll bar okay
but it just makes the code while the
page itself look ugly ain't having a a
random scrollbar right here like I don't
know that don't really make sense all
right so I'm gonna say with 100% okay so
you can see that's what we're getting
we're going to I
move the padding that we have on this
comment it out because the pattern we're
gonna put inside of this use a container
so we got this we're gonna put in box
size in content box we're gonna say box
socks and box eyes in content box when I
say padding 15 pixels and then 15 pixels
left or right so zero top and bottom and
15 pixels left or right okay now I can
scroll through here you see and there
you go so you have to already set up
because scroll here and I can scroll
here alright now the next thing that we
want to do is basically do the bottom
okay so the
section here is what we want to do so
pretty much let's do it right now
let me see where's my HTML among I'm
gonna close up this whole users
container so we could have space and see
exactly where we at okay so we got the
users now we're gonna do div class okay
search okay now
we're going to do we got the search we
got a input field input type text
okay so we got input type text and let
me see do we have a button there no so
there's no buying okay so here we're
gonna save this gonna come all the way
to the bottom make sure we find where's
the ending of the the user container
okay find the ending of the user and
they're right below it we're gonna add
the search so there's a search input
type text so we got the input type text
we're gonna see background and the
background is going to be what we have
here search input background search
background okay search background sorts
your input background so I'm saying
search background no this is
actually for this for this part for the
search so this is gonna be the
background of the search right and the
background for this one is going to be
search and put background okay let's see
what's going on here see you all right
this isn't showing it's not changing the
background
input type text okay we got class search
messenger search we tried doing this i'm
saying i'm background:white see if
that's working okay so it's not working
must be something that I'm doing wrong
so let's figure it out we got messenger
okay so we are inside of magic messenger
let me cut this out from here make sure
that we're okay so that's why we was
actually inside of users so we want to
be outside of users okay there's a
complete different section all right now
we're gonna say background okay that's
fine let me see input type text see
search so this one was what was it
search background okay I'm gonna say
100% padding on the search we're gonna
say 20 pixels top and bottom and they're
15 pixels left and right okay seems
pretty good now the next thing that we
want to do we're gonna put in 0 border
so we're gonna say border none' I'm
gonna say border radius though we're
gonna say let's say 25 pixels okay let
sighs say a size of say 1.4 rim try that
out see how that goes
okay that's not bad
but let's see the image how it is okay
so it's a little bit too big so one
point tool and let's put in some padding
inside of this all you're gonna see 10
pixels all around I'm gonna say color is
white all right cool now see you guys
may see it's getting a little bit out of
hand as far as the sizing so let's do
this let's figure it out it was like 12
pixels and then the size of of this
should be around like 36 36 pixels so
okay let me put this at at one rim okay
okay that's better let me make sure let
me check the size on this yeah that's
fine so yeah alright so there's a couple
of things that I want to change and I
want to show you guys how easy it is to
just find the answer to things like
sometimes you might be like man I don't
know what to do how to do this see the
grain now let's say you wanted to change
this search box right and you can't
remember how to do have a dilemma mean
there's a million different syntaxes out
there right little really Google is your
friend you come here say change
placeholder color okay there you go
w3schools
you know there's a different selector
for it cool so you pretty much copy this
okay now on our CSS we're gonna come
here we're gonna say like this and paste
that in okay delete that from there we
don't need no comments there the color
of it should be I will tell you right
now color should be this so color there
you go
okay and there you go then we have our
placeholder yeah we could do the same
thing you know one thing that's always
annoying is this default blue highlight
that it has you could use literally
search there remove blue highlight from
input how to remove the border highlight
on input text
pretty much somebody already found the
answer is for the Focusrite so we want
to do this throughout the whole website
like I really hate that little outline
to be honest with you guys so we're
gonna put this as a default at the
bottom here so it'll go throughout the
whole website so any input view any
select select type or text area or
button when we click on it it's not
gonna be you know outline okay so now
you see we are good now the last thing
that we want to fix is the height of
this here okay because it's going
overboard all right it's going over if
you scroll through here you'll see that
it actually this is the area we're
supposed to stop all right
but the container now is bigger than
what we actually set it which
technically we wanted it to be just 800
pixels and that's because on this side
this thing is going over it so let's
make sure on the messenger we see like
this say height 800 pixels okay
so now we got to fix this here so we got
to come here and we got to do a
calculation so the height of this this
container let us say this one should be
hmm let's think about it and see what we
have two other one the container we got
content area
okay so constant area is 800 so that's
800 all right so this right here should
be 800 minus whatever size this is okay
so the search field is actually the high
of 78 so the height of the users should
be 800 minus 78 pixels
okay let me see something
come back here so 800 pixels minus 78
pixels so we're going to do calc
okay so technically at the 800 minus 78
pixels but I didn't take into account
this right here okay
so the height of this container of the
header right is 50 3.33 so now we've got
a basically say 78 a calculator bring
out the calculator you can never go
wrong 78 plus 50 3.33 131 point 33 so
let's say 130 1.33 pixels okay and there
you go now everything is perfect it's
exactly the height that we want okay and
as you can see shadows is there we got
everything that we want
we got the search box here so yeah we're
pretty much done guys so now is when are
we gonna start building to other pages
and all the cool things and I hope you
guys like this video
as far as we've gone in this the
introduction to the project now we're
gonna start working on the logic and
working on the controllers and routes
and all the good stuff okay so yeah I'll
see you guys in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
