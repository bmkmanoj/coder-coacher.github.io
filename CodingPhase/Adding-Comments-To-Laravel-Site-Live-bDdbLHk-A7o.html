it again man coding fees calm listen
guys I'm about to just ask some comments
to basically my laravel application
which is coding phase calm and I say you
know what man maybe somebody is gonna
find this useful you know in the future
a year from now two years from now so
you know what I'm gonna do is life and
then from there I'm gonna hang out with
you guys for a little bit alright if you
don't mind
alright he already knows if I joke back
at it again man coding face.com so let's
get it started by it let me switch up
the screen so you guys see everything
here okay there you go let's hit them up
so this is what we at now all of this is
working so python whatever right so Q&amp;amp;A
is is there the blocks is there the
links is there now we got to make
basically the comments pop-up so this is
where the comments is going to show up
and what I'm gonna do is I'm going to
create this with a fork and basically
I'm not doing anything with Ajax I might
do it later on or everything I'm doing
it in PHP just to set up all the
controllers and different day later on
I'm gonna act and react to the website
and yeah alright so there's what we have
I just created the controller so you
basically say hey PHP artisan main
controller common controller right PHP
artisan make model comic right and I
already have a controller named post and
a model named post alright so what we're
gonna do from here is very simple
basically comments is one too many so
we're gonna look at the documentation
just to show you guys how to go here
find out basically come here laravel com
click on documentation on the top it
will throw you on this page then from
there you will say hey let's look at the
relationships we know that
there's one post and one post Can Has
can have many different comments right
so that's a one-to-many relationship
so what we do here is we come to the
post model and you basically copy this
right we come to the post model is that
there okay now basically it tells you
here that it goes by user ID so now
let's go to the post let's go to a
common man
matter-of-fact sorry okay so they go to
the comment now on the comment you
basically copy this which is the inverse
of the one-to-many relationship come to
comment I think I already did it but go
ahead
all right now well we gotta do is we
gotta create a migration to this thing
so I'm gonna say PHP artisan make
migration now for you guys that have no
idea how to do this you can look at the
documentation all of this info is there
so you click on database migrations and
then right here shows your PHP artisan
migration make migration create users
table copy this we need to just copy
this whole thing right copy from there
and let's do it let's just copy and
paste it for no reason just to show you
how to do it alright so create comments
table alright you can also create this
like this and say okay it's going to be
named create comments oops
v8 commas table pasted out there so what
that's gonna do is it's gonna make the
table already mean
well press Enter the migrations created
now from there
all right we're gonna come here and then
I say oops um start closing things up
all right come to the database come to
the migration now it should be here
create ups this thing I'll refresh it
okay so create comments what I have to
do is just refreshed up the finder for
some reason Visual Studio code is an
idiot and doesn't refresh by itself all
right so we got this right we got
comments cool now let's add the tables
right let's annotates to this well
basically a comma is going to have this
uh description I'm just gonna name this
description right oops
name it sex then prescription all right
and then from there what else does it
have has post ID post underscore ID make
this Angela okay mess anyway until the
database make sure we're here migrations
you got all the different types here so
you could actually take a look so let's
say integer sorry
put an extra extra R on it
all right let me see what else would be
so we can make the subtext of the
scripts ooh the description is gonna
have just the the regular text that the
people put in you know whatever comment
they want
leave right I usually just like to name
a description just to follow the same
conventions throughout the whole website
okay so let me see so we have text then
the clothes ID and then copy it is
because our ID and let me see I think we
good for now we got the description
which is whatever people are going to
type and they're gonna leave their
comments and about lol whatever I hate
this
you know FML whatever it is alright post
ID which is going to relate it to the
post and then from there the user ID so
we can know who actually created this
post
well this comic right in the time stamps
is the time I got created the time that
I got updated let's see so I think that
that should be fine now let's go to the
view let's go to the view right
resources views and then a half
everything here so show posts right now
this is commentary oh cool alright now
that is the list let's put this so
that's the comment area we're going to
do we just gonna copy what I already
have in other places just to make my
life easier
one of the best things about being a
developer is that you know sometimes if
you already found the answer to
something it's like there's no point of
you rewrite it I'm gonna find something
for okay that's too far
tags here that should be right shouldn't
be right all right so we're gonna take
this cop it is into the show polls well
the common area and then close this
close that okay let me copy missing box
primary how should I set this up I have
a set of Doug the desire for it yet so
I'm just basically winging this whole
thing right now
I wanted to let cuz it's like I have no
desire so that I don't know exactly how
I should design this actually the HTML
I'm just winging it right now guys
although I see all right well okay
channel D is getting me error all right
this is fine too messy I gotta make a
wrap for this channel data slash
pull slug and then here comic okay save
that and we close distance we don't need
it
okay now why got to do is fix in the
patroller okay let's see okay show
alright so it is the show function okay
now for this to work I need to get this
info show show show show
now this time for I think I might have
toes already in there I have this
information already in there so Missy so
the channel is really done the channel
slug so maybe the coolest to say post oh
my god sorry
oh okay so we can let me check the forum
did it go through channel nodejs testing
wrist k slash comic let the post okay
that's fine
cool so remember we have the csr a field
is what generates the toll the token for
it hidden token let's see what else cool
channel data i d-- let me see do I need
this channel data I don't think so I
don't think I need that I don't need to
think I think that either all right let
me see I got style this thing better cuz
it looks like okay let's delete
this because we don't need a title
see what was the end see if I could
format this thing move
we just told you Koloff is good for for
matters in future format she's pretty
 okay
so we'll see that'll do something the
settings this is annoying me right now I
say me go go - okay pre see Google your
friend guys like you guys you have to
look at a Google for sure guys let me
see if this worked
floor mat Babybel clean it up a little
bit you know all right let me see what
else let's see see how we gonna do
listing please okay
sorry guys I'm taking a long time
because I'm actually trying to fix this
frickin HTML if I don't have a design
for it so I'm just like winging it like
super winging it all right now all right
whatever and go to create blog this is
this
all right why is this give them you see
I don't know better fine where it's
messing up back okay somewhere else

control
okay mouse since I already did this
before from the post I can come here
just pretty much copy it copy this okay
I'm going to copy this whole thing and
then I just gotta take other things that
don't need here there's a common
controller okay we have a common
controller and what we're going to do is
we're going to strip this whole thing up
you know take it till here okay so new
pulse change this to calm it because
we're creating a new comment just say
now okay comics what else
buh-buh-bah now we don't need this we
don't need this switch either none of
that stuff be all of that Wow cause they
don't need title on fact we might want
to use this require unique comments no

max say now what if I not even know max

what we gonna do is see what we got a
copy and paste I need this alright I've
cleaned it up a little bit now what else
we're going to do is I'll create another
box when are we gonna basically display
the comments so it's just a Content box

gotta do so we did this cool okay we see
brows oh yeah we got a display the
collar I don't know I feel like maybe
doing the same thing here for a comment
until I find like a better design or
something
alright so to build something better so
let me see the content box the copy desk
press okay cool now let's edit this it
doesn't matter it's going to give it to
single cut people asking questions about
outside like what happened outside of
the company outside haven't been outside
all day man
how about although I know what that was
good is it was like a car accident

something wrong here okay comment or
pull side the equals first shall only be

justice it doesn't need a link you are
okay spend your error because that error
coming from
you get an error side maybe this
- is the error yeah one of the
stones I wanted it was like the most
annoying thing I hate when this should
happen so I was like you can't figure
out why this thing is not submitting it
could be I'm just I'm trying to remove
on a validation oh wait this one's still
here that's fine yeah should do should
go through yeah went well all right all
right cool okay create a link let's see
see what everybody's working on I'm
going to go back and watch from the
start
Joe fire - marry and kill Dean tree
house you me Linda okay
I will kill Linda tree house and
marry you
that's what I would do do you think it
would be possible to get a job before
six months by taking any courses of
course I mean that's what I did like you
know you guys could definitely do it
guys it's not a big thing like it's not
you know what people think about this
and like all men are dinosaurs careers
I'm going to do something completely
different guys it's the same way how you
got a job which is you apply you apply
for it and show up most of companies
they they want to hire people because
they don't have enough people working on
a project that I've man me you know we
need at least two developers for at
least six months right even if they hire
you just for six months or three months
that's fine we just go in there and be
good I just freaking work for those
three months and then apply to another
job you're going to get so much
experience from working in a company
that is definitely worth it
okay I think you're creating things I
think you've created you created things
one during the course and doesn't really
give you experience on fixing bugs etc
yeah fixing bugs that's gonna happen
like for experience right you got to
look at your code sometimes you miss the
semicolon sometimes you copy the wrong
thing or it's like that what am I using
vs code just for the hell of it I've
been trying to get used to it just
because I don't know a lot of people use
mvs code and sometimes I'm like I'm
gonna try to sell any I get bored of
using Adam
I get bored of music all the other
editors that I have my computer so
sometimes I just want to switch it up to
employers employers you interview with
look at your color before hiring or
connection of the malinka 441 1/2 again
yes of course
nobody has some time I'm being honest
guys nobody has some time to look at
anybody's code when you go into a job
interview
nobody I'm being honest with you guys
like nobody has time to me look into
your code a minute oh my god this person
he comes like this he calls bad he does
this nut you find out once you're hired
it's very rare like there's rare
occasions when like let's say if you're
going for an engineering position at
Google they might look at your call
because it's Google you know
what I mean but if you gotta get hired
at a company are oh no freaking
capital wongkom they're not
gonna look through your code what they
care about is can you build the the
things right cuz every job has its own
way to doing things so no matter what
company you go to or how much experience
you have you have to learn how they do
it meaning you gotta go through the
whole process of learning learning what
what their development is like you gotta
learn how how to install all the plugins
or whatever whatever they're using even
though sometimes even little things as
hey you can only use two spaces as
indentation don't use for so code could
be clean it all depends on the company
sometimes they they they go hard you
know sometimes they might actually buy
it can we look at your code then yeah
show the little github it
doesn't really matter but 80% of the
time guys I'm being honest you know out
of 10 companies eight are not gonna ask
you for your code what they care about
is hey show us what you did explain how
you did um you know how you build the
website
why you use the certain frameworks or
why you use a certain language to build
a and then that's it if you can show
them that hey you know your stuff
and that you're a quick learner so
meaning if right now they're looking for
somebody who is technically a web
developer right but all your stuff isn't
no GS but then when you get there
they're like you know our stack is in
Python do you think you can learn Python
you can say yeah I know the all the
basics of JavaScript I know all the
basics of basically of web development
and how the front end and the back end
is even though I know a lot of the stuff
in nodejs I can still implement that to
Python like it doesn't take that that
much for you to learn any language once
you learn one language you know all of
them it's that simple
you're not gonna be a master at all of
them but you're gonna be able to go in
there do what you got to do on your job
you know it's okay to look at Google
nobody gives a I'm being honest
nobody cares about this like this
idea that people think like oh you can't
go on Google because it doesn't make you
a good developer employers don't care
about that the only people that care
about that is the Nerds the nerds who
are here who are like oh man I'm super
smart because I can remember the
ten thousand properties of CSS is like
bro you have no life like regular people
half a life they have other to do
they can't go in there and
remember every function that PHP has
like you know I mean like if you guys
start thinking about that if you start
thinking like oh I'm gonna remember
everything that studying all of this
stuff
no nobody cares about that all people
care about is taking build a
website and build a site that's what
people care about trust me like there's
so many companies out there you don't
have to work for the top 1% on your
first job you don't have to work on
those you know those crazy
companies you don't have to work for
 Facebook Dropbox Google whatever
those companies
that make you go to a whole bunch of
 for your first job it's like you
don't need that it's like all you need
to do is get a job put money in your
pocket start working and then from there
you're gonna be good man it's like right
now call apply to Google and most likely
they will set me because of all the
that I've done over five years right now
it's the same thing now if I would have
went in on my first year as a developer
applying to Google heaven no they wasn't
gonna let me because I didn't know how
to explain things I didn't even know how
I was building things and why I was
using certain tools now I can go into an
interview explain all that if I
have to all right but luckily I've been
blessed I don't need that it's like
I'm making the same amount as most of
the developers around the country or
more than some areas in is because I
don't care about you know the details
like you know some people that just they
focus so much in the details and they
focus on like hey I'm gonna learn every
little thing in this world and people
don't care about that people they care
as can you do the job
alright sorry I gave you a little rent
um but yeah man I'm about to be out kids
and I'm gonna step for a while I started
like I eleven o'clock in morning so
crappy morning today so even though you
guys seen this live video no flick and
now it's two hours I've been doing this
 for a long time work on this page
the whole thing fixing bugs
cleaning things up adding new things I
mean it's getting there it's getting
very close to a finished product so yeah
I'm excited about that because then now
