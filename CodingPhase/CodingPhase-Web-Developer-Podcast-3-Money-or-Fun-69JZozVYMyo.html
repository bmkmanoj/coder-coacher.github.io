Joe back at it again man kong face calm
with your boy milk stars grow so I was
going on guys this book stars Malik
whatever you want to call me I'm just
here trying to spit some web development
knowledge with my boy couldn't phase
over here so yeah alright guys so yeah
you know what I had this topic where I
was thinking about it and I wanted to
pretty much talk about is it better to
get into coding for the money or for fun
but before we start into that tell the
people little bit about you okay alright
so for those of you that haven't seen my
channel so I am a full stack engineer at
eighteen t right now I'm working a lot
with doing like react and note stuff and
I thought I had a whole bunch of little
kids back home they were like oh you
should make videos and stuff so I was
like okay I'll make a couple tutorial
videos so now I'll may I make a to
teaching videos but I throw my own
little bit of comedy into it that way
it's like more interesting because I
feel like there's not enough people like
coding phase and krishan that are like
real with like what they're our stances
on web development and give their own
spin on it just to make it more
personable because there's a lot of
personal people in the field they're
just the it gets really overwhelming
especially with the projects and stuff
so yeah okay got your boy milk stores in
the gut yeah man man wanted to work with
you for elementum man seen your video on
JavaScript it was just like man I even
put you out i think in my top 15 worked
upon a person is like back in the
beginning back when I just started piano
and I wasn't man i just found you chat i
was like man I like that kid man he's
going to places man he's going to be big
one is these things like my boy milk
stars out here killing them right now so
freaking so let's get to it man it's
okay what do you think man like matter
of fact tell them a little bit how do
you start a wave of a web development
day you just start straight to what
developmental you was doing
program in Java or something else before
okay yeah so it's a little bit of a
weird story so like I always did like
computer stuff when I was a kid so I
like used to mess around like like you
know how like you said you used to do
like myspace web sites for people yeah
yeah I used to I'd used to do like small
like websites for like friends and stuff
and i ended up those like starting doing
uh like freelance stuff but like really
really really small stuff i got like
paid like what like fifty a hundred
dollars for most of the last i did and
it wasn't about the money i just thought
it was really fun because i was a really
creative person uh so i thought it was a
really good outlet for my creativity and
basically i went to this uh my computer
k my mom sent me to when I was like 15
and I went there for like I've been
actually wonder for a couple years
before that and then I started working
there and I taught web development to
like little kids like nine nine to
fifteen year olds that was like the best
five years like ever it was so much fun
but uh I got a lot of practice or I
guess a good solid understanding of like
the fundamentals from doing that like
teaching the basics HTML to JavaScript
from that and then like when I graduated
college I started I was like her what am
i what am I gonna do with my life like
I'm not gonna I went to school for
aviation management that was me an air
traffic controller like one of those
guys up in the towel you know you know
guiding left and right you know you know
you know and uh basically that was like
nah that's not gonna work out ourselves
like all right you know I always did
this web development stuff so I thought
I would just go and give that a shot and
I ended up going like I mean I brushed
over some stuff cuz there was a lot of
stuff I didn't know at the time and I
was able to get a job after like like
seven eight months now that's something
i wanted i want to mention like I I had
like six years of like experience
whatever you want to call it like if you
if I look at my resume I have like six
seven years of experience but it still
took me seven seven up seven months to
find a mid-level position
and love development so yeah that's kind
of how I got into it well oh and that's
really good that you share that part of
the story because also to a lot of
people thinks it's like hey man I'm just
gonna come in this thing and get a job
the next day it doesn't work like that
some people you know sometimes it's a
mixture of luck the right moment the
right time the sky turn blue and the
moon came out like once yeah that
happens is like okay yeah you get the
job right away what even for myself like
uh it really took me like a year to get
like a legit job because yeah you could
get a job in freaking whatever
little agency around the corner to get
like a real job like you gotta have your
stuff ready cuz they're gonna ask you
certain questions that you know you know
that you gotta explaining you got to be
able to show the work so it's like you
either gotta have a very good portfolio
or have you know work from different
clients that you've done in freelance in
whatever or pretty much just like you
know it's just like luck it just happens
you know yeah like when I saw that like
krishan got his job in three months when
I I actually found out about him through
that Cora post he had where he got like
like what a million views or something
or like were shared with a million
people and like I saw that I was like
how the hell did he get a job in three
months i'm over here struggling what the
what the hell did this guy do
differently and it's just like it wasn't
that he did everything differently he
just kind of like he was in the right
place at the right time exactly like you
said yeah exactly because that's just
how it is like for me like even I've
been messing around with with website
since 14 years old like it not nothing
new like I know HTML since 14 so CSS i
will say i didn't get to learn it to
later on because there was like more
advanced stuff that I learned when the
beginning low in the regular HTML I know
that I 14 years old is like you know
what I mean then if I was to be like
technically you know and say oh yeah
i've got almost 20 years of experience
like you know it sounds crazy but in
reality you don't have that you know
those 20 years because it is more when
you go to a job interview they're gonna
actually start things that you like okay
you gotta
basically explained you know frameworks
explain object-oriented programming
databases stuff that you don't do in
your daily routine of like you know your
little projects that you do at home you
know exactly yeah so it takes a little
time to just get ready or even get the
confidence I got for like I was ready
yet I was running probably like at three
four months but I didn't even apply for
jobs because I was like man I don't even
have a website I don't even have
projects for our clients I don't even
have a resume I gotta have another that
so it took me a whole year to actually
get a job because he ain't even apply no
no yeah well when I would start when I
started when I at the end of my senior
year when I started looking for jobs all
I had was the website that I had for my
for my little web development business
that I had when I was like 14 15 and it
was so ugly like I am pretty sure like I
looked at some other website like that
was in high school I was like web
developer huh oh I'm just gonna copy
this guy's website and i literally just
tried to remake his and it was really it
was really crappy and a lot of people
are like what what is this like getting
back you think this is a website like
you need you need to work so like I had
to spend a whole bunch of time trying to
figure out like how to make a website
look better and stuff and out that suck
because there's so much that goes into
it that people don't know about yeah man
so yeah so let's go to the main topic
again Oh learn you know to program
because of the money or because I've
just for fun just by hey I just want to
learn you know what I mean and when I
say that is because I'm usually saying
hey learn something that you're gonna
basically get something out of it
meaning learn skills that you're going
to be able to implement to something
else or get pay for me because I'm in
reality time is money you know what I
mean yeah I feel that hey hey hey hey we
got his oozing here hey what's going on
y'all what's going on I admit what we
always do
get all right man hey likewise we're not
the squad man yeah so what we were
saying basically is like shall we should
we or learn programming because of of
money of the money that you can make
learn a skill because the money that you
can make or because just for the fun
just for your own knowledge personal
knowledge what do you guys think all
right well I'm gonna go ahead and start
it off I guess so basically uh you
should really always get started just
for um just for the fun at first because
if you go into anything with the
intention of making money uh it's always
going to take all the fun out of it and
there's a lot of fun to be had with web
development I spent like hours just
trying out a whole bunch of different
like effects and color combinations and
different like just testing out the
stuff that you can do and basically I
mean ice that's kind of still how I
approach it the money was always a
secondary because you can always do
other things to get more money if money
is really that big of a problem I get a
second job or that sort of thing so
whenever people saying like oh and I'm
doing this and I'm only going to get a
job if it gives me like six figures or
I'm only becoming a web developer I was
gonna be paid me six figures 100k
hundred twenty Kay a year I'm just like
dude you're gonna go in there the work
is gonna be really rough and you're
going to be miserable and you're gonna
be like why did I even decide to do this
like this was a mistake so I really
think you gotta find the fun in it first
and then you could think about the money
because obviously we got to eat out here
but yeah that's nice I definitely agree
agree which one that you know it's like
oh I think I don't know for me it was a
different different time when I started
learning how to program and even till
now I always tell people is like may try
to learn something that you're gonna get
something back alright well at the same
time is if you have no love for this
this thing is gonna kill you because you
got understand this is like you're
constantly going to find blocks there's
things that's going to be blocking your
way it's like you think oh yeah
I'm gonna get to the end of this
freaking cold and everything's gonna
work and next thing you know it's like
you missed like a semi calling somewhere
you know thirty thousand lines before
and it's like oh man now you can't
figure out where where the code is
broken or whatever if you don't have a
certain type of love for this thing
you're gonna pretty much just Haiti you
know so yeah i will definitely say you
gotta have some type of love for it but
yeah so what do you think azuz for sure
man totally like i was truck driving for
a while and the reason why i was truck
driving was for the money you know what
I mean the money was good but then it's
like it's not something that I liked and
I was just like I don't want to be doing
this for the rest of my life you know
what I mean I was just thinking that to
myself and I got a degree in music I
can't really I mean I can't really do
nothing with it but do more schooling
and I can't i'm not in a position where
i can do that because i got a family you
know and when i came upon coding and I I
didn't realize how much I liked it until
I started doing it and I was like wow
cool i really want to do this you know
what i mean and i'm just you can't stop
me bro like I'm just I'm just going at
it and going at it you know what I mean
and like you say there comes into
problems like in your code and you're
like shoot man you get frustrated but
you have to persevere you know what I
mean you got to keep going and know that
that that problem can be solved and then
you can go to the next thing you know
what I mean it's just it's fun to do and
when you're the crib when you're in a
career that you appreciate and that you
like and you have fun at I mean you'll
have little problems here and there but
for the most part you're going to be
doing what you like to be doing you know
yeah so there's all that ya know it's
crazy because like for me like today
right like I was having like a lot of
 issues like this this past
weekend uh-uh freakin drama that I was
having in my personal life right and
then when I want to work like I feel
good like you know this very any jobs
out there that you could say hey man
when I go to work that's my estate you
know what I mean like you definitely did
yeah there Lee any people that go
actually you know agreed to that
most people be like man I hate
going to work I hate going to this job I
hate my boss I hate my coworkers I hate
standing around like if you're working
retail like you you you freak hurt like
if you freaking work driving you get
stressed you're back at stress style
your neck hurts like I did all those
crazy jobs man I I've done here retail
I'm done Oh freaking out I was a
freaking uber driver for like two weeks
and then I was like I can't take this
 no more like like I've done
everything you know what i mean so from
all the jobs that I've had I'm like man
I came and compare it to to web
development man like at all and you know
also to why I brought this top again
it's because you know a lot of people
have been sending me messages about why
am i doing crystal lang why am I
promoting this new programming language
and I think right now to me I think this
programming language has so much
potential and you know I want to just
basically tell everybody about it right
and most of my most of my subscribers
come in here and they expecting a lot of
a lot of them not all of them but a lot
of them I expecting like the easy route
they're like man all I want is just I
want to get a job I'm going to get in I
want to learn you know HTML CSS
JavaScript but what people don't
understand is a language like crystal
Lang can teach you just the fundamentals
of programming that you could take that
knowledge and learning anywhere because
once you know like let's say you know
variables if statements loops you know
switch statements the whole shebang of
you know the spectrum of programming
once you learn that in in a language you
could implement that to any other
language you know what i mean so that's
why i brought that that there are topic
up because I'm just like man people know
that sometimes you might not see
something out there like let's say
there's people working on personal
projects that nobody knows you know what
I mean I or you know it's like when no
Jas came out it's like
things like early not late two thousand
right yeah when I came out when it came
out nobody was like super excited yeah
nobody was trying to learn that nobody
was trying to get it out there like that
even with like react and all these other
frameworks aren't coming out when they
first came out the whole industry was
against it or people were saying that
there's no jobs for that there's no no
because awareness there's no reason to
learn it but things happens like this
that later on whoever were the first
pioneers in that language those are the
guys that's getting paid the big bucks
those are the guys that are there from
you know from the beginning like you
know they did since alpha you know what
I mean get it by the time you you you
finish on like blessing the language
becomes mainstream you're already a
expert you know it's like right now it's
very hard to say hey I'm a pioneer of
PHP I'm a pioneer of nodejs it's like
nobody that's like 10,000 people you
gotta wait behind the line of those guys
because they've been around for a long
time the been around doing that for 10
years but if you find the right project
in the right language and you make your
mark on that whatever people use that
language now they gotta hire you as an
expert you know somebody that really
knows the language you know it's like
those guys you know in my company
there's a guy who we recently hired for
our to basically go to basically set up
a server for gold go lay and this guy's
making you know $300,000 he was just
showing me like order the basically all
the clients that he got and that's
because he was just actually just there
when go just started blowing up so now
him to go anywhere he's getting the top
dollars he's like man I already put in
my work I have 10 years on the month my
built for this language you know what I
mean something yeah man I definitely
think that people should you know should
try new things and try things just for
the love of it man because yeah I can
play communities like yeah just like you
can grow so much drum so much from it
I remember when I was trying to learn
react like so reactie still I'd like to
say it's still like like it's been out
for like what like three four years now
and but it's still like that's still
pretty new compared to like some of the
other stuff that's out there and when I
was first starting to learn it it was
really hard to find the community of
people that were like trying to also
learn it that you can ask questions
because um in reactors like all these
little like thing every little thing can
go freakin wrong in that language and
JavaScript if you don't have like a
Babel compiler it's like impossible cuz
you gotta find out where all these
errors are happening and it feels
silently and it's like god it's like if
you don't have a community to ask
questions to we're like friends to ask
this to how are you supposed to learn
anything it just makes the process
really slow so I really think like
especially when you're going into new
communities exploring new areas
definitely ah it's definitely worth
doing because you also meet people too
yeah exactly that long I think it's
pretty cool um yeah what do you think
was it hell I'm so sorry yeah lighten
arts right uh yeah same thing like if
you're trying to learn these new these
new like like no Jess or whatever the
community is like yucky saying like I
totally agree i try reading the
documentation and like sometimes i don't
get home from that at all because I'm
just like all right cool you know what i
mean so yeah like oh yeah alright cool
give our next you know to me so by the
way men of you know you know me courses
are helping out a lot a lot like I found
some guys on you to me that helped me on
a lot so anyways like PHP like that
thing has been around for a while so the
documentation is is very well written
you know what I mean and and it's easier
to follow so like for us new guys it's
easy real easy to be distracted by like
frameworks and all these things that if
we haven't learned the basics yet and
then we try to jump in to all this
documentation and all this stuff that
we're going to get lost you know I mean
we have to remember to to to have a
focal point you know what I'm saying
as far as learning the basics goes your
this all right yeah man that's just the
way I mean that's just the way it is
sometimes I remember when I first gotta
gettin started like you said the like
peach so like I feel like the PHP the
documentation on their web on the PHP's
website like sometimes it's good but
sometimes you'll like go in there trying
to look up like some weird bug that
happened in your code and you just look
at the description and you're just like
what you're just like what like what I
don't I have no idea what you meant by
that i mean like i'll go that I've been
there I've been that situation so many
times with coworkers they're like you
know just try looking it up on the
website on like all right look at it I
read the definition of it and I'm just
kind of just stuck they're like they're
like that'll help that they're helping
you got a scroll they have like comments
for whatever reason cuz yeah Morty
sometimes I wonder if they know that
they like the documentation isn't that
great but and you have my people that
have like comments on it have like 3,000
what are like up votes or something it's
like no like you think it would just
include that in the article if it has
3,000 obviously like the other day I
wrote I wrote one on stack overflow
right and somebody some I don't they put
that that that that request was already
on there and I was like okay so i looked
at the request and I was like that's no
help either that's not yeah yeah no I
completely understand for sure pearl
yeah man that's how this random the
freaking industry is pretty crazy and
different communities could get pretty
crazy especially like you know the
documentation like for me like sometimes
I listen to a documentation now listen
to sorry every year I waiting I'm
reading the documentation I'm reading
the documentation and I'm like man I
freaking I don't want to stay a lot of
the things here like I don't know if you
guys have ever been to uh let me see
maybe I could share it to the screen
like a mute I don't know mutability
original one I'm missing this one
I immutability in JavaScript yeah but
this is a library no right it's just
like super or muted ideas I don't know
if you guys have messed around with this
thing um maybe I can share it to the
screen the entire application okay yeah
so this freaking this freaking thing
like they're not like even like if you
look at the docs like they're not even
clear on a lot of things like you know I
think ok like here like this I
understand the case key is the value but
you start reading through this thing and
I'm like did they don't have a look in a
clear English like yeah yeah it's just
like a library of functions yeah just
 put the in English man like
we speak English and just put it in
you English like you know what I mean
yeah you know I mean like I come into
this thing and I know people's gonna be
hanging on in like oh my god because you
don't know shrieking programming ah like
you know what I mean like here to keep
her word is headed you know you know
what I mean like that's how they beat
but it's like I put myself in the
situation in the place of somebody who's
who hasn't even had any knowledge of
programming and then you give it a
 document documentation which
supposed to be like your guide to
learning something and it's like the
documentation needs a
documentation like you know what I mean
like that's what I'm saying like this
 is crazy yeah that's right you know
but yeah man so let me see saying man
you guys got any new topics you guys
want to talk about let me know we in
here live let me check the chat too man
you see how you check the
to stay let's see I wanna see this let's
try to get in this for some reason I
hate when Google be acting up as I god
sigh come on you google like come on
like I understand if it was freaking AOL
com but come on bitch like yeah sure
yeah come on I step your game up you
know what I really like all right let's
see let's see what's going on in the
chat man we got a we got his shoes we
got milk stars we got the baby what I
would out we got the squad right now
loving the yeah all right let me
see oh this goes good what up Matt what
up Stephen what up chronic what up Chris
Sean i miss you never see the mercy
without without without without what up
what's going on everybody yeah x is out
there we're at texas yes are we in here
but people love allah people love in the
podcast man that's what they meant that
i really love about this thing is like
man we coming in here you know it's a
whole bunch of developers in yeah you
know it's more like a hangout it's not
nothing formal it's not like we here
trying to be like hey I'm the expert on
JavaScript I'm the expert on
Python I'm the expert in whatever it was
like nah man we just coming in here
shoot the and just you know talk to
having developers yes talk about me in
developer swag it out real quick dulu
died it wasn't that mad man ya know we
just out here man have a fun but yet
milk star so fricking what are you doing
it they debate a job I mean are you
still working for ya I'm working for a
two-year 18kt yeah
yeah so like uh all right I describe
this um so my job ok so my eye there's a
whole bunch of teams at AT&amp;amp;T and there's
a whole bunch of different departments
like I guess all over the world right I
work in the one the one the AT&amp;amp;T
department for the raleigh area and
basically the team i work on is the
business operations team so like for all
of the corporate customers for AT&amp;amp;T I
basically create tools for the
developers that are working with them so
there's okay so mostly most of my team
is java developers right and i'm the
only web guy and which you know i have
mixed feelings about but that's another
story but like um you uh they have
different information that they pass
forward and back toward between the
company and AT&amp;amp;T right so basically what
i do is i create tools for developers to
hook into the information and then use
it in a way present it in the way that
would be usable for people that are
higher up in the organization and that's
like so much information so a lot of the
main thing that I've done over the past
like six months I created like this
dashboard where you basically can do
literally close to everything like a lot
of my co-workers joking about Malik
you're gonna like gonna make me lose my
job here it does like everything didn't
like oh yeah I'm like well I know this
but like maybe you should switch jobs or
something but no there um just like does
like everything from like converting
like exit like XML document studies on
do like like taking like game like in
scheme us and and just just validating
data that comes back and from our
customers come earth and setting and
excited at all all good going through
clear like upper management permission
kool kool kool kool
and then we might be myself but but
watch it okay okay cool let me see was
good how about you missiles or have you
started looking for a job out here gone
to any new interviews what's going on
the man I just been yeah just been
putting resumes and stuff like that and
just working on my cold a lot a lot um I
just had a question i don't know maybe
you guys can help me with it um ok so i
have a lot of experience in the other
fields like i was a substitute teacher
for a while and I truck drove for a
while and it's like do I put that on my
resume or what you know what I mean what
should I do with that I mean because I
have certain skills that I can use that
I could transfer over so like say in a
work environment and stuff like that you
know but no really coding experience
like in an actual company what do you
guys think about that oh um like that in
my opinion that doesn't matter as much
because you're going to get experience
regardless and the way a good way to
show that your tech indicated is just
adjust that you're making stuff like you
don't understand like you go into the
job to the you don't you think that
there's so much it makes it so
complicated to do that stuff because
because of people saying you know that
how do I describe it's like it's like
developers go in there and they just
like a kick all this over complicated
yeah I mean okay so look for I think for
you right I don't know can you guys soon
yeah yeah okay all right I would say for
you i will put doubts that you know are
related to something you know certain
skills that you could bring in right you
know like from a view when you was a
substitute teacher like you know you've
worked with certain environments and you
just put in like all freaking came up
with new
plans for the four classes and stuff
like that little things like that that
it could be helpful full of it and also
at the same time you could just you know
once you go to the job interview if you
have the projects to show and you say
hey man this is the websites that I've
built in reality was on your resume
doesn't really matter it's more about
what can you show us that is at the top
quality that we could be like okay we
like this kid we we could see him
getting high if you don't have no
experience but he could get hired you
know what I mean so yeah well yeah so
that's what I'm saying uh that's why I
think you know but um i was gonna ask
what else i was gonna ask you guys
something um about personal projects are
you guys working on any personal
projects right now well yeah i actually
am working on a couple um so I've been I
going to murmur X looks so like really
put out that so that's been acting kind
of experience your hand and you know
I've been working anymore what I was
absolutely development 20 min to so
that's like one of my big might as well
so so I'm working important and add that
like like this like this it's like goose
things like what like a cloud like it
like like like it says a Josiah every
type of calculation and they to like
learn more and more and then like
there's just one word like Ortiz like
random advanced practice a explains it
look more like more information on it
and on it so that's something that's
really good really i thought that i
should like because it pulls them hold
them for me one and ATM api it like it's
like swickert iya ya holes articles
aren't going to load another 10 gauge
every to learn about it or about it okay
nice nice nice yeah like um how about
you has rules you working or anything
any personal project ya allah allah
khair here working on right now is how
to do a credit application format with
PHP and MySQL might feel nice that's
what I'm doing what I'm doing no I'm
trying I'm trying to figure out how to
how to do everything how to do all that
first or because I know a little bit of
the front end tag HTML CSS I just want
to figure out the back end how to
connect to database I mean I already
know how to connect the database you
know what I mean it's all just a matter
of people all together you know what I
mean I mean and that's that's what I'm
doing right now okay nice nice I mean
yeah yeah no I mean right now as you
guys may know i'm working on coding face
calm yeah it's coming out pretty dope
this thing is like it's a monster like I
thought I was gonna be able to do this
thing right away down my man I'll do
this on the weekends knock the
out get it out there promote it get
people to sign up man this thing is like
a monster itself like I have to do so
much that I'm like man all the
ideas that I want to do take a long time
so the thing that I'm doing is right now
to make it live is I'm going to create
something called channels which is
people going to be able to share stories
or YouTube videos or is you know
whatever they want to share that that
has to deal with a certain channel so
it's like you know Jas has a channel PHP
has a channel CSS has a channel every
single topic has a channel and people
can submit a brand new channel so if
tomorrow or a new library comes out they
consume a in Villa hey can you will add
this new channel tool to the website
coding face and then from there I'm
going to have moderators you know people
from the community that want to become
moderators and be like okay this seems
like a legit a legit library or a legit
project let's put it up and create a
channel for it on the website so far
that's the easiest part of you know the
grand scheme of things that I want to
build for the website but yeah man is
all that's my personal project at the
moment and
it's pretty crazy man yeah I mean I
looked really good looking real sleek
speak yeah man it's coming it's coming
out pretty good man I'm excited for it
man because you know I have a lot of
people that's waiting on it like
everybody from the community is waiting
on it and they're like you know what man
West coding free is coming out and I'm
yeah brah I'm waiting on it are you all
right I'm gonna wait only to myself and
i'm like cuz I I think it's gonna be so
cool it's gonna be like you know you
gonna be able to share the best videos
for the best videos for the courses so
it's like you know why wouldn't you want
to join this community you know what I
mean is it everything everything mixed
together we it's like having it's like
having ready having free coke camp
having this website cohosh node or
having like even YouTube itself put
together but in a way for the community
of like what developers to be able to
make it something special you know what
I mean so there it just it's just going
to be like a place where you just gonna
have a bunch of resources because for me
when I was learning how to code the the
thing that I wasted the most time on was
finding resources finding where's the
best book where's the best youtube video
where's the best of course on udemy
where's the best mac book which was the
best mac book which was the best laptop
to get which one is the best mouse to
get whatever it is you know what I mean
yeah the whole point of this is just
gonna save time for people to just been
okay get the community has agreed upon
this the best laptop the community has
agreed apart this is the best intro or
to eat or HTML video out there so it's
like basically the communities to learn
that the sides which one stays and which
one guess you know gets removed and
whenever somebody cuz you know
somebody's going to come in and be like
oh man got a joke corner face and and
put up a porn link or some
like down
yeah you know how to trolls me and then
the community is gonna take it down I
don't be like you amen if you guys don't
take care of it that's you that's on you
you know what i mean but yeah you know
how the trolls be but yeah so that's my
personal project right now man Emily get
anything you want to say you want to
tell people or about your channel yes
there's people in there okay yeah so if
you guys don't haven't already seen my
channel well like i said like i said i
do do coding video in video but i make
it and make it funny funny so if you
haven't you had that check it out p
doubt I'm / milk stars I have an idea
whose weird javascript I have at one
video and trying to become our group
okay I have a series series starting

the end of the world or not man you can
go through it keep going learning
