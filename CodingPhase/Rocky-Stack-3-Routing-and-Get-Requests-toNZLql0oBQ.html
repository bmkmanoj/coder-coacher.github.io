it again man coning face calm listen
boys back today we're going to talk
about routing rang and the HTTP requests
all right let's do this so we're gonna
start with to get request right what the
hell isn't get requests whenever you go
to a page that's doing a get request is
going to the server and saying okay take
me to coding fav com so what happened
there says hey get this page when you
come here to the / which is the homepage
that little / right there it means take
them to the root of the page right so
saying hey go get this page and show it
to the user which is the client let's
talk about post request let's say you go
to google and you say google com and you
come here right you know okay I want to
do a search for let's say cars when you
click enter that does it you know post
requests to the server and it says hey
getting the search results that are
imagine the the cars right so it comes
back it gives you the information shows
you pictures shows you images right but
remember the first thing that you doing
it's a post request which is just
sending it to you know send them into
the server in basically saying hey send
me back something you know send me back
something will show me something else or
save the data whatever it is right so
those are the most simplest forms of
post request all right now let's go and
start making some routes right and what
the hell is around so when you go to
google com like I said before that's a
get request so we're gonna set that up
right now basically you're going to come
here you have this holders here you open
up the source folder you open up the
routes and then hear this one excessive
web which it means for the website now
submit through something like this let's
do
so I skip and then it's going to let's
return back when come here and say hey
cards right you're going to do something
like this okay we gotta return no
technically you don't have to say return
in case you the crystal name or a ruby
so instead of saying return cars or
return car instead of doing that all you
have to do is you say like that ended it
just cause and then that's being
returned now let's go to the server and
it's due yard run server up server
coming up is up there if you go and say
local host port 3000 / cards is gonna
return back to you the string cotton
yeah that's what we wanted it's
basically what's going here saying hey
whenever you get a get request to the
address / cause do on cars string show
them a car straight right that's simple
guys sum it up so if you want to do a
get request to the server which means
hey when I land on this page get this
page or get this string or get this list
whatever you want to print out to the
screen get it right so if i come to
slash cars show me cars if i come in to
slash user show me a user profile
whatever it is that you want to show the
user on the client who is actually
watching here your website or visit a
website that's basically what the get
request is doing all right sometimes you
might even use it to get data you could
return back a data file to somebody with
on ajax but right now that's more
advanced you're gonna see that later on
we'll come back and teach you guys other
rest calls which are here
if you go to the documentation you can
see all the rest calls which are get
post put patch delete I will do every
single one but for now I want you guys
to learn how to code on this process
like this all right Sookie following the
tutorials you already know simple jump
back at it again confit com I'm teaching
you guys in a high level very simple you
know dummy proof you know cuz that's all
I like to teach it you know I don't want
to teach you guys in a way where it's
gonna be overwhelming it's just keeping
a simple okay and you already know man
by the way if you want to know how to
become a web developer and you want to
learn from the courses that I did they
write down the tutorials on my tutorials
in the description check it out take
your time go to the links click on it
and make sure you visit coated face calm
all right he already knows the butcher
back at ax to get peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
