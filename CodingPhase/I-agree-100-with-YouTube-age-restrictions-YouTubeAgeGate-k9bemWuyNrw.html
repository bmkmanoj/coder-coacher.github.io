at it again man coning face.com alright
today we're going to talk about the
YouTube eight gig right so what does
this move it pretty much it means like
you know for big Tom youtubers like
let's say PewDiePie or h2 h3 or leafy
whatever right those guys that they get
millions of views and most of those
wheels are from kids you know kids are
you know younger than seven years old
eight years old and they're all
consuming their content right so what's
happening with YouTube well YouTube is
pretty much they're rolling out the same
creature which pretty much gives
everybody ratings right if you curse a
lot you have naked photos on your
thumbnails to get clicks all of those
things pretty much they making you or
more mature so you're making your
channel as a mature channel right so why
exactly is that doing so big-time
youtubers right it's just kicking them
out it's kicking up the the little kids
out of their description and you know
what I agree with you too I don't think
that six years old seven year olds
should be watching PewDiePie or should
be watching you know h3 h3 like those
 guys is just like a constantly
current and I curse a lot on my own
YouTube channel but my channel is not
for kids they're basically making their
channels for kids and pretty much
features abusing the system because
everybody knows kids they they
constantly on the iPad a constantly on
the phone and they watch videos 1 2 3
times 3 4 times in a row
and pretty much these guys are are
cashing in on on little kids
Springs pretty much you know it's like
come on man like you know I don't want
my nephew who was like you know nine
years old looking at puny
pirates videos I just don't
think that he should be watching that I
don't think that he should be watching
you know sexual content that's on
youtube or people talking racist
 on youtube I don't think little
kids should be able to be watching them
like you know when they don't socialize
down at from Nickelodeon on a cartoon
network like why would they show an
error on YouTube especially to YouTube
kids are YouTube hit that like it'll
make no sense you know i'm also in their
right to do i mean they have a right to
do whatever the hell else a one because
YouTube is you know a part of Google and
Google does whatever and Institute to
make more money and yam and I definitely
agree with it okay I'm one hundred
percent behind it I think like if you're
your channels for amateur or an hour
mature audience you should be watched by
miss I'm sure audience or at least 16
and up whatever teenage years whatever
but you shouldn't be showing up on
basically on little kids you know
Josephine like it'll make no sense like
you're counting is not for kids so why
is you showing its kids in order me and
all those guys be there super scary now
that i only got you know this is
unsubscribing before oh I'm subscribe
you'll all the little kids from our
channel now I'm not going to be able to
make a living know you can make a living
for me you know kids content and stop
making this with old Carson and
put it in 4k is destined and only me I'm
not affected by it because my crowd is
usually 17 and older like I could care
less if they put into this rating system
but but somebody like purifier whose
green ones been taking off little kids
for the past three years
is a egg make little kid content don't
 make you your adult
content slip it into little kid and like
any kids is going to be the oh my god
it's not so funny and that's so cool but
at the same time you give them some city
and county is that simple menu company
Kirsten we do a racist you don't a
whole bunch of that you
shouldn't be doing and be shown to
little kids you're not gonna go in the
shipping he does he wouldn't do it in
front of a five-year-old right so why
were you show it on the internet and
basically cater two little kids and
doing a whole bunch of shame gonna hate
you know what my audiences you know
tannin and younger but then you're not
giving them sending yogurt harkins give
us something that that they can
learn from or give them something that
is you know that they couldn't I don't
know something romance too cool for kids
like there's no need for a little kids
will be hearing somebody current
throughout their whole videos
and yes I curse the sound hypocrite for
my cello stuff for kids that's what I'm
saying if you you're going forward a
little kid give them little kick concert
it's not simple all right guys I'll see
you later make sure you subscribe make
sure you like this video also leave a
comment I want to know what you guys
think should people like beautify be
able to basically show up in middle kids
Kaname on local subscription or you know
younger kids whatever you want to call
it do you think that he should be there
showing up or like my sake somebody like
h3h3 or or leasing like like or what is
it gray under aerial socialite should
those guys be showing up a little kick I
don't think so in all day they're
counting is like a bleep beam engine
should be able to watch them for an
apple kid all right you already know
make sure to subscribe make sure you
like video isn't for Joe back at it
again later on I'm going to give you
some great news stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
