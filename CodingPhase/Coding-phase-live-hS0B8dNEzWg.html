at it again calling fees.com I don't
know you guys tell me can you guys see
me now can you guys is the service good
let me know please sorry I have to get
my wife he's full not for them but Timur
was actually not that bad let me know if
Timo was going so I started doing a
livestream a few minutes ago but I had
to stop it because service was so bad
I'm like okay I can't be I can't be
using that here so we in New Jersey
right now man we out here kids yeah I
need to switch up so t-mobile man see
Timo would never let me down it's good
now we got Gucci okay so yeah man so
let's talk about this man because people
were concerned people like me so we
don't want you to leave the channel the
corner face guys I'm not leaving coating
face calm I'm not leaving calling face
the channel on YouTube what I'm doing is
I'm pretty much I'm starting fresh all
right I'm early in the game when it
comes to this YouTube thing I have one
year with this channel I want to
continue doing everything that I've been
doing doing the you know the dropping
gems with coding phase I want to be
releasing videos daily I want to be able
to do this live streams without being
hurt alright so when I say without being
hurt um basically the way how YouTube
works and this is something that I'm
gonna go into that I'm gonna go into my
other channel called Lottie if you
haven't subscribe go to my channel
coding face right and right there at the
bottom this um this is what no website a
channel that's a slot II subscribe to
that one right
subscribe to that one that's your boy
Joe I'm releasing a lot of new videos
this weekend on that channel
so let me explain it to you how things
work so in case you wanted to create a
channel or whatever right
when I first started this YouTube
channel I came in here just like okay I
just want to share my thoughts I want to
share my opinions on things and be able
to help people become web developers
right and I feel like I've achieved that
right a lot of people have kind jobs
because of me and other people are
signed up to my website which I pretty
much release brand-new courses every
week every two weeks okay
fully courses you know everything from
beginning to end now that I'm continued
to do because I just love creating
courses I love talking about coding I
love talking about different programming
languages or about different techniques
that you can use to build websites I
love doing that right so that's not
going nowhere
so this new channel called laude what
I'm doing there is putting in all my
higher quality type of videos meaning
videos that take me let's say you know
two three days to make I will be
releasing it there right the videos that
I come in here and I do live streams I
do our long videos like 15 20 minute
videos me explaining a topic as far as
like coding and web development all
those videos are gonna be here right and
the reason why I'm doing that is because
the way how YouTube works is number one
you gotta have either engagement which
means constantly telling people like hey
man hey you know hashtag dis hashtag dad
or oh my god going and freaking leave a
comment leave a like da like I never
liked that I've never liked doing
that you guys know me I'm I just come
and do my content and release it I'm not
interested I'm not into like constantly
for it's like you begging people to give
you like sing and subscribe I don't even
like doing that I just say okay if
you want to you you do if you don't you
don't right so your channel grows
because of that or your channel grow
depending on your engagement you're
averaging nine gauging your average
retention level you know what I mean
meaning like let's say you have a video
which is 10 20 minutes right most people
leave about about 8 8 minutes in right
so now your video your videos retention
rate is really about 40% right for your
channel to really start growing you
really have to have it above 50% right
so there's two ways to grow on YouTube
like I said there's the way of getting
engagement right constantly getting
people to like your videos constantly
telling people to leave a comment
constantly doing this in that or the
other way which is just creating good
quality content which basically as long
as people watch the whole video that
videos gonna be promoted out there ok so
when I say the mistakes that I made on
this channel was it still are and I
don't even know if that's a mistake cos
most of you guys loved those content
like my loyal fans and the lawyer or
community here coding fence calm you
guys loved the live streams y'all love
when I come in here and drop a video
that's you know 10 15 20 minutes long
yeah I love that right that's the core
community of this channel but
unfortunately YouTube don't look at them
but I that's only a small percentage of
your your total subscribers that
actually stayed the whole the whole
video right so that's the problem that's
the main problem as you guys can see the
past few weeks to three weeks I've been
doing shorter videos just to test things
out right just to test things out and I
wasn't doing that many live streams just
to see what was my level of retention
rate to see how long do people stay on
the videos right
to see if my levels go up so because
this whole past year I've been doing so
many livestream so many videos that are
like two hours long three hours long
right
most people don't stay here for two
three hours
so YouTube looks at that and says okay
these people stay here for let's say
half an hour of a two-hour long video or
a 3-hour long livestream
you know so then they look at that in
the midnight okay these people only stay
here stay here for 20% of the video you
get what I'm saying so they don't watch
the whole video so pretty much my
channel has been getting penalized
because of that now it took me time to
really learn it it took me time to
understand it and after getting some
professionals to look at my China and
understand what was going on and
basically just just to audit the whole
channel and literally go in there it
took like two weeks two weeks and a half
of just like going in there testing out
a whole bunch of looking at the
titles looking at the SEO looking at the
type of quality of my content the type
of videos that I've been making and
literally the only problem that that is
happening with the channel is it's
literally just the retention rate so my
retention rate on my channel unlike the
average of my channels is completely low
it's like that 20% and the reason why is
that 20% is because of all the long live
streams which I didn't know I didn't
know that they they took into account
like the live stream I thought like the
live streams is like you know just to
play around I was like coming in here
you know around and have fun right
but the live streams can actually hurt
your channel from going right because if
you're doing live stream like let's say
gaming right you have a little kid who's
14 years old who watches your whole live
stream
your whole gaming livestream and they
just leave it there playing while
they're doing other stuff on the
computer or whatever then everything is
fine but the type of talk the type of
content that I'm releasing on YouTube
most people stay in for you know maximum
30 minutes you gonna say so for I've
been doing just like straight like
lowlands live streams right so that
completely killed I didn't even know
about this I'm telling you guys ahead of
time if you're creating a channel and
this isn't that like my channel there's
no way my channel is gonna be able to to
grow at a steady pace like I've been
growing steadily it keeps going up but
it's just not gonna do those major jumps
like okay you got 300 subscribers in one
day you got freaking a hundred thousand
views in one video and one shot it's not
gonna happen right because I didn't know
about this you guys wanna say that but I
came plus I wasn't even thinking about
this when I came in to YouTube I just
came in just to around play around
and help other people out you got are
saying like I wasn't really thinking
about all I want this channel to grow I
literally to be honest with you guys I
was like yo this is from nerdy
I don't even want my friends to know
that I'm doing you know I'm doing
YouTube about coding like this is not to
say I'm not the type of person to be out
here promoting this that's how I
was thinking in my head I was like man I
don't want I don't want other like my I
don't want to be like a big youtuber
that's not what I want
I just want to release content and
nobody sees it and that's fine but with
time as things start growing and I start
seeing like man I really love doing this
I love coming in here and helping people
out and show love I realize I'm like you
know what I might want to actually be
doing this more professionally and like
helping people out more you gonna st.
so is crazy cuz I'm like yo I did
not know like even if you look at any
other youtubers like the major youtubers
whatever like oh you know those channels
that's how you Hey
and this the things that you got to do
for your channel to grow this who think
that da da da nobody talks about this
right I had to do a freaking huge you
know how to do a huge investment I had
to pay somebody was a professional
YouTube marketing guy and basically
audited my whole channel and figure out
what was going on and what was happening
so pretty much even if I drop the best
content that I I can't here on this
channel
this channel is never gonna be able to
see the light that's the truth right
most of the people that's here that find
me is literally like they find like one
random video like three months bootcamp
you know like or what other video that
most people have come here why you
should become a developer in 2017 like
little things like that right which is
not something that I want to be focusing
on I don't want to be doing every single
month some programming languages to
doing 20 18 January type programming
languages to do on 20 you know 20 18
February like every single month I don't
want to be doing that you gotta say
I just want to continue creating my the
best content that I can but I did not
know that livestreams really hurt your
channel you're gonna say I do not know
that because it just brings you your
retention rate down so the way how
YouTube doesn't now is like you could
drop a 1 minute video if people watch
your 1 minute video 100 percent at a
time
alright now the full 1 minute then
basically that video is more more more
important than another video that might
be 15 minutes long which people only
watch 7 minutes out of it right so
basically like no matter what I would do
you know this channel is not gonna grow
how I want it to so I know I got the
content I know I got that fire I got
you know I got that hate you know what I
mean so what I'm doing is I'm going on
my way creating this new channel this
new idea that I have which I wanted to
do here but what I'm going over there is
I want to do pretty much better produced
videos better editing engaging videos
videos guys is going to keep your
retention rate up and you know just more
professional just keeping it more
professional now here on coding face
coding face channel is gonna be only
about coding there's gonna be tutorials
it's gonna be me coming in here doing my
live streams the things that I've been
doing for for many with you guys the
things that are a lot of you guys enjoy
but I want to have this other channel as
a way to really promote this channel I
don't know if that makes sense for you
guys
right like this is the real uncut coding
face channel the other channel is
literally let's say the quote-unquote
the commercial version of coding face
you know that's the channel that we're
we don't curse that's the channel where
we don't do no live stream that's the
channel where we pretty much we stay to
one topic we do one video about that
topic and that's it right have like
everything in a series meaning like hey
if I'm talking about how to get a job in
web development you know break things
down into series into episodes and in
that series where we could say hey
episode war will be learning to code
what are the best places to learn to
code episode two after learning to code
what are the best places to actually you
know to find jobs episode three if you
decide to become a freelancer what are
the best ways to find clients you know
episode four could be how to how to
handle a stress
a stressful position as a junior
developer right because that happens
sometimes you'd go into a company and
you think like man I'm not ready and
they give you mad work but then at the
end you come out successful right you
you finish your work you're you get to
handle it so but in the beginning these
are things that everybody goes through
your first job is like the hardest thing
right so you know also those are the
things that people are gonna look for
you know and those are videos that are
gonna be here for the next 10 20 years
so that's where I'm gonna put that out
I'm gonna put that Lahti so Lodi means
living off the internet right at the
same time I'm gonna go in there or do
topics like how to get your credit up
right things that I wish I'm basically
putting all the things that I wish
somebody would've told me from the
beginning grain you know everything from
finances everything from investing
everything from how to save money you
know when you become a developer you
might be you know Johnny Johnny the kid
who works at you know Foot Locker right
you bust your ass for one year you
become a developer and then now the next
year you find yourself in a situation
where you're making $80,000 but if you
don't have the knowledge and you don't
have the guidance of somebody telling
you hey this how you spend your money
this is how you save money this is how
you put money in the 401 401 K this is
how you freaking you know how you how
you start investing into smaller things
that you don't see in the beginning but
you see it later on you gotta say like I
have a better man account right I have a
better man account where I basically
came in and I don't know like probably I
think like in 2013 I started putting in
$50 a month in there right and then
whenever I had the opportunity I will
put an extra 500 I will put in a extra
200 right
now in that betterment account I have
about like forty eight thousand dollars
in there right so have forty-eight
thousand dollars into an account that
you don't even know like you in your
head you're not even thinking of it
right but most people don't do that most
people come in and they're the they
become developers they become
entrepreneurs but they don't they don't
start saving from the beginning so
little things like that is what I'm
gonna be teaching you guys on Lottie at
the same time I'm gonna teach you how to
find niches right how to find a niche
for you guys so let's say a lot of you
guys are here to become developers right
but a lot of you guys have a plan to at
some point get out of becoming a
developer for a company and start making
your own money like that's what I do you
got on saying like that's what I do
and I've been doing it for a long time
like I have my CSS generator websites
I have small niche websites for like
music and you know buying studio
equipment and like that
that just generates money so those are
the things I'm coming in here and
teaching you guys on Lahti man so let me
see what's going on in a chat I mean let
me know what you guys think
yeah yeah Timo's see Moses always been
good man the problem would see mobile
that I didn't like back in the days was
they slow down your internet so like
let's say they tell you it's unlimited
but once you pass like let's say five
gigabytes or like ten gigabytes of data
they slow down your internet to 3G I
don't like that but you know I
guess I'm gonna have to switch up at
some point cuz look the live stream is
good we're here we go right now you know
my phone I got the was it the noh8 AT&amp;amp;T
AT&amp;amp;T sucks
Verizon sucks
yeah man
Genoa thought it was gaudy Lodi man Lodi
I've been thinking about this I actually
wrote this down like two three years ago
living off the internet like because
somebody somebody asked me a while back
like oh what do you do for a living
that's now and I just said man living
off the internet man like I live off the
internet you know how some people be
like yo I'm living off the earth now I
live off the internet man the incentive
dies tomorrow I die with it too because
all my income is straight on the
Internet come on this kids playing with
their balls man let me see what else
yeah man so that's the thing you know so
it's like this channel no matter what I
do like I said like no matter what I'm
gonna do like it's not gonna get those
boots like I don't know if you guys have
noticed if you look into my videos none
of my videos even my most popular videos
have touched a hundred thousand a
hundred thousand views or anything and
it's because they just don't show it
right it's not because people don't want
to see my content its people not because
they don't want to look at the
thumbnails and they don't want to click
it no it's literally they just don't
show my videos okay so I know that that
 what's happening you know cuz I was
like you know that's why okay I'll pay
some money I paid like $1,500 for it
people to literally go into my YouTube
account and go through the whole process
and look through it and I know there was
something in there I was like yo there's
no way there's no way that that people
that that put in have to work or even a
quarter of the work that I put in and
the amount of content that i release
there's no way that that they get a more
promotion to me on youtube because it's
like you know my content is way better
than 90% of people on here and that's
being honest you know most of the people
either they repeat themselves or they
constantly doing
click baiting and this is narrow or you
know that clowning or you know doing all
the like my content is good the
people that come here the people that
get to find my content they love it
everybody that comes here they'd be like
you know I love this freakin channel you
get on saying like even Keanu the other
day she's like yo why the hell I don't
get none of the notifications and I
gotta be constantly checking to see if
Jos live you know what I'm saying like
it's kind of ridiculous and then I've
been noticing this since probably July
last year because I remember when I
first came in I was getting like
crazy views and then I started focusing
on doing a lot of live streams and you
know cuz live streams are cool you get
to share your thoughts and you get to
interact with the people I love it
interacting with you guys but at the
same time I didn't know that this thing
I'm doing the last room right now I know
that you pretty much you get you get
penalized if people don't watch the
whole livestream like I don't expect
people to watch a three hour livestream
you gotta say I expect for people to the
people that get to be there they get to
enjoy crazy late
I didn't sneak in my car like now you
bugging Kent this ain't no hide-and-seek
type car dogs like go get I hope you to
do that yeah man so so it's crazy
so I'm like yo I know there's something
off you know what I mean
I got 800 videos I got 800 videos on
YouTube I got like 800 videos on YouTube
like the amount of content that I put
into this channel
it just doesn't equate that you're gonna
say it's duals that coming year and half
a hundred two hundred videos and have
the same that I have and it just
doesn't make sense it doesn't make sense
so it's like y'all I had to do this
I had to be like yo man let's figure
this out let's get the pros let's
get a pro to look at this channel let's
figure out what the hell is going on and
since when did they forgive they
freaking is like being blackballed you
get what I'm saying
it's like you create a channel and like
once you're you're already they're
already looking at you bad and they're
not really putting you out there your
your foot you gotta say so dude looked
it up and literally yo is so crazy
literally around jewel
my c2 started tanking and it's like why
and it's because of the livestreams man
it's some you would think like
there's so many people that I stay here
for a whole hour an hour and a half and
hang out in the lime streams but the
channel gets penalized because if you do
a long long form video and people don't
watch the whole video they pretty much
say hey they only watch 20% of your
video which means your video is not a
good video right and it's like now it's
like people come in and out it's kind of
ridiculous
amen
let me see Derrick Rose who says hey Joe
it's cold steel web developer class out
dating now are people still using
bootstrap yes a lot of people still use
bootstrap is they out dating no I don't
think so I mean it doesn't have
everything and you can't expect to have
everything in one course like you got
understand this who is the target
audience for web developer bootcamp that
that course is literally for the person
that has never coded before and that
program has never done anything before
right if you're Johnny the the mechanic
that's a perfect course for you right if
you already know how to code and you
already know HTML CSS like why will you
take the web developer bootcamp you get
on a thing like that course is not for
you you already are on the next level
you need to start looking for other
courses that that have better things now
what I would say is you know you could
go to my website check it out yeah is
dropping gems still on for tonight
so today Saturday no dropping gems of
Sunday's 9:00 p.m. every Sunday I'm
still dropping
the drop gems man the channel is not
gonna change guys this channel it is
what it is right this channel is the raw
and uncut channel of coding phase right
this is where I'm gonna continue doing
my live streams like I said I'm gonna
continue doing everything that I've been
doing I'm gonna continue doing it on
this channel I'm just I'm having this
other channel which I'm pretty much
gonna use it to cross-promote this
channel right because there's so much
good content here that I've done over
the whole year that it will be a loss
for people to never find this channel
you know what I'm saying like it would
it wouldn't be right I mean I've done so
many good videos that if I go and I say
hey man I'm just gonna let this this
channel you know leave it alone and and
just leave it leave it there for so
whatever they frickin YouTube decides to
change the algorithm it wouldn't make
sense so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
create this other Lodi channel which is
already created go subscribe if you're
watching this go subscribe trust me
you're not gonna be let down you're
gonna be getting really good content
over there but the only difference is
we're not doing live streams on that
channel that channel I'm keepin it clean
that channel I'm not doing live streams
I'm not doing you know I'm not doing
live streams I'm cursing I'm not I'm
basically it's gonna be like straight to
the line I'm I'm basically gonna play
super safe because I just don't want I
don't want to be spending so much time
into doing something that it's just not
gonna grow you don't know saying it's
like I love this channel but the way how
things are on YouTube now is like it's
forcing me to also create another
channel to be able to promote this
channel you know what I'm saying
it's kind of ridiculous but it is what
it is so the other channel I'm just
putting in a lot of really good content
they're short videos no longer than five
six minutes the maximum that I'm putting
in six minutes
then everything else is gonna be it's
gonna be over here on this website on
this on this channel and as far as my
courses and everything you guys know me
I'm dropping courses every single week
no matter what but yeah man Gregory go
to click on my channel coding face and
then scroll down you're gonna see my my
my new channel there
how can we go from courses to getting a
remote position bro that's one of the
things I'm going over in the new channel
go subscribe man but now I'll tell you
like the quickest way you know here on
this livestream the easiest way you
gotta find a technology that you can do
really good right or like let's say
you're a skill maybe one technology a
skill right so like let's say there's
this website for Lara
it's called Larry jobs right constantly
there's a whole bunch of jobs they're
posting for laravel developers okay
so most of the people there a remote
developers okay so if you're good with
laravel you get hired
that's a Developer Forum different
companies and you work there remotely
now let's say something like Ruby on
Rails look this up because people be
sometimes they listen to so much of the
 of the internet that people are
kind of ridiculous Ruby on Rails is the
programming language that has the most
remote remote jobs out there if you're
looking to become a remote developer I
would definitely stay learn Ruby on
Rails now if you're looking to become
just a regular developer at a company
you know learn PHP learn you know live
well learn JavaScript learn nodejs
you know learn the basics of what
development but if you're looking for
remote jobs you have to do something
that now a lot of people are into but
companies still need you you're gonna
say like there's so many jobs for Ruby
on Rails that are not failed so like I
say I'm a company in Wyoming right or
Ohio I basically have my whole back-end
in Ruby on Rails my Ruby on Rails
developer left or he's leaving now I
can't find a ruby
rails developer in Ohio so what do I do
I go on the internet and find other
developers out there I thought you did a
video and so that only Ruby on Rails are
available or senior roles for Ruby on
Rails now that's a lot than to which I
said before like yes this a lot of job
sites for senior developers but like I
said before even if you are a junior
developer so long as you could show the
skills that you have you could get a a
job you could get a job that a
quote-unquote senior developer it's
neither for like stop looking for junior
developer jobs like those things are
like finding a unicorn what you need to
do is build a portfolio that's solid and
focus on work scale like I said you
really want to become a remote developer
you want to work from home learn two
things either Ruby on Rails or you want
to learn laravel those two programs or
programming skills are what people are
cutting hiring I'm telling you ahead of
time because even in the company of the
last company that I work for we had two
laravel developers who work remotely
okay now not only that but as far as
Ruby on Rails I have so many different
job postings on my email that people
sent me from different recruiters all
over the country that basically by
Albany your senior will be your rails
developer and then when you start
looking at it on the bottom
you're like one to two years experience
that's not a senior that's not a senior
developer position once or two years of
experience you could do that in
your house right what happens is a lot
of times they use the word senior
because what they want is somebody that
already knows the framework and knows
the language they don't want to deal
with somebody that's gonna go in
I'm nervous oh my god you want me to do
what you want me to do a recipe I - what
like you need to be more confident in
your skills you going the same like even
if it says senior developer position you
need to apply if you can do the job
you're gonna get hired
yes sir man yes that's how I feel too
man react for life man Tyler Benton
check Lera jobs Lera jobs search remote
Ruby on Rails positions on Google and
there's a whole bunch of websites
there's also dice comm what else you
could check on LinkedIn put in remote on
LinkedIn and you're gonna see a whole
bunch of of the jobs
what about JavaScript should I skip that
no in this day and age you need to know
JavaScript brain you need to know
JavaScript you don't need to be a master
you just need to know the language and
know how to change things where if you
know within the Dom like you know
changing el-amin adding a class removing
in class those are the things that you
got to learn right and no one single
framework that's it
use Arlo's I said so you have any advice
for an ATO getting into front-end web
development so what I would say to UK is
learn HTML CSS build any website any
website I'd uh well build any site out
of any design that anybody gives you if
I give you a design that looks oh my
gosh super complicated you should be
able to build it right because that's
how you test your skills like I just did
this on this course here on YouTube this
tutorial building a website for
Takashi's 6:9 it's completely free right
and this is one of the reasons for to
why I'll be I feel frustrated sometimes
because it's like that's a really good
tutorial it has six videos teaching you
how to build a single page app
for an artist now out of the thousands
and thousands of people that are here
how many people are gonna do it
maybe maybe a hundred all right maybe a
hundred and that's it but besides that
not that many people are gonna do it one
because most people won't find it in
tool because the majority of people that
are here they don't I feel like a lot of
people here don't want to put in the
work man you know what I mean a lot of
people they say they want to become
developers but they don't understand
what it takes to become developer link
is it looks nice on paper but you gotta
actually do work you know it's like I
see a lot of you guys portfolios and you
guys cannot build complicated you know
designs yeah I can't if I give you a
complicated design you can't build it
you don't even know how to break it down
so it's like why wouldn't you take
advantage of a video that shows you how
to work with CSS grades
I don't work with Flex boxes how to work
with gradients how to work with
positioning how to work with you know
everything everything from typography
like literally is completely free right
but most people won't do it you know
it's frustrating so it's like for you as
an 18 you're okay I would say do
tutorials like that you know a lot of
people will come in and even from other
instructors here on YouTube I see a lot
of people do this they come in and show
you things of here's how to do a web
application we're bootstrapping this
just and that and it's like that's not
how our application looks in real life
you get what I'm saying like you gotta
put in work you gotta put in work with
websites that are realistic you know so
take advantage man
so yeah man
yeah definitely yeah Goulding I think
Golding is is very very interesting I'm
still interesting on it I learned like
the basics that they're like a few small
apps on it but personally I just I let
it go because the competition for gold
lamÃ© developers is extremely hard like
it's high man is you're not dealing with
like regular dudes me like I'm being
honest you gotta say like for me I look
at look when it comes to programming I
look at it like this I look at it in a
way how much money can I make
how difficult is it for me to get into
that field and you know how long is it
gonna take me to learn goal and takes a
while the competition is very high
everybody wants those jobs right so it's
like should I focus a lot on it I'm like
I can't okay I don't have time I don't
have time to focus on goal and you know
maybe if I was in my house where you
know my mother's house and this and that
but now is like who's gonna pay for this
 you know if I if I decided to start
learning just learning like who's
gonna pay for this you know I did a
video like I don't know a year ago about
elixir and I I pretty much said it I was
like yo like why should I learn elixir
like there's no jobs for it you know it
seems like a cool programming language
but there's no jobs for the jobs that
are out there are basically the
competition is super high you know cuz
it's an interesting language so more
people want to jump on it you know what
I mean yeah
and there you go a blocked yeah that's
one same man so we constantly those are
the type of things that we get out here
man
the thing is that I wish I was sure like
all of the comments and all of the crazy
 that I'll be getting on my freakin
channel man the amount of racism the
amount of you know yeah
something like crystal Lang is important
and it's good for people to learn
because number one if you are coming
from Ruby like the best transition for
Ruby developers is gonna be crystal lang
okay it's pretty much the same language
the only difference they got typing it
also has concurrency it's faster than go
but currently right now it doesn't have
a huge company like Google behind it but
the moment like a big application gets
built on on crystal lang it's a wrap man
like the reason why I told people to
learn it that's an investment or
something that we know for sure it's
gonna be huge and then if you know the
language like let's say right now you
you're like a crystal Lang developer for
the last two three years when this thing
pops up right when this thing pops up
you're gonna be a senior developer on it
while everybody's scrambling remember
what I told you guys this right you
gotta see this in a year two years from
now right and then you're gonna be like
oh shoot I remember what you're talking
about this guy's when crystal Ling goes
mainstream it's a rap like literally I'm
telling you right now this is not this
is not like a random programming
language that some guys built in their
basement like this is guys are really
really good
like this is guys that are really really
good in like the programming language is
faster than all the other languages that
are out there except seat right so if
you become a senior developer when this
thing blows up in the next two years
like you're gonna be ahead of the game
you gotta say like it's like the guys
who you know like a year ago never you
got to three years ago when react was
just starting the guys that have been
using react since beta they get paid
super like like a crazy amount of money
and I've seen people get paid like a
$150,000 to be a senior reactive a
number right two three years ago right
because nobody else was on that when
react came out people was all this is
cool you know what I'm saying but the
reason why they got paid so well is
because of things like react I mean take
for example like even Chris Hawkes has
said it himself like the reason why he's
going this the jobs that he's dying is
because he was doing react before
anybody was even using react so now he
has so much experience on it that
whenever he goes to any company is like
yeah I've been doing this for like five
years
you got what I'm saying like that holds
weight Christo Leng is gonna be one of
the biggest programming languages out
there and it's already you know jumping
up the ladder every single day so it's
like if you know that language when it
blows up you could be asking like a
hundred forty grand out here remember
what I told you this remember I started
talking about this and when was a 2017
watch 2019 and 2020 what's gonna happen
now I'll leave it up to you guys to keep
track of that you know because when you
start seeing every single youtuber here
talking about
hey guys top programming languages of
2019 2020
Oh crystal Lang that I like I'm gonna be
like Oh remember me from 2017 I was
telling you guys this that's what's
gonna happen
you get what I'm saying yeah man yeah
well you gotta check it out for oh man
you gotta be ahead of the game man
that's like one of the things where I
feel like I shine on you know what I
mean I'm always ahead of the game I
don't be behind nobody I don't look at
what nobody else is doing what nobody is
else is up to
I'll make my own decisions on things and
you know make my own conclusions and be
like okay this thing is about to blow up
same shade whenever I came out I was
doing angular and I said there's so much
 and angular like I was looking
for the right programming not
programming language the right framework
and I was like man reactions to
that was like three years ago we in 2018
you know what I'm saying like a lot of
people are just hearing about react now
or that was just hearing about it in
2017 I've been up on that since 20
like 15 you know these people that have
been on it even before that
let me see what about lower lower I
don't know man
lor I don't think that's gonna be a
language that's gonna go anywhere that's
like that language is like elixir it's
like a language that's like neat like
only neat companies is gonna find that
 useful you know I believe was the
lure that usually a lot for for games I
think for what game engine they use it
for I forgot which one well I know they
use it for automating games or something
like that it's College necessary for
front-end web developer nope
also it's a handle degree programs
warfare nope
listen man with less than a hundred
dollars you could become a web developer
a very good one you know what I mean so
less than a hundred dollars
John Smith I'm good man I'm chilling we
are here a family in New Jersey we came
out here freaking we stuff our faces we
went to to go eat a sushi bar
I'm freaking fool I've been up since 5
o'clock in the morning because the the
community was in the first communion was
a nine o'clock so we woke up super early
for whatever reason and we left the
house at seven o'clock on the dot we got
there nine so it's been good man we
bring out here children hanging out as
you can see we got the kids out here
kids playing around playing games you
know my my nephew's so it's been cool
man
you jes any thoughts man my thoughts of
you jes I'll be honest and I've said
this a million times I didn't like UJS
because it was a copy of angular and
react okay now after messing around with
angular was a four plus or angular five
or what now they call angularjs right to
be honest if I had to choose between
that and future yes I would choose view
Jas now would I choose UJS over react
hell no hell no I will not use it
because all the things that you get with
react you're not getting in
in future yes like I feel like you J yes
UJ s is like a little step up from what
jQuery was a few years ago right it just
makes your life easier for people who
are not really good developers like that
like and that's being honest with you
guys like most of the people that are
interested in view GS are people who are
beginners right people who have less
than a year and they see oh man I don't
have to use webpack I don't have to use
gulp I don't have to use grunt I don't
have to use any of the preprocessors I
don't have to use Babel I could use this
with just a script tag and I'm good to
go right they love it right but any
developer that's been here for you know
more than three years they'll tell you
it's like now man oh I'll stick with
four react I'm not touching you GS
like I know few GS basically I did like
about five hours learning view GS with a
what was it maximum Ilyas whatever or
his name I took his course to learn VGA
I think like somewhere last year
and then I transfer a application that I
had created in in jQuery and I
transferred it to a few GS and there was
a lot of in there that I was like I
don't like the flow of few GS I don't
like how things work I don't like the V
bindings we bind that I don't like the V
for days whatever like I don't like no
erection I don't like working with
JavaScript and then I get it having to
learn other stuff like HTML tags like I
don't like doing that shame
I don't like thinking about Oh compute
this compute that like I don't like to
think about that I just want to coat
JavaScript I don't want to have to learn
somebody else's jargon you gotta say so
those are the things that that I see on
v-j yes and I'd be like I'd rather not
not with it you know I mean plus it
just there's a lot of about the
view GS community that I just don't like
you know like certain things that you
pick up like you jes was a whole
different framework and view one right
and which people forget about like
people forget that there was a view one
like where was you like I'm not talking
about you but where was the people that
like view when view one came out like
nobody was there right so when people
talk to me about view I'm like bro I've
been on view since view one since the
first view before view two came out so
it's like when people come in and tell
me that oh you're hating or you don't
know I never heard of you
I just thought that I'm I hate this
whole it's a copy of what reacted
mix with what angular did and it's like
why not keep what you already had and
just make it better instead of copying
the things that other frameworks have
like the the reason why people like is
because you
in a script tag ok whoopee-doo I could
do that too what jQuery so why why would
I switch from jQuery to a few GS you
gotta say or why would I switch from
react to view GS if I'm already getting
everything that a few giasses is trying
to give me and react I already got it
you're gonna say so let mr. John Smith
hey coding phase I have a question when
you call six eight hours a day will you
do it every single day from Monday to
Friday I mean that's called working -
that's what you call working as a
developer and even at that you know
sometimes people think like you code
eight hours a day you don't code eight
hours a day you probably called four
hours a day or maybe three hours a day
most of the time you're doing research
you're figuring out how you're going to
tackle a problem you know how you're
gonna tackle a problem which one is the
best tools which one is the best
programming language which one's the
best framework for for the situation
like that's what you do most of the time
every developer knows this you know when
you work at a company either you're
doing meetings either you're doing
 agile or you're
doing research most of the time
and they're from there you're going and
you start coding but that's how it is
it's only your lighters man listen man
you got a do research bro
you gotta do research don't let nobody
on the internet tell you those things
like Oh PHP is dead
Ruby on Rails is it's on earth it's on
the the last breath of fresh air is
about to die tomorrow they've been
saying that you know since when since
before 2012 when I started I started
2011 I started working professionally in
2012 they've been saying that since
before 2011 men like people people be
talking online all the time man
it's like right now right me and you
let's say they're sinking to a regular a
regular conversation me and you we like
basketball right but I come in and I say
hey man you know what I like the Knicks
I like the next and then you say I like
the Cavaliers and then one day you come
in and you tell me hanging you know the
Nexus is dying tomorrow right and you're
like wait what like where do you get
that information he's like oh I heard
that online that happens all the time
especially with programming man program
when it comes to this what development
community or it you know developers
period doesn't matter what type of
out there right people always gonna be
like oh these people this language is
dead this is not good this is bad da da
da
son you got a first look online and look
look online what a jobs inside and then
you'll see that man there's a lot of
places that where Ruby or rails have
more jobs than nodejs developers
right there's more jobs for Ruby or
rails developers then OGS and
quote-unquote nodejs is like the hottest
thing in the world right now everybody
talked about it everybody wants to do
everything with no Jes but for some how
like a language that's dying or dead
already
how does a language that's dead already
have more jobs than a language that's
like oh this is the future this is
distance and that like this is the best
thing ever
you don't know saying so sometimes we
just got to do our own research we can't
let people come in and and tell us oh
this is good and this is not good Gold's
gobbling what up what are we in here kid
yeah yes
I don't know if you guys saw that from
girl in SETI he just said this this is
what he said for the people that
watching this in the future I just
started development with no GS I have
read book on it and know much about no
Jes MongoDB and all of that but still
don't know how to make a website those
are the things that most people don't
want to hear they don't want to hear
that that happens to everybody so girl
in door don't feel bad that happens to
every single person out here
they started learning languages or
frameworks because everybody tells you
all this is what you're gonna learn is
why but still don't know how to build a
website like for you to build a website
you should know how to use HTML CSS and
that's saying that's what you should
focus before you even jump into nodejs
you need to focus on building the
website okay you can't go in and jump
into something which is the backend
without knowing how to build just a
single page come through the website man
check it out
and give it a try everything that I have
about my website is literally like real
life experience type it's things
that the things that people are not
gonna show you man you know most of
instructors out here they show you a
programming language they teach you a
programming language but they don't
teach you how to put things together
how does things work together to build a
website your web page how a web
application is mean how is it planned
they don't teach you know that stuff you
know what I mean so it's like when you
go to a job you go in there blind you go
in there thinking oh I'm a junior
developer now you go to my website you
learn everything that's there on the
timeline you're gonna come out as a
mid-level to senior level developer it's
not just like some beginner you
know what I mean yeah
do you know different types of
entry-level programming jobs you can get
as a self-taught developer where our
college degree there's a lot of
different jobs that you can do and
that's what I'm gonna focus on on Lahti
go subscribe to my new channel it's
called la d ll TI the best way to find
it is by going into my coding phase
channel and you will see right there
there's a thing that says channels you
need to subscribe to check that out
tomorrow I'm dropping my first video for
for that channel and I'm also gonna be
doing live streams here so like I said
before we're basically dropping all the
high quality videos the videos that take
me a long long time to plan out the
videos that take me a long time to
create and you know explain a topic very
well they're gonna be over there the
live streams we're doing it here on
coding phase so my advice is subscribe
to both channels so one channel this is
like let's say there's the raw uncut
channel and the other channel is pretty
much straight to the point
quality content okay yes sir lotty new
t-shirts coming out faladi
we've got a couple of cool I
haven't slept and I went to sleep like I
won one o'clock at night by one freaking
sleeping tired
the man I just loved the last newsman I
love talking to you guys I love hanging
out with you guys don't know what we do
out here yes man subscribe to the new
channel Noddy I'm gonna put this on all
my my videos here on coding face until
we surpass the numbers that we have on
coding phase
yes sir Harold Ramos man listen $20 per
month for 30 over 30 courses and I'm
creating more courses now in the next
week I'm creating more courses there
there's gonna be more different things
like using Photoshop Illustrator After
Effects pretty much designed for
developers I'm gonna add to the website
there's a lot of stuff that I'm gonna do
I'm finishing right now the social media
website which is cool if you are into
nodejs you should definitely check that
out yes that's definitely a lot of cool
stuff man and even of that you don't
even have to sign up for the 20 go on
the description you use the description
or you could use the coupon code from
YouTube all capitalized you write that
down from YouTube and you get 50% off
Kenya smooth canyons movies like yo
Joe's on the move man this is about to
end
quick now I mean you know we did it for
an hour
we hang that for now my freaking throat
is killing me for some reason yes take
advantage I mean I always tell people
man go check out the website coating
face calm I'm still gonna continue for
more than coding face com'on Lottie
you're still gonna see at the end of
every video you're gonna see it on the
end of every single video because it's
like I got so many good courses there
and it's like a single price and you're
gonna get access to everything okay and
just like grill man real real
content things that's that you can fly
to real jobs like I don't come in and
give you guys courses tutorials on
things that there are dumb that you're
never gonna find at your job
everything that I do is for a reason
it's like teaching you a skill that
you're gonna have
to use that your job you know no that's
a light there are food your Tony Tony
boy bro they I don't know who you've
been following man you gotta be careful
out here man you gotta be careful oh my
god please somebody help me
we gotta get Tony out of this world I
don't know where Tony the people that
I've been talking to Tony I feel bad man
cuz Tony and don't feel bad it's not
just you man it's not just you wrong
it's literally like so many people yo
people come into the internet and tell
people like oh man WordPress's
is like the worst thing you go in there
that's where dreams stuck some I heard
somebody say something like go WordPress
is where dreams go to die as I bro it's
not like that
like people thing is like oh you become
a wordpress developer you'll never get
higher anywhere because they see
WordPress is like bro they it's not like
that at all
it's not for beginning developers at all
WordPress is is a CMS system creative
for people that don't know how how to
build their own websites but the
WordPress developers the guys who
building the beams the guys who are
building the plugins the guys who are
building things are customized in that
platform those guys are big kid those
guys know how to code this is not this
is not like guys coming in out of no way
and you gotta understand it's a huge
difference between being a wordpress
developer and being a guy on Fiverr
right a guy of fiber like I say I'm on a
business I think I should make a video
about this because people should
understand the difference between a
developer and a content editor right
there's guys on fiber who own let's say
five ten different
deems right that they bought online or
they download it for free so what they
do is they offer to people hey I'll
build you a website for five dollars
ain't it every other page is gonna cost
you ten dollars that's it it doesn't
cost them nothing to to pretty much just
upload that team and then just give it
to some poor guy who needs Oh a little
website and then people think like
that's WordPress development like no
that's not WordPress development that's
like that's like the that your your
boy that's like the type of that
your boy is out here trying to teach you
guys without saying no names you gotta
say like that's not web development
you're gonna say that's not really what
development that's like that's like
fiber scheming type Craigslist type
shape like exactly like team is like
team freaking flipping like that's not
really what development man that's not
WordPress web development at all that's
like a constant editor that's like
somebody who comes in it like let's say
your designer don't know how to name a
designer somebody who owns the blog and
it's like okay I want to start my own
blog he'll use WordPress and you buy a
theme and then people would think oh
yeah he knows WordPress he knows how to
install and upload a theme that he
bought on online but you don't know
WordPress you gotta say like that's the
type of things that you're gonna see you
on on freakin on fiber and like
that like you're not gonna compete with
with guys on a fiber man like if you
know WordPress you could work with a
digital agency and you could get a lot
of money I'm not lying to you guys y'all
look Tony for this search creative
circle search for creative circle
they constantly have jobs for WordPress
developers I'm not talking about little
amount of money I'm exactly like that
creative circle I'm talking about $50
and up that's why I'm telling you it and
look it up freakin Taylor Swift's
website WordPress are freaking universal
music group all the websites that you
could think of that's out there like as
far as like music websites they are all
built with WordPress WordPress is like
WordPress mph fee is like 80% of the
internet like you know it's not one of
those things where people be like oh man
we we create robots and we program
robots it's not a thing that you're
gonna be like oh yeah I freaking our
program you know the autom automated
cars from uber like nah but if you want
to get money if you look at this as a
career you know like most people that I
see that so sure about were present and
PHP and and a whole bunch of other
they look at programming as if it was a
religion if you're here to get money
like me I'm here for the money I ain't
here to get I don't need kudos from a
couple of dudes playing yugioh cards you
got on saying like dude that we was
giving wedgies you know in school like
I'm not looking to get props from them
like I'm here for the back you gotta say
like I'm not here to be like oh I'm
hanging out with the cool cool nerdy
guys and I get respect from the nerdy
guys like I could give a damn about that
you got on saying like I'm here for the
bag I'm here for the money man you know
I'm not here to be like oh this is a
religion is like if you don't love
programming in this distant sounds like
nah man I'm like where the money at
where's the bag you know you could keep
that you could keep trying to become the
smartest guide and you keep trying to
how to write the most Pro you know
efficient efficient or freakin algorithm
you could keep that I know where the bag
is that and it's not there you got I'm
saying like that's the truth plus it's
like a lot of those guys they're looking
for a dream a dream of like getting
validation from other developers in you
know in becoming the next person to
create a programming language like I'm
not looking for that I'm looking to take
care of my family I'm looking to pay my
bills I'm looking to be able to flip
money you know it's like you know say
like in five years right I was working
for five years man all my bank account
and just from me saving money for me
working hard I'm looking at almost three
hundred thousand dollars this year alone
I'm about to go higher than what I did
last year last year I made one hundred
seventy four thousand dollars that year
right this year I'm about to go over
that you gotta say like somebody might
come in here but I oh man this guy don't
know what he's doing this guy he's you
know he mixed up at this programming
language he almost said programming
languages instead of frameworks like
yeah I'm doing one hour a one hour
livestream you gotta say sometimes you
mess up most people are scared to even
come on camera and talk about anything
technical but me I don't care I'm here
giving you real life experience in real
life advice you know that I've seen
you know so you can learn from my
mistakes you know most of these guys are
stuck somewhere you know I've met so
many guys who are geniuses who are
programming geniuses like and then they
stuck at a company for ten years earning
$60,000 might make $100,000 above what
they make it's like what the hell is
them to tell me anything you gotta say
and I don't even work for Google I'll
never work for Google of network for you
to I've never worked for another that
 you know
yeah almost $300 on my bank account
I'll careful from Queens freaky who
pretty much is like Gil I'm out here I'm
gonna $80,000 car like I got a freaky I
got a crazy crib you know I live on a
hill like you know sailing I'm not
looking for validation for from other
nerds who might come in here oh man you
know we try to we try to make the most
efficient array
you know sorting array as I bro you
could keep that I'm not looking into
that I'm looking at I think it's like
where's the bag you know how can we make
money how can we flip things like look
at this what called team forest right
team four is th e ma e fo r est there's
a lot of guys there who have made over
two million dollars on one single team
of WordPress the thing that everybody
talks about you know what I'm
saying like wow people might come in and
be like oh that's not developing that's
not programming that's not this isn't
that it's like well some dude just left
with two million dollars out of that
 sign me up
you get what I'm saying like you knowing
everything that I do is for a reason for
me it was this whole switching up to
Lodi is because I put in so much work to
this channel that I know this channel
should be way bigger than what it is and
it's not the content it's the fact that
I didn't know how to YouTube game work I
came in here just like sharing content
and doing my livestream cuz I love I
love talking to you guys I love hanging
out I didn't know that doing live
streams actually hurt you you know what
I mean I didn't know that I hurt it will
hurt my channel from do you know one
hour two hour livestream there's my way
to actually stay in contact with you
guys in and talking and conversing about
different things you know what I mean
like
like I always tell you guys man don't
listen to us on the internet don't
listen to what those is telling you man
like you will have two things are you
here because you're looking to make
money and be successful or are you here
because you want to be in the
programming religion you know what I
mean which one do you want to be do you
want to be the guy that looks at things
as a religion or do you want to be the
guy that that is out here looking to
make their money and just continue
growing and even at that there's so many
developers one of my friend hit me up
and super smart
hit me up like two or three days ago
he's like man I want to disconnect from
the matrix
that's how corny the matrix when you
work for a company you know you do
eight hours nine hours a day you come
home stressed out you get your little
 hundred thousand dollars a year
that's the matrix for me right everybody
would go through but after your four for
the fifth year you're already thinking
how can I get out of here you know I
already achieved that I already got out
I left I ain't looking back so those are
the things were yo that should be the
name of the course where's the bag this
hey guys go check go check out coding
things calm new course where's the bag
act you know what I mean
ha how to get the bag that's what a guy
yo you know that's one of the main
reasons why I'm also doing this Lodi
thing man because it's like I love
coding I love programming I love it but
I can't look at it as a religion you
know what I mean even with the amount of
hate that I get on my emails and not
email all my comments and all the crazy
 that people be putting racist
I'm like you know what man I'm gonna
continue to drop in videos on coding
phase calm but I'm not here for the
dudes who are looking at this like
a religion I'm here for the back I'm
here for for the money I'm here to you
know freakin two years ago I was making
ninety five thousand dollars a year
right and then the year before I dropped
on what was it in 2017 my money dropped
because I took a job that was paying me
less then after I did that I say okay if
I'm making less here I gotta step up my
game on my side huh you know my son
hustles me 174 by myself
lassy so I say I mean 85 100 5000 or
something like that oh my all on the
side right then now coming from that
world on my yo I need to step my game up
like if I made a hundred seventy five
last year 174 it's like how can I step
the game up this year you know how can
we make this $300 in one shot
you're gonna say and then the next year
after that how can we make it to 600 and
then after that how can we make a
million a year you're gonna see the
whole shape man you're gonna see the
whole gameplay like everything that I do
is for a reason like I'm not
I might not speak like the best you know
I'm not the most articulate dude
the most whatever man because that's how
I grow from the hood you know I got from
the hood like this like you know say
like my accident it's my swag that's my
sauce that stuff this the that I
got but it's like how how cameras a man
you know
go ahead stupid go with them chicks
will be the third little piggy imma
with them bricks better yet the bakery I
got possum cakes you know turn five to
eight eight to eight 200 that's 100 no
that's 1,000 that to a hundred thousand
in front of housing you're gonna say
like don't matter what your phone you
just got a freaking do it that's the
future right there nice little
neighborhood tell ya I'm see what up do
came from the hood we out here now we in
suburbs you know saying like this is the
 that those dream about we are here
just just telling like this a nice coat
what they call this I don't even
know how to say it right like how you
pronounce that shake a nice little coat
to sack or some like that right now
your boy hasn't made it
we above-average that's what we got
right now so we haven't made it yet it
is when you when you love doing big
moves you know what I mean I haven't
done no big lose it but it's gonna come
here I'm still young I'm 30 give me some
time
you gotta say it's like back in the days
man I remember I was like 16 years old
and I used to see the you know the big
drug dealers coming through the block
pick up all the girls in the high school
and I used to like man one day I'm gonna
pass all them things right one day I'm
gonna pass way beyond them and it
happened now I look at a lot of
developers in the game and I'm like I'm
gonna pass a lot of those rules right
without having to be the smartest guy in
the game I happened to be the guy that
went to MIT the guy that went to Harvard
because it happens if you put in the
work it happens and all that is
happening now
it just is a process as little by little
you live and you learn
you know even with this YouTube thing
like I say when I came in here I wasn't
thinking about making use I don't want
to become big in youtube at all now that
I'm doing I love it so much I'm like I
can't get stuck in and like in the back
alleys of YouTube like now I know what I
got I need to make it to the top how can
we do it to the top without being fake
without being freakin a clown without
being one of these dudes selling dreams
telling people like hey man you want to
make a million dollars in one week you
want to buy a house with 50 cents in
your pocket like I never want to do some
 like that sending people dreams
hell no I want to show people how to do
it with hard work and show showing us
myself as an example like if you do hard
work she's gonna happen
yeah man go to the website mint
once again with man that's the point man
I appreciate it you got my face that's
the icon that's when you know you
somebody they they like you and I
appreciate that just want to go remote
my advise is first of all gotta give
yourself time for you to become like
fully remote it's not gonna happen on
your first year it will happen on your
second year your first year should be
you working in a company I always tell
people this all the time because when
you're going and get paid as a remote
developer you you you don't have no help
there's there's no co-developer next to
you there's nobody else that can hold
your hand so my advice my advice is go
work at a company first and they're from
there and they're from they're freaking
you know start applying for remote jobs
and it could happen your first job could
be remotely but I don't advise it I
don't advise them because you want to be
able to you know when you work in a
company you have the flexibility to f up
when you work remotely you supposed to
know what you're doing because you can't
just be like oh I'm gonna work from home
and not even know how what the hell
you're doing you know what I mean as far
as the the web developer challenge I'm
releasing that tonight before you guys
we're gonna see who's the winner man
I've seen a lot of good HTML tables that
look legit I'm gonna share that with you
guys
later on tonight we're gonna go over it
you should be leaving out a new jersey
so heading back to New York not New York
damn okay
I'm missing heading back to New York now
heading back to Connecticut yeah if you
move to LA you're gonna be good always
moving to a bigger city it's gonna give
you more opportunities so I'll
definitely check that out but yeah man

90 minutes that's and I would not I
would a half so I will see you guys
