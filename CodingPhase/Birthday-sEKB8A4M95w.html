amount of time you know what I mean like

besides that so
that's where I share all those things
you know somebody was sending one thing
Chris Shawn was telling me I should just
put my vlogs and all my stuff here but I
want to put them at the same time it's
like you know I know a lot of the people
here also - just don't care about that
you know what I mean they don't want to
see me hanging out with the baby hanging
out with the family like they're here
for coding so you know I respect that
I was watching that's my Chris Hawkes
man that was sad you know I feel bad for
him you know because you're going
through a divorce after 14 years and you
know sometimes I don't know his business
but at the same time it's like sometimes
you think about it like you know being a
developer does it contribute to the
relationship is it bad
you know i mean--can sometimes as
developers we're constantly learning and
constantly working at work and then
working at home you know that could take
a toll on the relationship noting that
that's what happened with him but I
wonder if that could be a case you know
saying but it's like even right now I'm
trying to manage how to chill with the
family spend time with the family</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
