want to try this code thing out guys it
doesn't matter just try to get your
money out here and don't work for free
okay
now let's go back into this so the
subject for today is something very
special so I received that email today
of somebody who who told me like yo man
you know I did my portfolio or you check
it out portfolios looking good I might
be doing a review on it later on
and the portfolio J I like it now he
tells me yeah I was telling and showing
it to my boss to see what my boss thinks
I don't know exactly what he does but
this is my biggest advice for you guys
especially now 2018 we're starting a new
year keep this to yourself kids keep
this to yourself I'm gonna be honest
take it from my my experience right
every single time that I've told
somebody hey man I have my own website
where I you know I basically sell
courses or I have my own website where I
build you know I make money out of you
know for people that come in and check
out the services I make money off what
of a website where people come in and
download music I make money off this
this and that soon as I start telling my
business cuz I'm that type of person I'm
not type of person when it's like well
I'm having something good in my life I
want to share it to people because I
want them to get motivated but people at
work people at your job
people that are how can I say this like
people who are you know some type of
level where they feel like they are a
little bit above you you don't give them
no information about your life those
people do not want you to do good
because it feels good when you're on top
of somebody it feels good when you're
the boss
it feels good when you're on top of
other people and you know why and you're
like oh like like for example like I'm
gonna give you a good example
alright this is my last job whatever you
know where I used to work at not saying
the company's name you want to look it
up look it up yeah so I'm in this
company I tell his people like oh here's
like they ask me about marketing stuff
and the people from marketing don't know
anything
and then I'm helping them out and giving
them ideas and the boss is like oh wow I
didn't know that you know that you knew
so much about you know marketing and all
this other stuff in and I'm like yeah
and then it comes down to another time
where you know something with the
designer and then they looking into it
like oh the design is not that good
maybe we should get somebody who knows
about design and I'm like yeah and I
started giving my opinions and give
giving them examples of websites how was
I supposed to be and people's like oh
wow we didn't know that you know about
design and I'm like my second degree I
went to school for design like you get
what I'm saying then from there another
situation is like you know talking about
marketing for YouTube and helping people
out and I'm like yo if you want to
release your product and you want
influencers here's the website and then
the guys like the boss is like oh I
didn't know that that you know like that
you know about this like as if I'm like
some idiot that I'm like some computer
monkey that all I can do this code right
now that's another thing now this
a complete other situation now I'm
giving you a couple of situations right
where people already thinking like all
you can do is just that one job that
you're there for they think that you're
your talent is just that that you're
only going to be doing that right now
there's another situation so um whatever
me and my partner we're talking you know
I work and we're talking about you know
how much money I make on the side and
this this and that and then when you
start comparing it how much money I made
on my job compared to how much money I
make on the side I made about probably
like two thousand three thousand dollars
more on top of like on my side job this
is not specific numbers let's see on my
job I'm making six thousand and on the
other job on my side job and labor my
side job the side things that I do side
businesses the side that I do in
this world
I make nine thousand right today me and
my partner we're talking about it cuz we
cool and then this other bozo who's been
there for god knows how long
you know he's been there his whole life
and he comes in he's like he's like like
you knows like you're like you make
money on the side like I didn't know
that from that day on that dude looked
at me like I don't know like jealousy
like he was freaking envious like just
pissed off right and this is how it is
at different jobs different work don't
tell people your business for twenty
eighteen make it a rule don't tell
people that you're trying to better
yourself don't tell people that you make
money on the side don't tell people the
things that you do because this people
don't want you to do good they don't
want you to shine then I want you to
make money out here you know every boss
out there is gonna want you to be under
them every boss don't want you to to
come in and be like hey man is like you
know when I
I got my my Benz right I was looking in
the dealership I was gonna buy a
Maserati I could have bought it right
I'm going to work and I was like yeah
it's like I was gonna buy the Maserati
it's like you gotta buy a Maserati like
I don't even have a Maserati and I'm
like the manager here and I'm thinking
in my hand like bro you don't know my
finances like you don't know what I make
out here you because you see me here
working on this field doesn't mean that
you know my business you get what I'm
saying like you don't know how much
money I'm ready out here kid like you
gotta say like this dude's out here that
I know that working company that on
their side businesses they make like
another 200 grand on top of that but you
cannot tell that to nobody on your
company because if you go in and you
tell them like hey man I'm just here for
the love of code all right they're gonna
look at you like you're crazy you know
when I was working most companies you
know I was working there for the love of
code not because I needed it
it's not like I'm freaking dying like oh
man if I don't work I don't pay my bills
I don't I don't live nah man you gotta
understand like I'm that type of person
I always had SCI incomes even from you
know back in the days you know you buy
your sneakers you know you buy one
Jordan then you buy the other Jordan to
basically resell like I did all of that
things man like I've already done that
through my whole life I sold things on
eBay I sold things on Amazon like I've
always had a side hustle anybody you
gotta learn from this you cannot tell
people especially now 2018 your
businesses you can't tell them like hate
what you're doing you can't tell her
about how much money you making out here
especially when you are a co-worker or
you work under somebody because there's
people they don't know you they in their
head they think that they know
everything about you but they don't all
right they already look at you a certain
way you know it's like it's like me I go
in there like this with the same hoodie
you don't fit it you know I go in there
chillin you get
going how I go in in their head they
thinking this guy's he's barely
surviving in this world is the thing the
same thing how some people might come in
and look at me I'm like bro you don't
even know where I am what the hell I am
you know what I mean like but that's
just how it is that's how people
perceive you and and they look at you
right so I feel bad for this kid cuz I'm
like girl I've been in those situations
where you go in and you're working with
a co-worker you work with a boss and you
tell them oh yeah it's like oh look at
the things that I'm looking I'm working
on so to make the story shorter he told
like the balls like oh look at my
portfolio in the portfolio on the boss
was like you didn't make this like
laughing you know jokingly trying to you
know act like you didn't make this son
like you don't have the talent for that
alright so that's how people are so be
prepared people aren't like that you get
what I'm saying like people are like
that people are pretty much snakes when
I go into most work and most jobs I
don't go in there thinking I'm a bump
into friends I'm a I'm gonna meet people
who are nice nah most people are
cutthroat most people want to put you
down to make themselves look bigger if
they have a little something they want
to be able to you know you know what I
mean like just even the most simplest
things man like this things like you
know even like what I'm telling you know
when I bought my car I'm like yeah man
it's like I could have just went in and
bought the Maserati yeah I was thinking
about doing it but the reason why I
didn't do it it's because I was like you
know what I'm about to have a kid it
looks dumb it looks crazy me buying a
Maserati when I need a freakin how you
call it how you call this the freakin
cars SUV right so I need a SUV to really
be comfortable it would have been
annoying to be in a you know in a
four-door car that small has a small
trunk
wouldn't have me sense right but for
them they're like Oh God you can't
afford a Maserati probably you do not
know me like you get what I'm saying
and this is just stories that happens
all the time you know this other
companies where I've been are like when
I had told somebody like yeah man like
I'm trying to learn the backend like
back in the beginning when I was working
like digital design firms and stuff like
that and they're like listen man just
just be glad that you're in the field
just stay with you know with the fern
and stay with JavaScript
and it's like what does that mean like
be happy that I'm in the field like you
get over sound like you don't know me to
tell me if I could do the backend if I
could come in and make applications if I
could come in and make iOS applications
there's people out there that don't want
the best for you let's be honest let's
just keep it 100 people do not want you
to do good out here you gotta understand
that not everybody is like me not
everybody's like you most of these
people are literally walking around
crabs you know what I mean in this world
it's like we're in a bucket and
everybody's a crap everybody that's
trying to make it to the top they'll
bring the other crap down and then until
one crab makes it to the top but
everybody is crabs it's just people
crabbing on each other you got when I'm
singing so with this video my advice for
you guys for today is you know let's
let's work hard this year but let's keep
this between me and you let's keep this
between maybe me and you and your
girlfriend your wife or something like
that not even too many family members
because people do not want you to do
good if people start knowing that you're
on your way in your trajectory going up
you're about to jump classes if you was
making if you was making you know 50 60
grand you you're middle class you're
pretty much making the same thing to
every single person out here is making
the moment you start
touching 85 and up then it's a whole
different ballgame it might not seem
like much but you're making way more
than a lot of people all right once you
touch a hundred you're making what a
whole family makes in a lot of
households right when you make like 250
grand up you're comfortable now you're
one of the privileged people right why
do you think like a lot of this you know
the not to put it out there like most of
this white white people don't even want
nobody to know how much money they've
got because they know how people are
there's people that are crabs out here
there's people that want to prey on
other people who are doing good in their
life there's people that just want to
hate on you like let's say right now
somebody was you go to a place right
let's say for example you was going to
replace and they they know you right
they they know you for Wow and they're
like okay Joe always comes here and
because he always comes here he buys his
turkey sandwich right
he gets his turkey sandwich right you
come in you get your turkey sandwich you
your turkey sandwich is eight dollars
right but because you buy every single
day now you know what Joe's always here
they'll charge you seven fifty seven
dollars the moment they know how much
money you really make it out here
they're like now charging nine remind
you you've been going to the same store
you've been buying everything for god
knows how long
but because they know how how much
you're making out here how much you
doing you know how much you're moving
they'll charge you you know four nine
right so it's like now it's not even
then I am in charging you the regular
price they're charging you like a hate
price they just like hey man it's eight
dollars but because I know he got it let
me charge him that extra dollar more
that's how life is you know you come in
you tell your boss your business your
boss could even fire you for just saying
hey you're not focusing
of our company you know saying like they
do stuff like that I'm sending you guys
out of experience keep your business to
yourself whatever you're making out here
keep it to yourself whatever worked at
you you trying to get into you're trying
to get into web development keep it to
yourself don't tell nobody because the
moment that they start seeing you and
they're like oh this person's trying to
better himself he's not even trying to
be here he's not focused on this thing
let me go get another slave to come and
focus on this job that's just how it is
you get what I'm saying and you know
that's just how it is man I got so many
stories of situations like that because
the problem with this is when you're
like an entrepreneur when you're like a
go-getter where you're somebody who who
pushes themselves forward right people
don't like that right
and there's my last story that I'll give
you guys I was in another job you know
working for a BS company and I'm telling
you like this the company we were
supposed to create our application we
created application for whatever reason
the application did not succeed it
wasn't popular a matter of fact the
people who I was working with they
decided to to use angular and nobody
knew how to use angular and I told her
angular has a whole bunch of different
bugs and a whole bunch of BS at that
time angular one so then we had to redo
everything that we did from angular 1
and then we had to do it in laravel
because they also did it in raw PHP I
don't know why yeah so they did
everything in raw PHP so they from day
we had to do it in laravel definitely we
had to do it react so mine you make the
story short after we did all of this
stuff basically the website we lost it
too late so pretty much we lost money
there right now alder is firing people
letting people go and I say you know
what man
maybe I I could still help this company
and I told him about creating content
online and reselling it online like you
know promoting it promoting facebooking
every time that people go to your your
website you make money off the
advertising I told them about this I was
like look this is what I do there's the
how I make my son money so I told him a
body and I saw him hey you have money
where you could come in and promote it
even more so you could scale it to you
know sky's the limit
- God knows how far you could take it
because you have the money to invest
into it
so that guy goes like cool all right I'm
gonna do it mind you he does it there
from there I have him on my Facebook and
everything this guy is like a complete
loser he's one of those people that it's
like illiterate people who don't have
education people who somehow they got
money in this world but they don't know
anything right all they know is their
field this guy was like a construction
type of type of dude but all he knows is
construction everything else he's an
idiot so mind you we come in we I build
them the website we average you know
putting advertising we're doing a whole
bunch of stuff and then the dude was
like hey I saw that on your Facebook you
promote it one of your your post from
your website at 3 o'clock and I was like
yeah
I have a system that does it
automatically that promotes my website
on different schedules right guys it's
cool
let's go scheduling you you idiot right
so I told him about this the guy goes
like oh I don't know I think this is
gonna be a problem because I want to
start doing this and you're doing this
on your on your side I don't think
you're gonna pay enough attention to my
my website the way how you gonna pay
attention to yours and I'm like you
effing idiot
like I put you onto this thing and then
you want me to leave what I'm doing to
work for you on your site like even on
my off times like this how people are
snakes there's how bosses are snakes
this is how managers are snakes there's
people out there like that so it's up to
you if you really want to work with
people like that and only that just
don't share your your business don't
share your ideas don't show you nothing
go in there if you are a janitor going
there as a janitor do your generate a
job and get the hell out of there get
your check
you are a bus driver you're just a bus
driver go in there get your check and
get the hell out of there if you come in
and you were like you know what I'm a
bus driver and you know what I also a
mechanic people's gonna be tight then
I'm like who is this guy
he thinks he's special he's better than
all of us like you get what I'm saying
like that's how people think so you have
to be careful out here so what I'm
saying for 2018 let's make this a rule
there's a rule for me too for this 2018
don't share your ideas don't share what
you do on the side with nobody period
nobody wants to see you do good nobody
wants you to do better than them nobody
wants you to say hey I make income here
with you working for you and at the same
time I probably make more on my own they
don't want to hear that because the idea
of work the idea of a job is for you to
be with a slave mentality right the
moment you think outside of that slave
mentality you are a glitch on the matrix
that's always say this Kanye West always
says this - I'm a glitch on a matrix the
moment you come in and you do something
that you're outside of your realm
people look at you as a glitch you're
our enemy you're not a friend
you're now our enemy because you're not
doing what's the norm
okay people want you to just be like
what I do is my nine-to-five job yeah
you could do you nine-to-five job but
people act like there's not other other
incomes you can make outside bosses
owners or CEO CTOs they want you to just
work on your 9:00 to 5:00 that's about
it don't share anything besides that
with anybody because if you share it at
the end of the day you're the one that's
gonna come out losing because now that
extra income that you was getting from
that place they could take it away those
extra hours that they used to give you
because they know that you already make
money on the side they could take it
away because there was gonna give you a
little BS dollar fifty a freaking race
next month because they know you're
trying to better yourself they say now
we're not gonna give it to this guy he's
trying to study something else that's
not related to this let's give it to the
guy who's gonna be a slave here for the
next ten years you get what I'm saying
like that's how it works so don't share
it 20:18 keep your goals to yourself
keep the things you're working on to
yourself don't share it with people
there's people out here who I just craps
inside of a bucket and that's just how
it is
all right guys so I'll see you guys
later I do apologize to remind you guys
about this gal access path past 65% off
I do apologize to even have to bring it
up in the beginning of the video but
it's because people who send me emails
and then I came in I can't afford this
Don this week can I pay for it until
Friday so what I say go ahead don't
worry I'll make it until Friday all
right so I'll see you guys later
this your boy Joe back at it again
coding phase com leave a comment I
really there's like one of those
subjects that we need to have a
conversation so leave a comment so we
can all talk about this alright see you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
