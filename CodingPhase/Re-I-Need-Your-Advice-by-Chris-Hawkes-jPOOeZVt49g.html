again man
coding face.com your boy is backing out
and did it again all right listen guys
I'm over here watching your boy Chris
hogs he got a new video he's like yo I
need your advice
remind me of me like when I'm over here
asking you guys like questions like what
do you guys think about certain things
but um yeah I just wanted to give him an
advice what I think he should do so he's
asking about um what do people think if
he should start making courses to sell
courses online or like you know you know
what I mean like he's thinking about
creating a react course that he has
right and it's a series right so and he
said he's probably gonna release it for
you too and it'll be great
I'll get him more subscribers or get one
more more views give him like you know I
don't know maybe $1,000 for the whole
series on YouTube with ads especially
now because the ads really suck so
nobody really makes the money on YouTube
anymore but you know I'm a total - Chris
directly Chris this is what I think
that's what I think you should do you
gotta understand your crown right you
have a lot of people a lot of
subscribers right and this is me I study
everybody's channel I study everybody
out here you know cuz I learned from
everybody I learned from everybody that
was there before me I learned from the
people that coming up it's like I look
at what they doing
never copying anybody whatever people's
doing I go to the left whatever I look
that somebody's going to the right I go
somewhere else right you know so that's
what I do but at the same time I like to
study what the hell you know their
audience is like who do they like you
know what I mean like I look at your
channel and your channel has a lot of
subscribers now when I look at the
comments the people are in the comments
that's your core audience 80,000
subscribers and reality doesn't mean any
because that's like people use the
subscribe button as like bookmarking
something somebody watches a video or a
tutorial die a day they bookmark it
right they added to their list if you
two want to be nice they'll show them
your videos again if not they might
never see your channel again and that's
just how it is now because everything
sucks on YouTube so the people who are
on your comments all the time those are
the people that's like your core
audience your core audience it's not the
beginners right it's not the people who
are like just starting they're not there
for you you know what I mean like the
people are there for you or people like
myself may level to senior level
developers right so guys who have years
enix of experience or guys who have been
working in different companies and you
know when you come in and you sound
frustrated about certain technology or
when you come in and you talk about
what's happening in the industry those
are the guys that aren't there for you
you know what I mean like you if you was
to create tutorials and you want to sell
of course your courses should never be
targeted to beginners because that's not
the audience that's not the people that
find you know what I mean that's not the
people has really got a support you so
what I think you should do is focus on
Python more advanced Python like there's
so many people like this um this loser
kid or whatever programmer he's making
money somehow like literally like pretty
much tricking people right and I don't
see his his experience as a developer
right so I look at you and I'm like wait
Chris Hawke should be doing this like if
there should be a Python guy a Python
go-to guy it should be you you know what
I mean like you've been doing this for a
long time you have experience working in
major companies which is something that
I tell people too it's like you know why
do I feel like somebody should buy my
course cos I have experience of working
in real companies man like I come in
here i swag
I dab I hit him with a little slang but
that's my style for you too but I have
real companies behind my my back you
know what I mean like I have those
stripes I have those you know those
those badges you know what I mean and I
think I'm like yo Chris Hobbs has a
couple of badges he has seven years in
this he's had he's worked for major
companies guy go away you know I don't
know exactly the new company working
like but you've worked for real
companies so if somebody was gonna teach
about web development or more advanced
courses I would go to you I would go and
buy a course for me I will buy and be
like okay he's on udemy or Pluralsight I
was subscribed to Pluralsight for you
know for whatever long it takes me to
have you know to finish your course I
would do there I'm a mid-level to senior
level developer right that's where I'm a
senior developer that's but I say my
levels seen it level developer anybody
who's above three or four years that's
your core audience you know it wouldn't
make sense for you to come out with
something like something like HTML CSS
because that's not really your crown
that's not the people that that
alone you you know what I mean the
people that follow you are people who
are experiments people who know what the
hell they're talking about people who
enjoy your your your talks so that's
what I think that's what I think that
you should do for sure you know and this
is my message to everybody else right
now on YouTube there's a lot of people
scrambling you know scrambling I'm like
oh man what should i do what should you
know it's like there's no money on
YouTube no more there's no more than
that guys this money on YouTube you just
have to be yourself that's number one
number two you gotta understand the idea
that you were supposed to make a million
dollars from you know a freakin coding
channel if you thought that that was
gonna happen at some point most likely
is not gonna happen
kids like
take that idea out of your head if you
thought that that was gonna happen
that's one of the points another point
is basically for people who don't even
have to experience like people who don't
have experience people who have nothing
on the resume people who have no no no
background like don't even try to create
a course man
don't create a course you just started
like you know what I mean like you just
started in this industry like you don't
even have experience what what are you
gonna teach people you know what I mean
like you have to have like some type of
skills and some type of like history in
the industry to be teaching because then
what are you doing then you just become
like one of those Indian instructors
from udemy and you to me there's so many
instructors was a packed publishing they
hire a whole bunch of Indian instructors
guys who just read the documentation day
four never done those are never in their
life touch those languages and they're
teaching like Python teaching JavaScript
teaching a whole bunch of stuff they've
never done none of the stuff they never
work for a company all they've done is
read the documentation and it's like
okay I'm gonna teach it like this I'm
gonna break it down like this or they
copy somebody else's course or they go
verbatim from somebody else's course on
YouTube that's free like you know for
those of you guys that want to jump into
this game man you gotta have some type
of history man like that's the truth man
you can't just jump in for the hell of
it you know what I mean like somebody
like traversing media like I've bought
courses from him from you know he was
already onyx I don't know if he's still
messing with them but he has a whole
bunch of courses with him and you know
like he's pretty dope right now I don't
know exactly what's his business model
or on YouTube you know cuz it's it's
hard he's giving out so much free
content that in reality I don't know how
in the long term how his business is
gonna is gonna go but it's hard
it's gonna be definitely hard for
everybody out here with how you two is
right now you know what traversing media
killing the game you know when it comes
to the tutorials it's like he got every
tutorial out there you know what I mean
you know that's why me I feel lucky
because I have a core audience that they
want to learn from me and at the same
time it's the way I teach it to them
because we all could come here and say
hey we're gonna teach HTML CSS and look
at the documentation you break it down
or hey I'm gonna teach angular and I
break it down the same way how the
documentation is anybody can do that but
the idea behind it is can you teach it
in a way that the person is gonna
understand it and it's gonna hit him in
the head like oh cool he broke it down
for me right like me I don't come here
and try to be like you know freaking try
to act like I'm super smart I'm you know
what I mean I'm not fun fun function
like I love that guy but he's like super
legit he's like he knows every single
thing about I guess the Dom like let's
say an example he knows every single
object in there right and you break it
down to every single one me I'm not that
guy I'm the guy that comes in and
teaches you something and breaks it down
in a way that you can understand it
because I as a you know somebody who is
self-taught like I know what I need you
know and the things that I needed when I
was starting to learn I didn't need
somebody to come in and give me the big
words and explained the difficult things
in one shot now I need somebody to just
talk to me like a regular human being
talk to me in English and break things
down you know simple you know but going
back to Chris Hawkes it's like what I
think is your audience bro is is really
you know the mid to see me love you guys
like we are looking for more advanced
stuff you know what I mean like I'll be
honest I don't think if you was to do
like HTML CSS like that's not gonna do
no money at all because that's not your
audience the people that really go to
use like
the Geist I know what the hell is going
on and in the industry you know what I
mean so that's what I was saying man
just create a courses put it on
Pluralsight put it on you to me hit up
what was this guy's name home simple
programmer he knows how to play the game
like he's made money you know through
there so he knows I mean I'm pretty sure
he if you ask him he's gonna give you
some tips on it on why exactly you
should don't but you gotta find the
right course you gotta do a research you
gotta do you know
I'm telling you from experience myself
cuz I'm noticing a lot of things things
that even courses that I thought I was
gonna do like really really good are not
doing really good in courses that took
that took me forever to make are doing
okay compared to the courses that I was
like this course this is not gonna do
anything
and for some reason don't sort of course
is that everybody wants and everybody
likes and everybody enjoy so it's like
you got a do a research and see exactly
what's your audience and then from there
you gotta do the research on what's the
courses that's out there that's gonna
you know it's gonna get you the most for
your time because this does suck I'll be
honest I come home I'm like yo I'm over
here working for many hours knocking a
whole bunch of videos and even like
right now I have a subscription-based
you know I'll take problem one of the
first ones doing that because I know a
lot of people's probably gonna hop on
that but um I was the one of the first
ones doing the subscription-based but
pretty much I are looking in the stats
and I'm like man the course is that I
think everybody's gonna hop on and
they've gotta enjoy it's not really what
they want like my audience is really
more of like you know super junior
developers guys who are coming up guys
who they just got the spark but they
don't know if they really want to jump
on it you know what I mean so it's like
the way how to break it down for them I
help them out to get the courses out
but you know that's my audience that's
the type of people that I have you know
what I mean it's like somebody hit me up
the other day they're like man do you
wanna get some more advanced and and
more advanced and cool stuff like when
you was doing the rocky stack and
crystal Lang and when you were talking
about gold Lang and I'm like bro that's
not my audience that's not the people
that come to my channel you know what I
mean
like that's not the audience that I have
if I go and create those things those
courses and those tutorials and reality
what I'm doing is I'm throwing it to the
air like nobody's gonna watch it you
know what I mean because that's not my
audience and then on top of that even
how Google works like Google's not it's
not throwing me like you know like more
mid-level just senior level developers
it's more like beginners and that's fine
I love that because I could help them
out and then it's like I'm bringing my
audience with me I'm taking them from
you know knowing nothing to becoming
junior developers to coming mid-levels
will becoming senior level developers
right so it's like I'm I'm basically
grabbing them with me and you know
taking them step by step you know taking
them to the next level but like I said
man you know everybody right now
scrambling dogs everybody right now
scrambling you know I was like people's
like yo man you know thought I was gonna
be making million dollars on youtube
views like now we don't have that
audience we don't have Jake Paul Logan
Paul or the in its like this is tech
stuff this is like educational
like you know what I mean like weird
occasional right now we're all like this
is the educational squad you know what I
mean we in the same listen we're not
even with the diys man like you you know
you create a channel about DIY like hey
guys let's make little flowers with
pieces of paper or let's make like you
know carve boom box cards or a little
 like that right we don't even get
that
like because those guys they make a lot
of money because a lot of people watch
them for us we don't we don't get those
type of views you know what I mean like
I look at your channel you've been here
for what like four or five years and
just getting to like 80,000 so that
means that's like wow that's like almost
like 20,000 subscribers per year like
you know these guys out here if it was
on a different topic of different genre
then right now you would have probably
had like a million subscribers you know
what I mean but it just sucks it's just
how it is you know it's like with time
people will appreciate and they'll be
like man you know those guys were like
the pioneer of this you know what I mean
but right now it's like it doesn't
matter plus there's not a really good
platform for the content creators you
know especially when you have you know
it's like I look at you know a couple of
guys from you to me like that's where
for me that's where my passion is now
like YouTube is not it's not really up
for me right now right cuz I look at you
to me I'm a girl and you to me I poster
of course 5,000 5,000 people register
for my course right now if I go into I
put a video or like a series here on
YouTube maybe 200 people do it out of my
eight thousand nine thousand subscribers
that I have you know like there's a big
difference all right especially when you
come home and you're like oh you do so
many videos and you do this whole series
and like literally only like 5000 people
out of your 80,000 people get to watch
it like it sucks so going back to the
topic manages create courses for you
know mid-level to advanced topics man
don't even waste your time don't even
waste your time doing uh you know
frickin beginner courses that's just
being honest you're gonna waste your
time you're gonna get frustrated same
thing as me it's like I come in I try to
do some more advanced stuff and it's not
really there the audience is not really
there for me
not yet you know what I mean so when I
do those courses or do those tutorials
only like 20 30 people actually do them
the rest is like dinner up to there
because that's not the audience that I
have so my advice is do the research
check out multiple platforms you know
with what you have you know you could
probably get a pretty good deal with
Pluralsight what they'll give you like
you know whoever signs up to Pluralsight
they'll give you like I think it's like
30 bucks so you probably get like $15
per every person that signs up and then
from there you get paid for per views so
Pluralsight will make sense or udemy
where you could sell the questions
direct to the people but just do your
research man find out your audience and
I mean look at the the comments right
now I look at the comments you know it's
like there's a lot of guys here who I
see like this guys they know they've
been around for a minute you know you
know what I mean like I come here look
who's in here
of course this Casey trolling like all
we think but I can see definitely every
time they look at your videos the
audience that you have is like mid-level
to senior level people who are who are
either from different programming
languages and they like to know about
more stuff about JavaScript or people
who are doing Python and they want to
just hear your opinions like those dusty
audience man you know this right here in
reality that's just a number that it
really doesn't mean anything anymore
especially cuz how how YouTube works
like you know like you should be able to
get notification like why do I have to
come here if I'm subscribed to you why
do I have to come here
and activate this notification like
everybody should get notified that you
know you drop the video because they
already subscribe to you you know what I
mean but now because of the way how
YouTube works like those days are over
you know but yeah man I'll see you guys
later
Chris Hawkes I know it's hard especially
coming home you ty you're working a full
time and then to come home and not be
able to you know make some little extra
income there it sucks I know it
definitely sucks especially after
putting in so much hours so many hours
into it but you know keep your head up
Kent you're gonna be fine
I'm gonna be doing good trust me you
just gotta find out who really your
audience is and yeah and also to start
putting this on your videos man
tell everybody to know to click on the
notifications man cuz listen with 80,000
people man like trust me you should be
you should be able to be good son
alright I'll see you guys later
make sure you subscribe make sure you
check out the mod videos man : face calm
your boys backing out and edit game by
the way man check the description below
man check the description below man
there's definitely gonna be a couple of
courses there from your boy I'm super
transparent I told you guys man I quit I
quit my job I'm doing this full-time
doing this for you guys and yeah man you
know luckily I'm good for the rest of
the year but it was gonna happen next
see what I mean so we gotta make
something happen out here
oh yeah man love you guys and yeah see
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
