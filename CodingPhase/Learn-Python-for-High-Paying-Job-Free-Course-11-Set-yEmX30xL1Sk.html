about sets okay so let's say for example
you have a list of cars alright we did
it with the list we did it with tuples
now let's do it with a set
okay so how do you declare a set so the
clear set you can come here and say set
and then parentheses all right
now when you run cars you run it it says
set okay
now how do you put in you know values
inside of the set very simple you come
here you're putting a brackets and you
could come and say something like this
like okay I have a Honda I have a BMW
okay you have a Benz you have a Lambo
okay so now when we run this see BMW
Honda Lambo Benz so that's the set okay
now why would you use a set okay a lot
of times is to remove duplicates so
let's say for example you have a couple
of Honda's right you say okay I have
Honda here and I'm gonna have a couple
of ones here a couple of BMWs there on
the side a couple of BMWs after Lambo
and then now when we run this what
happens you will see that automatically
and removed all the duplicates now
another thing that you're gonna notice
is that also inside of this set they're
pretty much how you call this like an
odor right you know we set this up like
this we had Honda Honda Honda Honda BMW
Benz BMW Lambo but as you can see every
time that we click on run there are in
different places see Honda's here now
Lambos there we run it again brands is
their BMWs their Lambo
there so as you can see it keeps
changing its unordered there's really
not our order it doesn't keep the order
that you have here it basically just
says okay
it's just randomize it okay alright guys
so this is sets I'll see you guys in the
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
