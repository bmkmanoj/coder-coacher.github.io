back at it again coding please calm your
boys back and how to knit it again
somehow late night you know how we do it
right yeah man let's talk about it right
because it's like people is already like
oh man like a blood boil some time guys
listen I already said this a while back
I already said hey I was gonna do a
Python course right I didn't know if I
was gonna do it for the website or not
and I say you know what I'm gonna do a
completely for free 100% for free is I'm
giving it out to the world
right the only keyword that's out there
that's not taken by everybody right it
is literally that that's gonna be the
title of the course all right
learn Python for high paying jobs that's
literally like the last keyword that's
out there that I can actually take and
say hey man I'm gonna create the series
that I'm gonna bust my ass to create
every single day and drop more videos
for you guys so I have to name it
something that nobody else has alright I
can't come and say free tutorial for
Python or a course or on Python it has
to be something that nobody has out
there unfortunately all right now let's
share the screen where is it
so you already know even when you drop
something free somebody is like man this
is free you know I don't I feel like
people still get upset but somehow we
still winning you get what I'm saying
but it's just funny thing you give
people who signed that you know it's
like that they want people being asking
me for this thing and somehow still
somebody's like y'all man I can't find
the common no more but Brandon King was
like yo I said didn't you see there's no
high paying jobs or well whatever this
is gonna be hard for people yes it is
gonna be hard right for people that want
to gain some Python
it's not a PHP and say hey I can just
get on top of this thing and you know
two three months getting a freaking job
a high paying job right but there's a
lot of college students there's a lot of
people who are getting into it you know
they're trying to get into programming
and that's the target audience for who
that course is for you know it's not
only just people who want to become web
developers I'm trying to branch out at
the same time you know make this channel
a more you know diverse like I already
said the main reason why I really want
people to learn Python is so we could
actually get to do Golduck which is a
game engine so you know for the people
that's not gonna like it you know what I
mean hey I'm sorry you know what I mean
I'm sorry it's like that's the goal of
the the channel
we can't stay forever doing the same
topics right I'm still gonna be talking
about web development because that's my
bread and butter that's what I do all
right
that's the the main thing that I do but
at the same time we have to also branch
out and give other people you know the
chance to have what they want you know
what I mean like people bring asking for
Python since like last February we are
in February 2018 people been asking for
this since 2017 right so it's like I
have to give people also what they want
man I can't just keep just saying hey
man this is the things that I like right
you guys know exactly what I like and
where my focus is as I hate learn PHP if
he's gonna get a job right away if you
want to become a web developer but now
we also have to give people the
opportunity the people that's doing all
you know classes in school also to
people who say hey man it's okay I know
it's gonna be a long run for me to
become machine learning you know data
scientist is gonna be a long journey
cool right let's give them the basics of
Python let's give them you know all the
things that they need to you know
continue on the road you know what I
mean so that's all I'm doing
people can't get upset of you know I
already told you guys I feel about
Python for what the fella
right now for applications and data
science like hey it's a great language
right
we can't hate on it right and I think I
said in the video hey it's one of my
favorite languages after Ruby you know
what I say so I was like man you know we
just trying to diversify the whole
you know I mean but it's just funny to
me man like you give something free and
their stills like hey like Jesus Christ
is free like Jesus is crazy like we
giving this out for people man like come
on man you know I have to play the
YouTube game man you know I mean like
we're growing but not the way how we
supposed to and you know like I don't
even curse no more I'm doing all that
stuff I mean I'm not wandering eye well
out but not that much
and it's for a reason is because
literally I don't play the YouTube games
I don't do that you know
click bathing I don't do the same things
over and over there's people that do is
like top programming languages in 2018
some programming language 2017 time
programming language 2016 I don't play
those games so it's like at the same
time we've been kind of stuck as I came
that's the games that you to want to
play with us so then now we're gonna
have to take it to the next level and
also playing the same level for you you
know what I mean like so yeah but yeah
man all the things that I do all year is
pretty much the slate is it's planned
out man
I already did everything that I wanted
to do for a whole year you gotta have
seen me why allow you see me out here
dying doing all this crazy you know just
being right you know what I mean I'm
still gonna be rod rod but at the same
time it's like man YouTube is not
playing fair we're not getting no
notifications we're not getting you know
subscribers come in for not that at the
level that they should be you know
because this channel is it's an amazing
channel well I'm doing here no
but every time people hit me I was like
yo I came to find you right you're not
showing up in the top search results
you're not showing up anywhere so it's
like okay cool so now we're gonna give
them what YouTube wants you know at the
same time I'm still gonna drop in my
classic content you know late night you
know self-taught guy no you know like
you know what we do out here you know
late nights twelve total ATM is about to
pop up you know how we do out here
you gotta say so but we gotta play the
game man unfortunately you know
everybody plays this this clickbait
games I've been trying to fight it for
so long I've been trying to fight you
know playing the SCO games I've been
trying to fight you know freakin trying
to get people to retweet my my youtube
channel all this stuff
I've done this whole thing solo I've
been like fighting against the frequent
Remer it's like a rivers coming down to
Maui now I'm like this hoping that I'm
like nah man we're not gonna do that
okay YouTube warning we gotta give you
two what what they want you know what I
mean I can't do that body
so yeah man where people is like you
know type programming languages of
February time programming languages of
March it's just how it is man oh let me
see I've been doing a lot of PHP show I
go - no - yes listen you got a look in
your area right if there's way more jobs
for PHP listen stick with PHP finish
that you already started with it just
finishing is it's freaking star applying
for jobs right start getting paid
YouTube is owned by Titan opus they can
I pull brothers word yeah that's just
how it is man but it's gonna be cool man
like the the whole course that I'm doing
online for Python it's come it's gonna
be completely different man it's not
gonna be that corny stuff that people
come in who's like how can we put you
know how can we put in
you know a paragraph and come how many
letters of the letter y is inside of
that paragraph I'm not doing none of
that corny stuff man I'm coming in and
just breaking stuff down just how people
been seeing me break it down with every
other language out there JavaScript CSS
PHP Robi now the only difference is just
like for me python is a throw away you
know what I'm saying like python is just
like okay here guys you want Python here
you go
there's a throw aways now it's not like
my main focus it's gonna be like
something that I'm gonna release every
single day one video explaining
something new and then door some cool
projects to teach people you know in a
way where they could be entertained and
at the same time like want to actually
watch the videos you know so that's what
we're doing yeah man the clip clip be
calm man we have to man that's and if
that even really click be is more SEO
man because no matter what every single
freaking thing that's out there is
already taking you can't it's like if I
create I've been wanted to do a Python
course right but I don't want to do it
and like I want to just give it out
right but what happens it's gonna happen
the same thing that happen with all my
other courses that I put on on YouTube
nobody sees it nobody finds it all right
because all those titles are already
taking learn HTML for beginners learn
HTML CSS for beginners learn HTML for
web developers like that's already
taking man you know what I mean so
there's like now we're just gonna say
hey we're gonna find a keyword that
nobody's using all right and from there
watch people start copying what we do
you know what I'm saying like you know
get a couple of people get a couple of
the Python Python guys tightly oh man he
eaten my hearing my kicked out here you
know what I mean like people don't get
listen if subscribers get tight soon as
I drop saying and making out how to you
know the other dudes who
who are tight he eating my cake out here
word man yeah Joe just finished the
portfolio course and I was wondering why
we don't focus on developing more
developing for mobile design first and
then doing a desktop version basically
that's my style of toy days you know
when people come in and say hey we gotta
do things for you know like mobile first
that's somebody else's style right so
usually when people used to do that a
lot they will come in and focus on
bootstrap right Oh everything's gotta be
bold first and we're gonna say okay this
elements here and we're gonna focus on
mobile first now that's not what I do
alright that's not my flow I do it
differently right the way how I work
if I'm focusing if the website if
somebody tells me hey the website is
mainly going to be used for mobile users
right then I'm going to focus on mobile
on the mobile side first right but if if
it's a portfolio portfolio that other
developers and other mechanism other
recruiters is gonna see first 90% of
those people are not gonna be like on
their phone like oh somebody sent me an
email
i'ma look at it on my phone they're not
focusing on the phone and they're
looking like that they are work right so
they looking at down on the desktop so
you gotta know your audience right so
that's why I'm doing a desktop first
that's it what's better for jobs $5 Ruby
like I said I would definitely choose
Ruby first no matter what because if
you're trying to become a web developer
right this is a big difference and I
think I'm gonna make it more clear and
more most of my videos I'm gonna add
either for what developers for software
engineers or for game developers like
I'm gonna put that on the titles to make
sure people understand who is it that
I'm targeting right who is it that I'm
talking about because sometimes people
come in and they think like hey he's
talking about this and then contradicts
with this other video but your
understanding is that I'm doing these
videos but they're not for one target
right one target audience it's just for
people who search this right as you are
subscriber right you are subscribed to
my channel and you might come in here
instead oh cool this I'm finding all
this cool videos of what development but
now every front every single video that
I'm gonna release is gonna be just about
what development right like I'm trying
to do other other quote unquote
genres or subsections of coding right so
it's not just gotta be what differently
like you guys know I've been doing this
or what the world over for five years
professionally right but now I want to
also add other fields to it so that's
what we do it let me see
I said keep coding and by the time you
turn to now you'll be making it $28 yeah
13 should I stop calling and live life
as a teenager or should I keep doing
Conan listen continue coding man like I
wish somebody would have told me back
then like yo just keep coding kick I
stopped I started at 14 I literally
stopped probably like a 15 I was like
nobody was like encouraging me and I
what it was telling me anything so I say
you know what I'll move it off for this
all right and I was still like music and
traveling all over the US and doing a
whole bunch of stuff so they're from
they are came back and ya know the story
if you don't know the story look it up
in one of my other videos I've said my
story like a million times but yeah I
just wanted to come in before I go to
sleep just because just from seeing the
first two comments on the video and it's
like I need to stop doing that I need to
stop looking at the
it's alright cuz it's like I want to see
the feedback of the people but 90% of
the time when somebody drops our
feedback real quick it's usually just
like it's throwaway right they could
it's just like their first shock of a
video right okay
oh cool I see this title god dammit joel
is going to the Python team and it's
like no no I'm not I'm just creating
content for everybody else as you can
see somebody else
left a comment right there ourself
Wilson right he's like yay Python right
so it's like a lot of people been asking
for this you know what I mean it's not
just one person that I'm doing like you
know I can't I can't do all my videos
for five of you guys hey I got a do it
for everybody that's here there's a lot
of people here that's coming from all OH
a different way of living and in
different situations right so I have to
create more content for everybody else
and not just one set of the group right
unfortunately right if we want to grow
if we don't want to grow them we'll stay
down here on the you know the ten
thousand subscribers and you know the
same you know 30 people that come online
and I love you guys but at the same time
but it's like hey man I want to be able
to say hey by the end of this year I
want to get as many subscribers as I can
by creating cool content that they could
you know they could relate to right
there's a lot of kids that I see all the
times I'm like oh man I can't relate to
this person Joe can you do a c-sharp
course man I'd rather see you and I
rather hear you break it down for me
right I haven't even done C sharp or
even done Python or any of the things
that people keep asking me about right
so now we gotta create it and the things
that I field are throw away like you
know Python learn Python the syntax
learn Python you know doing algorithms
with Python like all that stuff to me is
easy like I've learned that like three
years ago you know I mean
so it's like it's pretty when I was to
me is old it's like okay if people want
this cool that's just make it alright
but like I said man we just knocking out
stuff out and creating cool content for
everybody no blows keep this up bro seem
like that's a good thing is like
sometimes you get some comments was like
oh man people is already saying
something dumb or like did I appreciate
the work that we're doing but then right
after that just like for comments was
like oh man thank you for dropping this
oh I love this I was like it makes you
feel good you know I love it
why are people something was going on in
both yeah no I think you can learn
whatever you want man like I said for
what development I wouldn't recommend
Python that's straight up that's just
being honest I wouldn't recommend it
because the jobs are not there right now
if you want to come in and start
building your own applications you want
to come in and you want to create all
your own games and and a couple other
things then Python is great it's a great
language for you for what the fella mean
I'm not gonna be the guy that's gonna
tell you hey guys leave PHP go jokes for
the Python way from now man like you're
not gonna find the jobs there you know I
mean like that's just being real with
you
so have you learned from one language or
learn the programming language do Boston
no not really I remember the new Boston
but it's like that was that's old it's
like I like when I watch YouTube man I
like people that I could relate to and
people that I see like me seen just text
air and like oh there's this text like
you know I was this guy's name
Derek Manus or banana whatever his name
is like I can't I can't really watch his
videos because there's no person behind
it that's how I feel like I don't know
who this person is
it's like I like when I'm come to
YouTube is I want to see
something that I can learn and at the
same time something that has me
entertained
right YouTube is for both right when
you're like something special I feel
that's what I love with my channel I
love everything that I'm doing because I
feel like I've done something special
that no other people I have done right
which is bringing the entertainment side
bringing in what people call even the
drama faces just like me being honest
with people just me being real with
myself and and being real with other
people you know what I mean but it also
brings people in like hey this is
something different we haven't seen this
in in this genre of what development or
programming or you know I mean almost
finish it react cress this one that's of
course all the great portfolio piece is
one employee like to see real deaf apps
not in 1990 looking sites which are
boring with no texture any yes sir yeah
man like that's what I'm saying like I
mean and I'm still not done with that
one down it's like the one that I'm
working on from 9 to 5 so that's the
thing where I was like man people don't
even know all the things that I do
tonight all day so for 9 to 5 I'm
knocking out all the courses from my
website and then on the late lengths I'm
going to be doing the Python courses so
I say it's a lot of work but it's
working you know well everything that
I'm doing I know it's gonna pay off like
five years from now right you nothing
that I'm doing right now
makes sense right when I divide the
amount of hours that I put in in a day
to all the work that I do and then how
much I'm actually making out of YouTube
and even my website it's like man I
literally could be working at a company
and make way more money than that but
this is like putting in like a little
seed five years from now then you'll see
the the fruits from me hey I'm saying
are you saying there's no job in what
development no I'm not saying there's no
job in web development what I'm saying
there's no jobs for Python that's like
Python and web development right if you
want to
hey compared to like you know
applications developer compared to you
know even data scientists compared to
that right in Python right in the world
of Python and then you compare it to web
development jobs there's no jobs for
Python what developers like there's
really not you look it up you go online
to your research going be calm
search Python developers or search
Python on the title and then from there
look through every single job position
that's in there there's a few but
compared to PHP no changes compared to
dotnet compared to free game Ruby on
Rails like Python Python Java is very
scarce like when it comes to web
development JC's rockin till tomorrow
going to have to work to library
University and Las Vegas to get focus on
the courses from the website definitely
in my home I cannot advance nothing yeah
sometimes you got to step out man
sometimes you gotta go outside man
especially if you got kids around
running around or you got your wife
eating your wife is like hey man then
you episode Netflix just came on come
date down for a little bit you know what
I mean I think they hit you with that
you ain't getting all work done a sign
you know I'm it's a yeah web app
therefore other languages are going to
be more popular pythons for back-end or
apps data science or specialty
physicians there are way more web jobs
like joe says yeah joe do you know
javascript framework when you got your
first job yes when i got my first job I
knew backbone and then from there soon
as I thought that I mastered backbone
that's when they like Oh everybody got a
jumper and
man and then for the past five years
it's been the same thing every time that
you feel like you master something it's
like oh wait no not this time
everything I do learn last time the last
four or five times
you got to relearn it again because
somebody made it two milliseconds faster
so it's like now burns Kojo I got
homeless that get turned off by your
style they don't like the they don't
like the swag that's fine man this is
not for everybody man this is not for
you know some people they loved you know
the stiffness you know I was like hi
guys this is a function this is where
you put the parameters this is where you
like nah man like this is YouTube right
this is YouTube this is oh you know
online I feel like at the same time it's
like if you want that stiffness go take
a computer science degree go get a
computer science degree like you you're
self-taught developer you are here
trying to learn on your own let's be
honest a lot of this stuff is boring
let's just won't be 100% honest with it
right a lot of the stuff is boring it
can be very boring when you're hearing
somebody who was like like man I ain't
trying to hear that man like straight up
like your father's like if it was me
back in 2012 and I was hearing myself
and I was like okay I could mess with
this dude at the same time that I'm
learning I'm also entertain and at the
same time I feel like I'm hanging out
with one of my friends right
so there's people out there that's just
like me that talk just like me that
enjoy having somebody like me around
them so those are the people that we
targeting right the people that want to
have you know their buddy
little Shawn who plays you yield cards
into the lunchroom
you can keep those guys right you know
what I mean like that's not me and you
know it was like freaking people get mad
or whatever is like that's just not
man you know what I mean like
unfortunately but yeah man the word what
up J guitar thanks bro Abbi time job I'm
gonna grind oh he sees me to stay up for
him yes sir for those of you guys that
don't know J guitar this one of the
members from coding face.com
he's one of the the peoples from the
team he's one of the writers that
basically wrote probably all of the
descriptions from the websites courses
he also helped him out with a lot of
different things he's gonna help me out
with the you know the janya scholarship
that I'm planning on doing and probably
by the end of the month so he's gonna be
one of the guys that's gonna be vetting
people to see if they are really from
you know what country they're really
firm or you know if they are a certain
age you know what I mean so he's
definitely helping me out and I really
appreciate his work so yeah man so say
what up to J guitar man definitely one
of the members of coding phase calm and
I want to thank to everybody who also
has contributed to the website so let me
see if we go to github.com coding phase
comm I want to share this with you guys
there's a couple of contributors that
help out let me see there's seven
contributors okay so let me see
no the six cuz one two three four five
four five people this Kendra the slave
Dylan this Martez Connor there's girl

got a lot of people man we got a lot of
people that show up and help out you got
your boy
take a part of course so yeah you know
what I'm saying
tells Connor word let me see should I
learn jQuery yes of course you got to
learn jQuery if you want to get into web
development that jQuery is like it's
like learning how to I don't know how
how can I say if you want to be a chef
right like learning jQuery is like
making rice you know I mean it's like
you have to you have to know at least
how to make rice you know I mean if you
don't know how to make rice like you
can't call yourself a chef you know what
I mean so yeah chat woman's like hip
hoppers I want to learn to code it's not
really more like hip hoppers is more
like earning people man there's a lot of
urban people out there you know and it's
not just like blacks Latinos there's
people just urban cities man you know I
mean like this guy start from the

like yo I'm a carpenter I don't want to
pound nails anymore you know what I mean
like I'm I feel like that's the audience
that's my audience that's the people
that really mess with me the people that
they know like what we came from cuz
they've been there even though we I've
never been a carpenter I've never done
like nothing crazy but I've done like
real manual work I've done freakin
working in a factory worked in in a
kosher food where I always say Hasidic
Jews were pretty much locking to the
freezer on us and is like hey get back
to work kids and it's like what can you
do you you need the job you know what I
mean you gotta feed your family you
gotta eat right I worked in a parking
lot
I freaking are used to working Armani
Exchange and got fired and then after I
got fired
I ended up working in the same mall in
the parking lot you know how
embarrassing that is
that's like going from being inside
inside dude and then ended up in the
fields you gotta say it's like you was
out there with master you know I was out
there master master you know you want
some lemonade master and then he's like
that's a boy get back to the fields
that's how they had you you know what I
mean so it's like I've gone from the top
to the bottom to like being on a train
asking for $2 to get back home like I've
done everything you gonna say like most
of these people they're you know it's
like most of the people they can't
relate to people who they're not from
that world who hasn't had any struggles
they haven't gone through anything
you know what I mean like you know so
it's like I'm completely different man
that's why I'm gonna come here I just I
don't fake anything man I come in and
just like you know just say what I gotta
say share my knowledge for the people
that care about it and they get
something out of it
they appreciate it they move on they get
their job you know some hotter people
there's people who have seen they got
they came in they listened to everything
that I did they listened to everything
that I told them and then they get the
job we never see them again
right we've had people come in to this
channel show us love a year later
literally yap yap-yap yap-yap
took right behind our backs on our
own platforms right so it's like that's
just how it is man you know so it's like
what can we do you know just keep it
moving
and I say just do what we gotta do out
here good point gentlemen back at it
again coding face.com when I say doc ya
say yo listen I was like watching
I did my to or something like that
I was like yo let's do this corny like
creating super horrible content that
doesn't do anything for nobody
or even like those those guys with the
pole brothers whatever those guys their
content so garbage has like you know
what I mean like those people don't help
nobody out you know I mean like I've
been helping out since the beginning and
it's like not even to keep I bring
up because it's like go
not even this big youtubers guys who are
like literally two three times bigger
than me and naming that like 10 times
bigger than my channel now we give back
never help out nobody and people make
money out here you don't sound like they
make money I don't make change this is
like I'm like contributing to to the
world for a blessing you go don't sing I
think I'm not how you're making no money
I'm out here for for a blessing you know
what I mean like that should be a
t-shirt I'm doing this for a blessing
thank you I'm doing this for a blessing
side you get the same it's like like I
drop up you know like when I come in if
I look you're gonna see I'm gonna show
you guys this thing we're gonna create
this whole a long series of YouTube
videos for Python let's see if YouTube
even decides to show us some love or
show it to new peoples right we're gonna
create this on a blessing this is not me
gonna gain anything out of it I'm most
likely out I'll probably lose
subscribers like you know you know when
you try to do something good for people
and things still backfire we are here
just doing things for a blessing we're
like straight up
oh boy ma so I hope you guys have
appreciate it it's gonna be cool man
there's nothing cool we're gonna do a
couple of little projects this is for
the people that are interested in Python
if you're not interested you don't have
to get into it cuz I'm not doing what
development with Python so if you're not
into that um creating applications or
creating games you could literally look
the other way because I'm not planning
on doing what development with Python
I'm planning on doing like stuff that
other people haven't done yet you know
it's like we could do Django but why
would we do Django when we have Ruby on
Rails you go on saying like why would I
do Django when we have flair well you
know like we already have enough good
content on that
Oh
type of project so this will distinct oh
I mean this gold app right
so gold is an application is basically
it's an application that you could
create game switch so technically it's a
game engine right so let me share the
screen with you guys so to use this you
actually have to know some type of
Python right or have some type of
knowledge so this is something that I
want to focus on okay so if we click
here and let's say this game real quick
okay so this is the game engine and
pretty much you can set up and build
your your whole game for like Android
development or iOS and it compiles it
for you
okay now I'm gonna show you guys the
game real quick
and I'm gonna show you guys like how the
scripts look like now there's like a
super simple game like there's like the
stuff that comes with like the the demo
but you know me I'm I'm gonna show you
guys the real thing like I'm not I'm not
building this type of a little BS game
I'm gonna build something legit now like
I say I mean there's a whole bunch of
stuff that you can do with this and
technically it's if you look at the
script
I'm sure to use code GD script but it's
pretty much Python right so by me
creating this free course on Python it's
like basically teaching you guys Gd
script at the same time so if you come
here on the difference is a couple of
little differences so if you want to
create a variable with Python you don't
have to save are but with G this script
you do but as you can see there's no
semicolons functions that's how they are
they see the IFS it's very similar to
Python it's like you see the X in the
range like all the stuff is there right
so that's the main reason why I really
want people to try out Python it and and
learn it cuz this is what I really want
to start building next right like I've
done I'm gonna knock out this is how I'm
doing it I'm being 100% my 9 to 5
it's gonna be creating courses for you
guys and what I call you know front-end
and back-end development right but my
gift to myself is I'm gonna create game
development courses all right at the
same time which I'm gonna add to the
website so for the people who are
interested on it with your membership
automatically you get it for free so
it's up to you if you want to practice
you know building applications I'm also
doing iOS development like I'm doing a
lot of stuff I'm doing I'm adding a lot
of extra stuff because I want to give
people more value right not only are you
getting everything that's gonna get you
a job to become a web developer right
away but also it's gonna continue your
growth you know so it's like learning
something you know like right now the
main goal for you guys should be hey I
want to get a job as soon as possible
right the best way for you guys to get a
job like this that quick is in web
development so that's where you need to
put you all of your focus but if you
love to code and you love to program
what development at some point is gonna
be very repetitive for you guys and
that's when you say hey I still want to
challenge myself and build applications
I still want to challenge myself and
build games I still want to challenge
myself and build iOS and Android
applications so all of those things are
going to be on the website alright and
at the same time I want to create those
courses because like I said I'm doing
the hair colors like the scholarship for
the kids that want to be from you know
from the age of 1 to 17 right those kids
that want to learn how to code I want
them to have all the type of courses
that they they can have you know
available for them if they want to do
Python go ahead to Python through you
want to learn iOS Goldner are us you
want to learn what
learn when to them you know so it's like
I'm doing everything for the people that
come to the website and just so you guys
can have more value you know because
it's like I said you go to people's
websites and they they try to charge you
$200 for RBS you know one course or you
go to people's websites $500 for one BS
course and it's like bro like I could
get like for 10 bucks 20 bucks at coding
face.com
everything that I need you know what I'm
saying so that's the plan that's not
that's the goal you know cause like I
said you a lot of you guys is gonna come
in and you guys is gonna learn web
development on the website in like two
three months all right but what's gonna
keep you there you know what is it
that's gonna keep you from actually
canceling your account and moving on is
to actually continue getting your course
and can continue get a new continent
continue getting your stuff that that
you could say hey I'm getting my money's
worth
it's ten dollars it's 20 dollars $9,000
whatever you pay right everybody pays
differently depending how they signed up
if they bought on a special right so
pretty much is like hey you're getting
the most that you can for your your your
money you know what I'm saying so that's
the whole idea behind it and then at the
same time everything that I make from
here I use that to fund other things
that I'm passionate about right so yeah
man yes sir you can definitely create
new applications with iOS yep if you if
you know react native right if you know
react already like you already got all
the tools a lot of basic things that you
need to become a react native developer
like
literally look at the documentation and
start creating your very first
application you know so it's not that
hard at all so yeah it's like once I
finish this Craigslist course I'm also
gonna drop the react native like I'm
doing a lot of stuff but it's just I
know a lot of you guys is like oh man
he's doing this he's doing the
Craigslist course he's doing the moving
a realist he's doing all this stuff like
yeah but you don't understand is like
what you like it's not what the other
person likes right I got people that say
hey I wanted a room in a rails and they
come in just sign up just for Ruby on
Rails there's people are signing up just
for JavaScript peoples are just signing
up for HTML CSS people are signing up
before you know once I have the game
development courses so it's like there's
gonna be a whole bunch of people like a
large range of of different developers
on the website and that's really what I
want to do you know so it's like if you
want to support it you to support it if
you don't want to support it then it is
what it is but yeah man
yes
who's the same
but yeah man so let me see hold on I'm
trying to see something I wanted to show
you guys a little something
obviously who else is online right now
is there anybody let me see how long
so let me see super chat super chat
person what type of projects I'm gonna
have just like cool projects stuff that
you know it's different that's different
for people
how do I want this job in two hours
probably I will change your life try
Java Android studio the play notes play
around Raspberry Pi hello I'm sorry but
I'm not using a Raspberry Pi like I'm
not making I don't know I feel like that
doesn't make you any money I don't like
I want to do stuff that you can actually
actually come in and and you know make
money with you know that's like those
things are cool but I mean to me what's
cool is me looking at a bag you know I
was like I all I got a bag of cash for
the work that I did not to say hey man
you got kudos points you you know you
you added a operating system tool to
Raspberry Pi on my nerve that doesn't
really do anything for me Alex Kiko said
I don't go that was G script or some
custom language yes G script but G
script is like super similar to Python
so that's why I'm actually using it
try trow ephemeral trail try mail I
don't even know how to say his name
he was like yeah don't be afraid to
experiment
the only time you learn anything new is
when you make a mistake yes sir that you
ever play so calm yes sir
back in the days man US Navy SEALs SOCOM
US Navy SEALs you remember when you had
to connect the modem to the PlayStation
2 back in the days Jesus Christ us it
sounds like a lifetime ago right if I
want to learn JavaScript for web
development be to learn JavaScript game
development for what - I'm sorry if it
sounds confusing I mean it can be very
effective like if you really really
wanted to learn JavaScript learning
through game development like phaser GS
you will really understand how
JavaScript works right but
if you want to get a job is like you -
what just learned the regular way of
just like learning JavaScript learning
jQuery learning react cuz that's gonna
get you jobs right away learning faces
Jes it's like it's like a side project
you know what I mean that's like if you
love to code that's a side project let
me see let me see why don't you build a
game using html5 and CSS and JavaScript
faces yes I was gonna do that but it's
not the same like when you're using a
game engine like go doc or like unity 3d
the games are so much better to be
honest with you I've done both I've done
the regular html5 games and it's just it
can't compete with a game engine like
there's so much better
how much the earn a lot how much I earn
on what you gotta be a specific unlike a
lot of people I'm not scared to share
how much I heard I just you need to ask
me exactly what is it so they agree with
joep tips to start and then we move on
to machine learning data science yeah
like once you're in you're in and you
could jump into other fields you know
but that's a beginner like you need to
start making money man to be honest with
you you can't be out here just learning
to code just to learn to code like you
don't want to be one of those guys
that's like super smart but they're in
the basement of their mother's house
like you want to be one of the guys
they're like oh cool I'm smart and I'm
learning to code and I'm doing all this
stuff what I'm getting paid you know
don't think your twitch account is
working yeah it's not connected I need
to actually take it down what about
learn Swift for iOS games sup chat if
you would what if you were to do a
cross-platform app why would when you're
doing C C sharp C sharp is good I'm
trying to catch up to Jay guitar
sometimes was there sometimes he wanted
code what ones and zeros I guess I'm
currently in university studying iti
started next week from my first semester
so learning HTML CSS I broke the bank a
$60 what six a dozen when I learned for
HTML CSS for free from Joe yeah man yeah
you come to the website you get it for
free man you learn like the the basics
on the site you know now I can't mess
with Nipsey Hussle man I can't mess with
that daughter I used to I thought he was
gonna be like the next big thing in the
West Coast when he first came out but
now I'm just like
I rather listen to yg Missy yeah I'm
getting a bachelor's Jill did you
already do of course I'm get like
scenarios where you have to do merges
and work with others recovery etc and no
I have it I have a really focus on get
that much and that's because like
literally there's like a million
tutorials on YouTube I mean at some
point I'm gonna add it to the website
but it's like okay it's like all over
YouTube so it doesn't really make sense
for me to create one well most people
already learned it on their own Ali
Hussein says lots of love from Nepal
what up that's my peoples I got a lot of
people's in the poor man I got a lot of
people Bangladesh and a lot of people
and me and Mar I got a lot of people in
Thailand I got a lot of people in the
Middle East shout out to my people from
you know Syria Israel shouting my people
from Egypt
you know from Africa we got people in
freaking South Africa like crazy like
every time I look at my Google Analytics
South Africa is always like lit up like
there's so many like little dots that I
see that people are going in there like
let me see how many people are on the
website right now look at that there's
my people on the website right now just
right now as we we speak as we speak
right now there's like people all over
that's crazy
you know when I think about it think
about it like I'm like that man that's
crazy I got people all over the globe on
the website right now I mean the most
majority is from the US but we have
people from Brazil Canada you know we
usually get a lot of people from Asia
South Africa so it's like
you know I don't know whatever I'm doing
I guess I'm doing something good I'm
helping people out you know so that's
not that's the whole idea behind this so
let me see what claim were you the
network adapter I don't remember
remember what clan I was in in so car
let me see Joe you're an inspiration
thank you bro
you guys are my real inspiration man
rule number one no B's we're doing this
for the blue cheese way the money way
that way get on a bus or get out the way
word let me see I recommend for anyone
looking to get a job get on LinkedIn
there's so many people looking for what
developers is crazy yes sir
there's a whole bunch of people there
there's a lot of recruiters all over the
world man it's not funny man
let me see chill out Jay guitar you got
a bright future but you don't need a
masters you'll be a great bachelors and
greater bachelors just mice of sense I'm
just reading people's comments between
each other and stuff Late Night Live
yes sir JC Rodri how can identify scam
jobs or versus real jobs I don't know I
mean scam jobs will be like if people
are trying to get out oh can you build
us this as a test like sometimes
sometimes they want you to work for free
like I've seen that done to some people
that I oh is this normal for for me to
log into their gear and like change
things on their website my bro no they
want what they want you to basically do
work for free like man I mean just you
see if it looks like Jay if it looks
like a real company you know well Joe I
have a question that you ever get a job
through India recruiter not trying to be
racial just most like every talk every
time I talk to
who never pans out so now a black eye
just blocked them I think I think they
very good but I mean usually they like
you know they're there in India right a
lot of times so they they were come from
over there and sometimes they just like
reading whatever is on the screen I've
never been hired by any recruiters like
that work from from India laughs nahdar
I got got the coals and we talked for a
while but that never works out for me
for whatever reason you can tell when
the series to want a video core or Skype
yep so do you do penetration testing or
is that like it's all totally in another
level no I don't do it how can I make a
great LinkedIn just build your build
your portfolio putting your your
basically your resume the things that
you have done joining some groups and
that's pretty much it man hey guys
listen I'm about to head out of here
I've been here for a while
I wasn't gonna do a live video but I
wanted to just address it before people
be like oh god Joe's doing Python listen
guys you're gonna like it
why not I mean we're gonna create a
whole bunch of Python I'm doing the
whole series so everything that you need
to learn Python and a couple of extra
projects for free on YouTube and if you
like it you like it if you don't like it
you don't like it and at the same time
I'm dropping my portfolios and I'm you
know portfolio reviews and by the way
and this is for the youtubers and for my
subscribers guys please call people up
man please call people out do this for
me call people out when they start doing
things that you've seen here first right
call them out because the for me it
pisses me off when I go on YouTube and I
said oh portfolio what developer
folio and then you start seeing people
doing the same thing that I'm doing that
now people are reviewing portfolios like
that's annoying like don't copy what I'm
doing same thing with the udemy courses
I was the first one reviewing udemy
courses here like as far as like what
development and programming now people
want to be doing reviews and it's like
yeah sure like now you want to do
everything that I do like that's really
annoying you know I mean we're between
the internet connection with solid yes
we got that a good internet now I mean
he's not even got into that it's it's so
sad that I'm paying a hundred and fifty
dollars for a hundred up no a hundred
down and ten up from Xfinity like those
people are freaking thieves like they're
stealing so much money out here it's not
even funny
I don't even have HD cable like this is
ridiculous like I have two regular cable
it comes with a regular cable like $150
for a regular cable no HD no nothing no
I don't even have phony VCRs
I don't even have like I even have Nick
jr. like it's bad like it's really
really bad like those people like I
don't even know man like it's really bad
man when I was living in Long Island I
was paying $50 for 50 up and 50 down and
if I wanted to get a hundred up in a
hundred down it was gonna cost me $65
like check the big difference $150 for a
hundred up in ten and no 10 up in a
hundred down right in 450 compare it to
$50 up $50 for 50 up and 50 down my dad
some big difference yeah up speed is
horrible I mean I don't know it's just
crazy yeah feels like yeah this is
called getting read oh man
yes sir I wouldn't be surprised there's
another Craigslist course out there so
let's not make it everything that I do
for whatever reason right for whatever
reason people start doing it and I'm
just like a small Channel still like I
haven't grown like that's why I get mad
and pissed off by other people and they
start copying me because it's like you
have to let me grow so then when people
you know when you copy me people who say
hey oh you copy from Joe or you copy
from Cody face whatever right but since
I'm still small and this people are
either on the same level as me or bigger
than me then when I come up with content
people tell me like oh are you doing the
same thing that so-and-so is doing it as
I know bro I was still originator of
this thing like people are just copying
what I'm doing you know
so whatever what if I pick my nose
people are gonna pick what they know do
you know anything about what development
in Philly I don't know but anyways guys
I'm out of here
I'm tired been here for a while I've
been here since 10 o'clock in the
morning till now in front of this
computer knocking out a whole bunch of
courses like you know a whole bunch of
content for you guys please enjoy it
