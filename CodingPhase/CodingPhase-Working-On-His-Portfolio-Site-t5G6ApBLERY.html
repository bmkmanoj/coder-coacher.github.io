released that video about you like the
computer guy I have nothing against to
do it is just how I felt when I found
out I was like okay you know wow we
supposed to cry a cry for you know II
like the computer guy who's been cake
Guinea making money for years on old
videos and pretty much not creating good
content for who knows like three to four
years already we're not supposed to cry
for that right well yeah so as the video
I just came out with and now y'all get
to see and chill with me basically here
live
all right so that's what I'm doing right
now working on my jsg website so this is
gonna be like my portfolio site of
course it's not gonna be a beer that's
not gonna be too professional right so
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna change
this to a different color like a solid
color and then I'm gonna put the react
react logo right there so you know cuz
I'm drinking that react kool-aid right
now so and I've been doing that for
years alright so let's do this let's fix
this up let's work on this man I'm
telling you guys man one of the best
things about me having a you know design
degree is that I pretty much know orders
this programs you know what I mean now
let me see
doesn't have to be perfect because what
I want is I want to make this like a
react beer you know it's gonna be if
you're a developer you're gonna get the
joke you know what I mean I hate
that you know when you double-click you
lose everything man and how's everybody
man how you guys doing man what you guys
working on today man
as you can see I'm working my portfolio
it's gonna be pretty legit a lot of good
animations you know the last time I
worked my portfolio was about mm I don't
know three four years ago that's like
the last time I I worked on on a
portfolio page so it's long overdue
all right so we got that there now let's
make this like let's say what color
should it be okay
okay I don't like the color so what we
gonna do we're gonna continue playing
with this let me see something
let me take this color
let's see what's complementary to that
one color adobe.com
right now let me see take this color
change it to that one now let's see
complementary to that maybe we just go
with a different shade all right okay
let's come back here change this to that
you know let's play around with it
okay let's make this just a little bit
bigger let me see what you guys are
talking about in the Hangout 22 people
were watching this okay so let's see
who's online mute that out
Missy who's in here we got Flor de Otto
we got David yang Robert Jones Camp
Perry tell him
Adrian Layton let me see Jonah was Noah
Bustos right well Rossi Robert Jones my
boy kicked grain is boy I see you man
working out this kid he's getting she
kids killing it right now I'm trying to
get back on my too man I'm really
right like right now I just I'm cooking
some vegan pizza like I'm trying to eat
healthy like I'm killing it too right
now
when does the anybody got the link for
the fight let me know anybody got the
link for the fight I'm trying to watch
it why I'm trying to pay $100 right now
Missy was about a sketch of Photoshop
sketches go for making web designs
Photoshop is go whenever you got to
manipulate any type of like you know any
type of image or more like let's say any
project you working on those girls good
was good anybody got the link to the
McGregor fight let me know try to find
out for me man if you guys can find out
and that link for me man
I appreciate it I'll throw a free course
we trading links for a Koi ring times is
hard right now alright so let me see ok
cool let's keep that there let's say for
this bottle okay alright
okay let me see me dislike all right
let's get the react level
all right now we just gotta fix the
colors play around the colors man maybe
just leave it like I don't know looks
fine but instead of doing it like that
how about we do it the opposite way oh
no oh no it's not looking right you've
got to play around with it man
so we got to get this thing and pretty
much we gotta put this to be in the same
perspective as this olive oil
alright now let's take this oops
into this alright now what else we want
to go to this I want to change that
color that yellow because it's ugly
right now let me see something
mess around with the baby and wifey let
me see
think I should do it the other way
around I mean if I paste this back again
like I said anybody got the McGregor
fight the link let me know I'm trying to
watch that tonight let me see if I could
flip this thing so instead we both
watching that way all right I saw the
Missy see if I could do a little
something a little a little magic trick
let's see if we can take this color see
now that works a little bit better and
let's see what we do with this
now looks like hey under this brush
tools wait we have to move this a little
bit
that's a lot for Brian your
perfectionist okay now all we need to do
is erase so from here up delete now
obliques do this we gotta make this this
logo right here
appear like is part of that
okay the missing
I hate them in with my perspective on
it's time to get this little icon to be
in the right the right perspective
be right back
