joke back at it again members and
tonight we gonna talk about you know
jumping around for framework to
framework right like we all do them and
we constantly like you know we learning
a little bit of HTML and then we want to
go ahead and go oh let me mess around
with you know some Java scripting but I
don't know where you know yeah I still
don't know how much as CSS but you know
what let me jump into PHP and then on
top of that let me just jump to some
Ruby and then it'll have to learn some
Ruby a little bit let me jump into some
Java or some right that's a problem
that we all have right this ain't
nothing like you know we're not the only
ones that's going through this thing
like everybody goes through it in the
beginning and at first you gotta
basically understand that number one you
can learn everything you know but you
have to understand like that's number
one but you have to look at yourself in
the mirror and say hey you know what
physical many languages out there like
all I need to do is basically be
proficient with you know one or two and
pretty much just master those two or
three languages you can learn everything
framework that comes out every freaking
day like you know like right now for
example in JavaScript everybody's
talking about
hey view Jes and this and that and I
would like to make well a few years ago
it was all about angular and then I
thought we said we don't like the way
that angle is being run so let's move on
from that to something else like amber
and then everybody jump onto amber right
then after that everybody went it was
like you know what amber is too
opinionated and is telling you
everything you can't do anything you
can't customize it let's go and jump on
to something else like you know react
came in so yeah came in and everyone is
like okay there's like the second color
pieces you know what I mean everybody is
like oh my god we love her yeah
we love you Minoru right and then I
don't know where new framework started
popping up it was pretty agonal or
inferno irelia and a whole bunch of
little you know little frameworks came
out and now last year pretty much people
from laravel which is a PHP framework
decided to put a VJ s as their main
framework so what happened there right
now everybody get it gives it attention
because we're here why did the guys who
never start giving UJS attention while
very simple they wasn't going to give
attention to angular there was a nun
give attention to react four main reason
that those were frameworks that were
pretty much already a lot pretty much
we're already supported by major
companies Google Facebook well the guys
from that RL they're like you know what
let's pick out of all the new frameworks
that you know that's out there let's
pick one and basically promote the
out of it even though it's pretty much
the same as angular and react only
difference is put together right the
people that were complaining about I
don't like my HTML in the JavaScript
okay I'm going to link you / UJS
here you go take 3GS for you so that's
what happened right and everybody just
jump on that and right now is like it's
like a frenzy everybody's jumping on
huge again and now people was like doing
tutorials online and everybody's got a
jump on it because now you see 20,000
tutorials online like as if vgs is the
hottest thing in the world right right
but let's be honest guys like is it
really is it really that good no not
really
like the guy who made is pretty smart I
like them he's a good guy is a worth
changing for me yet after you already
invested so much time to react to just
jump onto a few Jay s and now you're
going to start switching up or even
worse let's say you have already twenty
thousand components on
 website right and then now
you're like oh you know what we've got a
switch over and start building
everything of you now it's like you
start it all over again you know like
are you really going to do that no most
likely what's going to happen is that
you're going to have components are
still Olivia and then the news that
you're making you're going to make a
review Jas I'm not going to show you
guys like there's no need is there
something like that is already good just
keep using the fact that other people
created something new great we applaud
it great for the open source community
but as a new developer you cannot be
worried about those things because it
becomes so confusing because now you're
spending an hour two hours three hours
four hours deciding which one of the
ones that supposed to be the best and in
reality they're all the same shape you
know like if you know JavaScript you
could build anything over JavaScript
like this guys they're not really doing
anything special they just put on things
in order basically well then putting
anything in a certain way where it's
easier for you to find things work okay
I know what the model is I know what a
controllers is that I know where the
usual template is that you could do that
yourself so yes it's cool to have a
framework because the framework pretty
much it helps people out like if I'm
working with five different developers
and we all decide to start doing our own
thing we're never going to be able to
collaborate or make you know any
progress at all on a project but at the
same time we cannot continue you know
every six months another framework last
year we were just doing react now this
year we're going to do you know you it's
going to happen like there's no point
guys like I'm being honest you guys have
to make a choice in this side hey am I
going to be just following the crowd for
no reason or am I going to be actually
building things because that's what
you're here for
you hit for programming and to learn
some programming or how to make websites
about how to make web applications
learning how to make for all
applications whatever it
that you're here for so why waste your
time trying to figure out which one's
the best trust me you don't want to deal
with that so I would say hey guys I know
this is pretty long but okay hey guys
don't be jumping around you know like
stick to long thing stick to the basics
like this is something to happen to me
I'm gonna give you a little backstory
when I first started or basically
learning how to do web development
because let everybody else here I was
just a programmer I was just you know
programming a little websites
making my little Dragon Ball Z websites
and stuff like that and then you know
there was a time where okay I will take
this thing serious so then I started
looking online okay I don't know how to
do this you know like dinner with my
single-page apps at that moment single
page hassles everything like everybody
want to jump on it so it's like okay
which one was the best one they have
amber they have backbone they had a
whole bunch of them and then it's like
here you go angular right so now I chose
angular and then I started doing
everything through angular and then I
realized most of the things that I was
doing on angular I didn't know how to do
it in JavaScript right so I fell into
this trap of just building things was
the framework that I had no idea what
was going on behind the scenes like you
know because I wasn't like a real expert
in JavaScript yet I was just using a
framework so I was even doing like you
know for each loops and and doing a
whole bunch of stuff that I wasn't
uncomfortable and calling myself or like
you know pure JavaScript so what was the
point of me using angular it's all about
JavaScript at that point you know what I
mean like right now a lot of people just
you know if you go to every blog every
youtuber every person that's out here
and you're like hey I'm trying to learn
everything I'm trying to learn every
framework that's out here you're not
gonna learn anything this is a whole
bunch of developers on
that pretty much they know a million
frameworks in a million languages but
none of them are senior level annular
like that's the reality of things like
you know what I mean like people are
just jumping on the bandwagon result you
know certain framework you like this is
the best but at the same time they were
just saying that three months ago about
the other one and just before that there
was another one you know what I mean
like every 3-4 months they like this is
the best come on guys stop your game on
man like just focus on one thing focus
on learning the basics focus on learning
object oriented programming focus on
learning every type of loop that you
could do focus on learning every type of
method that JavaScript might have if you
guys are doing the front-end or like
something like Ruby learn every method
that it has don't use jump on different
bail wagons just because everybody is
doing tutorials on a certain framework
because most of you guys don't even know
what the hell is going on yeah I just
learned on how to do the framework what
do you even know what really going on
behind the scenes more normally so at
the end of the day you know you might go
to a job interview and just somebody is
going to come to you and gonna say hey
do you know what's going on here how how
did that react is rendering the page you
know the virtual Dom how does that work
right or angular's are dirty checking or
you know or clicking always embrace
glitter what the hell is it what the
hell is going on behind the scenes
most of you guys are gonna be like
I don't know right because you guys
don't know JavaScript right there so I
was saying just focus on JavaScript or
focus on the language man don't continue
just learn and you know not even know
because most of you guys think like hey
I'm able to create something for a
tutorial and now I know how to do
JavaScript no because you still haven't
created any projects on your own so you
know how to do that yourself
don't worry about no frameworks don't
worry about learning anything else what
are we about learning the basics and you
really know simple job back at it again
man I'm out here life is turning off and
 is bothering I like to actually
subscribe to make this video man if you
want to support the channel just click
on the links below and basically click
either the Amazon link or you click on
the youtube link so whenever you buy an
idol basically like a little percent up
looks like three or four percent we get
it back over here at the channel and we
actually help out other developers if
you didn't know we actually give 25
percent of all the earnings</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
