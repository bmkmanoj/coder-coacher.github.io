it again man coding face.com
listen guys we're gonna basically start
my favorite part of the talk stone which
is react and a lot of you guys have
never even messed around with a
front-end framework and I'm gonna make
this thing super easy everything is
already set up meaning the whole gold
the whole web pack everything that you
have to do in the background to get you
started with react it's already done for
you of course if you guys want to find
out how to do yourself this other
tutorials online oh you could check out
the courses that I have below if you
could take Steven graders course that is
just amazing I haven't done a tutorial
from scratch or react because if he
doesn't way better than me why would I
you know try to create something that he
does it better than me you know I mean
so at least here you're gonna get
basically the taste of what reactive and
it's gonna interest you know get that
little spark inside of you to get you
interested in to learn and react alright
well yeah so let's do this
so we're gonna come here make sure
you're on the index page right you're
going to come to the index dot HTML and
then from there what we're going to do
is we're going to create a div that's
going to be cold now I don't know if
it's IDF or class act but we'll find out
in one second okay this right also down
here basically we import the you know
the vendors and the component right now
right now that thing doesn't make any
sense but listen to me just follow me
and you'll be fine
now let's save this for saved this
compiler right now okay now as you can
see my old component is there
right so we're going to do is now we're
going to come here and we're going to
rename this we're going to say rename
this to a web app that J is right now
and we're going to rename the file tool
so what app effective name just like
that camel case - web app that Jas all
right so now what we're going to do is
we're going to go into the web pack of
fig folder or now the folder the file
and we're going to come here and rename
this we're going to say web app and then
we're going to rename this the same
thing well as and then the file we're at
Jes what this is doing is is bringing in
the JavaScript that we have here in
compiling it for us now let's make sure
that we run you see we have we have an
errors here so we're gonna run yawn
watch again
okay cool now let's make sure here we
named this instead of first comp we
gonna name it what app jf you see now
the component shows up again now what
we're going to do is we're going to copy
all the JavaScript that we want luck
JavaScript all the HTML that we have in
here everything from div class container
down till the last if we're going to
delete it well not early then we're
going to press command X you know to cut
and then save this and then what we're
going to do is I'm going to paste this
inside of here
right now this thing doesn't make sense
to you guys but like I said just follow
what I'm saying I'm gonna explain it to
you guys all right so we gotta come here
I'm going to paste it inside of this
we're going to say I'm going to name
this let's say class name me we got to
delete this all this stuff here
sorry and we're going to name this where
that right my bad roots now inside of
this we're going to paste all the HTML
now one thing doesn't point they'll
react what we're doing right now is
basically is this the area where you
render your component right
but in react you can use the keyword
class so because if you say class is
basically you're talking about this
class because remember this even though
this is HTML inside with JavaScript you
can't say class inside of here so it's
going to give your error so what you're
going to do is you're gonna you know 5
all right and you say class equals and
then you're going to say class and then
upper caste and and then name and then
you're going to do equals and then find
off and then move to subside replace all
so what that did was just every place
every single one now another thing
that's important about JSX
that's what that's how it's called JSX
whenever you put HTML inside of your
javascript
it's called JSX so another thing that's
important about it is tags that are not
so there are basically self-closing you
know like the image tag
or the I think the I tag there's a
couple of ones that people use our
self-closing you have to have a closing
tag for it so what you do you see like
image right now is giving us error right
here and saying okay that's the arrow
here and it's not rendering the rest of
it so what's happening here is you have
to come in here and say slash so now
what the day was it closed that HTML tag
right now we keep going see everything
seems fine okay cool now let's see if
that runs okay yarn watch okay let's see
what's the error this whatever is the
end let's see the JavaScript went
through yes so now this page right now
that we're watching is being brought in
by react right so already this basically
this whole page itself is a component
right so what we're going to do is going
to look into this
look def ID app this is where the the
app the web app component is actually
starting so from here then inside of it
what react does is it renders all the
HTML inside of this this disk tag right
now right now I'm about to break it down
for you guys and simple terms in an easy
way for you guys to understand right so
react is a further framework now what
does that mean it just means is a bunch
of libraries or a bunch of functions put
together to make your life easier as a
what developer right now all the stuff
you could do it directly with just
JavaScript but now we've react you have
things that are easier for you plus is
what was cool about it it's just
the way how things work is it reacts to
certain things depending on the data
depending on the state right now I can't
really show it to you until we start
creating more components and you will
see why react is like so gray and you
can actually keep track of everything
right now what we did right now we just
basically converted our regular HTML
into a react component right so right
now automatically you guys already
started with react right now a lot of
people might think like oh man this
seems easier than what I thought and
yeah react is pretty easy the only thing
that takes time is setting it up with
gold in the packages and all other stuff
but once you do it once like you don't
have to think about that ever again like
maybe later on if you want to tweak air
or do something else yeah but once you
do it once and you do a basically a
quaking store of all the packages and
everything that you need for it and you
will understand what gold and white on
webpack is then you're going to be fine
after that alright so this is the first
video just a quick introduction to react
right now let me show you this if we
come here and we do this sorry my voice
is acting up I don't know why we come
here we say we remove this and we say
poor let's say let's organize this let's
put this to 232 save it it compiles and
then you see now shows up here right ok
we see that now you might say why would
I choose react why would I choose
anything if I could do this with jQuery
if I could do this with regular HTML why
would I want my HTML and sorry
Act or JavaScript whatever right why
would I want this well all of the stuff
it makes your your code more reusable
components you know theoretically you
could create a component like let's say
for a pop-up right let's say a modal you
create that component once and then you
could repurpose it to any other website
that you want to create later on if you
code it properly right so in one sense
that that's one of the main reasons why
reactor is very popular another reason
is because of state so the way how state
works
you guys might not know what the hell
state state is basically think about it
like this um just to break it down let's
say when you come to a page right and
you click on the menu when you click on
the menu the page knows okay this person
clicked on the menu now let's take them
to the next next page the news page
right now we've react with this what
this does is you keep track of
everything you can let that you keep
track but you can't keep track of every
action that a user takes on a page on a
component or anything and then react to
it on another component meaning let's
say right now somebody added this to
their cart right and say okay I want to
add this to the cart and it says okay
I'm gonna add six six items of these
right and they all add up to let me see
232 times 6:30 196 right now if you put
a functional you push something and you
stay well you say hey when it cut when
somebody comes and add something to
their cart that's above $1,000 once it
reaches $1,000 show them a pop-up that
says hey you have 25% the moment you you
anything over $1,000 you get 25% off now
you could show that to the user on a man
click on their page alright so think
about it like that alone maybe if I
explain it right or not but there's just
like a quick introduction to react and
as we go with the tutorials you will see
more better examples because right now
I'm just explaining it to you guys in
like very very low like high level of
like you know of what's really going on
like the best way to show it to you guys
is actually by doing but yeah this is
the first video um make sure you
subscribe make sure you like this video
man and right now there's just a
beginning right now all we do is just
basically set up this page to be able to
run were free act right now all right so
yeah I'll see you guys later
make sure you subscribe so you can make
sure you like this video
trust me guys follow the steps you're
gonna be good
and there's just the introduction this
wasn't even like anything because I know
how people are gonna you didn't catch
one mm you know introduce everything
from reactants like of course not that's
why there's a question on Stephen
Greiner if you want to thinking where
he's gonna go in-depth into everything
this is just for you guys to see how
everything works on a page so you're
building it and then you're gonna
realize how important is every single
library that I'm showing you guys or
every tutorial that's out there or when
I tell you hey PHP is important because
it is or hey you shouldn't react because
it is so now you're actually going to
see it in person of what how things are
being used all right so yeah make sure
you subscribe make sure you like this
video I'll see you later guys
Wow GG you already knows your boy Joe
back at it again man listen make sure
you subscribe and make sure you like
this video man by the way if you want to
know exactly what courses I took to
become a web developer they right there
in the description it's no secret it's
nothing crazy is no secret gift that I
had it's just pretty much I took the
courses they're pretty cheap tonight
written dollars each on specials and
just
change your life change the lifestyle do
something fun with something cool that
you could call a career</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
