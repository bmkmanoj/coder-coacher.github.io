again sorry about that I was doing a
live feed and then things was going
crazy so I'd rather just come here and
spray into you in a video so Felipe's
had a very good question
if nobody is as far as like companies no
one's using hyper app as you know last a
full fledged framework or whatever you
want to call it right there main stack
why am i teaching it well you got to
think about it like this Filipe
basically every framework is a tool
every framework is a way for you to get
a job done right you know it's like you
gotta take out a I don't know a screw
right a star screw you're not gonna go
in there with a hammer and hammer it
down right because that's not what the
the requirements in it needs right it
needs a screwdriver there has to start
on it right so that's the same thing as
every framework out there right when you
become a experienced developer with time
you realized there's a framework there's
a tool there's a library this something
for each project right now let's say
somebody asks me jump we want you to
create a video player right what would I
use react angular a hyper app or view or
always the other one I think mark
there's another one called mark or
something like that Marco which one
would I use I will use hyper app because
it's super simple I get to keep track of
the state of my app and it's super small
I'm just building that one component I'm
not going to build a full website with
hyper app for that if I want to do that
I'm gonna use react I'll be honest you
know so that's what I'm saying you guys
is gonna have
different situations where you might say
hey I want to create a form a quick form
something small right and I don't want
to use jQuery I want to have something
where I could keep track of my state
keep the validations keep things nice
and clean I'm gonna use Hyper app for
that right let's say another situation
let's say you have a search bar right
and you're typing down you know
something and you want it to
autocomplete and you want to create that
component what would I use am I gonna do
that with jQuery am I gonna do that with
react why would I use react where react
the library is huge and uses like two or
three different things basically uses
react your users or react on it uses
component if I'm using es6 classes so
there's so much things that I have to
load for react to work instead I would
just use type wrap because it's a small
component is something quick and you
wanted to note fast right so that's what
I'm saying you know it's like for every
single situation there's a different
tool for it now as you become a more
experienced developer you get to figure
that out you know so that's what I
wanted to tell you guys because like I
said every single situation has a
different tool you know what I mean like
you're not gonna come in and if you're
building something simple there's really
no point of you coming in and creating
something with reactive redux you're
making it more complicated than what it
needs to be right you're doing it let's
say just a simple search bar with
autocomplete why will you use react and
redux for it you could just use the
regular react right without no Redux and
keep everything on your local state for
that component now if you want it to be
faster than that because you know it's
just a small component you don't need
this big library then you will use
something like hyper app right a lot of
the things that you use
jQuery for I will use Hyper app for
that's my that's my opinion that's how I
would choose it and that's what I want
to teach it to people because you need
to know multiple tools for different
situation different jobs it's like the
certain situations why don't say hey I
will use nodejs over pH feet larvae
larval is more for a full-fledged
website something that I have user
authentication a whole bunch of stuff
right if all I want to do is just create
a REST API for a cell phone let's say I
have a blog right and all I want to do
is just return back a JSON of all my
posts to a cell phone right to a mobile
device and that's what I want to do like
let's say somebody has an iPhone
application and they need to connect to
somewhere to get that data when I do
this in their account
no all I would do is just do this
straight on no GS and basically just
send them the the JSON data like every
single situation has a tool for it and
as you become more experienced you get
to figure that out with time so that's
all I'm saying kids you're ready now
Superboy job back at it again : face
calm Philippe hope that that answer your
question
keep throwing questions at me man
in comments and I love that it's like
it's a good discussion it's good to have
discussion between developers and and
basically talk to each other and like I
was saying on my live video man you know
a lot of times don't worry about what
everybody's using because whenever
somebody tells me everybody's using this
automatically I got a question it
because I'm like are they really using
it all right is everybody really using
it you know what I mean like all the
companies in the world or the majority
are using whatever you know fill in the
blanks whatever library or framework the
person might tell me I'm like not really
because every time I go to a
different company I've been to a whole
bunch of companies from major to small
businesses to just clients everybody
uses a different workflow depending on
what does the company's business is
perfect example guys look up the stack
of Netflix right Netflix has like three
four different backends servers right
back in on languages then they have like
literally every framework out there do
you guys think every company's like that
no so when somebody a developer from
framework from Netflix comes in and does
a talk on a on a thing how you call his
own kind of freaking I'm sorry I'm I'm
starving having eight on a convention
right he basically comes in he doesn't
talk does it really mean that everybody
is using whatever that company is using
no it just means in that company they
use that you know what I mean so yeah
man you're in a noisy boy job back at it
again coding face calm stay up man and I
guess a check out my website coding fees
calm got a couple of links there below
check those out you could go to the
udemy if you like you to me if you like
my website listen it's the best deal
five dollars a month you're getting
every course or you could just buy it
individually for like $15 all right so
I'll see you guys later again man listen
make sure you subscribe and make sure
you like this video man by the way if
you want to know exactly what courses I
took to become a web developer they
right there in the description it's no
secret it's nothing crazy there's no
secret gift that I had is just pretty
much I took the courses they're pretty
cheap they're like 15 dollars each on
specials and just listen man change your
life change the lifestyle do something
fun and something cool that you could
call a career</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
