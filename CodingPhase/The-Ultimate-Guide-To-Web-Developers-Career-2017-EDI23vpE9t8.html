it again man : face calm and it's the
ultimate guide to web development
ultimate guide to web developers Oh to
make sky two levels of developers man
you dig all right so let's go with this
man so right now if you just starting
you started to get you know interesting
into this you have the level of spark
man you just got your first interest
from there you become a programmer you
know you learn HTML CSS you know the
basics of JavaScript you know little
loops conditionals Dom manipulation and
then from there you start jumping to the
next level a Julia developer right
junior developer means right now you
don't know exactly where you're going to
go you don't know if you're going to go
further and you don't know if you're
going to go back in but right now you're
just learning as much as you can right
so you got no bootstrap you got jQuery
these are portfolio of your little
personal projects little tutorials that
you've done and all you know you
launched your first website your little
dot-com you know something from GoDaddy
whatever right and then you start
applying for jobs right then you realize
okay you start applying for a job let's
start with the front end right you know
what do you need to become a front-end
developer right you know you got a load
responsive design Dom manipulation Ajax
MVC or any framework from you know
angular react ember view j/s right right
now this is like the basics this will
every single developer from junior mid
and senior need to know right that's one
that you start growing up you're like
okay I'm a junior front-end developer
now you hired you got hired right here
is where you basically your client -
Jocelyn okay I'm gonna send this out
send my portfolio in my car you know my
resume to people so right as a front-end
developer but reality once you come in
your junior front right because you have
you know less than a year or two you
know always long basically building
action you know having experience at the
job doing stuff in your house it's not
the same thing that's working in the
company remember that all right from day
is that okay
so your little job is going to be from
45 to 60 K and that's five you're going
to be maintaining that if you call HTML
email css3 animation a little
introduction to no js' which is fine
then from there you got two to seven
years of experience all right so this
one you're already in the job and as you
go you're going to get a lot of more
stuff to do of course all of this stuff
is not in England but what it's telling
you is that by that and by that time by
the time you're in the middle level
you're going to know at least the REST
API how to connect with it or you know a
Jackson you're going to deal with other
back-end developers I'll use that a
build tools like gold web pack grunt you
got charts like libraries charts
libraries like d3.js charges high charts
other libraries that I didn't want to
put it because if I was to put every
single JavaScript library that you might
use you this whole page will be shrill
there's like a million JavaScript
libraries all right all right there's a
menu at the senior front-end developer
right now you'll be here you you would a
big boys now now you got the chance to
work in more in companies like Netflix
and oh you know Facebook whatever or
whatever big companies close to you
right so like let's say an example you
got seven years plus right so let's say
an example right now you're earning 80
to 130 King right you got constant
constant contact with the higher and
upper management or CEO which is a
start-up ownership the project meanings
that you're pretty much responsible for
the project project management automated
testing well you know also to extensive
experience with security you know how to
you know clear everything from you know
people injecting a sequel into the piece
through your JavaScript because they do
that all the time and also to training
junior and mint developers so now you're
pretty much responsible not only for for
the project you're responsible for the
team so when somebody messes up on the
team
upper management is going to come to you
then I'm going to go and talk to them
they're going to come to you like hey
whatever Johnny came in late or whatever
Johnny's not keeping up with was the
stack whatever it is but now you're
actually responsible for it you know you
got unit testing mocha jasmine caramel
all right so that's the funny right now
let's go back into the novels remember
junior developers now you can easily
gone the other way and you say hey I
want to become a back-end developer
right so you're back in developer right
now you gotta know at least some of you
know Linux app deployment you know FTP
you know putting stuff into you know the
servers and FTP knowing Apache ng on
nginx back in languages right you gotta
know at least one of these right c-sharp
PHP JavaScript Java Ruby elixir Scarlett
go whatever right definitely you gotta
know at least one framework from them
right and say hey asp.net are laravel or
no js' spring Ruby on Rails Phoenix
gopher Django
so you gotta know at least one framework
so this could be easier you know and
everything is more structure and you
know once you follow a framework
everything's easier right
so definitely go to the next level you
got junior back-end developers right you
got six months two years right so that
was just to you know get your feet wet
into the industry right so for people to
even take you serious you gotta know at
least one language and know at least you
know the lamp the lamp stack right which
is like the easiest thing and able to
you at least use or FTP like FileZilla
you know that's just to get hired right
then from that your junior back-end
developer right now you're here for six
months to two years you earning 35 to 50
K you know knowing one back in languages
is a must you got to know how to create
a crud create read update delete you
got to be able to create a REST API most
of those frameworks already have
something similar to it - you know Russ
API so you can actually look at the
documentation and you get to pretty much
you know build upon that then you have
stuff like CMS's like wordpress drupal
90% of the time you're going to start
here like if you're like a brand new
back-end developer like most jobs like
they come to be hiring for this you know
wordpress and drupal you know what else
you got a deployment how to you know how
to deploy the apps in FTP servers like
shared hosting like GoDaddy comm with a
namecheap.com also to like simple
deployment like in a real cool digital
ocean also to you must know my sequel my
sequels are give you some places they
might use MongoDB but the reality of
things is everybody is going to expect
you to know my sequel and how to do
sequel queries so there is a muscle I
kind of I should have put this over here
because you know what I might just put
it over there because it's actually that
important to actually go here yeah there
you go
so let's put it there because this is
something that every single you know
every single level is going to need
alright so then from there you have
mid-level just you know middle level
right so you got two to seven years in
this right now you already been working
you already been jumping from you know
one company to the other you have
experience and you know deploying that
the whole shebang right by this time you
should be able to be understanding you
know understanding and security and
compliances you need to be able to have
extensive knowledge of MVC frameworks
you got to know at least multiple
back-end languages most people know PHP
Python nodejs
those are the language that people
mostly now let's go to the senior back
end right so the senior back-end
developer
and this is not just for anybody that
could just come to this level like I'll
be honest with you guys like most of the
things back and develop will have a lot
of pressure and a lot of you know
responsibilities this is not just like
hey I just want to be a senior back in
developer this takes years and there's a
reason why they you know they earn the
big bucks man you could earn ninety
thousand to two hundred thousand dollars
man I'm talking about you know corporate
companies and you know company that is
quick to throw that money at you but you
got to be really good because you're
going to have a lot of responsibility
you gotta you know be in constant
contact with the higher management CEOs
experience with big data experience with
automation in operations not only that
then you also to responsible for the
most of the time it's like the whole
project is you're responsible for it
when somebody try to hack something on
the website you're responsible for it
when somebody you know security is not
good and something happens you're
responsible for it when database is down
and the website is down you're
responsible for it like every type of
big responsibility on it on the whole
web application the whole website you're
responsible for it okay so you guys
gotta really think about do you really
want to take that route in army so
there's so much even more stuff that
Google into but I don't want to go so
Saudi because there's really no point of
going that deep because most jobs they
have different things and different
requirements to become a senior back in
developer but I can guarantee you one
thing you will get to this level without
the years this is not something that you
can say hey I just graduated from
college and now I'm a senior back-end
developer like 99.9999 of people is not
gonna become that person in one year
trust me like you know what I mean and
then from there you have the full stack
web developer what is a full stack web
developer it means you got knowledge of
front-end and the backend well you're
not a master of anything and why do i
why do I say that why do I say that
because you're pretty much you
so spread out you know in the industry
and you try to learn every single little
bit of of technology out there it's
almost impossible for you to keep up
there's no way that you can keep up with
the the fast pace of JavaScript and in
the front end and then also to keep up
with with everything in the backend it's
almost impossible to keep up with
everything so when I say your mastermind
it means like you're very good at you
know every piece of the whole stack and
you're you know any moment somebody
tells you hey could you do this you go
into the database and fix this up or can
you you know come in here and fix my
page up or whatever it is the location
is right it means you could do all of
them but you're not an expert on it
you know there's guys who are expert in
JavaScript they guys who are expert in
Mike you know certain frameworks those
guys who are really great with sequel
queries those guys who are really
amazing that you know architecting an
application but being a full stack web
developer it it's not about that it's
not about mastering something it's about
being able to you know get your hands
dirty and your feet wet with every
single all part of the stack you know
like there's people who are just
back-end developers like you tell them
hey could you go and fix something you
know to this website and change the CSS
and they're like oh look look look
written even creatively change anything
in the three SS pass it to the designers
pass it to the disciples there's people
like that or there's guys who are in the
front end like you know know if there's
like hey hey man I don't touch the
backend I don't touch database man how
do you know the front-end I don't my
load JavaScript I'm doing my little
stuff that's like the oh man guys that's
funny if you want to be just a front-end
guy or you just want to be a back-end
guy but I remember that if you want to
be a full stack web developer it just
means that you're able to pick up any
other technologies at any given point
all right so this is the full guide full
real you
real real real real guide that's out
here you know something you know on a
higher level for you guys to understand
you know speaking in English you know
what I mean like I don't want to come
over here and give you a whole bunch of
big words and a whole bunch of you know
big explanation of every single thing
because sometimes you don't need that
you just need to know like hey what's
going on here talk to me in English you
know what I mean and that's what I'm
here for you guys man make sure you
