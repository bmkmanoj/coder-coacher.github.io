joke back at it again man : face calm
listen the boy is back I'm doing this
thing I'm out here man I'm on him I'm
doing my thing right alright guys so
somebody asked me in a chat room
yesterday like hey Joe with everything
that's going on with YouTube and you
know the ad ban and you know all the
things that's happening thanks to
PewDiePie for you know messing it up for
everybody on YouTube
um are you affected by it and I will say
yes and no yes in the sense of I'm not
getting that much money out of this but
I wasn't getting that much money before
this anyways so it wasn't like a big
deal for me now I say no because I'm
still getting new subscribers every
single day and when I created this
channel it wasn't like hey I want to
make money off this YouTube channel
that's not what I made it for I made it
for people you know just to have like a
I don't know have somebody who might
look like them who might talk like that
whom I just relayed to them or somebody
that they feel like oh that's like that
could be one of my boys that could be go
to my friends and that's why I created
this channel so I'm getting subscribers
every single day you know and that's why
I created this channel so it's not
really affecting me because I'm still
going to be doing videos no matter what
even if YouTube wasn't be like hey man
we're not going to pay you for
advertising or you curse too much on
your videos whatever whatever they want
to do I really don't care because I
don't make money from YouTube I make
money from you know other things like my
website you know I make money from my
job I got a full-time job I'm not
dependent on YouTube you know but at the
same time it's like it does affect like
you know it kind of sucks like I was
making like honor
300 $400 a month
and I was able to give out you know free
courses and help people out here in the
beginning everybody who's been here from
the beginning I know that I was giving
out a whole bunch of courses in the
beginning but I was because the money
was coming in was okay cool if I get
$300 I could go in and give $200 of
courses to people now that's not the
case I'm not making $300 from YouTube
ads and so on or the YouTube revenue
like those days are over
like they they basically stopped it so
that's why you know I created the
patreon and I don't even promoting I
just put it on the links I'm like okay
guys if you want to support just
freaking donate a dollar a dollar to the
channel a month through patreon $5 a
month through patreon which is pretty
much what I would get if if the YouTube
you know YouTube ads we're still on but
like you're used to you know again the
coca-cola commercials and listen that
not those are a god they're not here no
more so there's like really no way to
make any money from YouTube so I can't
come out of my pocket and always pay for
other people's courses the way how I
used to do it was because since
everybody is to watch my channel YouTube
used to give me some money and from
there I was able to just give it out to
people like in India the Philippines and
freaking Brazil I would give it out to
people in Mexico I would give it out to
people here in Miami who didn't have
money give it out to people freaking
California like there's a lot of areas
that even though the United States
people are poor they can't afford attend
out of course 15 out of course you know
so that's what we say okay all of you
guys who watch my channel and yeah
enjoying my channel like it's not going
to hurt you to sign up to patreon and be
like okay Joe here's a dollar
he's a dollar for you know your service
and he is a dollar so you could help out
other people's because that's what I do
the channels for helping others so it's
like if you see the patreon and when I
say Oh
like you know check out the patreon or
whatever it's not because I'm over here
trying to make a million dollars of this
 like I'm talking about like a
hundred two hundred dollars a month like
I'm not going to make money out of this
 but this helps me out because
I get to give it out to other peoples
here like I don't care to give $200 $300
and courses for free to people that I
know that really needed and you know
they really got really sad
stories man and I'm like I could relate
to all of them because I came from the
bottom and I mean that's what I do this
 you know but yes so YouTube affects
me in the sense of I can't give out free
courses number how I used to I still
give it out you know I was sparing fifty
dollars out of my own pocket but I can't
do the 200-300 dollars that I was doing
in the beginning I can't because I'm not
getting that money back no more um and
yeah that's where it's affecting me and
no has not affected me because I still
getting subscribers and that's what I
came here for I came for the subscribers
I came to see people online and talk to
people online I got some good friends or
you know I got Matt Matt Matt through
here Katie super cool I got this other
kid Jerry we talk all the time now you
know texting Shane I got Chris Sean you
know I got so many people that I've met
from this channel alone that even if you
to says hey Joe we're not gonna pay you
for any of the advertising that we put
on your on your videos like I'm still
happy you know what I mean and I know
that there's a whole bunch of people
that once I half : phase calm like
they'll sign up and I'll make money off
the the ads on there you know so even if
all this shit's for free it's fine you
know I'm not worried about it
but like I said man I don't promote the
patreon because I know that you guys
read through it and I know you guys see
it is there on every video every
description if you really want to
support the channel just man donate a
dollar a month I do this all the
time if you look at my I'm probably
going to show you guys my patreon how
many channels are support here
like literally I put in like $50 in
total from like all the channels that I
support on YouTube so and I'm not even a
 Boulder I'm just like some
regular guy I somehow figure out
to pay $50 to people on YouTube so it's
like I know a lot of you guys can just
go in and put a dollar that's a
$1 man you know what's going on with
YouTube nobody's making no more money
nobody's doing anything and I
know from the beginning that this
channel wasn't gonna be like hey I'm
gonna make a million subscribers in a
month and I'm gonna be making $10,000 a
month now I know this was a small
community I know that was more of a
niche community and I said you know what
I'm afraid this channel no matter what
but I would really appreciate if you
know the ones that can man sign of a
patreon man is is a dollar trust me you
know them well that the content that you
get out of this is worth more than that
you know I come here every single day
show you guys love you know so love back
maybe because it sucks I can't
give out free courses like I used to
because of YouTube because of
PewDiePie PewDiePie pretty much
it up for everybody
so yeah that's where we are with with
YouTube and the whole drama of hey you
can you can get paid because of YouTube
because of whatever PewDiePie additional
racist and then now all the big
advertising you know companies are not
here no more like you know coca-cola
 what else there's a whole bunch
of them some they left for you to let me
say peace you guys are racist you guys
are saying a whole bunch of now we
don't want our commercials promoting so
now everybody else to the little guys
like me we get affected in the sense of
like if we was making some dollars we're
not making that no more you know

sure you like this video man and if you
want to learn to become a web developer
