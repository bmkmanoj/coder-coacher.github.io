so I guess YouTube is coming out with
saying you hey Google alright so I guess
we got the invite for this YouTube
studio beta yeah it looks pretty legit
I'll be honest I like the design I like
the the black on top I like the clean
white here a little of gray on the side
you know so nice navigation this is my
first impression I literally just got
the scent right now I just clicked on it
I went in that's it we're in so I don't
know where nothing is at this is my
first impression so okay so they have
this little message he is telling you
hey see was Neil click to explore the
new features we've added to YouTube beta
cool so you know this all your videos
here shows you your likes vs. dislikes
which is cool I you know a lot of times
I get a hundred percent of all likes and
then I'm literally like what like a 97
you know usually the the smallest thing
that we'll get from like likes is gonna
be like 75% outside like that which is
fine we don't need to get likes every
single day from everybody people don't
need to like us all the time alright
let's see what else is in here let's see
if we click in here turn on monetization
cool so you could just go ahead turn it
on that's cool let's see what else wanna
change this to public we could just
change it to public right here let's see
this thing should give us like some
something if we click here shows us the
comments this is cool it's gonna be
easier for me to actually see or the
comments from everybody nowadays so
that's gonna be hot oh okay so when you
scroll the top gets smaller it's a
little bit a little bit little bit slow
you see the animation
it's pretty bad which I mean it's in
beta right now you know they're still
probably trying to get it to 60 frames
per second but yeah they're definitely
gonna work on that because look how slow
that it's alright
let's see get the big picture click on
the click here to takes you up a level
gives you whatever you of your content
so okay it just brings you right back
Google just say go back Nessie you don't
have to give me a crazy explanation like
you're not talking to a beginner all
right let's see analytics hopefully
analytics it's a little bit better now
okay it's a little bit more cleaner
I like this real-time views you know a
little 7000 views you know nothing too
crazy you know we're not doing that bad
I mean it's cool subscribers how many
subscribers I got subscriber change we
went up a thousand in the last 28 days

noticed that by now my advice is for web
developers I'm not talking about
computer science majors I'm not talking
about high corners software engineer

what I mean I think like I don't care
we're not talking to those people if you
like what develop me if you like
creating stuff on the web this is my
channel welcome alright
average view duration so my average view
is like five minutes you know that's not
bad let's say all time it's like four
minutes
in 23 seconds so that's not bad so most
people stay in for five minutes most of
my videos are usually from ten to
fifteen so and that's not all of them
that's like some of them but yeah that's
that's cool cool information let's say

little keywords that throw throw me some
views and some subscribers let me see
top video suggesting your content hmm
who's suggesting my content out here
angularjs angular versus react versus
PJs you can't become a developer in
three months yes I know that one be
careful with falling in the free cocaine
trap people get so mad at that one um
yeah but it seems like those are like
the ones like always give me some views
let me see top external searches google
searches i wish they will give us the
the keywords that are actually coming in
from google searches so like that we
