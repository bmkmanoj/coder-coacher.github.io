your boy is back and I didn't did it
again somehow listen guys good morning
this is my little drive from my crib to
to the gym show you guys a little bit of
my view how it looks nothing but
mountains out here in Connecticut and I
loved it I was tired
all that flat land from Long Island like
Long Island super flat guys if you guys
didn't know it's super flat like you can
see from one end of the island to the
other end it's super flat out here in
Connecticut every time that you go
anywhere there's like mountains all over
around you and it's the nice mountains
mountains with pine trees but yeah man
today's topic while I go to the gym and
workout is basically how hard is it to
transition consider back in right
especially when you like a front-end
developer how hard is it to be coming
back in developer so be honest with you
it can be a little bit hard right
because a lot of times you know there's
like once you start working you'll
notice that the back end developers
you know have more responsibilities than
the front end right the front end it's
like okay it needs to look good and
JavaScript need to be minify your
JavaScript needs to be optimized as much
as possible
CSS needs to be optimized what else you
know but that's pretty much it it's like
hey make it work in a couple of
different browsers nowadays people is
not worried about Internet Explorer
eight or like nine and stuff like that
most jobs right
most companies but your job consists of
you actually just making sure that
people can view the website consistently
in all the browsers let's say that's the
jobs in front-end developer here's a
design building that's it that's your
front-end job right a back-end developer
action he has to do a lot more stuff
right let's say for example if you go to
a company that's everything is already
built for you your job a lot of times
consists of adding new features so like
let's say you you have an e-commerce
website okay and they say okay we have a
rating system now we want to show you
know the top rated of sneakers right so
now you got to create that feature from
scratch okay so now you got to deal with
the the database you got to create a
sequel statement or if you're using
something like Mara you got to know how
to optimize eloquent so be proficient
you know cuz sometimes you might create
a query that doesn't make sense that
that queries throughout the whole the
whole database alright so you want to be
as much as you know as specific as
possible so it could be efficient and it
doesn't do too many calls to to the
database right it doesn't worry to so
many
different things especially when you
have thousands and thousands of users
online at the same time you know so you
have to worry about that you also have
to worry about you know the server
sometimes this companies that I already
have you know DevOps but if you're like
a medium-sized company or even what's so
responsible if you work in a digital
agency
so pretty much transfer websites and
deal with the domains you know
understanding the NSA understanding all
the good stuff right you know because
it's like a client might come into your
agency they're all could you guys build
me a website for my little BS restaurant
and next thing you know the project
managers oh yeah we'll do it with
WordPress right so then you do it with
WordPress but now you have to be able to
upload that website to the FTP server or
if you guys are using something like
they do the ocean or something like what
else like Heroku
it all depends on what you're using
right play most of the time if you're
using WordPress you're gonna be doing
something like namecheap.com or
godaddy.com or I was a Bluehost you know
those gotta be like the easiest way to
to set it up because usually they have
already WordPress in there all you have
to do is I click one button and it
stores it for you so that's like the
easiest way to do it but as a back-end
developer I feel like you have way more
responsibilities you know something
breaks and like I say in the cart system
right you're responsible for it
something breaks in in the backend like
let's say the the dashboard on
administration side of the website
you're responsible for that
let me see what else you're responsible
for connecting to AP is like sometimes
you might be connecting to something
like Tullio you might be connected to
other api's that you know like let's say
for example that connect to you connect
to an API and you send the text to the
person like a verification code or stuff
like that little features like that
you're the one that that's responsible
for that so in reality being a back-end
developer is like you got to do more
work than a front-end guy front-end guys
is just hey do the front-end do a
website that looks good and you know it
works on every browser but you know but
when you're dinner with the backend it's
a little bit different kids it can be a
little bit difficult I'll be honest with
you guys
but that's why I chose you guys you got
to build a bunch of projects on your own
you know when I first it's easy to say
hey I'm gonna get a job as a front-end
developer and I tell you guys learn
react or angular one of those tools
whichever one clicks to your brain rate
which I won't make sense before you guys
learn that get into a job very easy
front-end development and then from
there you have like a year or two so
prepare yourself building projects on
your own understanding the the company
the stack that your company already has
you know if they use Ruby on Rails you
know go home build Ruby on Rails
applications if they use Java go home
build some java applications so you who
actually understand the stack you know
I've seen a lot of times front-end
developers not be like oh I'm just a
front-end developer I don't need to
worry about anything I just create my
components I create my little HTML pages
let the backend guide deal with
everything else
and it's like sometimes that's annoying
because it's like it would be better if
you have you was able to give an extra
hand or like he was able to understand
how things work like some they are
seeing front-end developers that don't
understand how the back-end developer
sends them a JSON object like they don't
understand it they think it's like as if
it was magic now you know it's super
simple but you got to understand the
framework you got to send the
programming language but some people
they don't want to freaking you know put
in the work but that's their problem so
it's like how hard is it to transition
from front-end or back-end when you
start at first I think the first year
you're always gonna be like a front-end
guy you know and then with time you will
transition to a back-end developer by
building your own applications and then
you know then from there like either
applying for a back-end position or you
know in your own company that might
promote you now I wouldn't recommend
people to go straight from from scratch
train from the beginning and say hey I'm
gonna be a back-end developer I wouldn't
recommend it unless you're doing PHP and
you're doing something like WordPress or
you're doing something like glabra where
you know for sure is like the system is
already everything is already in place
for you I wouldn't recommend people
being like hey I'm just gonna be a
back-end developer like it's a difficult
road like it's gonna take you longer to
get in because there's like companies is
they wanna hire people but it's hard to
hire back-end developer that has never
worked at a company first right because
it's hard to trust somebody like how can
you trust your core business to somebody
that has never done it before things
like that happens so you gotta be
careful with that
so yeah man so what was good guys any
new questions and new messages are bunch
of going to the gym but making sure
seeing you guys is gut I hope there's a
little quick topic it's good for some of
you guys right Kelvin Davis as curious
about that myself because my programming
logic is not so strong right now I mean
it's not that difficult and reality is
not that difficult you gotta understand
the concepts of database you got to
understand the concepts of session you
gotta understand cookies you got to
understand how the server renders pages
and renders you know even you know pages
headers like you know content type like
you gotta understand those things too
like I see a lot of people talk about
they teaching like back-end courses and
they don't even talk about the different
type of content type like you know you
could return back on image from the
server right you can return back a JSON
or XML you do return back JavaScript CSS
like static files but you got to
understand how it works and that's one
of the main reasons why I tell people
don't try to learn your first back-end
language with no js' because no learning
it from no GS point of view is like
building something from scratch right
there's really not that many good
frameworks out there that already have
all those things built for you so you're
gonna have to start not only learning
the concepts of being a back-end
developer but at the same time having to
figure out which library you're going to
use out of thousands and thousands of
libraries you know what I mean like
there's a few libraries that everybody
use like body parser what's the other
one
there's one for session that almost
everybody use but then this is like a
million different libraries for cookies
there's a million different libraries to
to render
your you know your templates like which
one is the right one
you get wonder cynic you I feel like
when you do know Jes is like you're
gonna fall into a trap of like
constantly searching which one is the
best right and it sucks
I think I first to become a good
developer you should try to use a
language or a framework that has already
been proven so all you have to worry
about is to learn the concepts right
once you learn the concepts then you
could be an expert you could say hey I'm
gonna use this library in my no Jes
stack because it's more proficient than
the other one but if you don't even know
how to use any of those libraries you
don't even know why you're using them
it's like you're out here trying to do
like three different things that are
once you're trying to learn it you're
trying to find out which was the best
and then on top of that you're just
still trying to build your application
that you're trying to build you gotta
say like you're doing too much
now when you use something like laravel
laravel already has everything set up
for you you know Pete you learn PHP PHP
is super easy then form a you use
something like narrow Larry bro has
everything already built for you you so
you're not worrying about oh which
library should I use for sessions which
libraries should I use for user
authentication which Larry the library
should I use for cookies what should I
use to render my pages like it's too
much at first so it's like for people
that jump it - no Jay yes the best
nodejs developers are not beginner
nodejs developers at all if you look at
any person who's been doing nodejs for
like the first year like their
applications look horrible when you look
at the code you're like wait what the
hell is this it's a mess but the best
nodejs developers our developers are
coming from other languages guys will
have been you know building applications
for like six seven years and in PHP or
Ruby on Rails or Java so by the time
they get to know Jes
know exactly all the concepts so then
they can focus on building the the
application but when you're a junior
developer and you're like oh I'm trying
to learn no GS and learn which was the
Bentson and figuring out how to build
this app it's like it's too much but
yeah so let me see so I'm trying to read
what everybody says here so says good
question
Ramsey's joining I don't even know what
Ramsey Johnny said so Joe I got a call
yesterday about a senior JavaScript
position but I was honest about my
skills that I ever or that I do
the right thing I really want a chance
for someone listen as far as I get
skills like you know sometimes you can't
oversell yourself right but it's like
this man if I'm gonna take this analogy
right if somebody takes you on a boat
right and they say they take you to to
the beach right and they say hey there's
a boat there I'm gonna take you very
deep into the waters and then I'm gonna
just give you a lifeboat and then I want
you to come back to the beach at first
you're gonna be like oh my god I'm so
scared I don't know what to do should I
go that deep should I go that far then
if you go you actually realize that once
you're there the guy left you in the
middle of the ocean you could swim to
the beach right I hope that makes sense
that's what happens with a lot of jobs
you know they're gonna tell you hey man
we need an expert in this this and that
then you realize when you go to the job
you realize that all the things that
they wanted you to do were very basic
you know once in a while this is gonna
be a thing that's gonna take you a while
but that's fine if it takes you a week
two weeks to do it that's fine because
you knocked out all the easy things
before so by the time you get something
that's very difficult and somebody asks
you oh can you do this and you're like
yeah I'm gonna tackle it right you're
gonna build it you're gonna take your
time with it
and you're gonna look online you're
gonna look at resources look at Stack
Overflow ask questions you're gonna
figure it out right but stop thinking
like oh man like I gotta tell them like
I'm a beginner like don't tell nobody
that man don't tell nobody that you're a
beginner that you've never done this
don't don't act like you're nervous like
you're gonna figure it out man
you know you have to also and this is
why I always go back to building
projects you have to build like a real I
think a real application later on today
I'm releasing a video I'm reviewing
somebody's application that they sent me
and I'm like yo this kid is already
ready he's ready for primetime he's
already ready for primetime but he's
legit he created an amazing application
you know I I think he's using nodejs he
using react you know and what's cool
about is that he listened to me say yo
after you told me to start learning
react I learned react and this is what I
built in the application he built it's
amazing I'm releasing the video today so
people could get motivated and
understand the difference between
somebody who really wants it and
somebody who's like I do this as a hobby
right now going back to Ramsay Jordan
stop worrying about am I gonna be able
to do the job if you're able to build an
application in your own house
then you're ready to get a job you're
ready to go work you know if you know
how to deal with data most jobs most
companies they're gonna have you working
with a back-end developer who's gonna
send you data and then you're gonna
display that data for for the front-end
that's a that's like your job making
sure that HTML CSS looks exactly like
the design and getting data from the
backend and then using a framework like
react or angular to actually display
those those things
that's all better and that's about it is
nothing crazy yeah I'm sorry guys I'm
it's freaking this was storm out here in
the East Coast right now it's definitely
a storm right now but it's like a lot of
rain they said they it was gonna snow
and this isn't me it's mad hot like
yesterday was like 50 sine 60 degrees
like it's not gonna snow and look
exactly what I said got your boy out
here platinum finish you know getting
that $21 a month so let me see you what
everybody's saying
okay Albert Lewis says damn I wish I
found this channel a year ago yeah man I
wish it would have been here a year ago
you would have seen the progress of the
channel and it's fine man now you're
here you know stay here you know a lot
of people that I see they come in and
this happened a lot of times to with
other developers that were here who you
know they turn to the dark side let's
just say that right people come in here
when they need a job and they need to
get the skills and they say oh you
haven't gonna come to coding phase comm
I'm gonna come show up I'm gonna watch
the show and it's only temporary right
until they get a job once they get a job
that I owned not sound good I don't need
this right or how some other people they
felt a certain way you know I mean
because I don't I don't promote no GS
that much for people to learn it because
I'm an experienced developer like I'm if
I'm telling you something it's for a
reason I've seen people that because
they want to focus on nodejs and oh this
is the future and this is now I'm like
you don't understand what I'm trying to
explain to you it's not that is not the
future it's just it's not the best
language it's not the best form back in
for you as
at first right so when I tell people hey
don't learn no js' that's your first
back-end experience is because it's just
it's not gonna be a good experience
you're wasting so much time that you're
gonna learn this somewhere else and I've
seen people get pissed off about that I
seen people switch up I've seen people
for again coming here like once they
feel like oh they know like they know
code some people they don't come back
cuz they're like you know they use the
channel for what it is and then don't
show up again or talk behind my
back you gonna say like but that's how
people walk man you know people are like
you know was it that they did to Jesus
day you know they they all hang out with
him they all drink his wine the whole
drink his bread eat well drink his bread
ate his bread but then once they good
that I alright you know we good we don't
need Jesus you get what I'm saying say
man
so it's like you're welcome to the
channel man but you stick around man
there's a lot of stuff that every day I
come in and give gems give you examples
I give you advice I give you a real life
experience right a lot of people don't
do that a lot of people come in and give
you what they like you know if I come in
here talk about the things that I like I
would just talk about Ruby and crystal
Lang and game development that's it but
I come in here and give you exactly what
you need you know not what you like but
what you need if you can understand that
then you're gonna be fine you're gonna
be successful you're gonna get a job
right away you're not gonna have to go
through all the mistakes that I went
through because like when I come in here
I give you advice I tell you some things
because I already did those mistakes the
things that you guys are doing right now
the mistakes that you're going through
like you know the hard work that you're
going through already did it
I'm a self-taught developer I learned
online I learned on udemy like
freaking a bunch of websites mostly on
udemy so it's like I'm just like you
guys the only difference is I have maybe
what five years above you guys but
that's it you know that's not that's not
a big difference you know just a regular
do so it's like when I give him a vice I
hope you take it and at the same time
once you got your job don't disappear
man I hate that I really do hate that
because it's like people come in and
there's like oh they show up every day
they this isn't that once they they
hired at all I said I'm a developer I'm
gone peace it's like no man is like
you're supposed to come here be part of
the community now that you will you have
a job you're supposed to share your
experience with the audience you know
because there's a lot of people here who
would like to know how is your first day
at your job how is your first week your
first year you know you want to share
that with the community so it's like not
only are you here for the opportunity to
getting a job but you want to be here to
also help out the people that are coming
in behind you you don't know say and I
feel like a lot of people don't
understand that in this channel
I feel like they think like this is just
like oh we're doing some YouTube stuff
now like I want this to be way more than
just some YouTube channel it's like this
should be like a community that people I
want people to being here and be like yo
you know Joe helped me out six years ago
you know I'm still on the channel you
know still helping people out and now I
come in are writing on the blog on the
coding face blogging and do tutorials on
coding phase and and share my knowledge
as as a developer that's what I want to
see from people not just like oh I came
in and I said hire thank you thank you
I'll see you later peace we never see
them again you know it was like you
gotta help each other out so come back
let me see Hey Joe I got to learn
backbone Jes do you recommend and
courses
backbone genius on check out coats cool
calm they have a really good backbone
Jas course that's how I learned it
masters the man says I know this will
sound dumb but who pays for web hosting
the client or the developer well you got
to two ways of doing things right like
you could buy you could buy your own VPS
or any and all your own server right and
host all of your clients in that that
server right and you can say hey this is
gonna cost you $100 per year for hosting
right you say it's $100 per year for
hosting and then you buy the domain for
them - you say hey this domain costs $30
so pretty much even though it's $10 and
it costs only $40 for hosting the whole
year you basically make profit by
hosting it yourself
now if the client already has their own
hosting if the client already has the
under main then they paying for it they
in charge of maintaining that and like
let's say a lot of times that's how
clients they lose out on their domains
sometimes they come in the Bayeux domain
they basically do put a credit card a
credit card expires and then next thing
you know that's it they freakin the they
lose their domain now you as a developer
as the digital agency you basically you
be like yo that's not my fault
we told you let us host it for you you
told you told them hey let me buy the
domain for you but you didn't want to do
it so you're responsible for that like
we give you the co if you notice the
code if you lost the website that's on
you some companies they keep backups of
like the the website that that they
built for somebody
me personally I don't I don't keep any
of the
the website that I've built for for
clients cuz sometimes I lose computer's
hard drive crash etc a whole bunch of
stuff happens so I tell people like you
if you want to host it yourself you are
responsible for this website not me like
I'm the developer on creating code for
you
basically building the site for you but
you're responsible for it gotta go to
Phoenix MN Wednesday's man
you talk about that because we like to
that true friend can't disappear after
you got a job I don't know yeah a lot of
people disappear man but that's how it
is it's cool man it's fine I want people
to be here I want people to treat this
as a community that's why I got the
medium website I told you guys if you
have a story that you want to share if
you are a developer if you are somebody
who wants to become a developer you want
to write a story send it to me I want to
build coding phase the community same
way how free code camp has their
community right where people come and
they they drop videos on the website
they come in and they hike all is they
drop videos on the website they drop
tutorials they drop
blog post I want to do it I also want to
do that I'm taking a page out of freako
camp because I think that's the best
part of the community the fact that you
give access to regular people to come in
and share their stories and share their
tutorials and things that helps the
community and that's the whole idea
behind it but a lot of times people you
know they come here and they see this
like oh cool I'm gonna get some advice
once I got a job I'm good and you never
see them again and it's like that's the
only part that sucks cuz it's like bro
this is not just a place where you come
in you got your job and say peace it's
like you supposed to help out to other
people that is behind you you know what
I mean like there's people that are
coming in right now that signing onto
the website just learning HTML CSS you
know just because you learned it already
doesn't mean that now you're above
everybody is like nah man help to other
people that's there you know if you see
somebody's asking a question answer it
you know I'm not supposed to be just the
only person answering questions like if
you know something answer it for
somebody you know help them out you got
some resources that you say hey man this
helped me out to understand react go
ahead
Salone show it to them you know on a
Giri and Prince Joe are you single I
have a girlfriend for you listen man I'm
good man I'm good cheat um
cheap yeah I got a wife man a wife and a
kid an amazing wife man
so let me see your PHP advice is always
spot-on
Joe yes I'm just trying to help people
out I'm trying to help people understand
what they gotta do
ages like it's the only 19 are you
everyone discord Joe yes yes I'll be on
this Court
it's just I can't be on this court 24/7
you know amazing how can I be on this
court it's 24/7 when I'm you know I'm
also coding I'm creating courses I'm
coming in here putting in time to answer
questions and help people out making
videos then from there answering emails
is a lot man that's why I want this site
to become more community-based than just
me because I can only do so much
you got what I'm saying like we need
other Joe's
you know I mean we need other Joe's at
coding fees calm we need another 10
Joe's at coding phase calm meaning I
need you guys to step it up you know you
guys don't have the extra time and you
want to use this as you know you can use
this as a high coalesced as something
that you could show for and show that
you're part of the community but I hate
I'm a you know I'm a regular blog post
I'm a regular author at coding phase
calm I'm a regular at coding phase calm
I create tutorials like you could put
all those things on your portfolio you
can use me as your reference right and I
will give you that reference you know I
mean I'm somebody for recruitable you
know hits me up and I hate do you know
my cool bang what do you think about
this die but I hate listen he's a great
developer helps out a lot in the
community thought I you know I'll
definitely put in that work for you so
it's like this helps everybody out but
there needs to be more Joe's in the
community
the you miss the transition to the back
end part yes you missed it
that's in the beginning you can rewatch
this video later on alright so anyways
guys I already gave you guys half an
hour here I gotta work out your boys
trying to get skinny out here no I'm
just trying to get back in shape man am
