love this I love this too much man
me see I have control room me see if
anybody's online right now yeah I love
this too much man Merry Christmas Merry
Christmas man this is net unique where
we got who we gotta get coding forever
of course we got Avenel a nuke onek over
now Olynyk
el-amin mr. Boston
we got whoelse Kasim Ulta Raya
we got Quan Lopes you know
let's see who else eisah Ibrahim was
Jose's and Dante Harrison's in here man
where is Christmas man
what you guys doing up at this time man
it's past bedtime kids
2:59 in the morning unit in the United
States in New York City 2:59 crazy what
am i doing up yeah man I just wanted to
leave a little video for you guys and
see who was online it just hang out for
a little bit you know I wanted to talk
about a couple of things you know wanted
to look at a couple of things that I had
in here I don't know if maybe I should
leave this to make a full video on it I
don't know let's see let's see
maybe I should share this all right so
this one I wanted to talk about um
basically the state of JavaScript in
2017 I'm gonna talk about this now
yeah man so let me share my screen so
yeah so there's this website state of
JavaScript state of jes calm 2017 slash
whatever you just put 2017 you should be
fine all right
so pretty much what they did was they
did what I wanted to do for YouTube
which was basically serving everybody
all the subscribers in and just go over
things and see what frameworks they want
what you know what libraries they're
using currently you know the whole thing
so they actually went in and an axe a
couple of people's I don't know how many
people actually fill this out but
it seems like they had enough to
actually have some solid data so let's
go over it cool alright so pretty much
and the library is there any the
libraries that people have been using
which this doesn't make sense libraries
results per library okay so this is
about the flavors JavaScript flavors
okay
and all the top free well flavors that
they had over the past year okay so we
have es6 we got plain JavaScript which
is now called es5 typescript
flow Elm close your script reason which
is one that not everybody has heard of
this is actually cool and am I looking
to this I never really heard it of
reason at all you reason JavaScript me
see you try it seems cool it seems like
the type of programming that I like like
my type of style of like programming is
the Ruby slash typescript not typescript
sorry slash Ruby slash Python slash I
guess reason now like this type of
programming I really like it I really
like it like that I'm not a huge fan of
C the C type of programming which is
what we have with JavaScript likes
JavaScript very similar to see it's very
similar to C sharp so it's like that
family of programming I'm not really a
huge fan of and I'm like JavaScript but
at the same time programming wise I like
Ruby I like Python I like that type of
syntax that's my favorite type of syntax
alright so also let's talk about so
what they have here which is interesting
library's results so they asked
everybody and it seems like everybody
uses es6 alright it says I've used it
before and we use it again and that's
why you see that long purple line okay
so they go over every single one
I guess reason nobody has ever heard of
them the most then you have the yellow
one means I've heard of it and I'm not
interested and then that's the light
yellow the regular yellow which will be
like a little darker yellow which is
this means I've heard of it and would
like to learn it okay and then the light
purple is I've used it before and will
not use it again all right so those are
the colors um so basically playing
JavaScript everybody's like oh I've used
it am not using it again for whatever
reason it's like hey dummy you're gonna
have to use JavaScript no matter what
you get what I'm saying like people are
so dumb like why would they even add
this to to this list I guess JavaScript
playing JavaScript is just JavaScript
every single version of this is using
javascript so why is this on the list
makes no sir
it makes no sense that's like one of
those things that was like what well you
know why do you guys even add that so
then they have like salary range where
it tells you like how much money they're
making so one thing that's interesting
reason ends up to be they have seven
percent of them well seven people are
making above two hundred thousand
dollars the people are actually using
reason now a hundred thousand to two
hundred thousand they're using reason
forty two of them are using it so it
seems like whoever uses reason gets paid
more and you know why that is right it's
because pretty much
if you're using something that nobody
else uses right nobody else uses
something like reason when they go out
and try to hire people that I can't man
we need to the experts you know what do
you guys think like of course they're
gonna get paid the most because this
almost nobody uses this thing so when
they do need to hire somebody they're
like man we just need to hire somebody
but everybody that is basically getting
hired that I can't man you gotta pay
it's $200,000 if you want me to use this
reason or you want me to be an expert at
reason you know so that's pretty
interesting okay so you have those are
the different types of JavaScript that's
out there aggregating plain JavaScript
es6 typescript flow and close your
script personally I don't like a flow
I'm not a huge fan of typescript I like
type hinting in JavaScript but I don't
think none of those are the answer
hopefully in the future they come up
with something better
Elm is interesting but I don't think Elm
is going to pick up because Elm is just
how can I put it not only is a
functional programming but it's also
difficult it's complex plus you have to
write so much just to achieve something
that is easy like you know like most
people use it from what I've seen they
they use Elm to create the the the
elements of the dom they create the
onclick event they create everything so
when you look at it and you're like wait
I could do this with HTML why would I
use Elm and the way how Elm does it
which actually takes forever to write
why would you use that right when you
could just use the regular HTML CSS
which we all know you get what I'm
saying so that's like one of those
situations where it's like I don't know
who uses that it's like one of those
technologies one of those languages that
people use it to
cool you know it's like one of those
things that every nerd is like they nerd
out on they're like oh man are you using
Elm I'm using elm and it's like yeah but
there's somebody in other ways that you
can make things easier but it's like nah
man the harder it is the smarter you are
and it's like no it's not dummy like my
client is this thing fast they don't
need me to spend two days on creating an
element you know what I mean all right
so then the next thing that's here let's
see let's go into it this might be a
long video guys I don't know who's gonna
be up at this time watching this but if
you do watch this you're gonna enjoy if
now I will say use this video and what
like listen to it while you're driving
or something or listen to it as a
podcast all right because this might be
a long one okay so then we have here we
have front-end frameworks okay cool all
right so we have the most purple one
which means I've used it before and we
use it again is react nobody here is
going to fight against that like if you
use react and you've used it you're most
likely going to want to use it again
because it's good it's a good framework
it makes it JavaScript clean and it's
just JavaScript you're not learning no
jargons you're not learning no V bind is
or ng that you know what I mean this
DISA net like I don't care about that
you know to me like I already know
JavaScript why do I need to learn a V
buying this or compute that or like or
directives there's like probably I don't
need to learn all of this stuff you get
a lot of saying but whatever you know
each two is on so alright so the next
thing that we have here basically okay
so the one that has the most I've used
it before and we now use it again it's
angular one
so most people that use it then I used
it before I'm not using this period
the one that most people want to learn
that I've heard of it and would like to
learn it all right it would be view Jay
yes all right now let's see what else
a few GS a lot of people want to talk
about it and now basically its popular
but it's popular on the Internet it's
like you'll see so many blog so many
posts you have laravel adding it to like
one of their main front-end frameworks
and the like people don't understand
that if you put something in people's
faces 24/7 of course they're gonna be
like hey I've heard of it maybe I'll
I'll check it out you get what I'm
saying and to me is one of those
situations where it's like I don't want
to be on vgs i just don't see
you know don't see the purpose of it
like you know what I mean like to me and
not to make this long it's just I see
vgs as the baby of angular and the baby
of react okay and then here's vgs it
doesn't have everything that our react
has it doesn't have everything that
angular has but at the same time it's
like hey you don't even have to use
webpack or anything or go p-- or grunt
oh or anything you can literally just
use the library and create your
application and that's that census is
fine and it's I can understand why
people will be intrigued by you and say
hey man maybe I'll check it out because
you know we remember the good old days
of jQuery where all you have to do is
just put a script tag with jQuery and I
say your application work you didn't
have to go in and go through the
headaches of compiling your JavaScript
and doing a whole bunch of you know
what I mean like but what's interesting
if you want to get all the features that
react has you have to go through the
whole process of using WebP acting every
single other thing that's
that's in in a compiler or how you call
it is in a bundler like you have to go
through the whole process anyways so
it's like if I'm gonna have to use
webpack or gob or anything no matter
what why would I use view makes no sense
to me
you get what I'm saying like react has
such a bigger ecosystem and such a
better ecosystem you got react you got
react native you got are react VR that's
like so much cool projects people
creating every single day where every
act that is like why would I use view
just to be part of the you know the cool
hipster in dependency you know like
they're like oh man it's like yeah you
could use react and you know react is
great but you know if you want to be
independent out here if you want to be
one of the guys that you know they used
alternative if you want to be the
alternative guy you gotta use view it's
like nah man if I'm gonna use something
I'm gonna use polymer man like if you
know what I mean like polymer has
something different the new polymer and
this is something I'll make a video
about later on the new polymer is
actually cool man I use polymer the
first one polymer two is actually legit
and they has they have so many cool
stuff in there that make like real
components that it's worth checking out
like they have cool features and cool
things that are new to the front-end
framework community but something like
view I just don't see it there's nothing
new for it besides the point of you
could use it as if it was jQuery with
just a regular script tag but then if
you want all the functionalities and
everything that react has you have to
use a compiler like web pack or you know
gulp or babble whatever all right so
it's like makes no sense but I guess
that's just me man you know it's like
there's one of those situations man so
now what's cool about
this tools mentioned the moves in other
in others cuz you know they put in the
other field there so basically anybody
could come in and say okay I want to add
another framework that I'm interested on
or a framework that I use so it's cool
that a lot of people use pre-act a lot
of people are interesting a lot of
people are interested on of course
jQuery is always gotta be the OG but you
got stuff like Inferno riot there's a
new one that I just heard of like I just
literally heard heard of this thing
called as felt it or something like that
there's some new framework which to me
seems like very view like if there's if
that is a word
it's very view like I just don't know
there's one of situations like I just
don't know about this new frameworks
come you know coming up it's like I like
hyper app you know hyper app is legit
you know 45 people put hi Brad you know
but that's the thing man a lot of times
as I can tell you guys man it's not
about it's not about like you know which
ones are the most popular those are the
best ones it doesn't work like that
you know every tool that's out there
every framework every single library
it's just a tool you know what I mean
it's like it's like you're trying to you
know use a freaking screwdriver for
something that needs a wrench
you get what I'm saying like not
everything's gonna fit there's no
universal tool
everything has its pros and cons the
more experience that you become the more
comfortable you are on taking those
decisions right now when you work at a
company a major company a come major
company is gonna come to you but I came
in oh you come to them and say hey I
want to use view Jaso hey I want to use
for I was a myth drill or I want to use
Raya or is veldt a or Chu or dojo Oh
Marco or even hyper a right you come to
them with that they're gonna look at you
and be like listen man who's behind them
you gotta say my who's behind them a
Google Facebook Amazon who's behind them
and then you're telling us like Oh some
random dude on the internet who created
this and then you know shared it with a
whole bunch of blogs and now people are
sharing in giving it stars and now it's
popular and stranding on github but yeah
nobody is actually behind it and the
company's gonna tell you hey man now we
want to use the tools that already have
been proven to work so here's angular he
is react and here is whatever the telly
tubby framework
you got what I'm saying like you could
use whatever you want on your own
personal time on your own personal
project but you gotta be realistic
certain things out here they're just not
gonna pop off because if you don't have
a very big company behind it the company
you work for they're not comfortable
with switching things over to that
random framework that somebody created
in their basement they're just not
comfortable you're gonna say something
that's the thing so let's move on we got
that was like the front-end frameworks
and once again let me share the screen
then effect let me see what you guys are
are thinking about what you guys think
about about this whole thing
I get for these I was like yeah you
know there's a framework called Batman
GS that's what I'm saying man you go
yeah what I'm saying like people are
coming out with crazy names man a reason
yeah man this a new a new framework or
new language called reason out there
now man Eric man he does what he does
man he he has his own channel he has I
mean it will make sense like for me if I
was to like go after trends like me
talking bad about view actually hurts me
because in reality this community of
developers and community of youtubers
and everybody right you gotta understand
the way how things work you're not
supposed to go against the you know the
herd of zombies you know what I mean
like people be like us view juj yes and
then when you come in and you're like
mmm not really I don't want to use that
automatically you just took like 30 40 %
of people who are watching you or we're
going to watch you and now they they
want to pretty much just hate on you
right I got that all the time but for me
I'm the same a person that I just I have
my own opinions like I don't need to
follow the trend you know what I mean
like I follow what pace me you know what
I mean like I don't see this no jobs for
view Jay as there's not a view Jes
developer job out there there might be
certain parts of the website who are you
know they have a little components here
and there
whose some random developers say hey
let's add a few GS cool you know they
added it but doesn't mean that now the
company is of UJS company it's just now
there's not a few GS job out there you
know but so each is own alright so let
me see oh
share this the thing share the screen
real quick for the people that
watching this and you know in the future
do know this is 3:20 in the morning all
right now
oh let's see so this is about salary now
for the people that are getting paid all
right you gotta take this with a grain
of salt right because you got to
understand this thing goes from the
beginning of like let's say a junior
developer people who are actually
filling out this thing are a junior
developer - like senior developers
people have been around for 10 20 years
right but you must understand that most
of the people who are filling this out
are like junior developers and people
who are just starting all right but one
thing that's interesting about this is
the highest paid as far as average is
let's see
amber amber GS and the reason why amber
Jay yes is you know people get paid the
most at that that certain level is
because amber Jay s is proven to work
you know when you work at major
companies something like amber Jas is
solid like you know this thing works
okay and then you have something like
backbone Jes if you are maintaining
legacy code all right if you're
maintaining legacy code you are going to
get paid a lot of money and if you go
into a company that got created in let's
say twenty eleven right in 2011 backbone
was hot so they created their whole
website and backbone and till this day
the backend front end everything is is
basically done with backbone
somebody has to freak you maintain that
right so now that you've been around for
almost ten years
you're a expert
on backbone so of course you're gonna
get paid the most right now our rally is
another one - already it's one of those
situations where with something like
irelia and polymer most of the people
who are using this - frameworks
these are not your average developers
right and not to bring down any of you
guys or even myself you know these are
not the average people who are actually
using this this is not the average
developers these are more experienced
developers who like to have a framework
that's very clean code that's very
professional has good documentation so
somebody will come in and use something
like polymer or alia so this is why you
see this tool this high and then you see
react and the reason why you start
seeing react or angular angular tool and
view is the last one with an average of
60,000 is because like I said you're
gonna have people who are junior
developers - senior developers now
something like polymer irelia backbone
and ember most of the people using this
here they're going to be mid-level to
senior level developers now this from
here down is gonna be junior developers
- senior levels so you gotta take into
account all the beginners who are
actually getting paid to use this this
frameworks you don't know saying so this
thing is just an average this is not
like the final thing this is an average
of the total of everybody who's here who
actually voted this is the average of
them so it's gonna have people from that
were making $10,000 people who make in
ten thousand thirteen thousand so 30,000
sorry 30,000 to 50,000 you know what I'm
saying so it's like that but this other
ones have more
developers that actually earn more money
using these frameworks okay and usually
is because like I said as you can see
here the developers who are using these
frameworks are actually like seasoned
developers this is not beginners and you
see like react you have a lot of people
who are beginners using them and if you
see the numbers there one to two years
one to two years one to two years and
it's like two to five years but on
backbone most of the people are using is
like you know backbone and earlier it's
like five to ten years ten to twenty
years twenty year plus so in average of
ten years most of the developers who are
using irelia backbone and polymer and
like I said when you are a seasoned
developer you don't follow the trends
you just don't say hey yeah well this is
the trendy thing for today this is what
we need to work on now you work on the
things that actually are proven to work
and have companies behind them that are
maintaining those you know those code
okay now from there you start seeing
like different countries and this and
that one thing that you're gonna see is
reacting angular are usually the most
popular ones all over the world no
matter what except in China I wonder why
so view GS is popular in China
I wonder why yeah so pretty much then
you have things like state management
tools which are REST API is Redux
firebase graph QL Apollo mo backs real a
file core in to be honest I just don't
know why are these things together like
if I'm talking about state management
tools
I wouldn't put REST API graph QL Apollo
really or falco I wouldn't put them
together if I was talking about this I
will say Redux and move X those are the
things that I will put here
why are everything else that's hang here
this one made no sense there's really no
reason to to have graph QL every ducts
in the same place there's really not
because they're not the same thing okay
you see then from there the top mentions
our view ax C this makes sense like why
would you have rest api's and you know
it's like you're talking about state
management tools you're talking about
redux you're talking about mo backs
you're talking about VX you're talking
about flux you're talking about rxjs
it's like whoever made this like this
was done then I know what the hell they
were talking about okay one thing that
you're gonna notice people who are using
Falkor are making the most money for an
average of a hundred and ten thousand
dollars all right now if you don't know
what Falco is do a little search and
it's tool that this thing is popping up
is because a lot of the people that work
on Netflix they use Falkor right and
people who work on Netflix they get paid
a lot of money so you know and a lot of
them actually filled out this this form
but I think Falco is cool but I just
don't see it being used by other people
besides you know people who are actually
working from how you call this from
Netflix besides them I haven't seen a
company anywhere saying hey we use
Falkor like let me look this up man
indeed I like to have crew often
it's like hey man you can't talk out
your ass like a man I'm not trying to
talk on my okay so let's see seeing if
the senior developer okay so it seems
like people who are using this are more
like see like there's like real senior
level developers this is not like Joe
Schmo it's gotta be use of Falkor like
this isn't the norm no so that's why you
see things like that whereas I own the
highest-paid is Falkor and you got real
a you got graph q well but that's not
the norm the norm is things like Redux
firebase rest api those are the norms
those are the things that everybody uses
okay and as you can see once again
Falkor is like nine years plus you know
most people are in a ten to twenty years
they've been using it five to ten years
you see so it's definitely some senior
level developers is not like Johnny from
the black Johnny from the block Johnny
from the black and Johnny from the block
sorry
can't speak at night Johnny from the
block basically picked up Falkor and say
hey let me get a job now buddy it
doesn't work like that
let me see what else then from there you
got back-end frameworks and this is all
about on JavaScript of course all right
but they basically asked people to hey
which ones who you use and what's
interesting for some reason they put key
stone which nobody has heard of feather
Jas nobody has heard of loopback nobody
has heard of sales Jes almost nobody has
heard of
happy almost nobody has heard of then
you got meteor meteor has the most I've
heard of it and I would like to learn it
but it also has the most of I've heard
of it and I'm not interested and the
reason why people just don't like it is
because it's too opinionated it's like
there's too many rules there's too many
ways that meteor dustings and they only
do it their own way it's like one of
those communities where it's like okay
you're a media developer but you guys do
it your own way
even though this is no js' it has
nothing to do with note that's how I
look at it I mean because yesterday's
JavaScript yes it is no yes it is
the same thing you know how you call
it's like MongoDB but at the same time
meteor is totally different than
something like Express and this is why
people are mostly comfortable with you
know like people has said hey I've used
it before and we use it again so no
matter what if you're gonna be doing
anything with the JavaScript in the
backend most likely you're going to be
using Express now something that sucks
I'm surprised that nobody added Adonis
GS and I don't stand what does the
creator for Dynasty yes have to do for
it to become popular because Adonis GS
is very good it's actually very very
good its modern is following the same
ways of Ruby on Rails and Larry Bell so
it has structure and there's a thing
with JavaScript and one of the things
that I'm not in love with like no GS
it's like there's really no structure of
nodejs nodejs is really like the Wild
West and people like that they like to
be in the wild wild west like hey you
have a library tomorrow they upgraded
your whole application
doesn't work you got a rollback there's
so many things I'm not gonna go into too
much into nodejs but me personally when
it comes to web development web
development is something that you
constantly repeat yourself you're
constantly doing the same things over
and over and over again right so we
shouldn't be creating something that or
using something that gives us the
freedom to constantly change it however
we want like let's say right now I like
my project a certain structure like a
folder structure and then you come in
and you look at my project like wait
this project doesn't look right it's
supposed to look like this and then it
just keeps going and keeps going and
that's why people constantly creating
new libraries constantly creating new
frameworks because there's really no
structure to it and for whatever reason
in JavaScript and JavaScript developers
whenever they see somebody who has some
type of structure or they say hey we got
to do follow this conventions people
they lose this they're just like we
can't do do this I don't know like we
don't want to support it period because
javascript is supposed to be this free
fall place where people create libraries
every single day frameworks every single
day you know it's like you create a
freaking website your website look
completely different than my website but
we're writing the same language
what part of the game is that you get
what I'm saying like to me it's just
like man Adonis Jas has structure I feel
like Ruby on Rails laravel like the way
how they build things is just like it
works like if I come in and I give you a
project in laravel and you are a
developer who has used Meribah you know
exactly what everything is that now when
I come in and I give you something and
Express you don't know what is that
like people might put in folders
that you will never put it in and you be
like what a freaking
what is this thing and that's what
happens with JavaScript so like always
Express is gonna be the most popular one
so we can't we can't fight against that
because that's what people like you know
what I mean but I constantly look at him
like man this is kind of ridiculous it's
kind of stupid but then then we start
seeing here's as tools mentioned tools
mention the most in others meaning
people added this to their list all
right so they had a whole bunch of
JavaScript frameworks there and then
people just say you know what eff that
we're gonna add our own frameworks this
door the ones that we're using so people
put in nodejs
which is vanilla nodejs they put in
dotnet rails PHP Java Resta phi django
adonis you see that makes sense you get
what I'm saying like now the list starts
making sense because sometimes you give
people you give people options right and
they have to choose one and then I okay
we have a whole bunch of frameworks who
are all shitty but if we have to pick
one we're gonna pick Express no matter
what right but then you start looking at
here and you're like man you got no GS
this the ones are highlighted in purple
are the one that are actually JavaScript
so they put a no js' Resta phi Adonis
next GS server less socket IO
micro-cracking
I really don't know why graph Q I was
here somebody explained that to me
I guess eight people didn't understand
what was the question you know sometimes
you give people examples and they
somehow add something that has nothing
to do with Tucker the question is a hey
man is like what's your favorite your
favorite bread and somebody comes in and
puts in pairs or somebody comes in and
put apples as I bro we're not talking
about fruits we're talking about bread
what's your favorite type of bread
and somebody comes in and puts apples
like you got what I'm saying like
sometimes we just we got a deal with my
idiots in this world but yeah I would
definitely put in Adonis yes it's just
is a really good framework you know and
that goes to you know to say this to I
said this I think though on the last
time that I did a live video I'm taking
down my node.js course from my website
because I felt I was rushed when I was
building it and compared to my PHP
course there's a huge difference right
so I'm gonna create another
nodejs course from the ground up but
better structured alright and then at
the same time what I'm going to do is
I'm gonna teach a framework with it
which is gonna be a dynasty yes you know
because it's just a nice structure you
know what I mean like to do something
with express I feel like people have
issues people have like a whole bunch of
stuff in is like that's not really the
right way of like learning nodejs but
you need to have structure first and
understand how things work and then from
there start building stuff from scratch
by using Express is like building things
from scratch and it's like there's so
many different libraries out there that
you have to use with Express so it's not
only expressed in nodejs that you're
learning you're also learning a whole
bunch of libraries and it's like there's
a nightmare and there's one of the
reasons why I stopped doing the nodejs
course because I was like man this is a
nightmare like that's my fault for you
know for trying to show you guys to
expressway and it's just it just doesn't
work it to me doesn't work it's just
like it's ridiculous so I want to teach
you guys know GS with a structure and
that's what I'm gonna do
alright so I already took it down from
my website
the nodejs courses just because I'm just
I'm not feeling the the way I did
because one I was rushing to I was just
like I wasn't feeling the the course I
was like man I really don't want to do
this people wanted to do it with express
and I'm like express is not really good
you got my saying so yeah man
Waldo Mack says this isn't a knock
against things like node which is which
i think is great but I don't get why so
many recommended when there are more
jobs in PHP when there are more jobs in
PHP and dinette I don't see companies
abandoning abandoning these things and
you're right the problem is like
everybody wants to jump on the cool
things the new things it's like right
now I could go and create a golden
course but it's not gonna be beneficial
for you you get what I'm saying
like are you gonna get something out of
it you know what I mean
Joe has some of the videos had a small
family reduce some of your older videos
can't see them family which videos let
me know what video I don't even know
which videos you you want to see I have
all my old videos are still there on my
old videos on YouTube work they're still
there man um okay so let's continue with
this so let me see Krista go hang out
alright cool so
we're talking about back-end developers
ok so let's see what's next what's next
with snakes testing I guess the most
used one is mocha and Jasmine that's not
a new just is something new that's
coming out I mean it's been out I
believe it just is part of Facebook but
there's something that's been out
already but a lot of people are using it
I'm not huge on testing I think is
annoying but on certain situations and
certain companies you have to use it no
matter what but I do believe that
testing is freaking annoying I hate it
ok let's see what else then we have CSS
and styling most people use sass let's
see
as you can see second one came in plain
CSS say hey we still use regular CSS and
then you got bootstrap then you got less
that you got CSS in JavaScript which i
think is dumb foundation and you got
stylus and then from there you got post
CSS these are the ones that got added to
the top basically to the other answer
where it says post CSS boomer io
semantic UI materialized CSS modules
material design pure CSS material UI
style components ok
let me see what else there's another
reason build tools okay so you got build
tools for whatever reason I don't know
why build tools has NPM to me NPM is not
part of the build tools at all I don't
know why NPM was added to this I
understand web pack gold browser or five
grunt rolled up and I still understand
why people they haven't heard of roll up
like roll up is legit like I hate using
webpack I'll be honest I hate using
webpack there's so much customization
that you can do on it that it gets
annoying right I love gold because if I
say hey go up I want to use gulps ass
that's a I just added to my pipeline and
that's it it's that simple that easy but
people want to use webpack you know
whatever let's see what I was people
people haven't been using parcel J yes
yet I'm pretty sure next year parson Jes
is gonna be like in the top three for
whatever reason dating add I mean they
add a yarn to this thing and it's like
why is yarn there a yarn is not part of
the build tools ain't dummy like this
has nothing to do with it that's like
coming here it's like what's the
favorite what's your favorite bread and
somebody comes in and says apples hey
come on man it's not the same thing like
let's see what else mobile you got
native apps electron react native so it
seems like everybody that has heard of
react native to like hey I heard of it
and would like to learn it so this goes
to the same thing of react like the
ecosystem of react is huge guys like
once you learn react like the doors are
open to so much other
things like I saw somebody creating a UI
interface with react for a fridge you
know what I'm saying like there's so
many things out there that is using
react that it's not even funny
like sky's the limit
literally okay let me see what else the
highest-paid is react native let's see
years of experience if native script
with nine years I see what else okay
other tools there's like the end of of
the survey so as I hate package managers
number one is yarn number two is NPM
number three is Bauer
let's see what else libraries usage
count
most people use low - low - it's an
amazing library Ram does an amazing
library jquery of course is an amazing
library and immutable GS is an amazing
library
okay text editors vs code and of course
it's gonna be your vs code if you guys
know by now basically vs code works
amazing for Windows users because
Microsoft created it and I guess
Microsoft created Windows so of course
is gonna run amazing on Windows
computers um then you got Adam Adam
works amazing on my computer it works
amazing on every Mac works amazing on
Linux but you know for whatever reason
there's something wrong with Windows
where Windows people say that everyone's
slow for them on Windows I don't know
why I don't know how but hey man
thank God I don't have windows yeah and
you gotta understand one thing to AVS
code if you just care about coding just
like typing that's it and you don't care
about the packages vs code does the job
it's perfect for that right it's fast
and all you care about is just let's see
it you'll study code before you care
about is just loading it that's it look
for me it takes a little while to load
you know but I don't see the benefits
for me now when I use atom there's so
much benefits for it because this like a
million freaking packages like you could
be working on a language that just came
out yesterday and somebody already has a
package for it it is like whatever you
could think of somebody created a
package for it an atom so that's why
Adam to me is number one so yeah I don't
know let me see then you got cold
winters you got es lint you got pretty
here I sing a lot of people use a
prettier now I see features server-side
rendering exactly I agree with this a
hundred percent of the time a lot of you
guys have been focused on this man you
guys have been telling me as a joke can
you do so react course with express and
some server-side rendering and it's like
guys you guys don't even know what the
hell you guys are looking to get into
like server-side rendering is a freaking
mess like it's not worth it at all like
this is I have one of my friends who
currently works at a company and
everything that he does is in react and
also in react in the backend for
server-side rendering and it's like
everything is react and it's like the
whole website is a freaking mess
and is like sometimes people want to use
something that seems cool but it's just
not needed so 48% other people agree
with me on that then I go nice to have
but not important at all it's not
important at all okay
cold splitting cold splitting yes it is
very important it's a major feature
optimistic updates I don't understand
our from what I'm guessing optimistic
updates I'm guessing is updating a app
that's not gonna break on the next
version so it's like where's a backwards
compatibility I'm guessing that's what
they they mean I don't know how module
reloading nice to have but not important
to be honest with you time travel
debugging now I am really important
real-time operations I think there's a
major feature I agree with this because
WebSockets and and having things like
show up automatically for people and and
notifying them like that's that's like
amazing that's like magic for people
like they love that you know it's like
you're you're buying something and then
you automatically see on your screen the
price change is cheaper now like without
you having to refresh the page like
something like that is useful having a
chat or like you know something live or
like sports or whatever and you see the
number change automatically without you
having to refresh the page that makes
sense
dead code elimination definitely agree
with this and this is great because
sometimes like let's say an example you
you import jQuery on your application
right but throughout jQuery there's so
many other things that you just don't
use in jQuery right so when you import
that library
why the hell should you download all 400
kilobytes or 400 whatever 400 kilobytes
of of jQuery and
that of just using 20 kilobytes of just
selecting I don't know it's changing the
CSS for example like that makes sense
you know and it's the same thing with
like react like when you download react
you don't want to use react the whole
library you want to be able to say hey I
want to use this this feature this
function inside of the G on the react
library and that's it that's all I
really want so a lot of people say hey
major feature the people who put in nice
to have but not important they don't
know what the hell they talking about
because that's a major feature like you
need that
let's see progressive enhancements this
thing does is not important you know
progressive web apps people have been
talking about this this whole year and
to be honest with you guys it's just not
important not every single web
application out there needs to be
progressive web application at all like
people need to do their research and
there's like one of the problems with
the internet is like people come in they
see something on the internet I hate you
know freaking Google just release
something new we all got to create it
like this no it's like the same
application that I'm building that's
gonna use you know progressive web apps
or a naive in progressive web app is
really more like a a paradigm it's a way
of using certain features that are being
added to the browser certain features
are being added to JavaScript that you
can use but doesn't mean like that's
like the way every single web
application should be it's just not
everything needs to follow the same
thing and as it goes back to the same
thing that I used to say before with
like reacting naari egg on Ruby on Rails
and Twitter you know people they say oh
my god
Ruby on Rails doesn't work because
Twitter they switched from Ruby on Rails
tool Scala okay do you think that your
website is gonna get to the level of you
know requests per second
of Twitter no like you're building an
online store that maybe 200 people are
gonna be buying at that same time and
you're gonna be like man we got to make
sure we get to scale you know because if
we get to the point where we are at
Twitter's level and it's like bro you're
not gonna get to Twitter's level like
you're building a freaking a furniture
stores you own e-commerce site like like
come on you got what I'm saying like
you're not gonna get to that freaking
level man I stopped worrying about so
much how is this going to scale like
your website's not gonna get to that
point so why are you worrying about it
you know what I'm saying so servers
workers I haven't done enough research
on this so I wouldn't be able to talk
about this offline usage is the same
thing as progressive web apps like if
I'm building something like a website
right and I have a cool application
where let's say for example like this
like there's a web application that
somebody creating that they made into uh
was a HTML CSS javascript extension to
Chrome like this is actually something
that will be useful to use it offline it
makes sense to be offline with this
thing right like if I come here and I'm
using this thing and for whatever reason
I disconnect the Internet this thing
should still work if I come here and say
hey this whole application should still
work but if I'm building a stupid
ecommerce website who cares if the
internet got disconnected it got
disconnected what you want to do you
want to save the order of the the user
and you want to save in in in free game
in the session you know how many items
they still have in a session like once
this disconnect is disconnected like who
gives a I don't want to curse
but who gives a you know what I
mean some yeah man what do I do
line three sublime three is super old
man sublime 3 is like you talking about
a dinosaur like nobody creates packages
for sublime three no more it's super
fast is actually faster than all of them
because it's actually done with native
native code race program natively it's
not just using electron like vs coding
atom they're both using electron to
create this applications but sublime 3
sublime - they're both on natively on on
the computer it's not just like hey
we're using electron to you know show
you this HTML CSS JavaScript app for
your application now it's really
natively so of course it runs so much
better and so much smoother but yeah
right webstorm webstorm is tool is too
heavy man if you ever use webstorm
you you will notice that is slow it's
definitely slow man speaking of
e-commerce how do I get started in the
whole ecommerce thing well to create you
gotta start first of all you gotta
understand how ecommerce websites work
right let's say for example what was it
I found a let me see if I find what was
I think it is the real real car I hate
that
have they freaking to get to this
website you got a freaking sign up no
matter what like this is like a big
no-no automatically but you have to do
it no matter what stupid website so this
website what they do is they sell they
sell different type of luxury brands and
you know Louie Gucci and stuff like that
you know you know this for the ballers
on a budget
alright so you could come in here you
could sign up whatever you you come in
and they got a couple of sales and what
usually happens is that they sell you
stuff that is used basically so they're
all used they're all sold by people that
they were using it and then now that I
came in I want to buy some new gear so
now they sell it for you okay well
what's cool about it is like they keep
it in if it's really good quality like
you know somebody might buy something
and they only wear once right it's not
the same feeling you know cuz when you
go to the Louie store and you go and buy
something from the lowest or it feels
good because you go into the Louis store
but then there's the people who like to
pump fake right so if you like to pump
fake and you're like okay I just want to
wear the clothes I don't care about the
feeling of going into the store then you
go come here and buy some stuff like and
I'll be honest I for a couple of things
like you know like a belt or you know
something like a wallet that's it but
those are things like personally I don't
care about you know what I mean like if
I want to go to the store I could go to
the store but if I'm like yo man this
belt I'm probably gonna lose it no
matter what I'm not gonna pay $700 when
I could pay 350 I'm gonna lose it
anyways you know what I mean it's like
you buy frames you're like okay this
frames cost $1,200 you could pay 600
you're going that's like an item that
you're gonna lose anyway that's how I
look at it you know I mean but whatever
so you got this website so there's a
website right you come in you like this
you
add to the bag when you add to the bag
daggers added to the basically to the
website either by session or it gets
saved in the database it all depends on
how they want to do it right and then
from there every time that you add an
item it gets sent here all of this stuff
gets done by session and session means
every time you land on this website it
keeps track of an idea of your your
computer so it says okay this person
just logged in but if I come in and I'll
do this go to the same website in an
incognito it loses my session it doesn't
know that I already logged in you get on
sane so sometimes people use it or they
do it by session they do it by cookies
or they do it in the database so if you
add an item you add the item to the
database or to the sessions and then
from there you continue you could you
know person signs up put in the shipping
and then from there they add their
payment all right so that's about it now
behind the scenes as far as the
e-commerce every single product is is
it's a different role all right so you
could have a product and then you have
categories and then you could have tags
and for each one you have a relationship
on the database and that's just pretty
simple that's just like how what
development works all right
ecommerce that's how it works all you
have to do is just look at a website
that you you like you like okay I like
to buy from this website and follow it
see the things that happening you know
you click here and you start looking at
the URLs you see okay flash sales so
there's like a list of items that are
being added to this flash on the flash
sale either category a flash sale tag so
that's why I shows up on the top now
this website I like it because it's also
built with Ruby on Rails the whole
website is built on Ruby Oh
but this shows you like you could have a
very successful website and still be
using Ruby on Rails like a lot of people
come to this website like if you go to
let's see similar web.com when you click
the real real you'll see that monthly
they're getting like four million four
million visits which is pretty good so
this website these people they make
millions and millions of dollars and the
whole website is built on Ruby on Rails
alright and this is why I tell you guys
all the time like yo you might think
like PHP Ruby on Rails and all these
other websites websites
programming languages and frameworks are
not popular in like you should have
learned them because somebody tells you
hey learn nodejs hey learn Java hey
learn this
I mean Java is good but whatever fill in
the blanks
tomorrow freaking the Harry Potter
framework comes out with their their own
programming language the Hermione
language you get what I'm saying like
now everybody's like oh we gotta learn
Hermione
Hermione got the best you know the best
piece of code out here right you know so
it's like now people's gonna follow that
but that doesn't mean that all of these
jobs are being deleted from the world
you know what I mean like they still
they're like this websites are still
making money you still gotta get pay a
lot of money to come in and develop for
this type of websites you know what I'm
saying so yeah man
oh my word Joe has Joe has got to
connect but yeah guys went I'm bout to
head out of here
I'm really tired up and I probably got a
wink up in like two three hours when the
baby wakes up and he'd be like Oh daddy
Christmas daddy all right guys so I will
see you guys later man
Merry Christmas we hanged out it was a
cool day
All Right see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
