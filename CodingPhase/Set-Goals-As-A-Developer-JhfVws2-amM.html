people man like you know like take
advantage man you know you live if you
live in the United States man you got
understand if literally on the best
country in the world we have everything
like this is why everybody wants to come
to this country because we literally
have everything we set the standard two
things we set the standard hey this is
the best framework this is the best
programming language this whatever you
know this is the best phone this is the
best computers whatever it is we set the
standard make you know what i mean so
you live in the best word of a best
country in the world so you know set
yourself some goals think about it be
like man what am I gonna do what's the
goal for this year like this heart break
things down like my goals for this
year's hey finish coding face release
that then from there I want to continue
learning more react native and after
that I'm going to create a coding face
app that's gonna be good Pleasant
something cool for everybody that that
comes here so my whole year that's my
goal as far as technical right my second
goal is either buy a house all right buy
a house or just stack up as much money
as I can and just keep it there in a
bank account put as much money as I can
in them you know in betterment so I can
make some some money for my retirement
cuz I'm not trying to be working out
here till I'm 50 years old man I'm 29
years old I'm trying to work till maybe
40 that's a past I'm not trying to work
for anybody i'm not trying to even do
any work at all like i want to enjoy my
life after that you know what i mean so
for you guys you guys gotta have plans
to you guys got to set yourself up in a
way where ya can make some money
in this world like unfortunately the
world runs around with money if you
don't got money in your pocket you're
basically worthless you're not worth
anything out here in the world because
you can't go and buy anything that you
want you can't go in and give yourself
the type of cushion that you need to
enjoy your life like we're only here for
the moment like right now I'm oh I'm on
the parking lot like I don't know
somebody comes this way a car comes
slams I don't even have my seatbelt
that's it I'm gone you know what I mean
it's like what did I do with my life you
know what i mean so that's how i think
about it they know and another thing too
is like trottle as far as like
programming bringing it back to
programming like set yourself goals like
what can you what can you learn this
month what can can you complete this
morphing and achieve and say hey this
month all I want to do is be able to
convert a website from HTML CSS and PHP
on HTML CSS all right next month you
should be like man how can I make this
website more interactive it have a
connected to an API you know I mean I
mean you could do that in a few days but
I know some of you guys got work and you
do a whole bunch of other stuff that you
know it takes time away from you some of
you guys have have you know families and
responsibilities but just take advantage
man have goals man
think about it like this when was the
last time you you gave yourself a
vacation you know like I have a half
people who who I know who are like
literally right now they're like on
vacation and chilling somewhere else in
the world and i'm out here at work and
I'm like man what a my working
you know what I mean like what did I do
wrong like that's how I feel about it
you know like why am I here you know
like already I'm 29 years old already
put in my work I've been working since
16 years old and I think it's about time
for me to just figure out a different
Avenue and that's how I feel right now
I'm just like man I'm not trying to wake
up early in the morning for nobody I'm
not trying to you know do a lot of
that I'm not comfortable with
like one of the reasons why I don't work
in the city like I don't like taking the
trains I don't like being on a train I
don't like to be on a different time you
know on the time of the train so i said
 that imma go somewhere else work
somewhere else where you know I could
drive got a parking lot I'm good got
good benefits but the same time it's
still not enough for me what's enough
for me when I could say hey I'm making
the same amount of money that i will
make doing 40 hours a week but I only do
10 hours a week that's the plan and you
know that's where my goals is that you
know I want you guys to have goals and
set set goals start with small ones man
my goals in the beginning were very very
very small like all I really wanted was
like man I was like all I really want is
to be able to buy any game that i want
for ps4 well ps3 back then that's all I
wanted back then you know me I was like
man I'm good then I was like you know
Walker just buy any game any system okay
I achieved those goals all right then
from there I was like you know what I'm
just I just want to be able to buy any
 name brand that I want cool I
achieved those goals i could buy
whatever the i want to bark or go
to the lowest or and spend whatever
money i work I'm not worried about it
after that I checked on 10 then from
there I say you know what man I want to
be able to go to any dealership and be
able to come out of the car if I want to
I'm at that point now I could go in
there and get whatever the I want
but you know you got to start small and
as far as like programming for me it was
just mostly like man I just want to
learn the back end like for me if I stay
being a front-end developer for a long
time three years man not knowing how to
work with databases not knowing how to
connect to I mean I could connect to the
backend API but I couldn't create it and
myself like I have a lot of ideas of
websites that could work out but all the
websites were static
I don't have no dynamic system in there
and no user authentication is I didn't
have known you know none of the good
stuff that make it a web application
what I mean but yeah so yeah your boy
looking q out here man what happened man
now man this don't even flow for for for
this week we I'm bringing it back
straight 80 style wait you know bringing
this down leaving this on top for a
little bit you know you did no five
o'clock shadow your boys out here man
you know I'm just here to have fun with
you guys man I'm super cool in here too
just like motivate you guys see what the
hell you guys is up to today man so let
me see the missing what subway with the
crew in here okay remember guys we live
right now just in case you're watching
these videos later on oh yeah we live
right now so yeah I got my boy Alex got
John got Matt in here got cyber sound
got Barbara God oh who else is in here
would supply I don't know how to say
your name cyber sound let me see what
else man worried that's what I need
hyperbolic time chamber for calling man
yeah but the problem with that is like
man you still got to spend time in there
man like when you go into hyperbolic
time chamber you still gotta spend a
year in there it just happens that it
goes through in one day you're still
getting old you know what I mean I saw
her
Oh to do like social media accounts for
login but what system you're using Oh
using PHP use laravel man go go learn
there goes my lerigot it already has all
of us set up for you
best website to practice code so let's
make a clone of website I don't know man
you could start with YouTube you could
go and create recreate YouTube you know
it's pretty simple it's just boxes and a
couple of buttons and I think it has
like one user input which is just the
search so you could recreate YouTube
pretty easy man
Stefan reader what's up just chillin the
office working where we ideas connecting
to data sources we know Jas nice Hey Joe
I love your message leo from Brazil a my
people from Brazil you guys don't even
know man i'm half Dominican high
Brazilian which is why I got this little
swag and this little mixture you know I
got a little Brazilian me and on my
father's side my mom's is Dominican i
was born in dominican republic but i

Chuck man I love Brazil all right man
let me see what else how do I find a wet
the relevant mentor
I mean this oh this a whole bunch of
mentors out here man you shoot you guys
this what you guys should do you guys
should figure it out like this
look whoever like let's say if one of
you guys know a lot of JavaScript and
you know somebody here in the chat room
doesn't know a lot of JavaScript help
him up you know what I mean like if
somebody knows PHP and the other one
doesn't know PHP and he has a question
help him out like a mentor doesn't have
to be somebody who's like a super senior
developer like when you go to a boot
camp those guys don't even pay
mind to you there's like 20 20
students so what they do is like pair
programming with like you know
one-on-one basically helping each other
how so you guys could do that too here I
know so that's just how it is Section
six coats of web development boot camp
nice so rubble that day for example yeah
ripple that it is definitely Jay you
could use that one oh you Portuguese to
Barbara oh we in here man OOP check
check good job man I want to go back to
Brazil manner I'm a go visit one of

what you guys is here Joe you have a
high school level her team are you
dissing college I'm a high school
dropout nah man I'm I went to
school I went to high school I went to
college I got an associate's I got a
bachelor's like I'm not ignorant you
know I'm not dumb I just I act ignorant
here by all yeah none of this stuff were
were actually related to I mean I guess
my associates was related to program
it's called programming systems but I
didn't do no programming in it it was
mostly like hi coldest most of you like
networking and stuff like that so that's
what I did it wasn't crazy
I'll he Indonesian Delhi ya know I
actually want to computer science at the
computer science my first year and like
my bachelors but I didn't finish it
because I don't like it both laugh
that's why like this guy's going crazy
there you go what's going to bone say
everything's good how's the family yes
okay
mr. what do you do when you get a
project you don't know yet how to tackle
just break it down in different parts
start with the easy parts first now say
you know what am I get you how much is
your taste southtown 499 I'll both see
you later thank you alright guys so was
really good you already know Manny the
lunch break chronicles right now man
you guys get to see behind the scenes of
what happens in lunch break well
was crazy yesterday I forgot to tell you
guys about this so for whatever reason
nobody knows the password to the servers
in my company so yesterday I had to go
and reset the password for it which I
haven't done in a long time like I have
a degree in like I t work your network
game but I haven't practiced that
sharing years like I don't really do I t
work you know what i mean so i had to
help out and then I was just thinking
about them like man this yeah I just
remember why I left this
like and say there's so much
problems that happen with servers and
you know company that could
go wrong like you know all the
printers got disconnect day of nobody
could connect to the internet we had to
set that up on my oh man
 sucks I'm like I'm a
 developer why am i helping out
people to fix it in the office
you know there's people think like
that's all related to think like Oh your
programmer your developer that's high
tea work i'm like no buddy I t is
different I'm not an IT word to hear the
company Mike I'm helping out cuz I want
to be nice oh yeah man is crazy I
cut PHP cause what I think like like I
told you guys I think that my sequel in
PHP course the one that you got there
that one's already legit for what you're
gonna need out of PHP anything more than
that you don't need anything else like
all other courses is going to teach you
the same they gotta teach you this
what happens when you take a course
every course they're gonna teach you
what a variable is what a number
is what was an integer was a
object what's up whatever was in the
rain they're always going to teach you
the same shape the reason why I chose to
my sequel ps3 course is because it
teaches more my sequel than PHP because
PHP the language itself you don't have
to be a genius to understand it so long
as you know the core concepts that you
using every other language like they're
not going to teach you anything else
besides that you know what I mean like
you go and try to take a course that
it's two hours you know I don't know
tena was a PHP players like they're not
gonna teach your like PHP is
 easy like you're not gonna learn
anything more than that you know she's
 crazy I got ducks and
freaking gooses and it's how you call
the geese ins out here is
crazy living online it that's why I like
it because it's like you're you know
you're in nature man like I was born to
be like somewhere like in Montana you
know what a cowboy hat you're
like on top of a horse or some
 like that's why i was born i wasn't
born to be locked into a city in
and just be oh no i wasn't born for that
 that's why i can't win so I got the
 up but yeah man like I'm always
gonna love coating I enjoy coding I love
it but I use programming for what it is
I usually as a avenue for me to to build
on the things that I want you know like
I sometimes like coding phase I I have
an idea and I want to create it am i
okay I know how to basically build it
and I'm just gonna do it right now when
you know I just use it for what it's
worth like you know
and get me to where I want to get to
make I want to open up a business I
don't know what the business is gonna be
I hope that coating face calm becomes I
could you know build a business model
around it but besides that I also want
to have like a physical business like
you know something like a store or I
don't know or even like a center to
teach kids how to program like i'll be
happy with that you know have kids come
in like after school like a tutoring
program where it's okay they could come
in parents pay I don't know 150-200
dollars a week and we teach them you
know so yeah
I will say this a little bit more demand
for angular but that's going to change
this year but that's because of angular
1 you got to think about it most of
those jobs are maintaining so you have
to maintain oh you know code that was
made three years ago you know so they
need somebody to maintain it
you know I have a legit camera guys like
nine ching said yo your camera's way
better bro good job yeah my camera the
camera that I have is pretty legit man
like right now what I'm shooting with is
it's my my phone in the sink this camera
is also legit on this phone is galaxy
but the problem is the service so the
service is not that great but besides
that I also have a professional camera
like a legit camera and you know it's
just I haven't made it is hard because I
gonna shoot with the legit camera right
with the Panasonic was it panasonic g7
when i shoot with that camera it's
really great but the problem with it is
that i have to go and edit the videos
like here when I come here I just come
talk to you guys and this goes live and
then the video stays on my channel but
with the camera I have to go take it out
the camera take the SD card out the
camera put into my computer save it
there from there put it into Premiere
Pro edit the camera and then upload the
video so my process becomes 2 times as
long or even more because it takes a
half an hour to surrender the video so
you know at least here I get to talk to
you guys more regularly and or faster
you know
webdev career to a mobile Delta Korea
well the good thing about mobile def
career i think is like you don't have to
worry so much about different browsers
like yeah you could worry about
different phones and situations like
that but in a the web man you
got to worry about a lot of man
like people lose connection or
your website's loading slow because
there's too much JavaScript so you have
to use tell Google tag manager um what
else that's like a million situation ran
like goes wrong or like I say I
create something I reacting somebody
might be like oh it doesn't work in my
Safari I'm like oh man like now I gotta
go in there put some poly fills and fix
it up for somebody who's using a
Safari from 2006 like like that you
know so that's the bad thing about what
development also to like a lot of
clients like let's say once you start
freelancing people think that the
is easy they look at websites like wakes
and they look at our square space and
all this and like man but if I go
to week so I go to Squarespace yeah I
could build a website one day and it's
like you idiot like I have to
code this from scratch like you
know what I mean like some people just
don't get it
are you a drug man
now man but I am a drug now man come on
thanks gonna consider iOS career yeah I
mean it's cool iOS is definitely cool if
if you could get into it more power to
you I tried it I find out the industry
to be harder for brand new developers
they really choose people with computer
science over our self taught so it's
like you're at a disadvantage if you
don't have a web development career so
you know what i mean so that's the
that's the issue that i have with it
besides that everything is good it is
fun to make applications you should look
into react native react native is legit
you can make full applications for
native applications just straight on
react native
yeah I mean guys like I wasn't when I
started getting into this thing I
started from zero just like you guys
like the last time I had I had touched
anything about program and was like five
six years before that you know when I
was maybe 19 years old so I got back
into programming at 25 not 24 24 and
then I started learning from there but
pretty much if you if you don't practice
this thing there's no way you're gonna
remember it guys this is not like a
 bike you try to leave
this ship for two years and see what's
going to happen in two years from now
you're gonna be like what like how do
you start this thing like that's what
happens man but yeah let me see what's
good what's good anybody got any
questions man why they require computer
science degree in iOS because it's more
technical it's not like what development
is easier like you could get in but iOS
app you know making iOS apps and java
apps is more to the programming side
meaning like it's more lower level it's
more technical than just web
development what development is just
easy HTML CSS JavaScript and then a
back-end that you connect to and then
you save it to a database now when you
dinner with phone applications you're
dealing with like software engineering
like it's not that simple you know what
I mean people say oh yeah you could
become more iOS app on developer
whatever but man it's not that easy
trust me i know a lot of people who been
trying i know people who went to school
and graduate as computer science and
they they were going to become software
engineers and then at the end ended up
you know still coming back to what
development because you could get money
out here man
yeah you could just be a web back-end
developer you don't need to to deal with
it but with the front end definitely but
yeah guys you already knows the the
 lunch break chronicles man i'm
going back to back inside i got a yellow
sun inside cuz i'm hungry as hell and
i'm tired had a long day yesterday and
then you know i gotta do me Reina I'll
