man coding fees.com your boys backing
out and did it again alright kids we in
here man we live we chillin in a spot we
in the crib right listen guys man this
videos about enjoying good content take
advantage you know what I mean like take
advantage you know there's a lot of
stuff that I put up online and you know
and I don't know I feel like every time
I put in something that's great that I
feel is very beneficial for everybody
maybe like a handful of people take
advantage you know what I mean
but you know I really really appreciate
the people that do because it just it
helps them out man and then they hit me
up with the oh man I'm so glad that you
know you you got to do this and you
helped me out so much you know that
that's my only way to get any you know
any motivation to do this but I wanted
to show you guys like what we got so far
a lot of you guys haven't seen this
videos popping up on my channel you know
and now we're almost almost getting
there we got one more page left and then
we're gonna deploy this website and
there's a lot of details in this site it
might look simple but that's definitely
a lot of details this many lot pops up
we got animations in here we're also
going to deploy this website online you
know we have two portfolio so you can
see this animations on it it got a
couple of pages man it's got the resume
and I go into details of every single
thing that we're building you know now I
don't go in but hey man this is why we
choosing this technique here but it
makes sense
alright it makes sense especially like
you know somebody sent me an email
talking about hey man why do you use
floats in this section and you know you
could do this with Flex boxes or you
could use CSS grid on this and there's a
buddy
listen you gotta do your own research
you know sometimes we think a lot of
times that you know when something new
comes out it means it erases everything
that was before it okay there's reasons
why floats work there's reasons why
using percentages on the whips work
there's reasons why user flex boxes work
using CSS grids work but like if we look
into this this website right in a
situation like this all right what this
image right here is being set up in a
non-traditional way right this whole
section right here because of the way
how the designer made this page it's not
set up as if in a traditional way
meaning like in a traditional way we'll
be like okay the the blue part ends
right here and then everything is inside
of the white area so hey let's do CSS
grids like CSS grids doesn't work here
it doesn't make sense to use it here at
all all right but it does make sense
here okay just because there's something
new doesn't mean that you have to like
use it every single spot ever like you
know in I don't know if you guys
probably saw it what I was talking about
was this area here like this image here
doesn't make sense to have it done with
CSS grids because you're not gonna be
able to control it as good as the way
I'm doing it with
percentages I'm using with percentages
and it just makes sense
okay now resume right here we use CSS
grids this is perfect for CSS grids if
we right-click it you will see there's
the grids okay it makes sense okay
now come back to the portfolio area this
right here makes sense to use CSS grids
okay if we come in here go to project
details project section well yeah
project section as you can see it's
setup with CSS grids okay and then this
over here set up with position:absolute
and there's a reason why I like to do it
like that because it's more flexible for
the animations the flexbox animations
don't it'll really work it don't really
work and that's something that you start
learning as you go as you become more
experienced it's like hey certain
situations you use a certain situation
see don't use it there's a good article
that talks about it just search when to
use flex boxes once you CSS grids you
know just because they came out doesn't
mean that you have to flood your whole
website like setting up layouts with CSS
grids doesn't really make sense unless
you're using it as an inner area where
you're gonna have everything is in a
grid if you're not gonna use a grid then
why are you using CSS grids alright now
let me see who's in the chatroom right
right now man let me see who's in here
let me see who is in here how do I even
watch chatroom let me see
okay be a man so what I was saying is
like people gotta take advantage man you
know yeah no definitely Cal Zimmer says
I've been working on the site going to
use as my portfolio site probably I'll
add my personal touch yes use it yes go
ahead use it use it man that's why it's
there I got the approval from the
designer who created it he basically
said hey man go ahead you guys can use
it you know and it's a great design you
know a great website that we're building
we're gonna launch it and maybe I'll
even use it for my own website my Joe
San Jose Garcia I don't know and I just
put my own spin I haven't set up my Joe
San Jose Garcia right now currently I
even took it down because it was just
old new website coming soon that's what
it says
but yeah so I don't know you know I mean
but it's a great website that we're
building and at the same time you get to
learn so many different like little
tricks that you're not gonna learn it
from you know just watching the most
simplest websites that people build out
there you know what I mean like people
come in and but I hate let's build a
to-do app let's build a blog that looks
like every single blog out there that
looks like a freakin WordPress freaking
or now WordPress a bootstrap theme like
those websites are so easy to do there's
nothing that's challenging you right
like you're not being creative you're
not creating anything that people could
be like oh wow I haven't seen this
before because everything else you have
on the site looks exactly like
every single website that was made with
bootstrap you get what I say like those
things is not gonna impress nobody you
know people are gonna go to your sites
and I don't even know you know what I
mean and that's one of the reasons why I
think it to myself to you know reach out
to all the the designers like all the
websites that we have created for either
my website or any courses like I reach
out to the designers I pay them or we
come into an agreement because I want
you guys to create websites that really
look you know top-notch I don't want you
to come in and create you know something
that looks horrible that number one
you're not gonna be motivated to create
right number two you're not gonna be
challenged right because if you come in
and you have a very simple you know a
very simple layout where it's just like
okay here's the h1 h1 is size 36 pixels
here's a area where you put in the date
that's 12 pixels you come in here and
you got the paragraph in that paragraph
is 16 pixels and that's all you see
throughout the whole website and it's
all squares you know when you see a
design that's all rectangles and squares
99% of the time those websites are done
with bootstrap right and the people who
create it they just like they do it just
to like knock out websites as soon as
possible right but those are not the
websites that's gonna make you shine
those are not the websites that's gonna
make you or make anybody who who is
looking into your portfolio looking at
at your work just you know raise the
eyebrows I'm gonna oh wow they're not
gonna do that they're gonna be like
bootstrap another theme you know what I
mean like you want to create something
that people will be like oh wow its
first thing he's building you know legit
websites websites that have a lot of
details like this this design is simple
and the reason why I chose
to be simple because I want you guys to
be able to you know come in creating but
don't feel overwhelmed if you're a
beginner you can feel overwhelmed after
a while because it's like hey if you
come in and you start creating something
that has too much stuff in the UI
interface right you start looking at it
like oh man is too much work that's
taking forever but even on this website
because it has so many details and I'm
explaining everything and we're also
figuring it out together right so far we
have like why like three and a half
hours of content three and a half hours
of creating the site and somebody might
come in and be like oh man this website
is only four or five pages why take so
long there's details there's details on
everything like everything that we're
doing on the site we're coming in making
sure everything is aligned properly
making sure all the fonts are in the
right places making sure that you know
the typography looks good making sure
that you know the the background the
box-shadow looks good you know those are
things that people miss but when you
work in a company the details matter
a lot right ask the guys from Airbnb how
long they take on one page you know
somebody sent me a message like hey how
long do you think you know he was
creating one of my projects and he was
like man this seems like it's a long
time building this and that's all I'm
like well you got to think about it like
this everything that we are building
together if it takes one hour for me it
will take me 25 minutes because I'm not
explaining it right
I'm just working coding creating things
and that's a knocking it out now if we
is taking you let's say 17 hours right
think about it like this if the price is
taking you 17 hours to create and finish
and build it and you're following an
instructor right
what happens is you got to calculate
like how long does it really take and
how long does it really take you got a
minus the times that the instructor is
talking to you you got a minus the times
that the instructor explaining things to
you so when you mine is that for every
one hour oh like 25 minutes is really
what it takes to developer to create it
all right and then on top of that this
times that you might come in and you
might have a website almost exactly as
the one that you're creating now so what
you do is you come in you copy and paste
the code that you already had there and
now you paste it into the new project so
now you saved yourself all those hours
usually when I work at a company even
when I'm working on stuff on react guys
I don't come in and be like oh I'm gonna
build this from scratch like you know I
come in I already have so many projects
that I've done and I have everything in
my own personal big bucket which I
definitely recommend you guys to have
because github is for public projects
public projects that you don't care
about that you're like okay somebody
else could take this project right but
private projects you keep it on big
bucket okay so that's what I do I have
over I think 66 projects that I have
there from last year right a lot of the
old stuff that I had I just I throw it
away cuz I don't need it but there's 66
solid projects that any moment I can go
in there it's like you know it's like a
DJ a DJ walks around with you know back
in the days way you know crates crates
and crates of carrots of of Records and
then whenever you need that mood you go
into your crate pull it out throw in
that that
like you know what I mean hey you ain't
there so it's the same thing as a
developer like all the things that
you're learning here it's for a reason
everything that I give you guys is for a
reason I don't come in to waste your
time because I hate when I come in and
that's what I'll attend to a way even
though my courses there's courses that I
just don't come in and explain to you
like the basics I'm not gonna come in
and tell you hey guys today we're going
to install NPM today we're gonna install
the web developer starter kit no because
if you're watching this course is
because you already watched the other
videos you already know how to install
the the web developer starter you
already know how to install NPM and note
you already know how to install PHP you
know it's like right now like I finished
uh the Ruby on Rails not the Ruby on
Rails the Ruby course and that's like
the Ruby syntax right now we jumping
onto the Ruby on Rails but on the Ruby
on Rails don't expect me to come in and
be like hey guys this is how you install
Ruby on Rails this is like no I hate
that I hate one I hate when I take a
course and literally four of you know or
even more I think course is where they
come in and you're like oh I'll try to
learn let's say for example I'm trying
to learn or react right or elm I'm
taking a course because you guys know
I'm always taking courses just like you
guys - I'm taking a course on learning
Elm the proper way for this dude that's
like a genius he's he's legit but what I
really loved about him was he didn't
come in and be like hey guys this is how
you start well you know webpack this is
how you install gulp no because if
you're jumping onto this level is
because you already have all all that
information in the back of your mind you
already know how to install all of that
so all he does it says hey guys we're
gonna install no we gonna have no we're
gonna do MP
install elm and that's it and then from
there you start your course like one of
the reasons why was this guy's name Todd
McClay I think Todd McCloud something
like that his quarters for golang I
didn't like it is because he he went in
on stuff that if you're already learning
golang you should not be trying to take
like intro to computer like like there
was stuff there that is that here's a
browser here's how the internet works
like you click on this on this link and
the link shows you this like or like
here's what an exit exit exit is do
here's what a freaking here's what a
bite do you know that computers are ones
and zeros is like bro if I'm taking
golang I'm Way past this why are you
wasting my time for for this stuff you
know like hours and hours of explaining
things that if anybody's taking golang
they already advanced they're not trying
to spend all time on skipping through
like seven hours of beginner stuff you
know and that's my motto on things
that's why I have the timeline tool for
you guys like you have to go through the
whole process
alright you can't skip process you can't
say hey I just the HTML CSS Joe what do
you think should I jump on to should I
jump on to let's say es6 and it's like
wait you haven't even done the
future-proof javascript go over it if
you know it then you know it alright but
there's things there that is beneficial
for you to know alright because by the
time you get to the es6 I'm not
babysitting you you get what I'm saying
like each course it's already expecting
that you already know the previous
things you know what I'm saying so um
like this project that we have here the
one that we building here for it for
YouTube
and on my website on YouTube we reduce
releasing it one video per day and then
on my website is already there if you go
to my website you will see that if you
go to let me see where is it right here
if you go to side project bill a static
site portfolio you will see that order
the videos are already there you get
what I'm saying so it's like if you want
on my website you you will go in and and
do all the work
you gotta saying so but I'm not like
babysitting there's a side project this
is a project where if you already know
HTML CSS and you have some basics of
JavaScript then you should be fine
building this stuff but it's already
expecting that you know those things you
know as Ike that's why people you should
never try to skip steps it might seem
like oh there's a lot of cool stuff
that's out there but don't skip this the
steps like follow along and once you say
hey I know this I understand this then
you move on this thing is not Netflix
this thing is now like oh man you know
somebody told me season three sucks of
Game of Thrones all right I'm gonna jump
to season six No thank you gotta be lost
you get what I'm saying like this is not
Netflix you get what I'm saying so you
gotta also like I said take advantage
there's a lot of stuff that I put here
on YouTube that most people don't even
share most people don't come in and be
honest with you guys
most people who come in and give you
good projects they come in and give you
the most basic things it's so easy like
I'll be looking at a lot of times and
stuff out there I'm like man why are
they repeating the same basic stuff that
everybody everybody else already has on
their channel like why don't other
youtubers and other channels create
stuff that will challenge the viewer and
say hey here's how to create this
something cool something that you can
apply to your job and something that
makes sense
but you know that's why these videos
here man
this hangout today is just about talking
about that man taking advantage man I
hope you guys are all doing this side
project I'll build a static site
portfolio you know if you're beginner
this is a great video for you so you can
understand that you know how things work
and when do you use certain things like
like I said in the beginning when do you
use CSS grids when do you use flex boxes
when do you use you know floats when is
it that you use you know percentages on
your wish like or when is it that you
say of what fraction in CSS grids when
is it that you use those things so yeah
man but like I said man try not to skip
steps
let me see who's in the Hangout right
now man so we got shanti florida auto
ramsey jordan flower two kitties see
Sanada Kyle Zimmer presented in Alaska
we got our s7 I don't know how to say we
got Handy's we got Kelvin Davis my boy
Kelvin Davis is becoming a regular in
here man he's becoming one of the camps
one of the Barbara's one of the
Philippe's you know one of the fintechs
people that's always he is showing love
so I really appreciate it
let me see who else is in here we got
Joseph Torres let me see who else is in
here
we sent in the last schools like yo hey
I'm not hey man I'm nervous man what if
I'm not good enough man you should
always think like it doesn't matter if
you're good enough it's like if you're
already doing it you're doing better
than a lot of people cuz most people
just won't do it
I'm live man I'm live I'm like man what
happened you guys can't see me okay let
me see I'm reading the chat I'm a little
bit late but I'm reading the chat right
now guys so don't mind me okay let me
share the screen cuz I know people that
watch this video later on they'll be
like man I don't even know what the hell
the chat is said so here you go so I'm
reading this okay so is the chat I said
the person job let's see what else
hey Joe when it comes to CSS grids are
responsive design for that matter do you
have a choice of unit of measurement
it's all up to you
you know pixels is cool if you need
something to be precise if you need
something that can go with the flow then
use REMS and then that's it let me see I
started learning Python before I
discover your channel which you have
more Python content but I truly
appreciate the work you do yeah boy
wonder I know man a lot of people been
telling me that a lot of people been
telling me that they were like man this
thing I love you can't say I wish you
had
pipe down cuz Python is hot right now
man Python I'll be honest right then
it's hot right now because a lot of
people want to learn it for my own
business wise like if I was to be like
y'all I just want to make money I would
have already released a Python course
but you know I'm out here trying to help
people out to get jobs that's what
developers man so I was like for Python
there's really not that many jobs as web
developers so I'm trying to help people
out for the web development like I don't
want to go too deep into every single
programming language because it's like
you're not an expert of every single
language so it's like I have to or any
type of branch like you know so for
engineering or freaking applications
developer or mobile app developer like
you have to be as you know a specialist
in something so it's like I said a long
time ago I'm more focus on the web you
know and that's what I'm gonna do but
yeah some point I'm gonna release a
Python course for sure I mean that's
Python is just like Ruby in so many ways
so in reality the people are taking Ruby
that could pretty much just walk right
into Python that's how easy it is so
yeah when you take teaching out of it
you can have a site done in a week or
two depending on a project yep
ghetto for public projects and what is
the name of the technology for private
projects are bit bucket bit bucket big
bucket
babe okay yeah big buck is legit I like
it I also use our source tree for those
of you guys that like using git and what
I have something that is more
professional than you actually doing it
through the command line source tree is
the way to go okay you guys gotta get on
that
because every professional company uses
source tree or they use like stuff like
JIRA so it's like all this stuff is
integrated together you know so startups
the u s-- Trello and all of these stuff
is is part of the same company so if you
use source tree it basically works with
everything
when i class a big bucket it works with
every single one of them
all right let me see what else who else
is in here what other questions or
comments
let me see coding line by line it's not
efficient when you know stuff people
will look dumb typing things like HTML
template 1d they can use ma and having a
tool clicks if you see if you seen them
by side by side not dumb sorry everyone
learns as they go you always that not
know something yeah like I have M it but
a lot of times I don't like to use M it
because then people miss out things like
a lot of people are just beginners and
even if they skip you know when they
skip a step right listen somebody says
oh yeah I understand HTML and CSS right
and they go into another course and then
they see the instructor come in and
start doing stuff on Emmy and it's like
wait what what just happen again you
know what I mean like they'll get lost I
mean I know I would have gotten lost
using ma like back in the days like now
it's because I understand MA I
understand everything about HTML but
when you're beginner you should try to
stay away from M it cuz if you don't
understand the language itself
you're like or how you call it a hyper
markup language of HTML then doing
something like like Emmet could actually
mess you up all right so let me see hey
guys Joe 2018 hey guys the word on that
es6 Jogja goes straight into the ESX he
doesn't do anything more refreshers I'm
a witness yes as it still
85% off listen let's just say I haven't
taken down the code i'ma leave it like
that if you know the code and you know
how to find the code you could go ahead
and use it okay let's say I don't have a
CS degree since I am a dropout from
college I have a portfolio website but
looks like all the companies online have
a degree requirement
why should I do what should you do you
should apply this is the thing that
people don't understand if you have
better quality projects if you have the
skills people will look at your website
and this is why a portfolio is very
important let's say you have a portfolio
like this something clean something with
your image here something with your
resume something that has the social
media accounts and information of course
don't put in your phone number
use a Google phone don't put in your
phone number on here because what
happens is recruiters scrape the whole
internet and then they will start
freaking calling you every five minutes
but use a Google phone and there from
there pretty much you could put it there
if you want to if not just put in your
email just put in your email you don't
even have to put your phone the only
reason I put that is because of the
design but if you have a website like
this it's nice and clean you know it has
everything that you need hassey projects
you know a employer that sees this says
ok I like this person I like what he
does it looks very professional and I'm
gonna you know give him a call and see
what he has right so you go in for the
interview and next thing you know that's
you and there's like three other guys
that went in one guy is is you know so
like you know super old meaning he
probably knows something like Perl or he
knows like I don't know like old-school
Java like he has never updated his
skills he
even know what NPM is right there's guys
like that believe it or not he goes into
the interview so he got one plus because
he got experience now there goes another
another thing a new kid comes in who is
a college student comes in and goes in
for the same interview but that kid all
he has is his computer science degree
he has no projects he's never done the
web his his you know his final projects
his thesis projects have been in C++ and
you know freaking high colas I don't
know C++ and like some old technology
all right or like some crazy algorithm
he created some crazy algorithm to you
know find out the freaking names of of
movie stars or some I don't know some
 like that all right now you come in
you come in with your website like this
you come in with legit projects who you
think is gonna get hired the guy who has
he hasn't updated his skills in like 20
years
right he just got fired from that
company that he used to work on or he
just got are retired and now he's
looking to get the extra job to work
part time or the brand-new student who
just graduated but has no knowledge of
web all he has is his degree but you who
have a whole bunch of projects and have
the skills who you think is gonna get
hired you are so just because it says o
only degrees or get hired right guys
with degrees get hired
that doesn't mean anything I'm being
honest that doesn't mean anything
those are like barriers that people put
in front of you for you to be like oh
I'm so scared to even apply just apply
you're gonna be surprised you're gonna
be very surprised you're gonna realize
that you know what was the point of even
having a degree like people who graduate
once they start working they realize I'm
like what was the point of going to
school for this it like I should have
just one straight from high school and
like made my portfolio and and went hard
you know what I mean but sometimes
having a degree is good for the long
term of things meaning like let's say an
example I myself at some point would
love to teach like a community college a
high school a university teach or web
technologies right but I don't have a
computer science degree so that is a -
alright that's a major - alright but
even at that there's places in their
schools out there that depending on your
experience and what companies you've
worked for you can actually teach in a
college just based on your experience
alright but like I said for situations
like that I'm pretty sure most of you
guys it's not looking to become a you
know a university professor or anything
like that but a computer science degree
is in reality after you start working
you start thinking about it like wait
what was the point you know especially
for what I'm not talking about anything
else all my advices and everything that
I give out here is for the web guys I am
NOT talking about social engineering I'm
not talking about anything else I'm
talking about the web Joe why you hate
Netflix so much now I don't hate Netflix
I like Netflix I just wish I like
Netflix back in the days man Netflix now
sucks because Netflix the problem in
efflux now is that they've made so much
money right then now they saying you
know what we're not gonna come in and
pay for the licenses of of movies that
are old or whatever or any old show that
you might want to watch what we're gonna
do is create
new original content that we own and
that's cool right but then there's so
many City shows that Netflix creates
that it doesn't make sense you know for
every single 13 reasons why whatever for
every show that's like that that's
actually good there's like 25 other BS
shows that Netflix is doing and you're
like why are you guys wasting money on
this if I'm paying money for this
freaking website you might as well give
me the the stuff that I used to have you
know like macklin days you know years
ago they used to have like a lot of good
movies like classic movies this this new
service call to week TV if you have a
smart TV
check this out our TV like I have a
Samsung 4k right i'ma share this with
you guys
show you guys this this website so we'll
be TV or even sign up or to be TV calm
this thing has a whole bunch of movies
that Netflix don't even have it has two
movies that Netflix has plus a whole
bunch of movies that Netflix don't even
have and it's free alright so it's the
only problem the only downside is yes
there's commercials but I rather have
for commercials throughout a two-hour
movie then me sitting down and watching
another BS show on Netflix that's it you
know like there's so many good movies
that were made in the past 100 years to
say hey we're gonna forget about those
great movies that are out there and
let's just focus on the new ones it
doesn't make sense to me
you know so that's why I'm not I've
become like somebody who not that I hate
nothing this is just it's not a good
service no more so I was like I don't
care about that website so you
so much value you deserve more subs
listen man just share my channel man
share it to other peoples man you know
what's cool that I don't know why but
somehow we doing good now you remember
like you know what it was like this the
thing for some reason YouTube love my
content love my channel and they were
giving me a lot of subscribers and a lot
of views in the beginning when I first
when I first came in okay
when I first came in my first month was
amazing my channel was going up
constantly just going up I could have
probably been like right now no line I
got 50,000 subscribers hundred thousand
subscribers but what happened was I
stopped making content that was giving
like really really good value that other
people could take you know I was like
doing content that you know was helping
out the people who were already
subscribed it was also to you know the
fact that I started giving out a lot of
promotion like I started you know
throwing people - you know - Christian -
freaking so Eric - all these other
people so my channel started going down
because in reality I wasn't even
focusing on me I was focusing on like
helping other people out and trying to
help out other channels and this and
that and then I don't know if you guys
remember in July I was like yo what the
hell like eff this man like I'm not
trying to help nobody out that you know
people don't shout me out people don't
you know this this and that
even look Christian always shouts me out
and and he's super cool and stuff but
you know there was a lot of situations
where other people's where I'm like man
I'm giving all my subs on giving all my
views to you guys and I'm constantly
promoting you guys in and instead of me
creating my own content and focusing on
me
and then I say you know what in July I'm
gonna start focusing on me and I started
doing my work and then from there the
past month my foot - it has been just
going up now you're gonna start seeing
this number starts looking crazy you
know the next few months these numbers
is gonna start looking crazy right now
we like at one point four eight
subscribers per month but this thing is
gonna frickin go up man I wouldn't be
surprised that in the next two three
months I'm at like 10,000 subscribers
per month you know like it's already
going up like crazy like we're
constantly getting you know 69 I know
86 79 60 57 like it keeps going up you
know I just want to create content that
gets people value man and and not focus
on the BS not focus on anybody else
because it's like let's be honest
there's really not that much competition
for me out here period you know like
nobody does what I do and yeah so it's
like I know I deserve better not better
subs for more subs then what YouTube has
been throwing to me
but it's okay you know I understand why
they did it is because I started
deviating from my type of content and
you know other people started taking my
content you know I was doing everybody
was doing top tens and then I said you
know what I'm not gonna do top seven so
I'm gonna do top five and then everybody
started doing some spice I started
talking about certain technologies
people started talking about the same
technologies there's like there's no way
to win in YouTube because it's like once
you start doing something and people see
that it works people start doing the
same thing that you do it so that's why
now just I'm focused on creating content
for you guys and making sure that
everybody goes to my website that's my
goal that everybody that sees me on
YouTube goes to my website and even
registers for for the free courses
that's all I care about I don't care
about the register to the paid courses
or anything
is the fact that we get to have a
certain contact with the subscribers
because YouTube does whatever they want
to do you know like you might come in
and you start like deviating from your
type of content the content that made
you popular then they start freaking
taking you out so what I'm doing right
now is just I'm focusing on my content
the type of content that I like the type
of content that you guys like which is
building real websites websites that you
know it's gonna get your jobs and and
giving you advice that's real not just
to be here on YouTube and waste of time
so yeah man again thank you for showing
love man let me see what else who else
is in here man send me questions send me
comments send me whatever you guys want
to tell me man I'm here
let me see the missing KC what up
let me see hey Joe
future courses will you create first of
all I have to finish the one that I'm
doing now which is this one it's
portfolio one it's like it's a free
course everybody that was take a you
guys couple take it on my website is
right there literally right there as you
can see I'm sending it to youtube to for
free
and like I really turning on YouTube is
once one video per day if you go to my
website and your role for the course for
free you pretty much come in and you get
all the videos in one shot and you don't
have to wait until I release it on
YouTube so that's what I'm focusing
right now I'm down to the last page we
did the intro we did the resume with the
portfolio the next page that we're gonna
do is the contact so the contact is a
messy projects personal portfolio
contact looks like this okay
so the contact
like this and yeah got that so that's
gonna be cool um yeah so we building
this thing and then after that what
we're gonna do is we're gonna go over
the whole project and make it responsive
which is the the last section
and then after that the last section
after that is gonna be deploying it so
I'm gonna deploy in Heroku and then I'm
gonna show you how to deploy in a
regular hosting service like Namecheap
or Go Daddy
you know like one of those okay so yeah
this was is gonna be done probably by
tomorrow and there from there we got a
finished Ruby on Rails course and that
was gonna take a while
I don't know what do you guys think
should I I finished already the Ruby
course all right
I finished the Ruby course which is this
learn Ruby back in developer master
course I finished that which is super
long but not long enough it's not like
it's not long enough that you'd be like
oh my god this thing's taking forever
it's like no no I smell like two three
hours of learning Ruby the language and
then I got a do the Ruby on Rails which
is the framework now I don't know if I
should do the Ruby on Rails which is
gonna take like two weeks two weeks to
complete right it means that every
single day for the next two weeks I'm
gonna have to finish that right
or I should just do the michaelis
CSS animations CSS and G SAP animation
course which should take me like three
to four days so I don't know what you
guys think should I finish the Ruby on
Rails course the full framework which is
gonna be a super long if you took the
PHP several Arab oil course you know
that course is long that's how long the
Ruby on Rails is gonna take what do you
guys think
what should I do man should I do that or
I should I just do the animation course
and then do the Ruby on Rails because
the animation course is gonna take like
literally like four days recording every
single for like four days recording for
like five six hours a day so I don't
know a cure for the sounds like you know
Joe jump on that click big titles man
also Joe the guy who keeps saying
pythons whereas that is not doing
cryptocurrency commercials for you to me
I'm like not this guy again
yep then in the ad pocalypse ad
apocalypse
last April effect you also owe money
wise not I mean is annoying isn't I'll
be honest it's really annoying like
let's see let's share this the screen
right so if I come to
YouTube right and I go to the back I go
to the back end of my channel and I go
to video manager okay I come in here you
see this is really annoying that
automatically it's like yo ice limited
or has no ads which means how to make no
money out of that video you know some
people that be like Oh Joe you know it's
like there's a lot of advertising on
some of your videos the reason why I do
that is like let's say I put this here
or something here is for one single one
simple reason that number one you make
all your money from the first two days
of your videos right everything else
after that it's like it goes down unless
your video becomes viral like I don't
know like six months later your video
becomes viral that's the only way that
you will say okay I made some money out
of this but in YouTube if you missed out
the first two days like this video right
here I already missed out the first two
days already so whatever I was gonna
make in that day I'm not making anything
cuz already the you know the whole
family starting people that was gonna
watch it they already watched it so I'm
not gonna make anything out of this
maybe you know in the next month I'll
get like 50 cents I'll get 50 cents from
this video and that's just how it is but
let's see how many I got limber there
are no ads see lemonade
ads as you can see you see that's
annoying that's does that's not annoying
part because it's like a lot of the
videos you know they're getting like
demonetised for no no reason so you know
it's not like I want to be putting
advertising on my videos at all that's
why I rather people just go to my
website and it's like whoever wants to
support the channel they'll support the
channel when they sign up for the
website plus they get all the courses
because it's not just you guys coming in
and taking the courses but you also know
that when you sign up for my website
it's like you're supporting me for
creating all this content and creating
all this stuff because you can't make
any money on YouTube so that's how it is
you know it's like all of these videos
they get limited or no ads on them
period so it's like you have to add a
bunch of a bunch of ads for later on
like two months and that from now to be
equal to anything you ever done say like
can't really make anything out of this
so as far as like I had Apocalypse it
didn't affect me because I was making
the same thing no matter what so you see
it's like I have to come in here and
then I gotta say okay I gotta because
it's already so so much past the first
two days like nobody's gonna watch this
video like this is a video that nobody's
gonna watch I mean people are gonna
watch it but it's not like a viral video
it's not like I have a clickbait title
on it it's like oh it's like top 25
programming languages to watch like this
video is not gonna show up again only
people are gonna watch this is like the
die-hard fans like there's some guys
that hit me up all the time I'd be like
man I'm watching all your old content
man like I love your channel and I'm
like yo man I really appreciate it
because
if it wasn't because of you guys that
are watching my old content like this
channel wouldn't even have anything what
wouldn't make anything from from you to
at all you know what I mean so as far as
I'd epochal is I'm I don't know it never
really met anything because I wasn't
making anything before anyways so you
know what I mean so it doesn't really
matter
we're not Lake but as I'm saying like
for me I feel like I'm doing really good
this year man
I feel like we started the year with a
bang you know I mean like we're doing
really good and life is good right now
you need to start being confident man
yeah man people
some people are man and I don't even
think like I don't even think he's like
there's nothing wrong with him he's
super cool I think it's a cool dude my
problem is like I feel like I don't like
when people do what I'm doing
you gotta say like if I'm doing
something like everything that I've done
it's like it's my own sauce it's like I
come in and I be spending time here in
my room
you know this times that I'm not even
recording anything I'm doing research
I'm finding things out you know like
when I come in and I talk to you guys
about Ruby on Rails is because I spent
hours and hours and hours of doing
research and figuring it out and be like
hey man where's the jobs that you get
what I'm saying like and then for other
people to come in and be like oh ride my
wave and be like oh he does this type of
videos this must work I don't like that
 you know what I mean it's what
whatever color phase does subscribe to
PayPal give you access to your content
yes it does but I have to do it manually
because PayPal doesn't if you do a
subscription with PayPal you have to do
it directly through PayPal it can't be
through a website so the API doesn't let
you do that so what happens is that when
you you do that me and you it's like me
and you become a partners in an
agreement okay so we agreed to say hey
you're gonna pay ten dollars whatever a
month and then what I do is I go to the
website
no matter fact you go to the website
after that and then you register for a
free course and then what I do is I add
the ghetto access pass to your account
but if you do it with a regular credit
card and you do it through teachable it
doesn't automatically I don't have to do
it manually you know some people they
get that mess
missing school like some guy hit me up
the other day like oh man I didn't know
I was supposed I was gonna take no he
said I don't know who's gonna take me a
day to to be able to get access to your
website I'm like bro I'm doing I'm doing
it manually like to be honest with you
guys like out of every 300 people that
sign up one person signs up with PayPal
like it doesn't make sense for me to be
doing it but I do it because I want
people to just come in there's people
that are living in countries that they
don't even have credit cards they don't
even have bank accounts that they could
connect to you know directly to
teachables so PayPal at least opens that
door for them to be able to come in to
the website so yeah man it definitely
gives you access to everything I just
have to do it manually so it's like if
I'm out like I say you signed up right
now it's 11 o'clock at night and I
didn't check my email
till tomorrow and nine o'clock in the
morning that whole time from now to 11
o'clock to 9 o'clock in the morning the
next day like you don't have access to
it cuz I have to do it manually like
I'll probably be sleeping you get what
I'm saying but if you give me the time I
get to put you in people's Oh
Python is where as I'm starting to hate
that guy that was so convincing where
she knows I'll be good now yeah
I don't know if you guys have seen
there's one there's a lady there's a
chick chick that that does the udemy
commercials for I think it's like
marketing let me see if it comes up
fancy marketing phase
Marketing let's see if it pops up
obviously I'm Missy if it pops up
okay this fiber I want to see what pops
up man what
was the freaking mr. advertising last
showing up but I don't know if you guys
seen her she's like some black chick but
man she dick I was watching I was
watching the commercial I was like this
is why like you know in commercials they
don't put like thick women in
commercials because it's like you're
supposed to focus on the product like I
was not focused on the product I was
focused on the thighs I was like yo she
dick like yo whose mama is that I was
just so do you think man that's another
two I created a video if you guys
haven't signed up to the website right
for free you get the uncut uncut version
of a lot of videos right so you go to :
face comm you register
alright I'm gonna show you a little
sunny a little hitting sign a lot of
people haven't noticed this cuz this
isn't added automatically you have to
actually opt in to see this okay so if
you want to see the uncut you know
videos that I haven't released on
YouTube you go to all courses you click
on all courses alright you go all the
way to the bottom
you go to uncut coding face uncut you
enroll in course for free it's not
really a course it's just all my videos
dollar uncut so I talked about egghead
dial how they respond me I talked about
Tai Lopez now an expert of Bitcoin like
I had a video about he lied the computer
guy I took it down cuz no matter if I
got even get to upload it and I deleted
for my computer so I messed up on that
one but it was a really good video and
it was going to my uncut uncut section
of of the website so if you guys have a
register go register you are going to
enjoy it
yeah man Tai Lopez is now a free game
its lot that says his lot now you should
be going
you should be good I see you're rolling
course continue to course and there you
go it's there that was like the other
day cuz what happened was you have to
put in a price for you to me not you to
me for teachable to let you show the
videos you have to put in a price so I
forgot to put it in for free
I thought automatically it may on the
website free not the website the
freaking the videos free but it doesn't
work like that you have to manually put
in it for free so now you guys should be
good I know a lot of people's and leave
your comments I want to know what you
guys think man I wouldn't know what you
guys think make sure you leave your
comments if you sign up for the uncut
version of coding phase make sure you
leave the comments man I want to know
what the hell you guys think about the
subject that I'm talking about
let me see where is it yes so that
really pisses me off like Tai Lopez is
like Tai Lopez doesn't know ish about
freaking Bitcoin like what does Tai loop
is know about Bitcoin you get what I'm
saying like this guy did not know
anything about it he just saw like you
know bitcoin is hot right now we gotta
talk about it it's like and now he's
he's charging people mad money for
courses that is like bro like the
professionals guys who have been dealing
with Bitcoin they charge I think it's
like $40 for a course and like they
explained it really really well and Tai
Lopez is out here trying to charge
people a thousand dollars come meet me
at this seminar for five thousand
dollars in LA like bro like you're not
even an expert on this thing man that
was like my whole thing with other
people here like you know like people
charging crazy numbers like come on man
my people are here trying to better
themselves they're not trying to get
coming here make you a millionaire you
know what I'm saying like I hate when I
bump into people like that
yeah man it's crazy like one thing that
ty Lopez is good at he knows how to
market things he knows how to you know
pray under people that don't know
anything like it's very easy to do that
you come in and tell people hey guys
it's like if I come in and tell you guys
like hey guys you know hey guys come on
sign up to my website I'm gonna teach
you how to get a hundred dollar
freelance jobs like you are junior
developer man you a junior developer
like ain't nobody trying to pay you $100
per hour like I'm being honest with
people like nobody's gonna pay you $100
an hour unless you lie to the person and
you finesse them yeah you could be a
finesse King you know and be like oh
yeah I worked at Google where I worked
at this and put that on your Elance
freaking and your Alliance profile or
something like that but man people is
not trying to pay that much man and
that's the truth all right so me I
rather just be honest instead of praying
all those people who are weak weak
minded you know what I mean like people
in Xiamen that they're weak minded but
there is such a desperate need of
changing their lives and being able to
be comfortable that when you come in and
you tell them hey man you could get this
for you know in two weeks you can start
earning $100 an hour as I bro like who
are you lying to you get what I'm saying
but people do that
yeah man wear a tie Lobos needs to buy a
questionmark suit straight up Dan what's
this guy's name there's another guy
there's another guy let me see if I find
them something car
don't card down or crack card down or
something like that yeah this guy's man
I'm sorry guys but whoever's listening
to any of these two guys you just need a
hug in your life man you need a hug
garyvee or grant cardone if you if you
think that these guys have the answers
of things all you need is a hug man like
straight up like you need a hug you need
somebody to give you a hug and tell you
man everything's gonna be ok you don't
need to throw money at guys who are
multi millionaires because their jobs is
to prey on the people that need help
like there was a video that garyvee day
like I like how Gary Vee talks because
he he's like me he's like from New York
he's like the Tri stat me he's from
Jersey but he's like for the tri-state
and like you know he curses he said he
don't care but at the same time Gary Vee
comes from this lineage of people that
come under Tony Robbins and all those
peoples as like if you really wanted to
help people you help them right but you
don't do what a lot of these guys doing
they come in and be like hey man you
guys should definitely watch that Tony
Robbins video on Netflix where he comes
in and people have issues or any people
have problems in their lives and he
comes in and tells them the things
that's so obvious he comes in like some
girls like disrespectful to the mom
the the Tony Robbins comes in and tells
her you need to you need to put on your
pants on and take control of your life
in your house and the lady's like oh my
god you so right Tony Robbins and it's
like I could have told you that your
best friend could have told you hey man
you need to control your daughter don't
let your daughter talk to you like that
right a freaking guy a guy who this was
crazy they freaking a guy who wasn't
confident to have sex with his
girlfriend goes to the show and then
Tony Robbins goes in and picks him and
then he goes like today you're gonna be
a lion today you're gonna go back to
your room and you're gonna be a lion the
guy goes the next day they follow up on
the guy and the girlfriend they're like
the girls like she looked worn down like
the guys don't work her out he just say
yo what that mouth-to-mouth
hey like she came out like this like
sweaty were mascara aren't like like
running down her face and she say oh my
god he was a lying last night like I
could have came in and told I do like
yeah bro all you need to do is be
confident stop worrying about if you you
know if your penis is bigger your penis
is small don't worry about that put in
that work man you know put in that work
get comfortable you know what I mean and
it's the same thing with Gary Vee and
and what's this guy's name Grant Cardone
Grant Cardone is like a
multi-millionaire with high goal is with
real estate that at some point there's
only so much that you can grow right so
it's like okay this only so much I can
do with real estate but what if now that
I'm a millionaire I tell people I have
the answers to become millionaires and
then
charge them you know $500 per head to
come in to a show of like two three
hours and then I come down and create
books who I don't even write like you
know I could come out like his name in
hand I but I could come out and tell
people like grill inspirational stories
and pay somebody else to write the book
and that's what all this guy's do and
but the point of about it is that these
guys they they're not really there to
help you they're really there to somehow
get into your psyche and then going to
the thing that you're most vulnerable
about and then pick at it and be like
hey I could find a solution for this
thing if you only sign up for three
payments of $2,000 like this person has
enough problems in their lives but yet
you want to take that $2,000 which is in
a payment of 6,000 all right so 6000 in
the long run but you just want to take
it's like you know what you don't even
have to pay me the $6,000 right now I
got you pay me too and next one if you
pay me too
in the next month you pay me too and
that's it you come in for three hours
you watch me speak you watch me tell
people this is what's wrong with you
things that they already know things
that people have been telling them their
whole freakin lives but because this
person who is successful who has money
they think that person has two answers
you know like Kanye West said you know
that's like that interview he did to the
wave where this guy was swayed he's like
yo you ain't got the answers wait like
you don't know like people want to
give you advice on things
on things that they don't even have the
answers of you know what I mean and
these guys are the pros these guys you
know you start looking at Gary Vee Grant
Cardone or Tony Robbins like these guys
are the professionals you know those
guys are the professionals you got the
other you know a lot of programmers out
here I'm not gonna say no names but
they're trying to do what they did you
know I was like they try to carve their
own way into that meat I don't even want
to be close to those people to be honest
with you
the molding you start seeing me in that
world you gotta be like yo Joe he you
know the money got to his head
automatically because that's what
happens a lot of these guys they come in
they become successful it's like right
now I can come in it let's say who knows
five years from now coding phase calm
you know I have my website legit then
from there I have other businesses and
then from there I have other stuff that
I invested on and I'll become a
multi-millionaire and next thing you
know is like I hit a plateau of like how
much money I can earn per year and
there's like you know what let's come to
the people let's make the people paid
for me to elevate to the next level of
multi millionaires like I hate that man
and I'm saying like people needs to give
out free content or people need to give
out help out people for free all the
time but don't reap you know what I mean
like that's the thing don't rape like
that should be like a thing like you
know I was like help me out you know try
to guy me everybody needs a little bit
of help well don't rape me at the same
time you know what I mean like a lot of
these people don't even have anything
you guys
like these people were it's true man
ramsey joining is a coding phase after
darkman word yeah yeah nah that's what
I'm saying man I'm reading the comments
right now I'm reading the comments let's
share the comments this is me just
chillin that's how you know imagine me
and you and a couple of people and just
on a couch just laying down like lay
back just talking about conversations
that's what we're doing right now yeah I
think look I think Gary Vee Gary Vee he
does what he does think he's a he's a
good dude he could be a good dude you
know what I mean
be a good doing or but my problem is
when they rape you know what I mean like
why are people paying you know that was
a thing where a video that's in Gary be
going like you know what if you hit me
up right now you know if you ready to
invest you know twenty thousand dollars
you will have a meeting with me if we're
you know we will have one call like
you're telling me I will pay $20,000 to
have a call with Gary Vee like people
that's the problem is it's not just
people who who are poor it's not just
people who who are not confident there's
people who got a lot of money out there
who are just not confident like there's
people who have businesses and they're
doing good but because they think like
they should be doing way better and they
feel uncomfortable like man I don't know
how to bring my business to the next
level
Gary Vee goes and tells the person hey
man you know invest invest into Facebook
Ads get your website up get your brand
up and the person who's like oh my god I
was the best twenty thousand dollars I
spent and it's like people have been
telling you that your whole life like
why do you need Gary Vee to tell you
that
kind of the yo you need to put you got
that pants I got my pants on now but
it's true that's how the people be like
yo you gotta put your goddamn pants on
it and freakin take care that your
daughter you're the you're the mom of
the house and it's like her friends been
telling her that her her sister been
telling her that her frickin cousin been
telling her that
and it's like no she needed Tony Robbins
to tell her that Kelvin Davis says I
need advice like don't put your business
out there because folks be hain that's
real now that not that work hard BS
which is true
people be like just work hard man one
day it's like nah I don't want to hear
that story of one day or get there nah
man just be honest with me and tell me
the truth
yo dude there's a video with John some
is talking about I think it was
something like like I have a smoke I
have a small penis and what do I do John
some is like I love John Simon's what
John Thomas is the last person I'm gonna
be calling for that that question like
simple programmer I have I have a
one-inch penis what should I do with
that like like where do you find people
like that you know what I'm saying like
what that moms do my thing it's true
though that that's I swear to god that's
what the guy said on I mean he didn't
say like that but he basically showed he
came back where her a freaking mascara
you know going running down her face her
hair all messed up
like that's what happened the night
before and then she comes back like oh
my god he's a lion like she should have
been ashamed to even come up on that
documentary I see those
trash the Surfside way
that's why I think the Garvey's are the
world like you know I just I don't it's
not like I want to talk bad about those
guys I just don't like their business
model like this things that people can
do to help people out like I know this
subjects and things that I come up here
on YouTube and I I share my stories and
share my situations with you guys and
you a lot of you guys be like man that
reminds me of my situation and that
helps you guys out right it helps you
guys get out of that or helps you guys
at least think positive that if I made
it you guys can make it right but the
problem is when the business model is
preying upon that when you have you know
it's like whatever youtuber out there I
don't know their name
freaking some guy put in on the comments
it's like man you know I don't even have
a I don't even have a laptop
I don't even have a laptop but I'm
taking a loan to take your course and
then I'm gonna buy the laptop you get
what I'm saying like peeve people come
up to me and tell me stories and stuff
like that and a lot of times if I can I
just be like here take it
here take a web developer boot camp
here's the code I pay for the ten
dollars go take it a lot of times my
first three months of my whole YouTube
time here I was just giving out about
like $600 a month of courses you get on
the same
but when the motto is is like hey man
our business model is to prey upon those
people and be like hey man you know what
I know you you you got money somewhere
it's like now he is like you you robbing
people's like you know that the dude
just came out of like his his house he's
like yo he matter of fact he just came
out of work with his check on his pocket
and debo comes around the corner and
just be like yo run your pockets son I
know you got some money in there I
smelled it let me get that money you
only get paid
you only get pay 400 you only get paid
400 it's 500 600
you know what I'll do a little payment
plan for you this whole month you don't
get to eat give me 400 next one you give
me 200 at least you get to eat again
next month but let me get that debo
style debo on the bike you know what I
mean like you know so a lot of people
get the picture you know I was like
there's what a lot of people doing man
hey people show up he was
I'll hear like this man like it's crazy
start seeing this dude it's a lot of
people you know Gary V Grant Cardone
freaking Tony Robbins these guys are
showing up just like this it's like oh
you just got paid let me see that
oh you gotta eat don't worry you eat the
next week oh you got a pay right nah you
can hold that down you out here you out
here like that you was about to buy some
Jordans let me get that first though you
wanted Jordans you wanna you really you
don't need no Jordans out here okay let
me get that money I got you I got a
course for you I got a course for you
that you give me that money in another
payment of three months for the next
three months you give me for the next
three months you give me a payment of
$2,000 each month you get to eat you get
to eat in six months from that it's
crazy but that's how they be like that's
my
the problem with it with it it's not the
the fact to help we all are here to help
my problem is when you just come in
Deebo style and just be like yo I know
you're trying to change your life out
here I know you're trying to get some
money you only get paid what
let me get 75% of your whole paycheck
don't worry you get paid in two weeks
you make that money back you make $100
an hour in a month I don't know you get
what I'm saying like that's why I just
be like yo man people's is crazy man I
do a show up do a show up over there
like man like dude show up to your house
like y'all I know you got paid I know
you got paid I smell that from here you
just got paid listen this is what I got
for you you wanna join us
oh you wanna Jordans don't worry about
that listen sketches has gotta sketches
and only we got a special ring let me
get the rest and I'll give you and just
enough for you to go get some sketches
and some Oh Navy like that's how it is
yeah what I'm saying
greetings from China Sally what up I'm
just saying am I wrong don't like but
yeah these things that you you listen to
Gary B sometimes this is the problem
like people people need the motivation
which it sucks you know cuz motivation
is something that expires right you go
to one of this meetings or you go and
watch a video or even one of you guys
yeah keep asking me Joe was the
motivation to continue being a
self-taught developer in it and getting
it done the motivation should be as I
came in you ain't got in your life
right now like that's what I thought
about it that was my motivation if you
have things in your life and you feel
like oh like you're good and you're like
oh I'm good like I'm doing this for like
a hobby then this is not the place for
you because this thing is hard and you
gotta put in a lot of hours you know
it's these things that you know this
time something like your I could be
chillin right now I could be hanging out
right now I could be playing ps4
straight up I could be playing ps4
hanging out well because I love disco
 I'm here alright but you know
people come in and they they use people
you two were to use professional like
Gary Vee and Grant Cardone and they use
them as to be like they battery recharge
you should never have somebody else be
the person who charges you up you need
to charge yourself up right those days
that you'd be like oh man I haven't
called for two days I need to get back
in front of that computer and work
something out create something you
shouldn't be expecting that's like oh
man Joe then and drop a video today no
motivational speak
you know like no motivational talk
didn't say nothing that motivated me you
should never be waiting on that you
should be like yo I need to get my
done you know what I'm saying like you
need to get your work done but that's
what happens with motivation and all
these peoples they take advantage of
that because they know motivation and
inspiration expires so this is a
exploration limits way like I could be
super hyped right now like I could go to
a meet-up and be super hype and then by
the time I get home I'm like oh man I'm
tired my feet hurt you know what I'm not
gonna I'm a cold tomorrow then tomorrow
come back from work I don't want to do
it then the next day is the same thing
so my inspiration faded away from coming
from the meet up to my house how do you
keep yourself motivated you basically
say hey do I have a choice all of the
guys that have become something in this
world and have become millionaires that
have become famous and all this stuff
they are against the wall period
they're basically against the wall and
they say you know what I don't have
nothing I have to get something it
doesn't matter if it's coding it doesn't
matter if it's working out doesn't
matter if it's being healthy doesn't
matter what it is it's like you have to
be against the war for you to be able to
push yourself forward okay
because going back there's nothing back
you get honest things like when you
against the wall that's a you hit the
wall there's no way to step back you
know the only way that you're going is
forward so that's how it is with with
this coding thing man you can't be
coming in here and thinking like oh man
this thing is hot it's a hobby now you
got a thing in your head I don't have
nothing
I don't have nothing else in my life
what you gonna do you're gonna be
working in the same BS job forever
you work at a factory in the day they
had a freaking fire
are you from that factory what's gonna
happen now you're gonna go to another
factory earn less than what you was
earning at that factory because you've
been in that factory for ten years and
the new factory were you going to work
at doesn't want to pay you for your
experience for ten years that's just how
it is man
