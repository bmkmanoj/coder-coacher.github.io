at it again coding phase calm your boys
back and out and did it again guys
listen today's topic is is crystal the
most promising programming language of
2018
it's dislike the language that's gonna
take over is this the language that you
should be looking at alright now what I
was gonna say to you guys is it's very
fast I think out of all the programming
languages is the fastest one of course
besides CES C++ cuz they're pretty lower
level they're very close to the machine
code but besides that crystal is right
there
like literally leading the pack it's
faster than go people be like oh go is
the fastest is like not really buddy you
gotta start looking at this
so yeah crystal is where is that guys
now who is crystal for crystal is it is
not for the person who's trying to get a
job right now at the moment right if you
are developing you're like oh man I want
to get a job right now and I wanna you
know it's my first time being a
developer like you can look at it you
could try it out you can test it out
play around with it right but right now
currently there's not that many
companies using crystal right because
it's still on beta once it touches 1.0
then that's it everybody's gonna be okay
now is stable the API is gonna stay the
same nothing's gonna be having no
breaking changes so people are gonna
stick with it right now like I said
there's a lot of people talking about
golang a lot of people talk about no GS
there's a lot of people talking about
Russ elixir Python right but this is the
fastest language out there okay
there's no debate around it this is the
fastest language out there
and we're gonna keep on talking about
this okay so let's keep on scrolling
down this is actually an article that
Sam Johnson basically wrote I'm going to
add this to my my website I'm also gonna
add it to the description
into before you guys to actually watch
and and read okay so let's keep on
moving right so basically is as fast to
see what slick like Ruby so if you come
from the background of Ruby and you come
from the background or Python because
Python and Ruby are very similar in a
lot of ways so if you're coming from
those backgrounds this is gonna be like
icing on a cake because it's just super
fast all right so let's continue with
this so performance is legit uses the
LLVM framework basically goes toe-to-toe
with C++ and Russ any day of the week
basically I'm gonna show you guys
there's a link of which one is the
fastest alright and this is that I
believe is about fastest what frameworks
okay
so they tested out all the different web
frameworks that are out there and just
to see which one is the fastest all
right so the fastest one is actually
cold one Cole router CR so router
crystal okay
this thing is extremely fast okay now
let me see if I could show you a couple
of other ones you got router crystal
then the second one is rust third one is
nickel for foreigners iron then the
fifth one is crystal again which is race
they're from they you got Python jabarut
on fast HTTP router free go so there's a
couple of them over here now you can see
expresses all the way at the bottom like
they test out the speed to test out how
long it takes for the request to come
back in and and pretty much is like when
you do the test and you see it you're
like okay crystal
and it just blows it out the box
automatically alright so for those
people oh no they're super fast is like
is alright it's coming up in this world
but it's alright it's not really that
fast when you go and you put it against
go or you put it against crystal
and like crystal is already beating
golang so doctor that should tell you
everything right so this is a list that
has like all the fastest web frameworks
out there and in reality you might think
like who is this for like you know a
fast web framework when I could do
everything with laravel Larry Bell is
actually pretty slow but like let's say
in a situation where you need to serve a
lot of different requests right so let's
say an example you have a million phones
out there right connected to so this one
server and it needs to just constantly
give out data back and forth back and
forth back and forth right you need a
server that's actually going to be super
fast to be able to handle all those
requests okay now basically router
crystal is very simple it's a small low
application little framework I
definitely check it out all right I'm
gonna maybe do like got the story on
that you're on YouTube so people who
actually see how it works you just have
like a cool introduction to like Crystal
Wayne a cool introduction to the
beginning stages of you know router
crystal okay
now let's keep on moving so the syntax
is very similar to love Ruby if you know
Ruby you pretty much know no crystal the
only difference is that it has static
typing and for some people that might be
a problem but for some people that might
be the best thing that can happen to any
programming language all right so yeah
there's also fibers you know you come in
and you might think like hey man you
didn't work Kobach he'll JavaScript it's
like you're not dealing with none of
that right one thing that you see
constantly in JavaScript it's like no no
like those type of errors you're not
gonna have in crystal because there's a
compiled language so before it even
compiles it tells you hey man it's just
not gonna work you got to fix this thing
right so that's one of the best things
about Crystal Lake you're not having
those a little
all the mistakes that you see in
JavaScript they're not in crystal Lang
at all you know so that's pretty cool it
also has shards so shards are pretty
similar to no packages and they're very
similar to Ruby gems so it's like its
own package package management system so
it's pretty legit pretty much it says
Mary otic rise in popularity so yeah
right now
crystal Lang is going up the ranks man
like it's gonna get to at least in the
top five you know in the next year and
that's for sure I can guarantee you like
it's definitely gonna be in the top five
all it's really missing right now is
just one major company to say hey you
know our website used to be built in
Ruby on Rails hey now we're using amber
the moment somebody says that any
company it's a wrap like this language
is gonna blow up even more than what it
is right now okay
it is also cross-platform right now is
focus on Linux and OS X there's ways to
really do it with Windows boy is like
you're pretty much hacking the system to
do it pretty soon they're gonna release
a Windows version they're gonna have
more support for Windows users so it's
alright guys it's coming for you guys
right now like I said you could use it
but there's really not support for it
but in the next few weeks next few
months it's gonna be 100% support it
with Windows ok now the next thing that
you're gonna see it also is as far as
what frameworks I talked about router so
CR which is router crystal well that's a
pretty small little framework for it do
HTTP request now you also have amber
which is like the Ruby on Rails of
crystal Lang it's like a full stack
framework it has everything that you
need and it's pretty legit there from
day you have something like camel
remember when I started doing my my
rocky stack it was react over crystal
and camo so pretty much this is camera
right that's what was behind the scene
of my rocky stack now crystals not
perfect but you got to understand what
language out there is perfect there's
really no perfect language so let's be
honest okay now as far as the
limitations and the little problems here
in there that is having right now is
pretty much the window support right so
currently you could hack the system but
it's not 100% supported so it's like
you're hacking to basically get the
language working on your computer all
right now there's no parallelism okay
so unless you like something like C and
you're like oh I need parallelism in my
you know my freaking language and this
and am it's like hey man if you're doing
all of that you might as well stick with
C right but as far as concurrency fibers
definitely support that basically it's
at the same level as golang that's how I
measure it I will say hey is head to
head with golang but it's actually
faster than goal a let me see there's
still some breaking changes you know
once in a while they might do like a
point one or point to upgrade that might
break your code but what's cool about
the community it's the fact that people
are there to help you and only that that
they tell you exactly like whenever
something is about to break the blade
hey we changed this what used to be
let's say for example that length that
le and GT H now is actually that L Eng
right let's say in example something
like that right so they renamed
something maybe they'll tell you hey
just go in there and rename it that's it
all right so you were always gonna be on
top of it in usually I've had a couple
of calls that that basically broke and
then I looked at the website as I oh
sure
all I have to do is just change this and
everything was good it was so easy all I
did was just command F and like command
shift F a like replace all with with the
new syntax that's it it's pretty simple
so yeah that's pretty much it guys
what do I think about crystal where do I
see going in the next year I think this
thing is about to blow up man this is
like one of those cool technologies cool
programming languages cool frameworks
cool whatever you want to call it right
whatever is out there it's a programming
language but it's like you know how a
new framework just popping up and it's
like somehow is blowing up over here and
you know people are talking about it
like this is the next big thing man and
just remember I was one of the first
people that actually told you about this
because you know once I I come out and
be like hey man crystal Lang is popping
peoples gonna be like oh my god
crystalline is the new language and you
start seeing a whole bunch of different
medium pose a whole bunch of youtubers
you see a whole bunch of different blogs
everybody's gonna be on it but all it
takes is just one company one
application to really become popular
using a programming language and then
the whole industry shifts okay I'm
telling you guys this language right
here is the next big thing trust me now
for you guys you should guys should
definitely just try it out right I know
a lot of you guys are brand-new
developers who are just getting into the
industry some of you guys don't even
have a job as a developer yet but this
isn't gonna hurt you to actually try it
out and be able to have a conversation
sometimes it's good to try things out
like this because you might go even to a
job interview and somebody might ask you
hey why are you excited about and then
now you have a new topic to talk about
and actually put them on into something
that they never heard of you know I mean
you could go to an interview and they'd
be like hey uh what are you actually
excited about and you're like well does
this new programming language called
crystal Lang is as fast as C and it has
the same syntax as Ruby it is a
beautiful language
you got static typing like you throw
that out there on your interview and
people were like wow that's cool this
guy he's actually part of the community
he's actually looking into new things
he's actually putting me on to new
things so it's definitely gonna look
good and for all of you guys who are
more experienced developers hey man if
you're looking to build an application
that's going to be super fast and even
for like for just for web development
rain you need something that is going to
be fast or fast requests guys check this
out man this is the language for you
right and definitely check out amber and
check out router CR okay so anyways guys
this your boy Joe back at it again
coding face.com your boys back in I done
did it again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
