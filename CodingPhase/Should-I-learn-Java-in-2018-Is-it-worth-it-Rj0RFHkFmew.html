again man coding face.com your boys
backing out and did it again
oh somebody sent me a question today
like hey Joe what do you think about
Java what do you think about Java I
learn it should I spend any time on it
especially now for 2018 well it's very
simple guys this is what I will say as
you guys may know my expertise are in
web development web programming like
that's what I've been doing you know so
I can definitely give you you know a
good advice when it comes to that right
now from what I've seen for the past few
years is Joe is still popular no matter
what java is one of those languages that
hey if you're really good and let's say
you do something like android
development like you're set right like
if you have the right projects the
higher the right arm you know the right
degree you're going to be fine all right
because there's a lot of jobs now when
it comes to web development big data
let's say you want to learn something
like Scala right you want to jump into
something like Scala or you want to jump
onto something like Haskell
like you know they're like a little
subsets of Java but I would say man go
for it you know I'll be honest just go
for it you know this sounds that you
think man is gonna be hard for you to
find a job out there but man Java is one
of those things that just there's so
many jobs for it it's not even funny
like you find yourself doing software
development you find self doing web
development you find yourself creating
internal projects for a company you know
there's a lot of companies that use Java
to create software for like inventory
Java is very similar to asp.net it's
very corporate you know you're gonna
finding a lot of big companies always in
the backend somewhere you know no matter
where where you look there's always
somewhere in the backend of a company
that's like at least one or two
applications made in Java and somebody
needs to maintain it you don't say now
if you take the route of wanting to
learn Android development then that's
totally different then you know that's a
little different ballgame but they're
all coming from the same thing which is
Java programming all right so you
definitely should check it out I mean
look online I'm pretty sure there's a
couple of good Java courses on or you to
me that you could take a lot of
knowledge out of it and yeah go ahead
man you know I think right now
technology any programming language that
you might choose is gonna be a and okay
you know the only language that I might
say hey don't try to learn because it's
really like a waste of time by now it's
like Objective C like I feel like
everywhere that I look people are
talking about Swift and it seems like
Objective C is like if you want to
maintain like old applications then you
would do something with or doctor C but
it seems like everybody's doing Swift
now so yeah what Java man I'm repeating
myself
Java's good it's legit man if you look
online there's so much different type of
jobs so many different types of jobs
that that is out there just for Java
like it's not even funny man but like I
said it can be a little bit competitive
it can definitely be you know a little
bit challenging because you gotta think
about it you're not only competing with
a self-taught people you're also
competing with people who are having you
know the computer science degrees people
who have been doing this for a while
there's a lot of guys who have been
coding java for like 10 15 20 years like
they've been doing this for a long time
you're gonna say like we in 2017
I've heard of people doing Java in like
1994 or something like you know what I
mean like you don't have to compete with
those guys but at the same time and
think about it like this when you're a
company and you get the opportunity to
hire somebody new you get a developer
who maybe has like a year of experience
but he's very talented and he could pick
up a lot of different technologies or
different stacks in a company you know a
company might take the risk to hire him
so that could be you right now it's
easier for them to hire you they hire
somebody who's 10 15 years and because
that person was gonna come in with 10 15
years in automatically it's gonna want
like a hundred seven thousand dollars
while you might just come in and be like
hey man I want to start off start me off
with 70 start me off with 80 you know so
they'd rather do that they'd rather hire
you for that you get what I'm saying so
yeah man go ahead man learn Java I mean
I did Java in in college I played around
with Scala I actually created a few you
know a few web applications with Scala
but yeah go ahead man I'm not gonna tell
you I'm not gonna be one to tell you hey
don't learn Java Java is definitely one
of those languages that if you're good
you're good you know what I mean so yeah
man this is your book job back out of
the game man coding phase comm your
voice back and out and did it again we
out here taking a little quick Drive for
you guys I know a lot of people will be
mad when I Drive and record myself but
it's fine man I'm good I live in a
neighborhood where there's barely any
cars any traffic so I'm good I'm Gucci
you got what I'm saying but yeah man if
you want to learn what development you
want to learn you know the most popular
programming languages the most popular
frameworks stuff that you got gonna need
in a real job you know the real job
experience come to my website called o
face comm check me out man trust me
everything that I teach there is that
literally practical things I'm not
trying to teach you guys stuff that's
gonna waste your time now I'm gonna
teach you the things that I do at work
and yeah you're gonna know sit boy Joe I
got it again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
