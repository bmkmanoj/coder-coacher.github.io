what happens in the back end and why the
back end is important and why you're
here to learn no - yes
all right now think about it like this I
know you probably worked on HTML CSS and
JavaScript now remember all of those
things are what we see here in the front
view this is what the user sees the back
end is basically code that lives inside
of the server the server is just a
computer basically and just a space
inside of a computer think about it like
that right so now when we Glander this
page on facebook.com in reality we land
on an IP right so it could be something
like 2100 whatever it could be any
number right you land on an IP but when
you say facebook.com the user is easier
for him to remember this instead of this
long IP address to get to this website
so that's why we have to facebook.com
Facebook dotnet Facebook that org etc
right now when you land on this page
automatically we basically we're doing a
get request they get request means hey
I'm reaching out to the server which is
in the back end I am reaching out to the
server and telling him hey I just land
on facebook.com what happens after that
the server comes and basically returns
back this HTML document and a whole
bunch of other static files like
JavaScript like CSS so if we come here
and we click on inspect and you go to
network you refresh this page you're
gonna see facebook.com and we get a
status of 200 which means that hey
everything went good we basically got to
send all the document to the user and
everything is fine
right when we click on facebook.com you
will see here it says hey requests URLs
200 request method a get request which
means hey send me something right I'm
here
so sing me something right now from
there there's the remote address so you
can see it's like a long IP and a port
you see that there from there you have a
whole bunch of other information you
know this are the headers this is
information that basically for the
browser to know
all right you have content type and
basically it says text slash HTML this
is what we're seeing here all right
that's what we get we get this document
the browser reads this document and says
okay there's a HTML page let's load it
up and as you can see it has other stuff
here on the head like how long you a
second it has other stuff here like
links which are you know CSS files you
have Script files which are JavaScript
files right now if you come back to the
network we can see here we could
actually come and say okay what type of
files were getting so we got a whole
bunch of JavaScript files we got a whole
bunch of CSS files we got a whole bunch
of images so all of these are actually
being sent by the server to their user
right when they land on this page and it
all works from that HTML page because
when the HTML page shows up then it
starts loading all the other files and
formats that are here like here like
okay we got a gif file and then so you
can see down here you're gonna see
content type image slash gift right and
then the same thing here content type
image slash PNG so pretty much the first
thing that loads is a page now what I
want you guys to think about this is
when you land on a page the server is
the one that serves the user with the
type of file that they're going to see
on that route right if I come to let's
say facebook.com slash video now I'm
looking at another route right I'm
looking at another place other than the
facebook.com
so I have to have a route on the back
end to show it to the user right now as
you can see it says you must be logged
in now this is where authentication
comes in this is where if you register
to a website for example you come here
you register right when you click this
button here you do a post request a post
request means you're posting to the
server and then the server is gonna get
that data whatever you put in here Joe
Santos phone number password birthday
gender when you click enter or you click
on create account what it does it
basically sends that information to the
backend and now the backend goes like ok
I received this information right and
then once they receive the information
then to decide to do something with that
information now for a registration form
what you're going to do is you're gonna
take this information save the the users
data into a database and you're gonna
have one area where basically is our
king one line is for that user so that
in that user has his name his phone
number has details all his details are
inside in the database right now
whenever you want to log in now what
this happens is basically you do another
post request you put in the email and
the password here and then click log in
and then what happens is the user sends
that information to the server right
which is the backend it sends the
information to sort of server and then
the server basically matches it it says
ok if the user has the same email in the
same password as what we have here in
our database then we're going to let him
in when we let him in we're going to
show him another page alright now I want
you guys to think about it like this
there's get requests get requests means
when you land on a page right and
and post request is when you're sending
data from the front end to the back end
alright now I know this might seem a lot
but this is just I'm breaking it down in
very simple terms now I want you guys to
if you got loss or on any situation come
back to this video listen to what I just
told you and everything will make sense
always think about it like this get
requests means hey I'm getting something
from the server right send it to me on
the view here a post request means I'm
posting it from here from the front end
to the back end so I'm sending them
information alright I'll see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
