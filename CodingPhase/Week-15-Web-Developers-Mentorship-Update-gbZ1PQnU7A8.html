boy joke back at it again man coding
face calm listen make sure you subscribe
make sure you like this video all right
i'll just do this a little quick video
just to update you guys on how's
everything going with the mentorship you
know keep you updated on who's doing
what you know listen like i said you
know there's gotta be some some other
guys they're gonna take advantage of
your not the mentorship for what it is
basically having somebody on coal and be
able to help tomorrow in you know
whenever they have a question help them
out with the project now to be honest
with you guys out of six people only
three people took advantage of it you
know three people hit me up ask me
questions we can contact you know now
another three people there been a my ink
i don't know if they got scared I don't
know if they too busy I don't know
exactly what the hell they doing none of
them contacted me or send me back a
message like hey man I'm working on it
hey I need help with this hey I'm
working on this thing and I'm stuck you
know so it kind of sucks because I'm
pretty sure a lot of you guys would like
to be part of this and gonna take a
really you know advantage of this this
whole mentorship experiment that I'm
doing but you know three of them
basically half didn't take advantage on
maybe they are doing the project last
minute which is it's not the right way
to do it you know you shouldn't if I
give you a week to work on a project
then you should start working right away
so you will have time to ask questions
have time to basically work on things
and I was gonna actually make that
of rule of the experiment like hey don't
do last minute because I'm not
gonna help you out on the last minute if
you decide to work on a Wednesday night
instead of doing it on the whole week
that you had I'm not gonna help you out
you know especially if you did not
contact me throughout the whole week
with shows you're not interested or you
just not really dedicated to this which
is it it's like I always tell people man
you know everybody is looking for a
solution everybody is looking to get
into the industry but in reality nobody
really wants put in the work it's like I
do videos I don't tutorials here that
you could really learn a lot from my
tutorials maybe sometimes even more than
you know a lot of the courses that I
give you even though the courses are
great but then there's a lot of
boilerplate to a meaning like there's a
lot you know a video that might take 2-3
minutes you know they explained it in 10
minutes when you come here to my
tutorials I give you one hundred percent
the honest answer and the best way to
just do it without having to go through
the whole work around right and most
people don't take advantage of that you
know when I do tutorials tutorials is
actually the videos that leaves get
views in this channel and it's not
because the quality is bad because
people just don't want to do the work
you know when I first started one of the
hardest things to do is I find it a
project to do like it's like okay I'm
learning HTML CSS on until your
treehouse I'm learning academy or I'm
learning
in free cocaine but how do I put things
together how do I start making a website
how do I decide which type of website to
make those are the things that become
hard because
you're not a design you're not working
for a company who was giving you
different task so in the beginning
working project-based is the best way to
learn so if I'm come here i'll give you
a project to build you should do it not
because I'm telling you to do it you
should do it because this is almost like
simulating how it would be in a real job
situation you know what i mean so plus
you gotta take advantage man like I'm
coming over here I'm putting in my time
into this and you know that kind of
makes me if I see that half of the
people don't contact me and don't want
to finish the project or don't want to
work on it then that makes me feel like
you know what man I see just focus on
the first three that just contacted me
and like I know they're working on you
know what I mean so
i don't know if i should leave and say
whoa has contacted me
you
the whole point of this is to honor
first we basically what developmental
did ask me anything whatever unit they
there they dared to basically answer
questions when people get stuck so
you're getting that for free here and
the only thing that you're paying is
just only way that you're paying is just
basically just putting your face on a
video that's it that's all you're really
paying me with you know and I appreciate
all of you guys that came in on the
first week but just wish you guys would
take advantage man because a lot of
people 300 people send me messages
all six of you guys got god-chosen so
it's like come on take advantage ask
questions let me know anything that you
might need now if you feel like you
don't need an anything for me or you
know you already know everything then
you shouldn't have signed up for it
because the whole point is to help you
out and show how I could help you other
people out on how to become you know
what developers but this goes to say to
everybody that's watching this like hey
this shows you you know a lot of people
is gonna come in and try to do this but
now everybody's gonna finish it meaning
like a lot of people's gonna come in and
let me see trackback on this right a lot
of people keep saying to me hey this
thing is gonna get flooded with people
trying to learn how to code and people
trying to get jobs and it's like man you
guys don't understand that there's like
a million people who try to learn how to
code but the reality of things is that
only twenty percent of those people
become developers everybody tries to do
this but can they do it no because you
know you don't have to seem
determination you don't put in the same
time it's more of a thing of like oh man
I wish I could learn how to code but if
you don't do the work how the hell are
you gonna learn you know so that's why I
tell you guys don't worry your body this
you know this has been a problem for
four years already you know like people
have been saying like oh there's too
many graphic designers that's too many
web design is there's too many what
developers there's too many programmers
and it's like there's so many jobs and
still cannot be filled for a reason
people start to learn
but they don't do they finish no they
don't that's the reality of things like
you know it kind of sucks because I
don't know more people in this industry
but it's like not everybody's going to
make it nobody has that determination to
to basically continue pushing forward
and say yes in the beginning is boring
guys yes I understand the beginning was
boring you like oh man I got a cold I
gotta sit in front of a computer for for
a four to eight hours yeah it could be
boring yes there is no way around it but
the cold part is when you're finishing
the cool part is when you bring this
two-step looks great holy
it took me a whole week everything works
you
the code is not working
there's always going to be issues but
the best thing to do is just keep
pushing forward because once you go over
those little issues then everything's
going to be fine and that's when you get
to joy you gave it to be like oh yeah I
finish this oh yeah I'm nice with it you
know what I mean like yeah I spent all
this time to learn this and then
now I'm a great developer you know what
i mean so you know it just kind of sucks
people don't take advantage and then you
know 300 people's out here sending me
messages like hey man I want you to
mentor me and it's like that's one of
the reasons why I don't do it because
people you know I could come in and
dedicate my time into this but then not
everybody's gonna give me back that time
the same without give it to them so
you know but let's see what happens on
Thursday man I hope you guys all of you
guys who haven't contacted me and having
kept in touch I hope you guys watch this
video and at least show up on Thursday
8pm you know
give me a good reason why you you didn't
take advantage of this this whole week
because from what I could tell not all
of you knew how to basically have a coke
so if you don't know how to code this is
like the perfect opportunity like you
didn't have to build the whole website I
could have taught you how to code in one
week you kind of went back and forth to
the emails i would have given you the
right videos i'm giving you the right
website to get you starting quick
because I could teach somebody HTML CSS
in one week that's
though
that's up to you man know that the next
time I do this experiment people take
advantage but let's see what happens I
mean it's weak size is one month let's
see let's see what happens in week 2
here I'm a chat room
Nathan yeah I'm sorry if it's like a
very bad connection man I'm sorry about
that I don't know why man I feel like
verizon's supposed to be the best but
it's not the best because it
sucks out here
so that's a good idea to what I have to
say are any of you guys interested in
mentoring each other and making each
other accountable like that's one of the
reasons why I'm making coding face calm
so people could you know find a
community of developers and people that
want to actually work on stuff and get
stay in contact and be able to push each
other to keep learning cuz I know I
guess sometimes you hit a wall you like
oh man I hit a wall and then you don't
come back to code for like a week or two
but if you have other people in the
community that hit you up and be like
hey man it was good man like come on
come join the team or come work with us
or like hey have you learned I'll have
you practice coding this week or
whatever it is right like people need
that it's like going to the gym man I
told you guys this thing is I going to
the gym a lot of people is gonna be like
hey man let's go join the gym right so
they joined a gym ten people join the
gym out of those seven people maybe
three or four go every day to the gym
then two of them probably go you know
two three times a week right and then
the some of them probably like four
don't even show up to the gym like they
signed up and they never go to it now as
the days go by and the week's go by you
start seeing that less and less people
start going to the gym and then at the
end it's only three people who stayed
going to the gym every single day so
it's the same way as you know learning
how to code learning to do anything you
know there's people that they want to
learn how to you know do some karate
some you are see you know mixed martial
arts and they go to the to the training
but do they become UFO UFC
fighters none you know sauce I think in
one sense that's good for everybody else
in the industry you guys start getting
in because it kind of shows you guys
like hey there's gonna be a lot of
people trying to get into this industry
but now everybody's kind of
you know push forward to get in so for
you guys are really dedicated you you
basically got a leg up on everybody
because you know that you're dedicated
to this thing so you know you're gonna
be able to get into the industry you
know you're gonna be able to find a job
that's like guaranteed because there's
so many jobs and nobody else wants to do
it you know nobody else wants to put in
that time super early out here it's nine
o'clock 927 I'm about to go in going to
work but yeah man let me see what else
you guys is saying yeah we can make our
own group also yeah I mean that's why
the Gator is there but guys like
together just like how Matt OH is you
know he's helping me I promote it like
that's why it's there for so you guys
could you know going to stay in contact
and be able to work on stuff keep
yourself accountable
am I see ya man I'm a great resource but
you got school also do the same man I'm
over here yes I was driving but I'm over
here like two three blocks away from my
job that's why I'm good don't worry
about it I'm part right now you see I'm
not moving yeah definitely the
JavaScript course is super deep it's one
of those clothes on courses that you
know you're gonna get everything out of
it that's for sure
however really received how I really
received uh I think I got one email from
you Andrae but besides that then haven't
really had any emails from them and I
think I got one well I didn't see
anything else besides that
not also sup man if you make it
responsive man that's even better man
because you're pushing yourself forward
you know you're doing you go beyond the
expectations of what the project's
supposed to be so yeah right
but yeah guys so this goes to show for
every single one of you guys like okay I
want you guys to put in that work guys
this is not about you know who could get
to learn this thing the fastest who
could get to do projects the fastest
it's not about that it's about who can
actually continue coding every single
day at least for an hour to all right
and whenever you stuck how to find
answers either ask me ask the community
on getter acts Google you know go on
google and search it check your stack
overflow check through Korra like you
guys got to take advantage you know it's
the freaking internet guys like come on
man
yeah and Ray I gotta check man i'll be
honest I'd adding having received no
emails I think I saw one email from me
but besides that I didn't receive no
other emails and then um I know matt is
done I know Tommy is done um I know
April is working on it I don't know if
she's done yet um I haven't heard father
and I got a day or two but I know she
started it and she started working on it
so she's doing her thing
yeah just okay you know whatever you
know whatever you want to get into you
know I us javascript you could do java
for android
yeah Stack Overflow reputation doesn't
mean anything you could go in there and
basically ask a question of how to make
a unordered list and then that list
becomes trending because a lot of people
search for that right so then you'll get
a whole bunch of points just for that
question which is like super simple and
super dumb right now you get a whole
bunch of points and then you have more
points than somebody who really knows
his who really knows how to
freaking cold who knows java script for
no HTML CSS who knows the backend you
have more points in that person because
your question became became trendy and
everybody gave it a thumbs up and
so it's not really worth anything the
stack overflow reputation it just shows
that you're active in the community at
least your act you know asking questions
and but besides that it doesn't
nobody goes in there and be like oh this
this guy got 10,000 points on stack
overflow he's a genius we have to hire
him like no yeah man thank you thank you
Sayid you know what's cool man I like
seeing you know I'm getting a lot of new
the new subscribers then I was saying
the other day like my subscribers are
actually down compared to how was
getting them before where i was getting
i think like 60 70 subscribers a day
right now we're actually getting like I
don't know 30 to 40 subscribers a day
which is fine is not bad but it's
definitely has gone down because of the
type of videos that I've been making
lately which is mostly most of the
videos are making are for people who
already subscribed and I'm helping them
up but that's why I'm making other
videos this week which is going to bring
back but this you know subscriber count
of creating more in general or type of
videos and you know
more helpful type videos informational
type videos tutorials I'm gonna get back
to doing tutorials for sure big up from
Spain man I'm trying to go to Spain so
bad I got a cousin over there in a bar
celona and I'm trying to go over there
man so bad one of these days man you
know I'll be honest with you guys when I
really wish I could just go to a spanish
country like I've been looking into this
at one point I want to go to a spanish
country and like work over there and
just like live over there either Spain
Argentina Colombia maybe I'll go back to
Dominican Republic I don't know like ah
I don't know trust me guys like you know
when you're like hispanic or latino
you're somebody spanish-speaking and you
go to a country with like it's a
spanish-speaking country I don't know
there's something great about it you're
like ocean back home you know what i
mean so I've never worked or lifting any
country besides the United States I mean
as an adult I used to live in a
Dominican Republic till I was like six
seven years old but since then I always
lived here so but I definitely want to
go somewhere else because it's like you
know we always say hey America is the
best country in the world but at the
same time there's like so much culture
and so much cool in other countries
that you know just to pigeonhole
yourself just to be here in the United
States and be like oh yeah I live in the
United States and just the only place
where i live at man I think that's not a
great way to look at life in you
know what i mean so but yeah i'm gonna
see you guys later going into work right
now we talk later okay guys Jessica's
nice to see you will see new users in
here and yeah man Wow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
