up he already knows your boy joke back
at it again man :
face calm we live live in the morning
and it's the work a little late but is
okay because I'll say hello little yeah
what's going on with me this again
and what did I do so I basically I went
for Friday to the casino hanged out
family me wife mom and the baby ended up
losing I mean that's what happens you
know this is very rare that you're going
to a casino and you go in winning okay
but it's fine because is that my budget
was $1,000 to spend right right we just
tried to gap
and then I spent basically like Friday
night playing winning losing weight and
losing and then I went to sleep I was
like half a strong and then from there
in the morning time woke up decided to
basically just like you know play one
last time so they out there you know I
won and I lost one and I lost and I was
playing roulette I was getting a whole
bunch of numbers I was learning a lot
and then I should have just left
I almost recouped all the money that I
lost the night before but you know how
this when you're in a casino
happens so it's okay but then at the air
you know I ended up in solo I ended up
losing seven hundreds which is fine I'm
complaining
alright but yeah - that's my weekend
how's your weekend rain let me know in
the comments below man I want to know
what you guys did this weekend so there
from there came back Saturday on
Saturday afternoon like a no no six
o'clock or seven ninety six seven
o'clock and then Sunday's absolutely
worth doing anything and that's why
since I'm a 100 number
hello
yeah can you guys call me up asked if I
was like I'm gonna work right now
all right thank you you too
yeah alright so basically right now
having to work let's see how it goes but
yeah so Sunday actually you know Sunday
I try to make some videos for you guys
and try to scare a couple of videos for
courses all I got to do was just an
introduction to to the maragon of course
that's eight because my neighbors
decided to do a big-ass party on a
Sunday like I don't know who does that
and now that I'm an sounds up but
that's why some of the reasons why some
people don't they don't like
Spanish people to certain areas like
seven neighborhoods like no you don't do
that they said it's not a part
there's people have music
pumping from Philly
 twelve o'clock I think like this
 was a park like no there's
a residential area bro not supposed to
be abusing it like people that you have
a party but like literally my house is
shaking because they have a
whole bunch of bass and a whole bunch of
 I don't say nothing because I was
like you know what let's let them have
been low party the never happens
that only happens I go see here but
the same time as a grand I will never do
that
is that's why it's better in
Spanish before certain areas man because
people don't like that soon I'll be like
this like you can be in there having
 Mexican music last name with a
big-ass bass making everybody
how sick like apart especially some
corny ants music nobody wants to in
action and on mainly I know they'll have
like a key piano some sense of thank you
are a power like they okay
this is why I like to live areas down
remote where you don't have to deal with
 neighbors or people
and this people would want to hold the
house next door they live in a basement
you know what this guy Jimmy and woo was
also not the world over he's like he's
the one the rest are the main house
I don't know why he let them
have a party like that especially like
the religious scripture only they left a
whole bunch of garbage in front of the
house
the words
yeah so
that's what I built something I just the
plain Paragon the whole time
I was not boys on
aka Flaco you guys know honk an uncanny
podcast
Concannon culture but he sucks
come suspect one of you watching this
borough sorry him suck pink
instead became highly being able to win
a game with him and like my fact we did
willing 1 out of 10 games each game is
half an hour we know what it is to be
there just losing losing losing
there's nobody know how to play late
when you play mobile games man you never
know what the hell you're doing man like
it's not about killing this this is
not cool until you stop I'll get into
more skills people want to be the number
one getting the most kills you got to
play your role if your support your
support if you're an attacker
tacker if your tank let's say you'll
 take but come on the you will
practice the w2 probably Paragon and how
that
that's all I'm saying
what I'm doing today I don't know
today I'm going to try to do a couple of
videos videos that didn't get to do yet
we're going to try to knock it out today
I have counsel
plus I would have thought an hour ago of
course
I will start that off
but before that I realized something
they are not to create the HTML CSS for
this page as ready
so
what I'm going to do is I'm fine right I
might just create a couple of videos
like six hour videos of me for myself
off building the pages for those of you
guys who want to practice these them
elses
got that practice that I create those
videos because I have to create that
that page other ways requiring to start
making the
the first project is a to-do app right
which I'm inspired to say I hate goats
do axe flight I need to teach you guys
the crime create read update them so
that's the idea behind
so happy defeat and then I thought I
look like
likely person really are one of those
people that if that's Antonio that I'm
working on the design looks like
I'm like color or elimination right
that's how I have to look good and I
really have to look to par with the
money I'll spend like on Halloween I
know spending money position you know so
I want to give you guys a good design
good project that you could be like oh
this isn't it something that you can use
it it show it to other people or put in
your github or put it on on your code
pad you know the movie I want you guys
that's why I give you
the laravel force introduction video is
going to come out
which were you guys now
get started Lydia does better check it
out I got so videos on
I'm going to put the overview which is
like an introduction I'm just talking
about their well why is it why should
everybody else trying to learn
and that is another videos going to be
how to install PHP my sequel is our
Orion computer
so
kids
neither army I'll see you guys later
maybe enough podcast or maybe I might do
or what developers lunch break which I
don't know man I don't know if I'm gonna
continue to learn what the other
person's bring because the probability
is that number one the quality here
sucks like the fourteenth is no fortune
second 3t so it sucks that internet
connection so I feel like if somebody
comes from to my channel and they see
those videos together without all his
videos look like is the quality of
its channels pretty shitty so what I
might do is on my lunch break I might
just use this camera week old videos for
you guys think stead of me this doing
alive
and I will be like the web developers a
lunch break the only different is that I
won't be able to chat with you guys it's
kind of sucks but that's all failing you
must definitely join this chord and the
link is there and then should be there
are other descriptions join this chord
those people that I like too so
basically calculus I like to check what
I do it videos go on this chord and sign
up right and then from there I might
create a section I might tell Matt
create a section where it says web
developers lunch break where every day
at 2:00 o'clock 2:00 p.m. you guys can
go on go on there and that's pretty much
at the same time that I'm doing my
videos because you guys know it that's
it my lunch break at 2 o'clock so while
I'm looking at the chat room I can also
create content for you guys like
whatever questions you guys might have
or whatever yeah I want to talk about on
that lunch break I can talk about it and
then release the video for you guys and
good quality good audio so
at least we will lose the hassles of
being able to chat with each other which
is that's why I like to learn the live
videos because I like talking to you I
like again the feedback in you know
cracking jokes and you know
passion Casey around like a coffee cup
like you know what I really enjoy - so
yeah hopefully we get to steppin I just
want to step it up to do that and I'll
give you guys the best quality content
get education now yes
that's what we do
so annoying
to trick the cars and way
I'm here so I will see you guys later
make sure you subscribe make sure you
check out the web developers links there
right below and also check out my
website code in peace calm your God and
like I always say man I think there's a
special younameit if you want to support
the cam man and you're going to buy a
course whenever from you to me click on
the links of my videos and then I get a
little something back right that's like
the easiest way to support this channel
because it's like you're not really
giving me no money you're not really
donating anything but then at the same
time it's like hey I was going to buy a
course anyway so if unum is going to pay
somebody let them feed you let them take
a little two dollars two dollars give it
to him and that's it and you don't
really have to spend money out of your
pocket because at the end of the day you
was going to buy that course anyway you
know what I mean so yeah well if not
just sign off for the corner phase calm
and trust me guys like that website is
not going away meaning like I'm not
going to stop doing videos I'll create
 courses from now till forever
like when you sign up for a monthly
subscription you're pretty much going to
get access to all the room now if you're
one of those people is like are now
already known out of the then what
I will say is just buy the course that
you need right just buy the course that
you need and nothing and then besides
that you'll be good my kids I'll see you
later top</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
