it again man : face calm listen your boy
is back all right listen guys I'm gonna
say this forward last time I don't hate
boot camps but I do believe that if
you're somebody who wants to become a
developer and you have to pass it for it
and you say hey I woke up today I want
to do this thing and for the next you
know next few weeks the next month
I'm going to dedicate myself three and
five hours a day to do this so I could
learning better myself
I think that you could do it because I
didn't there's a lot of people who's
done it before 90% of people who are
here on YouTube have done it by
themselves pretty much like they learned
on their own even people who are
promoting boot camps they can actually
actually tell you that hey I didn't go
to boot camp I learned this on my own so
that's where I have probably was like
warming them different what makes me
different than you meaning why do you
need to spend twenty thousand dollars or
something that you could learn on your
own if you really want to become a
developer go ahead just take the courses
that I tell you or go search online find
somebody you know that can teach you a
better way or give you better resources
and to me it doesn't have to be coming
directly for me you could go to somebody
else and listen to what they got to say
listen to or you know John summers or
you know Chris on the team treehouse you
got um who else you got this other guy
Chris Hawkes you got Aaron bina he
actually went to a boot camp but at the
same time he's giving you a good feel of
how it works right for him now for me I
personally think that you don't need to
go to a bouquet you know what I mean
like you don't have to because if you
really wanted you if you just go you
know once I go into the gym I always
bring this up if you want to loose
weight you're going to go to the gym at
work
those people that are buffed up in the
guys are coming in there like that they
don't have no no person to go on their
way and hold their hand and be like hey
man this are you you lift your bars and
this is how much you got to put in this
which is I eat no those guys just went
all out started hitting the gym every
single day if you ask each one of them
they tell you hey I don't have a trainer
I just came to the gym started working
out it's that simple it's the same thing
as you know learning how to code learn
how to become a web developer you just
have to go in start coding start looking
stop looking for this you know this
answer is of man who whose how are you
going to give me the answers to to do
this who's going to give me the magic
trick
what instructors is gonna give me the
low sprinkle on my code to help me out
who who has the best you know placement
of leg boot camps man you don't need a
placement like your leader to spend
twenty thousand dollars into a bootcamp
difficut of their connections to get you
up into a job do you understand that
most of those people they also local in
be calm or what's the other one I think
it's a freaking dice coms are I'll try
to remember this one that specializes
higher calm like they go directly to
higher calm and say hey we just got some
graduates do you have anything that fits
in for them like you can do that
yourself so it's like you're paying
twenty thousand dollars for somebody to
come and teach you the basics of HTML
basics of CSS basics of JavaScript
basics of nodejs or even the basics of
Ruby on Rails some places they're still
teaching Ruby or rails right so it's
like now you're getting yourself in
there for twenty thousand dollars right
now let's do it like this if you're very
privileged in this world where you say
hey I'm actually thousand dollars my
bank account go ahead
oh maybe I was doing - maybe I will go
to a boot campaign if I have twenty
thousand dollars to throw away in the
air like that and I'm like huh you know
what I could've wasted this money in
college doing you know like philosophy
so
I was going to spend $200 but now I'm
just going to spend 20,000 and it makes
sense for those people who make sense
right or you know somebody who is
already a working person meaning like
hey they already have a career that were
successful there and they say hey I got
$50,000 saved right I got enough to pay
off my my my rent pay off my car pay
everything that I need to pay and I have
an extra $20,000 you know what imma do a
career switch a book it might work
perfect for you because you have money
in your pocket to go and you know throw
it away in reality because you just
don't want to do it yourself right so to
those people it could work it could
actually be good but to somebody who
doesn't have anything if you started
from zero and you're saying hey right
now I'll back you color is like negative
or right now my bank account has my rent
and that's it I want to advise you to go
in there and start negative when you
could have just done done this length by
yourself like you don't need nobody else
to come in and hold your hand and get I
hate man here now you're a developer for
stuff that you could've learned in your
house on your own time that it doesn't
make sense you know what I mean just
because just to ask questions some
people tell me hey oh yeah the best
thing about boot camps is that you know
you go in it you know you totally
instruct and the starter tells you you
know he helps you out whenever you're
stuck and it's like wait isn't that what
we all do while we're stuck and we just
go to stack overflow or isn't that what
we just do when we go on Google or even
the team treehouse forum or any of those
places or even on YouTube on the comment
isn't about normal developers - so why
is it that so hard for you to think like
hey I can't do this by myself I'm just
gonna spend money $20,000 to get a
shortcut and in reality it's not a
shortcut you just pay a premium for
something that's free or something
that's going to cause it $20
is a Christian Christian you know he
became a developer because he each of
the King treehouse courses right and
he's like only like $75 me I probably
spent around that same thing on udemy
you know what I mean so just on courses
so it's like why would I tell you hey go
to a bootcamp
it's like there's nothing special about
me it's nothing special about other
developers that do it by themselves
there's nothing special about it
like I'm being honest like there's no
magic trick there's no little thing that
you sprinkle on it and you're like oh
yeah this person is going to be able to
become a developer because he sprinkles
some on it no guys nobody needs of
the instructor you don't need somebody
to come in here and hold your hand and
tell you hey man you got a stick in this
room for you know for 8 o'clock in the
morning to five o'clock in the afternoon
working on code no you can do that in
your house all you have to do is just
basically there's a bunch of courses
that take you from zero to 100 ruining
everything for the beginning of HTML to
the end of like a full stack framework
you know something like no js' Express
laravel this here on YouTube that
you don't you don't need to pay somebody
else to be like hey give me a project
it's like I look at I think like oh is
it
Udacity you'd actually charges people
$200 or something like that or more a
month just to tell the people I came
here's the project you gotta do today
like I could tell you that I've told
people millions of times what they gotta
do you create a real estate you create a
digital agency you create a restaurant
you create a ecommerce store what else
and then you could create another one
Lowe's again you create those five pages
I'm looking for ground you know from the
bottom for like zero from like when you
say just HTML once you create that from
just that little HTML tag to the end of
all the pages you're fine you're ready
to go of course you're gonna need a
little bit
practice in JavaScript but that's the
same thing that you're going to get on
your own you don't need somebody to come
in and hold your hand and be like hey
Glenn will you do a little slider like
you know what's on a page you don't need
somebody to tell you hey maybe your page
needs a slider so practice JavaScript no
you look at other people other pages
sorry look at other pages like ign.com
you go to youtube that how you goodsoon
on worldstar you go to a cnn.com look
what they got on their pages go to
freakin couch EECOM go to whatever
favorite store that you want rebuild a
website the things that you see if you
see the page has a Snyder find out how
to do a slider if you see the page has a
drop down menu find out how to do a drop
down menu like you don't know me to tell
you what you need in a page at all use
common sense you don't need a bootcamp
to hold your hand and validate you and
this is something else that's crazy
these people that are hitting me up and
tell me hey I have a computer science
degree which is way better than having a
 certificate on book or you can
write to get hired right and they're
like I have a computer science degree
and I want to go to a boot camp what do
you think does that make sense
that's like saying hey I started to
become a doctor right and then once
you're a doctor you're like okay you
know what I'm gonna come back down and
I'm gonna be a doctor's assistant or
some like that
I'm gonna go to a little program to be
like a nurse assisting or was a PA where
they just teach you how to clean the
little tools for the doctor there's like
you already have a doctor's degree like
why are you going down here what is it
that you're scared of what is it that
you scared us to just start applying for
a job
that's the problem you know that's the
problem that I have 14 caps and you know
it's like it's great for people who in
their mind they feel like they're not
gonna do this by themselves and they
can't do it by themselves completely and
they just need somebody to hold a hand
most of those people they never really
wanted to be a developer they just
wanted to show up and say hey I want to
subtract a reader to something that's
cool that that's hip but it's not
because they wanted to become a
development they say hey there's money
here and there's jobs here I will switch
up to being a developer no you have to
have that in you and say hey I want to
become a developer somebody who is not
an artist somebody who is not basically
a painter somebody who's not or whatever
that has to deal with creativity right
can I go to a school and say hey now I
don't think all right so I'm dissing
that because I went to this school
no you have to bust your ass home and do
that every single day you know how many
people don't take the story I had this
ex-girlfriend this ex-girlfriend went to
school to become a graphic designer
the whole time that she was in school
she would basically accident - how far
about the homework right so she went to
school
somehow graduating she got a like a beat
right graduated when I got three point
something great what habits are that she
work as a graphic designer today no she
don't because she didn't have to pass
him she wasn't making designs or her own
time this is something that you have to
do it on your own time and take
dedication will say hey this my new
career it's like a craftsman somebody a
carpenter or architect you can just say
hey I'm gonna go through this program
and then I'm gonna become this without
diving into it you know it's not about
paint a little $20,000
I get an education it doesn't work like
that you have to go in there and put in
hard work right into that boot camp so
people are graduated from boot camp and
are successful is because they put in
that work and then to get hired to a
very large company you know like then
you see them on hack reactor or def melt
in or whatever there's other things like
hey we got this person hired to a 20 we
got this person hired to Verizon
we got this person hired to Geico we got
this person hired to whatever but what
people don't understand is that the boot
camp do not make those people what they
are today will make them good
developers that got them to that place
was the passion the fact that they were
at home and the projects aside from the
boot camp not just like hey I showed up
at the book about pay $20,000 I'm
expecting $100,000 because I pay for
hack reactor man no it doesn't work like
that guys you gotta put in that work so
if you don't have to put into you know
putting that work at a place how about
you putting that work in your house and
basically save yourself that money and
really freaking do something useful and
but I tell me you basically you finish
with all your projects your online
projects and your side projects you have
a full portfolio of things that you have
done not a github page or not a freakin
a github account like a lot of bootcamp
freaking people that coming up you know
how many people who send us you know
resumes that just came out of boot camp
all they have is a freaking get up page
many of them because not even the
instructors tell them that hey you
better have five different complete
projects projects that show that you
could actually create websites for a
company nobody does that
and I've seen in plenty of times
the people who are successful in boot
camps is because they were already going
to get there anyways they just needed
this little validation in their back
of like yes if you come here you're
going to become a great developer it's
like a slow people online who have great
pages great work they already do in
front of the back end and then tell them
with oil on September are up starting
you know a new boot camp I'm going to
record with a hack reactor or aquacadet
II and I'm like what you already have
two skills why are you going over there
so our knowledge just you know I just
want to get my certificate
what certificate why don't you give me
the certificate because the certificates
not even worth anything soon as you
leave the place that certificate is not
worth anything like you could go
anywhere that I here I got a certificate
from you to me I got a certificate from
Udacity
scientifical from lynda.com that's at
one who can actually stand for it's just
a independent school it's just somebody
who comes in and say hey I trained this
person not given my certificate I could
print your certificate and tell you hey
you graduated from Joe's Academy if
that's what you learned in a little pat
on the back I'll do that for you for
free you know what I mean but it's up to
you what you want to do all right just
that's my last message about boot camps
I'm not going to talk about this no more
because whenever somebody asks me about
boot camp I'm gonna bring them right
back to this video
CGT you already knows your boy Joe back
at it again man listen make sure you
subscribe and make sure you like this
video man by the way if you want to know
exactly what courses I took to become a
web developer they right there in the
description it's no secret it's nothing
crazy is no secret gift that I had is
just pretty much I took the courses
they're pretty cheap they're like $15
beads on specials and just missing mask
change your life change your lifestyle
do something fun and something cool that
you could call a career I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
