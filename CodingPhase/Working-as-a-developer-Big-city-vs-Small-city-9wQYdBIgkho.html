at it again man coding face.com
listen make sure you subscribe make sure
you like this video man cuz your boat is
on fire
alright listen alright so we're gonna
talk about working in a big city like
New York San Francisco LA Denver like
you know the big cities Dallas you know
working in a big city compared to
working in a smaller city or working in
a business that's outside in the suburbs
how busy right well I'm gonna say like
this in the city you're gonna get paid
more you know sometimes it's easy to get
a hundred thousand dollars and you know
in a large city like New York right it's
easy it's not hard at all but you have
to understand
everything is super expensive right so
even though somebody might be earning
$100,000 or more the reality of things
is that after you you add up rent which
is like you know you're paying twenty
four hundred dollars for rent you're
paying transportation you're paying for
food everyday lunches like $14 to $20
just for lunch
and then from there you gotta buy
yourself some food after work most
people don't even cook at home when you
live in the city you most likely you
know eat you eat out in a restaurant or
go out for a couple of drinks whatever
right once you add up all of that shame
in reality you're not making that much
because you realize that you spending
way more money working in the city then
as if he was working somewhere else
right so let's say an example for
somebody who works in in a smaller
business outside of a big city like
myself I find that I actually have more
money to spend in in the end you know
once you know I pay taxes once I I pay
my rent once I paid you know the car
know everything right
once I pay everything off I still have a
large amount of money there which I
didn't have when I used to work in the
city because I would constantly be
wasting money on that costs like
three times as much as anyone else
outside of the city you know so that's
where where my question comes in and
it's like where is it better to to
actually live and work Frank as a
smaller city is they somewhere
in the suburbs or is it working in in
you know in the city like New York or
San Francisco whatever right where
exactly is better for you now I would
say like this if you like the night
scene like let's say if you're like
young you're like 2021 and you want to
be hanging out on the club's Stoke on
the bars and doing a whole bunch of
I think that working in the city might
be fondant because you know everybody
goes out and hangs out and like
that but if you're in a stage where
you're not that that person who's like
going out clubbing or going on to bars
every single day or you know doing
like that then I think you know living
in the city is it's not worth it at all
because you got to think about it you're
paying twenty four hundred dollars for
rent
now sometimes even more and it's like
you don't own anything so let's say
right now you're working at this job for
five ten years and you make $100,000
plus in those five ten years you didn't
get to really save up anything you
didn't get to buy your own house you
didn't get to buy anything maybe you'll
buy a condo but in the long run you
won't be able to you know to have
anything to show for it's more like yeah
I worked at this company for this amount
of time and I got a 401k doesn't that
but in the long run is like you wasted
your youth working in a company
and pretty much you didn't even get to
buy anything you know like realistic
super important because real estate is
something that at least you know your
money is going somewhere when you pay
rent you know that that money is going
for the mortgage of the owner of that
part right but for you when you leave
from there you leave with nothing
now if you own your own house or your
own condo at least when you leave from
that you leave way you know whatever the
house guy appreciated for like so like
let's say you got a loan for $200,000 10
years ago now your house is $500,000
you're leaving out of the way $250,000
because that's how much you put in into
it you know what I mean the other person
who's living in a big city and living in
apartment when she moves out he's
leaving with just his clothes he's not
leaving with anything else you know what
I mean so sometimes you gotta think
about it like that there's a bigger
picture you know working in a big city
it might seem cool and working for a big
company nice
but there's a reason why they paying so
much money because everything else is
super expensive like I know people who
work in a really huge companies in San
Francisco and I know for a fact that I
have more money my bank account than
them because it's like I have this
friend right
he works at Microsoft gives pain $3,200
for a three-bedroom apartment $3,200
like you know how much is that that's a
lot of money and you don't own
it you know what I mean and yeah I think
I think he rents out more room but at
the same time it's like now you're
renting a room because you can't afford
where you live
and it's like you're already making over
a hundred thousand dollars and you have
to rent a room have some stranger in
your house like I don't know man like
that's why I kind of moved to Long
Island and I really you know the next
few years I want to move somewhere else
where it's even cheaper where I could
enjoy my money and I could enjoy you
know when I buy land I could buy a lot
of it you know what I mean like I was
thinking about moving to somewhere in
Texas or moving to somewhere in Georgia
maybe Arizona
yeah because it's like I don't see the
benefit of me staying in a big city you
know what I mean like they
there's really no no benefit like I
don't get nothing out of you know moving
to somewhere like San Francisco I don't
get nothing to move to LA I don't get
nothing moving back to New York City
like I lived in my whole life and I know
how how everything is most people that
come in from small towns they like oh
when I grow up I wouldn't move to the
big city you know what I mean like
that's how they think because in their
in their head they like how they've been
raised in you know the suburbs their
whole life and they haven't really
experienced life that much but once you
hit a certain age man and I'm not saying
that I'm old but I feel like now I think
of you know I think of life like totally
different
especially after my sister passed away I
think I'm life completely differently I
think that I have to minimize the time
that I work for other people and
maximize the time that I spend on my own
projects and I spent on hanging out with
my family that's what that's what drives
me right now you know what I mean so you
know you guys gotta ask yourself that
question so like do you wanna work it up
in a big city and say hey I'm painting a
whole bunch of money just to live in the
city I'm getting paid a lot but in
reality after you you add it up you're
not making more than somebody who was
paying less rent
you're not making more than somebody who
who actually has savings like
until because you get $100,000 doesn't
guarantee that you're gonna be wealthy
you know what I mean look especially
when you you put yourself in situations
like you're living in a $2,400 apartment
like it's kind of crazy you know what I
mean
so yeah man you already know it's your
boy jump back at it again I'm just you
know I'm just talking to you guys try to
open up your eyes and like that
like you know because it's like you have
to think about those small things like
is it really worth it do you do you feel
like working in a big city in a big
company is gonna be beneficial for you
in the long run you know like most
people that I know that working in a
large company they live in the suburbs
which means a lot of times they got a
cultural work for it so I would drive
more an hour and a half train and then
on top of that you're paying for the
training or you're paying for parking in
the city which is like $600 a month so
it's like are you really making money
like that you know what I mean so it's
like you gotta ask yourself you know so
yeah man my advice is working a smaller
company where you might be making twenty
thousand dollars less than working in
the city but when you do the math you're
actually earning bum
then actually working on the city so you
know keep your finances man you stay up
on your finances man you know teen track
of your keep track of how much you
spend when you eat for lunch
keep track of how much you spent every
time you go out keep track of every time
that you buy anything like how much are
you spending how much is your rent keep
track of all of that you know what I
mean so yeah man is it boy Joe back at
it again
