came in here kumbaya you know to this
game and then I realized everybody here
are snakes right and why am i holding
back on opinions that I feel about other
people why am i holding back about
reviewing other people's stuff and why
would I be holding back like I don't
need anybody from here you know I'm not
talking about my subscribers I'm talking
about any other youtuber out there like
as far as like what development write or
programming in general like I don't care
about nobody right because when I start
caring about people then I started
worrying about man should I say this
should I not say that should I
review this person's course should I
review this thing so a reality my only
obligation is to you guys the uterus the
people that view me on YouTube
that's a
I have no responsibility for nobody else
out here right like I'm not responsible
for other youtubers getting upset I'm
not responsible with anything you know
what I mean I'm not responsible for it
you know
so um today we got your boy your boy
Eric back at it again Eric came through
with the I already see that that that
the face army has started spamming the
last clever program of video with dozens
of comments calling him a scammer grabs
popcorn this should be good in all
seriousness I understand that is an
expensive expensive course I get it I'm
waiting for Cassie's response I'm giving
him the benefit of a doubt here's a
public he's a public figure he believes
in in what he sells I don't see a
problem selling expensive course people
buy thousand dollar course make money
online products all the time I think
those people are far worse those people
are far worse if people that if people
take the course and they hate it the
word will get around people stop buying
it the YouTube programming community is
small people talk people talk out here
the YouTube gangsters is gonna come back
at you Joe yeah man three days with a
nicer shirt I bought a whole bunch of
them because there's gonna be like my my
go-to clothing like you know I'm not
gonna be coming in here every single day
with different shirts different clothes
we're basically just gonna have a nicer
shirt that's gonna be my my stick from
now on yeah so so YouTube gangsters is
coming after Joe please guys listen I
separated myself from every youtuber out
there right I separated myself from
everyone
that's a the line has been drawn I don't
care about nobody right who do I see you
on you two who do i watch i watch
Krishan i watch the real cast dara i
watch tough candy i watch coach was the
coding training i watch fun fun function
I watch Chris Hawkes then everybody else
I don't watch them let's be honest last
I just don't watch them right now
well yesterday we talked about was this
Kazi the clever programmer because I am
going back into what I was doing in this
channel which was reviewing courses and
you know this was even a review this was
somebody sent me a long email asking me
like Joe what do you think should I do
this I went to this freaking seminar
whatever webinar and I don't know if I I
suggest you know I should go in and sign
up for this and it's like bro I'm here
to save people's time save people's
money that's what I'm here for
his clever programmer a scammer no I
never said that he's not a scammer he's
just selling courses alright but he's
doing it in a way of how tight Lopes and
every other marketing person every real
estate person out there does it create
of course is that pretty much they're
cheaper everywhere else and then pump it
out to a million people and 1% of the
people are gonna bite into it me
personally I don't wanna know my
subscribers falling for that right
because I know if they gonna go in
instead of spending $500 there's people
here that don't even have a MacBook
right listen this MacBooks that costs
you about $450 2012 MacBook could cost
you 200 on that one or $400 I've seen on
Craigslist I rather my subscribers
people that want to get into this
industry buy themselves a MacBook
instead of
pay you for this course I'd rather to be
a I buy a bottle or MacBook and then
from there they go in and buy a course
on udemy or sign up to team treehouse
ila to whatever a pro would say what I
would then decide right none of the
things that I say here is like hey I'm
I'm freakin forcing people to go head up
for game what's this guy's name
clever programmer like I could care less
about that kid
it could be clever programmer could be
Eric it could be simple programmer could
be Chris Hawks tomorrow comes out with a
freaking $500 course I might tell Chris
you're bugging when the market is
basically from $10 to $50 you're bugging
all right that's what I will tell him
crucial we'll come up with a course
tomorrow but I hey guys I'm charging a
thousand dollars and Hannah you know
hand-to-hand I'll hold your hands for
the next five weeks I'll email you
backing I'll do this all the stuff I'll
be like girl bro you're bugging it
doesn't matter who it is I'm just here
for my subscribers Eric to put it out
there there's a message for you Eric I'm
only here for my subscribers all right I
don't care about dealing with no
youtubers I don't care about nobody here

like I'm not worried about that it's
like if you do something crazy Eric I'm
gonna tell you hey Eric you're bugging
out if you tomorrow you come out with a
course and be like hey your courses 700
hours of course I'll be like bro you're
freakin buggin that's a because I'm here
for the subscribe I'm here for telling
people hey find that cheapest route the
easiest route the best routes for them
how can I tell somebody who comes in
here and be like hey man you know this
stuff here everywhere is twenty ten
dollars $20 and but I'm gonna tell you
hey go ahead and sign up for this $500
thing
instead of using that money for other
stuff that you might need you get what
I'm saying like I'm not here trying
trying to get people I'm not here trying

freaking was this guy's name he lied
that computer guy people send me
messages like you you know is bunking
out that I huh right yeah go to the
channel check it I'm like yo this guy's
buggin
this guy is there's something wrong with
him right so I put it out there
I'm like bro do content and stop
freaking crying about YouTube like do
you see me look my my views dropped now

YouTube drop have anybody here notice me

I'm not gonna cry people started doing
the same things that I was doing and you

people just need to like do what they do
you know I mean like me my channel from
the beginning everybody that has seen me
here and knows my channel you guys know
that my channel is about course reviews
telling you which one of the best
courses which ones are the bad courses

it was extremely like boring it was like
extremely boring the door hit me up

still we still here get money we still
doing it what we got to do I'm not
trying to become a millionaire I'm not

not trying to get none of that because
then people control you you know in the
beginning I realized too you know quote
unquote get get or get to collaborate
with other people you have to kiss their
butt
alright you have to kiss their butt and
keep it in a good terms with them but if
they do something bad you can't say
nothing because I I'm trying to still
collaborate with this person and this
and that it's like I realize I'm like I
don't need to collaborate with nobody
people need to collaborate with me the
source is here people come here every
single youtuber watches this channel
every single one of them you know don't
get a twisted
you know a lot of people don't want to
mention my name they don't want to say
who beyond here sauce in it but every
single day we growing we're the fastest
growing channel out here a lot of these
guys you know they pay for you know
groups the painful promotion they pay
for a lot of stuff this is genuine every
single person that's in here is just
naturally in here you know what I mean
like they fall into this I have a high
have a really high conversion rate from
subscribers from people that watch my
videos move yours to people that
subscribe i high high high high high
high conversion rate lake people watch
this channel they're like oh man where
was this Channel six months ago before I
went to this boot camp where was this
Channel six months ago when I was trying
to get into coding I wish I would have
found this channel that's what people
send me all the time this is not this is
not me making this stuff up you know
what I mean like I don't care about
other programmer youtubers I could care
less guys let's be honest I separated
myself from that community a long time
ago I just happen to talk about coding
but it doesn't mean like I'm part of
that community I I'm not in there man I
separated myself a long time ago months
ago when I started seeing that you know
a lot of stuff that I didn't like I'm
like yeah I can't I can't rock well none
of these people make a lot of corn balls
and a lot of people who are just like
opportunist a lot of people who see this
as a business like when I came in this
thing I saw this thing is YouTube man
you know I mean just YouTube I wasn't
here looking at this is a business now I
have my own separate business on the
side I have other stuff that I have
invested on I have my own websites that
I'm promoting other things that I'm
doing YouTube is YouTube and I'm not
here worrying about you too
you know what I mean yes my mic is
peaking because we screaming let's bring
it down let's bring it down look at that
once again every second my channel is
like this going up all day you know and
this is like genuine people this is not
like no fake accounts this isn't hey I
paid you know a thousand us you know I
paid a freaking $100 to get twenty
thousand freaking subscribers from India
I haven't paid you know money to get
people from the Philippines let's be
honest those are the YouTube tricks like
all these people is generally
subscribers right quality subscribers
this is not people like just just hey
I paid for it this is not people where
I'm like I got one hot video and that's
the only video that people see so they
subscribe to it and then for me they
never come back to the channel know
every single person that comes and
subscribe to my channel comes back every
single day I don't know why is a last
night I was laughing
we was laugh for last night somebody
said yo I've been here for two hours and
a half and I still don't know what the
videos about but I loved it I was just
laughing I'm like y'all this dude is
hilarious
people just come here because they love
the channel people just come here cuz
they're gonna see me they wanna you know
that's something that where I realize
I'm like I'm separating myself like all
those people I'm the one that's bringing
into this this thing into the table none
of these people here know these
youtubers that do programming have a
personality they have no personalities
at all it's like people you know they're
people that you see them in the back of
the room people throwing papers at them
like nobody talks to those kids right a
lot of this youtubers that do
programming that's that's what they are
right there's no personality there
nobody really cares about them they dare
to use them as a document how you go
documentation you come in you watch it -
told you I'm out peace that's it then
I'm on youtuber I want youtuber on
YouTube
you get what I'm saying like if that
makes sense you know what I mean like
that's just how it is
I'm just being honest I'm here to just
do what I do give honest opinion my
YouTube is like what goes on on my brain
if I come in and somebody sends me a
message Joe can you please review this
new thing which I'm also doing a review
on coke Adam ease their pain program and
I'm gonna go into it and see how it is
I'm gonna pay for the one month and then
I'm gonna try it out see how it is a
make a review on it and give it to to
the people that's a you know what I mean
like
we just here man so yeah all right you
know I was like people talk people could
talk I don't care bro like I'm not
worried about freaking people from
YouTube like the programming community
I'm not part of that I'm a youtuber that
just talks about code and talks about
you know real life things you know I was
like Chris Shawn has his channel he's a
vlog slash he's a logger that talks
about code from time to time
he's known he's a vlogger that is a web
developer me I will just I was just a
youtuber like I just happen to be
talking about code sometimes but now I'm
like the more I I am or on this platform
out the more I realize I'm like you know
this is exactly why I did not want to do
a YouTube channel years ago I've been on
YouTube for years since 2007 I've had
other successful channels I've sold
channels all right think I've been doing
this for a long time but the reason why
I didn't want to create like a coding
channel or me talking about my coding
life because I do music I also do you
know I do music I do music reviews I
also had another channel where I was
doing gaming like I've done all of them
right and I never wanted to create a
coding channel because I know how the
coding community is like a lot of this
this dude's is like everybody thinks
that they smarter than everybody
everybody thinks that you know your way
is the wrong way my way is the best way
that's just how it is right you can't
give an honest opinion because people
take it to the heart that I oh my god
like nobody can say anything wrong upon
my my product nobody can say anything
wrong about my framework guys y'all need
to shut the hell up
I think straight-up like let me do what
I do like don't worry about me you know
like you know everything like
I don't go to your chat let's be honest
here I don't go to your channel if I
don't like what I see there so I don't
go to it anymore
clever program I don't go to this
channel because I've never liked what he
had there there was nothing there that
was new it's very clear he had the
coding was according to Tory's 360 was
the first person that I've seen that was
doing high coalesce the the videos of
following coke Adam II and redoing them
himself and like recording I see he did
the the courses he was the first one
that I've seen doing that so I was gonna
do that before that and then I found out
that he was doing it I stopped doing it
clever program I saw him doing it and
then he started doing it you get what
I'm saying like there's really no like
respect of like things that people come
up with and then people will respect
that over here and that's why I can't f
with nobody here on on this YouTube
programmer thing like a lot of this guys
they look at other channels and start
following the trends I can't stand that
because if I come up with an idea and I
have like my own stick and people start
copying what I do that pisses me off
because it's like hey man you don't know
how long it took me to really come up
with this idea oh you don't know how
long I've been doing my work you know I
mean so that's how it is 360 I like the
kid until he started freaking he blocked
me with basically supported on his other
 people on his channel talking
ish about me talking lies about me
people that don't even know me and he's
like yeah he's like I'm gonna support
this people instead of letting the
person give his opinion on it so I say
you know what after I do - as far as
this channel his content his constant is
good
varta watching I don't watch him after
he did that and he freaking did his BS
on our Facebook group I said okay cool
you know what you're a snake so I don't
talk to you
that's it you Eric I feel like you came
in you try to take the sauce I didn't
appreciate that I don't watch you I
don't talk to you that's a it's a lot of
people you know Chris Hawkes
the first time I hit him up he said
something iffy but then again he came
back retracted and we talked it was like
okay you know what he's right it's fine
I moved on for it
who cares it's not a big deal but a lot
of people if like you you do me wrong
and then you freakin you act like you
don't do nothing then if you just get
out of my face you know what I mean like
that's just how I am
clever programmer I don't care about
that Kim never talked to like I don't
even care about the kid but I do care
about my subscribers if my subscribers
asking me Joe should I sign up for this
$500 course I'm like wait what when it's
10 $20 $30 per course you're gonna go
and sign up for this $400 $400 like I'm
not gonna let my subscribers do that
you know somebody is somebody get caught
on that let it be somebody that don't
know that there's other prices out there
this cheaper stuff out there you know
what I mean like that's what my channel
is about I'm gonna be honest with people
and you like it or not you know what I
mean like I'm not here trying to be
friends with nobody here man like
because then it just forces me to be
like nice to everybody like if you do
something dumb you do something dumb I'm
gonna call you out on it that's it and
I'm not calling people out on stuff that
doesn't it's not my business
I'm calling people out on stuff that my
subscribers are gonna get affected on if
right now you to me says hey every
course is out there it's $200 I'm gonna
tell them hey guys
I don't think unit means the right place
for you guys I mean there could be one
course that might be worth it but to be
paying $200 for a full course it's not
worth it that's so much money
selling the same thing when people ask
me about boot camps I tell them the same
thing I'm a yellow boot camps they they
charging you twenty thousand dollars for
something that you can learn with less
than a hundred dollars you got what I'm
saying like you're paying just to show
up in a place and somebody hold you in
in a room for eight hours that's what
you're paying for
so that's ridiculous and that's saying
man you know what I mean like that's why
I'm here for kids I'm here to just be
honest and give you guys give you guys
like the you know the honest opinion of
things you know what I mean like what do
people want me to do - just not answer
my subscribers and give them like real
life freakin comments on things like if
they ask music right now telling you
somebody asks me hey Joe should we go
sign up for this $400 cause I'm gonna
tell them no that's ridiculous
when every other course here is $10 $15
$20 $30 why are you signing up for
something like that go buy yourself a
MacBook Pro that's what you need to
spend money on that's it but we ain't
here man
chip chip chip chip chip chip you know
it's like every time that we come in
here we get like 60 70 people all the
time and like people love the channel
man like this is why I love my channel I
love my subscribers man like we just
here and you know like I'm just being
honest with people I'm gonna give you
guys I'm gonna create a poll I'm gonna
create a poll and be like yo guys do you
guys want me to be honest with you guys
or just be political correct all the
time everybody in the chatroom put yes
or no but yes for me to be political
correct all the time or no to just be
honest what do you guys want I'm leaving
it for you guys if you guys want me to
just be political correct all the time
to every single person out there every
single time and just be like hey I'm
just gonna be political correct just to
keep everybody else happy you guys let
me know you know like you know I'm just
saying though you know what I mean like
the only thing is like I'm guessing most
of us don't give a give a damn
now it's true man you know what I'm
saying like exactly I'm just demeaning
people acting like I need others like I
need other youtubers like I could care
less I mean that's right that's like my
whole stick my whole shtick is that's
always koko de face the real development
real web developer like I'm just being
honest here man you know when a
framework is bad a framework is bad man
you know and people get mad there's
people that just hate me after that I'm
like oh man why are you saying this
about this framework guys I just have to
be honest you know what I mean like I
just have to be honest it's not that
it's not that hard man that's all I'm
saying you know what I mean and I repeat
again I've never said that
this kid is a scam because he might have
a good course I haven't taken it what
I'm saying is at that price you could
get a lot for that price
that's it do people want me to be honest
and you be like hey guys
go ahead go spend $500 like there's
people here with a a Windows XP computer
like there's people somebody hit me up
about this right they have a Windows XP
computer but they want to go spend $700
at some arm some two-hour training thing
for a full-stack JavaScript I'm like bro
you have a Windows XP computer and
you're you trying to spend several
hundred dollars on this you get what I'm
saying like I'm giving people the real
options the real things like you know
what what might be good
this is that you know khasim I realize
like you this is ridiculous this price
is ridiculous let's bring it down to a
reasonable price that's a and then you
guys could go ahead and sign up when he
brings it to a reasonable price I'll go
and I'll tell you guys guys go check out
his course you get what I'm saying
like that's just how it is
just what was that eat a just came out
with Star Wars Battlefront 2 right and
basically to be able to get any
character you have to play like 2,000
hours or if now you have to pay for it
the communal what the community did
everybody talked about it and what they
had to do EA had to bring it down bring
down the price on it
because they will be ridiculous that's
it and that's all I'm saying
you know what I mean like I feel like
man what'd you say I couldn't read what
you said before 40 hours of what I
missed it
yeah like 40 hours yeah something like
that yeah yeah you had to bring down the
prices that's what I'm saying like the
community has to talk about it you get
what I'm saying like there is nothing
wrong with selling there's nothing wrong
with profiting it's just when it's kind
of ridiculous is ridiculous people
cannot get mad at that
Kazi cannot get mad at that I don't even
know why this kid Eric is getting mad
about that
like why are you getting about just me
being honest I'm just saying my
subscribers don't go pay $400 especially
when a lot of you guys walking around
with a Windows XP like go spend that
money is something that you really need
you need a new computer you need you
know need a new computer you need to be
having an SSD these people here that
don't even have they have Windows 10
with a are freaking 5400 freaking hard
drive like go get yourself a SD are
freaking not as the nada SD s SD
freaking hard drive like exactly like
nobody could be real now like that's
what I'm saying
even SD card man these people walking
around with with like crazy hard drives
like if you really want to be blowing
money up like that man
because there's the thing sometimes
people they believe that spending a lot
of money for something means that it's
value on it and that I owe ya P you know
somebody like you know somebody might
going right I'm gonna buy a Gucci belt
all right they're gonna go buy a Gucci
belt but uh freaking a Ferragamo belt my
cost let's say $100 less than the Gucci
belt and people will be like oh the
Gucci belt was better than the Ferragamo
because it costs $100 more and it's like
no you don't you don't look thank do the
research one is made by freaking
snakeskin and the other one is made with
regular freakin high Cola leather like
which one's gotta be more more better
you know what I mean like come on yes
SSD the best investment somebody could
do for the computer you know what I'm
saying like that's all I'm saying to
people people cannot get mad about that
people cannot forget matter of me you
know it's like it's a gray now somebody
could come in and make a review about me
that's fine I'm not gonna get mad right
I'm not gonna get mad unless they took
something personal about me if they
talked about my course if they talked
about my website if they talked about my
channel fine I'm not gonna get mad what
was this kid's name
Titus what was his name
Titus this kid he made a video about me
and I was like fine that's great right
the only thing that I said was he said
something about that my subscribers are
like this a lot of people who they look
at my channel like oh like this is like
you know like hey this isn't cool over
here and let's see the cool clapping or
what
right and now my subscribers just come
here because they want to learn you got
I'm saying so that's what I told him but
at the same time I did like his review
that he made about my channel cuz he
took his time to make a review about it
you get what I'm saying like that's it
so long as you make a review about my
courses or my channel whatever you want
to talk about I don't care I'm not gonna
be like hey man people talk the
community talks this doesn't that man
the community suck money straight up
like I'm not looking to be friends with
none of these people I don't I'm looking
to just be honest and give my opinion
like I'm independent I can talk whatever
the hell I want I can say whatever the
hell I want if I feel a certain way I'm
gonna say it's that simple
yeah so now but I like to his his review
though on the channel I like what he
said about the channel you don't like he
said a lot of good and bad things and I
liked it only thing that he liked was
when he says something about my
subscribers like my subscribers are only
here for you know for whatever for it
then now I wasn't the entertainment it
was something like that but that was
about it
I just think I'll being like let's be
honest here there's a lot of people who
don't even have enough experience on
things and be talking about it people
talk about things even they give advices
and it's like you've only been a
developer for one year like you still a
junior developer you're giving advice
you know what I'm saying like people
it's people that we giving out advice
and you like you just got a job
how are you giving advice you just got a
job you know what I mean
you've never worked for any major
company and yet you're freaking selling
courses like like that's a-- that's how
i feel about certain things you know
what i mean like that's just how I am
that's that's how I feel about things
right anyways man let's move on from
this we got 50 people in here we got the
squad notification get whole lot of dish
you know people love this man why you
guys love this why you guys don't don't
come in here you know a lot of you guys
come in here when when I'm over here

nerdy stuff why yeah yeah I enjoy when
I'll be ranting man well I just like let
it out oh god why's not working is
working the stream is working
you know man
anyways man we're here we got the squad
listen man coinbase don't went up again
for those of you guys that didn't get
the chance to buy right here I got the
chance to buy so it was cool I enjoy
myself buying some coins so we're back
Bitcoin is back kids we going straight
to the top with this one I think is
gonna be like ten thousand dollars guys
I'm being honest I think it's gonna get
to ten thousand dollars it theory um is
up a little bit - lets see I sold a lot
man I had I messed up I got nervous
right I got nervous and I sold all right
when I started going down I got nervous
and I sold I sold a whole bunch of money
like last year what was it I think no it
was this year in the summertime let me
see what time did I was around yeah
around September yeah cuz I bought it
here at 2801 there and then I had a okay
went up and I was hype I was like okay
we go into 5,000 and then they started
doing a drop and then I I sold it I had
about like two bitcoins at that point I
sold it and then I was like I was over
here I was like man should I buy again
and then I bought and then it went back
down as I know
it went back down it's happening again
so then I just bought a little bit when
it went down to 5,000 something this
week like I bought a little bit of a
back but man I should have kept that
with a hat like what I would have
probably had like $20,000 right now in
Bitcoin but Ezra is a learning
experience
you know we just buy man like you see
that what I'm saying like umph I'm
always on YouTube I'm always checking
other people's YouTube channels but I
don't check I don't check for
programming channels like I does just me
that's just me I don't check for these
people if people don't send me emails
about other other people and other crazy
stuff that they're doing I could care
less
like I don't check none of these people
you know when they show up on my thing
there's what I do to people whenever I
see somebody that I don't care about and
this is something that you guys should
learn you know like there's a lot of BS
channels out there so when you come down
here on this little corner you click
here not interested you know and then
video removed and then you don't see
them again on your related things a lot
of these people that keep showing up on
my comments and this and that like
that's what I do to them
I don't watch them I already have them
block from my YouTube like I don't watch
them I don't care when they drop a video
I don't look at them like they don't
exist to me you know what I mean so yeah
man yeah Bikaner is a freaking scam is a
Ponzi scheme man
let me see so let's get any question
guys let me know was good man sorry for
this little rent you know I apologize
you know sometimes we just we gotta give
you one rent per week at least you know
man so let's see who's in here I was in
here man
if you know HTML CSS right you can get a
job out there if you know sass it adds
value to your skills it makes it work
easier because writing plain CSS is
annoying so it definitely you could get
a job like people be acting like they
can't get a job with just HTML CSS guys
there's plenty of jobs out there plenty
search content editor that's a search
content editor out there a content
editor is somebody like let's say you
work for let's say you work for Amazon
right the people that add the products
right or they have to go in there and
edit some some of the products or do
little changes those are content editor
those people all they need to know is
HTML CSS if you work for a blog all you
need to know is HTML CSS if you work for
an e-commerce website where they looking
for a content editor somebody who comes
in and writes down the description for
the products all you need is HTML CSS
that can be your first job that was my
first job my first job was adding
products to ebay and creating the HTML
CSS for it and I was getting paid for it
now you might think oh that's not a web
development job no it is web development
because you're doing coding in HTML and
CSS all right from there you grow to
your next position because like I always
tell you guys the important thing is to
get that first job so somebody could say
and they could vote for you and say hey
I trusted this guy we hired him so you
could trust him you know a lot of you
guys are going for those top jobs
they're like man I need to get those top
jobs and it's like now you need to start
at the bottom that's what you're gonna
do you need to start because yes you
could get those top jobs but now you're
leaving it to luck you leaving it to
luck to be like oh am I gonna be lucky
to get that job today
you know what I mean like now if you
show it will hard-working showing your
skills throughout the years you're gonna
get that top job just by showing your
portfolio and showing that you know
everything you get what I mean
now it depends on the job depends on the
job like content editor you don't have
to write the articles I mean if you to
be honest if you work for a like a blog
where you're writing a different content
that's different but this also things
called content editors where all you
have to do is go into that message
somebody has a cuz it there's the two
difference this copywriter
this is terms that you guys should know
copywriter is the person who writes the
article the content editor is the person
that puts it in so you go what I'm
saying like there's so many different
jobs man
yes I think CMS's they push some people
out of jobs like you know back in the
day you know back in the days because
everybody back into this used to have
like little web design agencies or you
know people were I remember there was
like graphic or was a graphic design
offices where people would come in and
be like hey could you build me a website
like people used to have that back in
the early 2000s now you have WordPress
you could literally be a wordpress
developer from your house build a
wordpress site for somebody and then
let's say they have a website online
back in the days they needed to code
that from scratch
but yeah man we're here man we ain't
here

questions any comments anything you guys
want to say let me know
yes go ahead and try man look online man
look on decom search content editor I
mean all you really in reality they're
gonna actually do you know playing
English you do you know English you know
cuz some people don't even know how to
write you know they're just gonna
actually like you if you know English
like you know how to spell it'll be
sometimes as a constant editor your copy
and pasting all the time and sometimes
you might make a mistake in and put in
something that's missing a letter or you
know misspelling you have to make sure
that all the spelling is good that's it
eggs it's like hey Joe why don't you

simple program is probably the smartest
person out here he look I've heard of
John Thomas years ago like years ago
like John Samus is like an OG triple og
of the internet like I don't want to
talk about that guy
god bless him you know like he's an OG
like you know he's made money man like
he's definitely made money I like when
he talks about high colas I love when he
talks about real estate I hate when he
talks about other stuff but I love he
talks about real estate yeah yeah there
was one video in John Thomas John
summers I I see him once in a while when
when they show him a my a my YouTube
related he's like one of the only people
that I don't have blocked like God like
I actually want to see what I want to
see him in my related videos
Jenica sometimes they be so crazy that I
watch it you know like there is a video
where it's like something like I have a
small penis what do I do
like what John Thomas is like answering
what do you do if you have a small penis
like yo yo like really yeah it's like or
somebody sent him a question like I
can't get a girlfriend what do i do
Johnson is like I'm being honest like a
lot of the stuff that people ask some
other like where do these people get the
courage to ask this question like like
if I had a small penis I was just like
I'll crawl under a rock I'll put myself
under a rock like this I don't want
nobody to know I don't want nobody to
ever see me I will be hiding I wouldn't
even ask that question just to be scared
that somebody might find my IP address
and find out I have a small penis
I want any ice that right that's what I
would do like who are we asking this
question to John so it's you know where
do when does he find his people you know
it was like that's like you know you
start getting people like Sam on it nice
like Sam senses a message like hey guys
what should I do man I have a small
penis
John Samus what do we really believe is
like yo this dude this dude is like yo
this dude talking ish if it was his name
Jordan Jordan Jordan took ish and he's
been here for like an hour and now we're
in change he's like this guy's the guy
who talked about Eli he came to set up
his bike properly lol what a do we use
of my words those are actually my words
cuz I called people on here dweebs
you're bringing for he being here for
like an hour I saw his comment like an
hour ago
he's been here for like an hour chilling
just watching and joined the show he's
like yeah let me say something crazy you
know I'll be enjoying this this freakin
thing man Oh God Oh God people are
hilarious oh my god yo number one let's
be honest guys did I say
Kazi is a scammer no I said the prices
are ridiculous for something that you
could get for $10 is there something
wrong with that if you come in here
right guys if you come in here and you
better hate Joe don't buy this because
you could get this for cheaper here and
it doesn't make sense
I'll be like okay cool you you're right
you know what I mean
Oh God people get so mad people can't
nah scanner a scammer I think a scammer
is different a scammer is when somebody
scams right scammer is is a scam well
you're basically like I say if somebody
signs up and be like there's it's like
we hate we got your credit card and now
you're giving it out to like the
Nigerian Network you know what I mean
like that's a scam right but if you're
like freaking if you just over pricing
things man that's not that's not a
scammer that's just saying like hey man
you're overdoing it
you're like the ee of web development
you like the the freaking the Tai Lopez
of a web development oh god yeah these
are Larry's man let's see let's fight
let's see what he got less YouTube the
YouTube like a three thousand dollar
laptop and you know why I got it so I
can make tutorials for the people who
are following me on Windows so I could
just make the tourist I hate Windows
alright nothing nothing
from clever programmer calm let me fix
the camera just a little bit all right
how's everybody doing today we have
quite a few people on Instagram Facebook
trying to get some people hi YouTube
yeah I got a kind of a crazy story of a
lot of these things and instead of you
know choosing to ignore a lot of these
things I think it's a good idea to talk
about them and bring them up because I
think it just opens up a dialogue
between you know everybody you know fast
word I don't have time to be watching
all those he probably made this video
you know I don't know why but he spent
about 30 minutes of just a lot of
negative energy into one video because
when I look at something like that I'm
light pink and don't get a really angry
at the driver that just crosses them
really quick something else maybe moving
themselves forward in life or like
trying to reach your goals or but I'm
just like okay this is a good thing to
talk to people about because I think it
just shares a lot of it brings out a lot
of value okay so the videos going
literally like each word is like this
kid you know he's a scammer he's running
a scheme he's trying to rob people and
that's kind of the overtone of the
entire video and I'm just watching it
and I'm like wow taking of them
unfortunately didn't even make much
sense I was like you know
there are a lot of places in life like
there are a lot of times in oh my god
but just answer this is the thing he's
walking around this whole thing bro
nobody called you a scammer right nobody
coziest give him a kick people what
people are saying is people was asking
me hey should I be signing up for this
500 on a freaking course bro your course
is not worth $500 let's be honest these
people that are more accomplished who
really know about Python who really use
it and then on top of that it's like
you're trying to teach Python for what
development if it was like 4k for
software development or for machine
learning but you're teaching Python for
web development when most of these
people are not gonna be able to get a
job with that right okay let's see for
my new course called the profitable
programmer and he was saying that nobody
should ever pay this much for a course
and he says that if anybody were to pick
if he were ever to make a course like
this somebody should just slap him in
his face and then goes on to say if
cause he worked at Google then I would
pay you know $500 for this course yeah
otherwise there's no way and I'm sitting
there and I'm thinking and I'm like you
know who else didn't work at Google
Sergey Brin and Larry Page who started
Google but this thing's pretty put the
thing about the price man this way
this is what I'm saying like people get
upset and people don't like when people
get called out on their own thing bro
watch the whole video the whole video is
about somebody asking me hey should I
pay $500 for this I'm like nobody should
be paying for
dollars for this thing it's that simple
I'm not gonna watch freaking hello 25
minutes of this livestream what where's
the answer on a discount overwork him
wasted lose me where do you talk about
the prize no one called you ascii a scam
at the video again your course is
overpriced thank you
like this is what I'm saying like people
you can't get upset if somebody comes in
and tells me Joe your course is over
front over price it's overpriced bro
like look it up like I'm not gonna spend
time watching this kids video because I
know he probably didn't watch my whole
30 minute video and the whole 30 minute
video was just like me answering the
same question over and over and over
again
the course is $500 and you bringing
people in for a webinar and telling them
hey you go get a are 400 it's not worth
$400 like only 1% of the people are
gonna gonna pay that like nobody's gonna
pay that bro like who's paying that like
it's kind of sad that anybody you know
it's kind of sad that anybody will even
consider pain that when there's like
literally ten thousand better freakin
options out there that's it that's all
I'm saying
where's the answer where is my answer
what is my answer Kazi what is my answer
I'm out of here
I just feel bad then you're gonna write
on his chat I'm outta here
I just feel bad people asking me should
they pay $400
now I'm gonna fight disagree pay $500
okay so you are reaching
okay region 4 that 1% that will fall
into that all right I'm out how will
going kids yell back at it again yeah
that's ridiculous
oh man man you know what I mean guys
like we just here trying to give the
subscribers the best thing that we can
man like there's the problem with people
I'm a youtuber I'm the same person as
any of you guys here who are subscribers
to me I'm a youtuber I come in here I
come check out you to become release my
videos here do I want to be exposing
this people no do I have time for it
yes do I have time for it exposing now
the question is out of those people that
are there who's buying the course many
people let's be honest even people are
his subscribers you see the hole you see
the whole thing there's like if we was
just like people are leaving the
comments like if it was so affordable
like I'm only bringing out the things
that people are saying I just happen to
have a youtube people live out his
comments and you delete it all the time
you know you leave a comment you turn
yes make it
affordable for people right you know
what he does deletes that comment so
just make it affordable nobody's telling
you you're scared I'm just saying like
me personally if I wanted to pay $500
I would pay for like somebody who's like
really legit not like some kick from
like some kid from like a I
don't even know from where he from from
Pakistan Oh like I'm not buying a course
from some kid I think you know somebody
who's just starting you know what I'm
really like I'm gonna show you guys this
is um this is this guy who sells angular
courses and I'm planning on buying for
him
let me see is it this one where's the
newest there you go this guy alright I'm
planning on buying a course from this
guy because I wanna learn from this guy
right now this guy look at this thing
this is what I'm saying this guy is
charging two hundred ninety-eight
dollars for angular and you know pro
typescript basics typescript master
class right but at the same time has a
lot of stuff that he's giving out with
it right now why would this guy be
charging this much you probably ask
yourself look up his name Todd motto
this is not this is not like some dude
this is not me right like somebody might
google my name Lee block a this person
has worked on a couple of companies he's
a legit person no this guy has worked
for every major company out there and
not only that does he actually gives out
training to all his major companies and
he's charging $230
you get what I'm saying like this guy
works for all of these companies like
he's he's legit whenever they they
announce anything new with angular
here's the guy they go to you get what
I'm saying like I don't know can people
understand what I'm saying here you get
what I'm saying like like this guy is
charging a set amount for something that
he's a a professional in like this guy
this is what he does now little Kazi is
not it's not this dude to be charging
$400 that's just how it is man and I'm
sorry you have to point that out you
know if people that if people never ask
me ask me about it I never have to talk
about it but if I have to expose him be
like hey man you're bugging out nobody's
gonna pay you $400 for that you know
what I mean you know god bless him he's
probably gonna do all freakin 40 minute
hour long stream about me god bless you
man
so long as you you bring down the prices
and make it affordable for people and
charge people what the frickin course is
really supposed to be you know how much
you supposed to be selling like come on

saying

don't hate me every day every morning of
the day you know I was like you know god

like told my subscribers like hey man

when he brings it down to less than $100
go ahead check it out take it you know
I'm not trying to stop his money I'm not
telling him don't buy from this guy
