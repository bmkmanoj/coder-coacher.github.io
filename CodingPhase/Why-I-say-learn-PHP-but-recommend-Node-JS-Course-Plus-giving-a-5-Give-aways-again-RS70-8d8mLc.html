go was good how's everybody doing a
little quick live video I went outside
real quick and I say you know what man
let's do this live video outside let's
enjoy this nice weather and it's still a
little nice video right yeah man what's
good I'm gonna let you guys get in here
first before I started going real hard
into this arm so yeah so yesterday
let me see give me a second give me just
a second I don't know if this thing is
live or not I don't know what's going on
with Google Google is acting up okay let
me see so we live I think I say let me
go to live control yeah so we're doing
another five more giveaways right well
what happened was remember I told you
guys that if nobody actually contacted
me going to just gift those gifts to you
guys because nobody really reached out
because like sometimes the people come
in to this channel and you see the
message giveaway right so they fill out
the form they fill out everything and
then they're not really viewers that
watch the channel every time that a
video drop so yeah um James Brown was
actually nice enough to actually give
you guys his gift
cuz he's already he already got all the
courses he already got everything
and I guess financially he's good right
so he basically he give away his gift so
I think that was nice and nice enough of
him to actually do it so I'm gonna show
you guys the message that he left so
yeah he's right here he's like oh snap I
won
but hey Joe I already bought up udemy
courses and I don't need no ramp so you
can give my gift just someone else who
might need it more than I do for the
work you do and I'll keep watching I
really think that's like super nice in
him being honest like that's super nice
for him to do and I really appreciate it
cuz you know the whole idea this
giveaway is to help people get motivated
to this industry and help them get to
the next level
all right so if they need a course let
me get it full right if they need
something in the hardware that's messing
up and like a SSD or it would be nice to
get I don't know something reasonable
right will help them out so five of you
guys now get the chance to do Larry let
me see who's online live let me see
who's in here again
ah who's in here we got
see love we got Coney we got your own
Smith
we got digital jazz we got FinTech with
our land oh we got max we got cam we got
Frank got Elon Musk of course we got
Cronus we gotta say Harrison we got
Reuben who else we got crayon Casey who
else is in here y'all Henry I appreciate
it Henry gave a little a little donation
a little dollar donation definitely
appreciate it that's how we actually get
to give more gifts
so everyone here cuz the idea is not
nobody wants to come here but I hey
let's make Joe rich that's not the idea
this right I would be just a piece
of like tie and Lopez and whatever
right like I'm not here for that I'm
here to help people up and just like
help to motivate just motivate them a
little bit you know sometimes it's like
sometimes you're like man I only got
twenty dollars in my pocket I can only
buy one course right and then if you got
a little something from the giveaway you
know man I call it get the what
developers bootcamp but now I'm able to
get something else because Joe gave it
to me for free and it's paid by the
community here you know this whole thing
is paid from everybody you know like I
put in whenever nobody donates anything
or nobody helps out or um sometimes
there's days dollar debt like a trade up
these days are dead and I make $2.00
right and I still give away no but
it's fun because God is gonna throw
something good at me you know one of
these days so it's fine well yeah man um
how's everybody man house here yeah we
can go in man and well yeah before I
even though all this crazy
and numbers that we are about to do
right now for everybody that's here live
don't go away don't leave because what
we're going to do we're gonna do the
same thing that we did yesterday we're
gonna give away arm five gifts right to
people that are here on this live feed
right because this like a lot of times I
give away to people that nobody
here in seas or knows or dare be like
who the hell
you
subscriber like nobody Oh yo yo yo
yo let me know can y'all hear me man
it's people every time I'm live
did everybody wanna call me you know can
y'all hear me now
it's kind of ridiculous man every time
somebody calls me this day like I'm
right now connected to the frickin
Verizon Wi-Fi man oh yeah
 is crazy bro guess I'm Karen here
my fault man oh yeah so like what I was
saying like don't leave the chat the
live video because this is where we
gonna give away those five gifts so
right now we got 40 people right so out
of those 40 people you know we're
basically five people are gonna get
assigned to it but yeah man so this
topic that I wanted to talk about
because somebody send me a message right
and I don't know maybe it should be
nothing on my email I don't show his
information right but he basically
emailed me and told me hey um you're
telling us to get the course from coal
steel guess course but you tell us to
learn PHP makes sense right and I agree
with him
right cuz I'm I tell people hey as a
beginner earn PHP to get a job right but
if you have no idea if you know nothing
Nathan or how the web works Colt steel
is the best course that I can actually
recommend for
because it actually teaches you HTML
which is the view right
HTML CSS which is the styling then from
the you get JavaScript JavaScript is the
programming language of the web then
from there you get to learn jQuery which
makes your life easier if you're not so
used to on JavaScript and the Dom right
then from there it teaches you no js'
and then after no js' it teaches you
MongoDB and teaches you user
authentication way we're basically
Heikal is passport write all of this
different are libraries that are very
helpful for somebody who is all
completely gay in there because most of
the people that come here they think oh
it's easy to make a website yes it's
easy to make a webpage it's very easy
you can learn that right away right if
you learn that in one day one session
you could build that you could build a
page with a title you can mail the page
where image that's it that's a webpage
right but there's so much to list so
much else that comes with this day right
it's not just just that what page right
because as I think about it like this
when you go to Facebook you go to
Facebook right you lando facebook.com/
what that does it goes to the server
gets a page that is actually in the
routes views and basically that's the
home page it shows it to you there from
there you get to either sign up or log
in right now if you click sign up you
sign up you fill out your information
your email your whatever you first name
last name address whatever right for now
that information gets saved into another
computer I'm not which is another server
right the database is being held
so that getting saved there right so
that's now we're talking about not only
are you learn do you have to learn how
to build that first page now how to
communicate with that computer which is
the server right you know I'm just
saying computer because I want to make
it as simple as possible for somebody
who have no knowledge of this to
actually understand it so you have to
come in connect to that computer
definitely get that information saved in
there and then from there be able to log
in that user and now with the users
permission you give that user a
permission and say hey you're a regular
user you're not cause you're not a
moderator you're not an administrator
you're not a web developer you're just a
user so you have to be able to give that
person permissions right then from there
you get two messages you send messages
which has to deal with WebSockets
so much complex information in there
that if you start thinking about it
you're like man how the hell am I gonna
learn all of this shame it's hard you're
not gonna be able to learn that in three
months that's why I said before hey oh
those boot camps that tell you hey
you're you're gonna become web developer
in three months no that's
you're gonna become a junior developer a
junior developer is just somebody who
knows the basics right and it just takes
time it's like like I always bring this
up it's like being a doctor a doctor is
not a doctor until he does all the
schoolwork you know sometimes it takes
eight years sometimes it takes ten years
sometimes if you're specialized on
something it takes 15 years
that's what programming web development
being a developer is that's why we get
paid so much right yes there's
astronomical numbers where you see
online with like hey we're looking for
our reactive Alipore for $180,000 but
they're not looking for a react
developer
just like that man I hear we want to
reactive elaborate no they're looking
for somebody who has knowledge who has
built a whole bunch of web applications
over the years half of a great track
record right - let's say uh go means tax
or what was the other one
 JPMorgan and they're gonna hire
you to create their you know
their financial system even
bloomberg.com
they're not gonna hire you to build our
webpage patient just because you know
react there has to be a a track
record of your work over the years and
that's how you get one hundred eighty
thousand two hundred thousand dollars
alright so it takes time alright now
when I tell you guys hey learn this this
course is because that course is going
to teach you the basics it's gonna get
you on a route that's gonna teach you
everything that's going on on the web
right everything from the front end to
the back end now you can take that
information from that course and
implement it to every other language out
there when I took that course I
basically I learned a and I was
like you know or man I took that course
and I was like you know what I can
actually implement this to other things
I can actually implement this to you
know PHP you can input it to real rails
I can implement it to Django because all
of this information is what I need to be
able to work with those other four going
to programming languages and to use it
on the web the web is the web right
software development is software
development like the that you're
learning here on web development
it doesn't really translate to Android
development iOS development it's not the
same
right but if you say hey I learned
something I know how to do this in PHP
you can translate that into Ruby or
rails nodejs you can translate it to a
whole bunch of different other stacks
once you learn it ones you're good one
of the also one of the reasons why I
don't promote that many courses from PHP
or tell people hate recommend them of
course on PHP because there's so much
good content out there for free right
there's already enough content out there
for free of PHP because PHP has been
around for over twenty thirty years I
don't know
so a reality like if you learn every
different what developers bootcamp you
could just go to PHP was it a PHP comp
is PHP dot org
um the documentation it's feed on net
and you could actually go in there and
look at the the syntax or even go to or
Koch Adam II course that's free online
right and learn PHP the syntax right and
when I say the syntax that means just
how the programming language works
because once you go through that code
steal course you're gonna learn
everything you have everything every
tool that you need is already there for
web development like period there's
nothing else different there's nothing
else that's gonna be like I don't know
where it's gonna surprise me like oh my
god we don't know you know this year
they came out with something new
no the web is the web the web is
the same that's been around since
the 1990s the only difference is they
change a little extra feature to say hey
this year we're dropping this HTML tag
well it still works on every
browser they just tell you is like when
people come to me and they tell me hey
oh you using the sensor tag oh my god
that got the print was it deprecated a
long time ago yes
well every browser still
uses it every browser still um you know
parses the code no matter what because
the web is the web guys you like
it or not probably 10-15 years from now
the web is still gonna be the
same what this guy's here who have been
working on website since the 1990s when
we was little kids and we was
watching and the maniacs and we was
watching Batman and Superman or
on The WB they were coding and
they still got jobs because the web is
still the web is still the same thing so
when I tell you learn this courses from
cold steel is because he's teaching you
the basics he's teaching you everything
that's gonna have that you're gonna need
for the rest of your life pretty much
then from there everything else is just
learning something new new feature that
somebody added it's like JavaScript
right if you know JavaScript
you know JavaScript if you learn
JavaScript in 1990 it's the same
JavaScript from now
now the only difference is to change a
little thing to use es6 es6 is still
JavaScript it's just basically adding
new functions that's it that's also one
of the best things about this type of
armed career is that you always gonna
keep on relearning the same that
you already learned right and I'm I'm
getting to this point where I'm starting
to feel like you know those older senior
developers that when I was young when I
was finally when you like you guys age
right yeah probably my age anyways but I
think of you guys young cuz you guys are
starting now most of you guys that some
of you guys are been here for a while
but like you guys are young in the game
right you're very young and sometimes we
come in and you be like man this old
heads just a head thing
they don't know what they're talking
about you know the latest and the
greatest best right now as I go and as I
learn more
and I become more of a software engineer
a UI engineer because that's pretty much
where I'm at right now when I came in I
came in as a like what designer slash
Union web developer whatever right but
now with order the that I'm doing
now I'm to the point where I'm like I'm
pretty up there now you know so the line
is like you level what but then I'm now
think about I'm like man I used to be
one of those guys where I used to be
like it doesn't make sense man
why is he you know telling me to learn
PHP but he's telling me to go buy a
course on ojs it doesn't make sense to
me
that's because right now you're very
young you don't understand the concept
that the web is the wet yeah and
I'm not when I curse people don't think
I'm mad don't think that a less hard
talk that's how I explain things I talk
to you guys like you guys are my friends
right
so this I'll talk to my friends so yeah
so when I tell you get this course is
because this course is gonna teach you
the basics of everything it's gonna go
in and out of the whole web
everything in the web is distinction
when they come up with a new JavaScript
framework I'm doing is like why are we
still recreating the same
or but with a with a little bit a
different syntax right that's why I
don't like PJs
because PJs is pretty much a the
ugly baby of angular and react and it's
like if I know angular which I do and if
I know react which I do and I know how
to use webpack which I do and I know how
to use go which I do why
the would I want to use something
called view Jas or view Jas is to me for
people that are just getting into the
industry
developer does use of UGS are I can
respect them because in the sense I'm
not talking about none of youtubers I'm
talking about in the sense of like
establish developers like you can't
respect it because it's like you're
you're using something that you already
know you know what I'm really like this
a big difference
there's really no speed differences
between reactive UGS at all but people
say hey there's it's so much faster no
it's not it's the same I've
actually built the same the
exact same web application in both in
view and react and they both flowed at
the same time
even with production all right even when
I put into production even why do I
 put it to Jesus they both load
at the same time now the reason why
people want to use it is because they
want to try something new they want to
say hey I'm on the latest thing but it's
not right it's not really that
important at all so sorry I'm going to
this rant but when when I tell you guys
to learn this courses for a reason guys
and I say you know it's for a reason you
can learn you all you have to do is you
could choose right now you can say hey I
want to learn Python development in
Python I want to learn web development
and Ruby on Rails I'm gonna learn what
development in PHP I want to learn web
development in nodejs right it does not
matter which one you pick at all what
matters is what type of jobs you're
gonna be able to get in your area right
now I mean any language that you want
it's like me I love Ruby that's one of
my favorite languages ever and now
crystal Ling I'm in love with crystal oh
that's my bitch right so yeah so it's
like I love the
those languages but that's not I was
what I get hired for Howie here where I
live in my location right so for you
guys you guys can learn this in any
language you want if I tell you hey
learn the code cold steel core is right
it's not for the language of jobs it's
not like oh I want you to learn
JavaScript it's not for that is because
the basically the the features and the
tools that he's giving you in the
tutorials that hey though in the way he
chose it easy for you to understand how
the web works and then you could
take that information and implement it
to every other language you want that's
it
it's like right now guys it's in English
right I can say I can create I know the
concept of creating sentences right and
knowing that once I finish at the end of
the sentence I put a dot that same
concept I could go and take it to any
other language out there English
it doesn't matter if it's Spanish it
doesn't matter if it's Portuguese it
doesn't matter if it's Japanese
there's a dot at the end there's
a way to read either from the left to
the right or to the right to the left or
from the top to the bottom that's a
concept that you're learning later right
and it's the same way as anything else
in this world just because you learn how
to change the tire in a Honda
doesn't mean you can't change it in a
BMW it's that simple
all right so because you guys stood with
me and I was cool
