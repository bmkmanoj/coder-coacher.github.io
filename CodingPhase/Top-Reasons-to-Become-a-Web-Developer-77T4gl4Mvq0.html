back at it again man : face calm
good boy is backing I didn't did it
again alright listen I'm gonna give you
guys my top reasons why you should
become or what the minute right very
soon
number one is a chameleon job so it's
definitely not a sorted job so for you
who has been looking for a job for let's
say 3 to 6 months you probably think in
your head man it's hard finding a job is
hard finding a job with benefits and
hard finding a job that you know I can
actually build something in and get to
grow in my career but with what
development and just being a what
developer general late there's so many
jobs and so many recruiters that want to
give you top dollar because the more
money that they give you the more money
that they get all right so that's one of
my reasons right number two is the fact
that you constantly learning so you're
not going to be bored it's not like you
became a mechanic and that's a or you
became I don't know a free game
marketing agent or a salesperson for
Allstate and all you're doing is the
same thing they usually last year the
same thing that you did the year before
and that's going to be the same thing
that you'll be doing for the next three
to four years of your life right no
with web development every six months
you're doing something different every
six months you you come in in and you're
learning as a new framework on a new
technology you know a new language you
always going to be learning all right so
that's one of the reasons why it just
it's not it's not one of those careers
that you're going to be bored with it's
like you're always going to be learning
something new so I will definitely say
hey man you gotta learn what the little
bit if you love you know stimulating
your brain and becoming like somebody
who we just have a lot of knowledge
right number three I will say the
community just the community alone is
enough to carry anybody into this career
right just because it's like let's say
you have a problem you could go on Stack
Overflow you'll find the answers you can
go to even reddit sometimes you'll find
people that will help you out or even
like let's say your job you're a junior
developer you're going to have a senior
developer who no matter what is going to
always help you out no matter what if
you you have any issues any problems
he's going to come in help you out and
tell you hey this is how you actually do
this are you know start can I help you
you know I've done this before so let me
give you the answers right so that
happens all the time
and that's one of the best ways to learn
because once you have that senior
developer is like you could pick his
brain or her brain right and just try to
get as much information as you can so
you could become a better developer
right another one is the pain like I
said before there's a million jobs out
there you know so number four is
definitely the pain just the fact that
you can live a very good life being a
developer you know most careers right
now they're paying people thirty forty
thousand as a starting point and that's
for like people who are not developers
right but when you are developer if you
have the skills will have the right
portfolio you can start at the top
automatically it's not it's not rare
that you hear that you know it's not
rare that you hear that from other
 people like you know what they
come in and they tell you hey man my
first job I got 80k that happens all the
time it's not it's not something rare I
like oh my god like
they only happens to one person though
it happens to a lot of people if you at
the right place at the right time you
will get that all you need is the right
portfolio right and then another thing
is I will say for me is just just having
that pride you know wait when somebody
comes in access view hey what do you do
for work you be like hey I work for you
know I work for Amazon or you say
something like oh I work for you know
ecommerce website we basically we sell
about 20 million dollars in you
in products right here I got a pretty
good pay first and every watch is like
do you have benefits and you have this
and I'm like yeah I got that
all right so there's like some type of
pride that you can have from being a
developer you like you can just
literally is like being an engineering
it's like being engineer or being like
you know it's a very respectful I don't
know how to explain it but it's a very
respectful career especially now because
people know what developers do people
know the developers make website
developers make applications so they
know that what they're using every day
you're one of those people that building
you know so yeah definitely is it's a
great career guys I will you know tell
everybody to try to join of course it's
not for everybody of course not
everybody is going to be able to make it
from my calculations from what I've seen
only eight percent really get to make it
as a web developer
you know because most people give up
most people they don't want to put in
the time of study and most people don't
want to you know put the time in front
of a computer and and seeing courses and
and learning different languages not
everybody wants something that right
there is for people who loves solving
problems let's say you one of those
people that they like to play the
crossword puzzles on the newspapers or
let's say you you like getting one of
those 10,000 pieces you know
puzzles who who's going to take you like
a year two years to solve but for you
you loved us this is why this careers
been theirs for those people those
people that they like to get that
feeling that hey I account the sign hey
I built sunny
hey I solved the problem hey it was hard
for I didn't give up and I'd be anti
guarding this whoo
this curry is ready for so only 88
percent even sometimes even less percent
of people are I want to make it but all
you have to think about it is all of the
things that I just told you right now
so therefore May it should be good you
should be able to become a developer and
and just focus on it and don't give up
don't don't come in and be like oh I
can't you know I can't place this in the
right place and in my page oh I don't
know how to change the background color
of this I don't know how to do a border
radius so now I'm going to quit no you
keep going you keep going on so you find
the answer once you find the answer
you're never going to have to look for
it again because you already know what
you got to do like
you know something even sometimes
something that might take you you know
half an hour and now it's searched for
the answer once you find that answer the
next time you want to search for that
answer again is going to take you two
minutes because now you know what to ask
on Google now you know what to ask on
Stack Overflow to be able to find the
answer so don't give up man trust me all
