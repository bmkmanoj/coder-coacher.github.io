of people coming in and having people
constantly creating new applications and
learning new stuff we achieved that we
got to a number that we're comfortable

it's like let's get back to my peoples
man my peoples from YouTube you know
what I mean like it's the beginning of

is it that you guys are working on how
long have you been doing this you got
what I'm saying like have have you been
working do you have a job or you do a
freelance like I'm interesting all of
these things the more data that we have
to better the channel can be for you
guys you know so that's what we hear man
how to learn Python in five minutes
everything about everything about Python
in less than 10 minutes word how to be a
developer in one week how to get a job
without knowing nothing without knowing
anything how to get a job with with no
experience
not even one hour of coding how to get
that dream job you know let's do
javascript in 15 minutes you know it's
2018 kids you know how we gonna we know
we about to go in its 2018 guys it's
December you know in December this way

be out here it's happening right now you
know what I mean it's like everybody's
out out getting those those keywords
now you know me man I'm one of the first
ones doing this and why do it classy I
come in here I give you real opinions I
give you real topics things how I feel
about certain things because there's the
thing I noticed this a lot of times I
noticed people go to blogs and then
pretty much they go to blogs and then
redo what somebody else did and don't
even tell you about it you get what I'm
saying like some I'm not pointing no
fingers I like that but you know what I
mean like like that's why whenever I
talk about anything like a response form
a hacker noon or TechCrunch like I put
it up there I put it up there so you
guys could see which is the article that
I'm talking about where I got the idea
just to give the props man you know what
I mean
sometimes it's hard to find topics that
you're interested cuz you know what I
mean like I don't want to be talking
about JavaScript all day you know
javascript is cool but it's like I'm not
excited about JavaScript but I'm excited
about other stuff in new languages and
they are coming out you know what I mean
or even sometimes new frameworks and
stuff like that those are the things
that get me excited I'm not excited
about just talking about JavaScript so
it's like we always got to switch it up
you know
yeah man we out here man we out here how
did I grow my channel so fast tips word
that's a good video
that's uh that's definitely a good video
let me write that down
send me some send me questions guys send
me questions I'm gonna start writing
them down what was it that John said he
said how did you grow your channel so
fast rain down down
all right cool what else do you need to
know HTML to make apps if you make your
web applications you need to know HTML
like how you gonna show anything to
anybody like you know what I mean oh
let's see that I hear about Kris Hawks
game and that that broke my heart I was
like man that sucks cuz I could imagine
you know what he's going through you
know having me and my wife we've only
been together for six years you know
what I mean like I will be pissed at 14
years in and be like hey man we got a
breakup and I'm gonna take the kids and
you know what now you keep the house and
I'll move out like you get what I'm
saying like those are the type of
situations that happens when you get a
divorce it's like wife is like you know
what I'm gonna keep the house and you
know cuz the kids are here that's the
scheme you already know that's the
scheme that's like you know what even
though you pay for this house hey i'ma
keep it because the kids are living here
you know so there's a lot of BS man you
know I was like why he came not saying

this person if they would have just let
you go on like the second or third year
you got what I'm saying but people want
to hold on to each other because they're
like man it's like this this what
happens all the time and this happened
to me before - when one of my first
girlfriends whatever I was with from 20
21 22 23 all the way to 20 for almost
five years
we did like four years I did a four year
bed with that girl
sorry um she was crazy like literally I
tried to break up with her fall on the
first year then throughout the second
third fourth year I was just cheating on
her all the time like right in front of
her face like yo I just want to break up
but she would never let me go she will
hack into my emails like hit up the
girls that I would talk to and be like
oh cuz you know on your gmail if you
could hack into somebody's Gmail you
could go and get the person's phone
numbers their contacts so that's what
she would do she would go in there and
be like girl man he's like oh I'm
pregnant by him doing a whole bunch of
crazy stuff doing the most and it would
just really
it just really like you know like mess
me up for like four years from 20 to 24

on her all the time like but it was just
crazy I'm like man I got I was trying to
get rid of this person and that happens
sometimes to where people end up with
somebody like that for 10 15 years 20

else
Congrats bro yeah man it was pretty
pretty special man
amen fantastic
I'm glad doc who help people out man
that's the whole idea of this channel
man all I want to do is help people out
I don't care about nothing else you know
it's like I got a lot of cool stuff
that's coming out now for 2018
I got merchandise that I'm doing I'm
also doing like legit legit commercials
that I'm doing you know cuz I told you
guys from the beginning everything that
I I wanna do with this is I want to take
this to the next level right like I want
kids like the high school kids you know
that they don't know what they want to
do with their life I want them to get
into coding because I didn't have a
mentor I didn't have nobody to come in
and tell me hey Joe you can make money
with this you could do you know live
girl you could create amazing
applications like you a smart kid like
nobody came up to me and told me that
when I was like 14 people was actually
telling me like oh man graphic designers
they don't make no money and that's what
people will call it like you know you
make websites they will put it all
together with graphic designers and this
and that you know so what I want to do
is I want to make like legit like make
coding make programming like a lifestyle
thing you know what I mean like there's
a lot of cool stuff that I know like
some of my friends that I do and some
some other things that my friends do and
like it's people that you will not think
like they're designers that they're
developers you know cuz a lot of these
people you know when you think about
like programmers and guys who like
coding and all this stuff you start
thinking about you know little nerdy
dudes you know those that that's not
really the reality of things of how
things are nowadays so what I want to do
is I want to make this thing like a
lifestyle like you know I want to make
it cool to be a developer you know cuz
in reality there's developers out there
but nobody gets a let's say nobody gives
a damn about that like yeah you're the
smartest person in the world but nobody
cares
about you you get what I'm saying so how
can we take this this world of
popularity swag personality and pull it
all together into the culture of coding
alright
culture of programming you gonna say
like how can we bring that in you get
what I'm saying how can we merge all of
that you know and you don't have to be a
square to actually like all this cool
stuff that's out there you get what I'm
saying so that's what I'm doing
2018 that's all I want to be doing
you're getting insane so we got a lot of
stuff popping off before 2018 it's gonna
be cool you know a lot of you guys that
seeing me from the beginning yeah I'll
be like whoa look at your boy Joe out
here in a conference it's like I got a
lot of invitations for places like you
know I'm not gonna put it out there but
I have a lot of conferences that want me
to go to speak and just go out there
like major conferences this is not like
me in front of five people in the room
now I'm talking about like three hundred
five hundred thousand two thousand
people in an auditorium type of talk you
get what I'm saying like if I decide to
do that I don't know if I want to do it
because I feel like I don't know if I
want to do that you gonna say I want to
and I don't know if I want to at the
same time like unless I talk about like
a cool subject like talk about I don't
know diversity in the industry or I want
to talk about you know showing teenagers
how to get into or coding like that's
something that I would like to do it or
talk about but I don't want to go in
there like hey guys let's let's spin up
a react app like that's not me you know
what I mean like I do that for
my website do it here for YouTube but I
don't want to go to a conference to go
talk about how to do a react app in five
minutes like I'm not trying to do that
you get what I'm saying I want to do
like something legit so but I gotta I
gotta definitely
I gotta definitely figure it out see if
I want to do that or not but yeah man
would it be worth it wasting four years
of my life I don't know let me see if in
text says four kids in high school these
days I will still recommend for them to
go to computer science route so they be
they better be smart now they better be
smart to graduate from that degree well
yeah ya know because it's like nowadays
to to tell somebody hey go get yourself
in debt it's like I don't know if that's
the answer anymore you know what I'm
saying like I know kids who are like
super smart like before they even
graduate high school to go to a college
to give you a degree and say hey you
know you know how to code because they
could do that doesn't make sense but for
you to be like hey man you smart you
could really build some crazy apps and
you know how about you start trying to
get internships and stuff like that like
I'd rather be working in a company than
me spending time inside of a school
taking freakin some BS psychology you
know cuz that's the problem with college
college if they will come in and tell
you hey you're gonna do four years of
computer science so you're gonna learn
everything about a computer to the
programming language if they do it like
that
then it would be legit but the problem
is that they give you a year and a half
of what your degree is about and then
the rest is about sociology here's
English one English one or two English
103 he is all freaking I don't know
here's our linear equation one linear
equation two
every King calculus one calculus to
calculus 3 before you even get to touch
a freaking computer and start doing
something cool you got what I'm saying
you know what I'm saying so yeah man
and came out only complaining about not
working while studying now I'm a good
man reading FinTech FinTech is crazy
Ivy Shan what up
you know I just think that you know it's
hard man but it's like this I think
about I like this look I think about
world Starcom right WorldStarHipHop calm
how many kids come to this website right
how many kids come to this this website
and just pretty much like come here
every single day don't get nothing out
of out of this website but see either
some violence or some corner II or some
dumb don't say that they don't even need
to be watching right how about if I come
in here it's gonna cost me I think it's
eight hundred dollars to get a big-ass
video right here just like a legit a
legit commercial of just like hey man
like you you see that Maserati you could
get that Maserati without selling drugs
without having to ride without having to
go to play basketball what I happen to
do none of this BS or this Connery or
this retardedness of like this kid you
get what I'm saying so how can we reach
out to those kids because this there's a
lot of kids who have potential but if
you don't see it if you don't see what
you can become then you don't become
nothing you get what I'm saying so
that's what I'm about I'm about
uplifting and showing people showing
people like different ways of getting
money out here you know I'm saying and
even like there's so many developers
Dossi like on different countries and
different different websites like Stack
Overflow I see on like what's the name
of this website on Nomad Lister IO
there's people travel in the world and
just working freelance right travel in
the world
chillin living the good life you know
block a block a word man this dude's
name though yeah man
and even if you do engineering there's
people who are engineers out there and
can't get a job
and that's for real and that's not even
funny that's that's what sucks you go to
school for four years sometimes five
years cuz you gotta think about it you
know sometimes you drop a class and next
thing you know you got to stay extra ear
things like that happens alright so you
go to school for five years and now you
out here free gained weight you can't
even get a job or you might be so
overqualified like you might be coming
out of high out of college with you know
Oh Freddy Martinez what up yeah you
might come out here right and you might
just have a masters right you got a PhD
and it's like man we can't hire you
because you got a PhD like this is a
beginner or like a junior level position
but you got a PhD so in reality you
should be getting paid more money than
what you're gonna be you're about to get
paid into this job so they won't hire
you because your education is too high
you know what I'm saying like stuff like
that happens
I mean I don't know
Joe FinTech says Joe will you say there
there is a bias with self-taught
developers the good ones remain as
developers in the shitty ones get fired
and change careers I don't know
sometimes people do change careers you
get what I'm saying sometimes it's not
even about that I think sometimes people
grow out of things you know cuz right
now hey I could love coding right now
I've been doing this for five six years
right but I'm already branching out out
of coding right like I did it for five
years
cool I work for major companies cool who
cares
whoopty-doo give myself a little pat in
the back keep it moving you get what I'm
saying now what is my next stage I want
to create my own platform my own
freaking you know quote unquote my own
Facebook my own Google which is
something that a lot of people don't do
there's developers who just for the rest
of their lives they're gonna be after
that check they're gonna be after that
salary right and they're just happy with
that but then there's people who are
like me and it's like some other people
out there who are just you know their
glitches and the matrix you get what I'm
saying like if you're a glitch in the
matrix you you're not gonna stay in a
company for for a long time because
you're a go-getter you want to create
new things and when you're working in
this companies even for what development
doesn't matter what language it is
you're going to be doing stuff that's
gonna be repetitive no matter what
you're still gonna be doing controllers
you're still gonna be doing working with
models and the database is still going
to be doing stuff with HTML CSS doesn't
matter what framework comes out are you
still gonna have to do the same thing
over and over and over and over again so
what do you do you say hey I'm just
gonna stay in this company and work
forever or you say hey I'm just gonna
build my own stuff so I could challenge
myself some people decide to stay
in a company and become you know upper
management or or whatever you know what
I mean like but I think everybody's
different you know I don't think there's
really like shitty the developers out
there there's lazy developers like
there's people who are lazy that's a big
difference
like if you're lazy you just lazy
there's people that just don't want to
learn new programming languages there's
people that don't want to learn new
frameworks they just they stuck on their
own ways
you know like one of the main reasons
why I was dying to get the hell out my
last company was because there was this
dude there who I was like yo this is
ridiculous I tell this guy hey man we're
gonna hire you right we tell them hey
we're gonna hire you and can you go over
this weekend over laravel just the
documentation just try to you know try
to go in there and get comfortable the
guy goes like yeah I'm gonna check it
out comes back on Monday and didn't even
freaking look at the website and it's
like bro like like you're freaking lazy
I don't want you around me you got what
I'm saying like then the doors like oh
nah I decided to leave I'll do it on on
company's time when you do things like
that I could tell you now passionate
about this and when you're not
passionate I don't want you around me
you know what I'm saying so there are
developers like that there's people who
come in here they look at things like a
check because we could call coming here
and be like oh this is just a check and
yeah I'm gonna get money
I learned this and then I get paid to
study at work I get paid to do
everything I work and that's the only
time that I do it if you are one of
those people automatically I don't like
you that's just how I am
it's just like you're just out here
trying to milk the game you know what I
mean most company asks you like hey do
you have open source projects do you do
learning on your own like what that's
what companies you know you go to any
major companies they ask you hey you
know what frameworks are you excited
about what languages you excited about
to test you to see
if you actually about this life if
you're not you don't even get hired
right now
this do we freakin we gave the whole
case again to hire him because we needed
the extra hand and he's actually like a
designer or something and he was I
he was I but the moment he said nah I'm
not gonna learn this I learned this at
work on companies time and it's like bro
like you're freaking lazy like I can't
stand you like that's just how are ya
man you know what I mean so is their
shitty developers out there no it's just
people are lazy it's like right now
somebody might come in and be like Joe
I'm a million times better than you and
I would probably say yeah you're
probably right but if you have more time
than me doing this then I will say yeah
you're probably right
alright now if you put in as many hours
as I put in I'm gonna be like nah bro we
are at the same level now if I put in
more hours than you I won't be like bro
you're buggin like you know how many
hours I'll be putting into this like 12
hours a day I code like do you really
think like I'm very developer if
somebody that costs 12 hours that's like
going to the gym every single day
shooting free-throws you're not gonna
miss that free-throw ever in your life
because for the 12 hours for five years
you've been shooting free-throws you
know what I'm saying
so it's just that's just how it is it's
who who put some more time this is a
time thing you know there's people who
come here and even they even signed up
to my website I look at their their
stats I look at everybody stats to check
out to see how their first week is going
there's a lot of people that come in
literally sign up spend one hour one
hour per every two three days like
you're not gonna make it like you could
you could pay for this like you only
helping me like if I look at this like
hey I'm getting money from you cool but
that's not what I want
I want you to become a better developer
it's all about coming in and really
putting in work put it in time you can't
expect to become a good developer
without putting in time so is their
shitty developers know there's just lazy
ones and that's just how it is man
you know there's been these listen this
days that I come in here I start at like
look when I was working full-time I
would go from 8 to from like 9 o'clock
let's say 9 o'clock 9 o'clock till 5:00
5:30 all that time on coding then I come
home I chill with wifey for like an hour
hang out we eat cook let's say you now
and a half let's say by 7:30 I'm already
in front of my computer coding again
making videos about coding talking about
coding all that stuff I consider part of
my process of coding every single day
because even though if I'm not coding
with my hands I'm thinking about how I
will build something I'm explaining
something to you guys so all that stuff
is like I pretty much add it up and
that's how I've been doing it before I
even had this YouTube that's how I used
to do it like I'm actually slacking
right now because I used to code for
like 8 to 10 8 to 10 to 12 hours per day
when I didn't have a YouTube channel
all right when I got my youtube channel
I just started you know it's like I
spent time on YouTube too but you know
what I mean like I was calling like
crazy
yeah man
that's what I'm saying look 18:47 is
like yo you know it's messed up last
week this dude was sending me he he was
thinking about becoming a plumber
because they make him bank and he got a
degree too like that's kind of sad you
know what I mean like and we're not
saying like being a plumber being
mechanic being all of this other jobs
that's out there is bad it's just like
you gotta come home dirty you're gonna
come home tie you're gonna come home all
beat up like you shouldn't be in that
situation like that situation should be
for people who who somehow messed up in
life that's how I look at it you got
what I'm saying like that's not for for
me like for me it's like I'm supposed to
be getting like you know AC I'm in the
AC Chinon you know working listening to
music coding you know doing stuff with
my brain you get what I'm saying like
I'm not doing the work no manual labor
like I've done it before that's not for
me
you know what I'm saying like most of
the like I used to work in this okay
story time kids I used to working in
this company called mill Mart man let me
see me Omar Maspeth let's go
story time kids let's look this up

able to get together 280 dollars to buy
me a pair of Jordans alright cuz that's
how much I was making after taxes you
you're looking at yourself you're like

you out here in there's BS jobs just
because you don't want to put into work
you know what I'm saying
Barbara Barr is over you're cracking

up to you if you're not making money I'm
telling you right now unless you live in
one of the states they're super cheap
that you could say hey I could live off
$2,000 $3,000 per month and be
comfortable if you don't live in one of
those states don't have no kids man you
get what I'm saying like you can't have
no kids out here at all man
cuz it costs a lot of money there's a
lot of stuff that I spend on the baby

this stuff that's all new expenses to me
like if I was like dolo like I'll be
balling right now I'll be like this

my off time cold cold Wars this is cool
if you want to come in check it out you
wanna you know spend some time testings
out do some you know a couple of things
practice this is not gonna teach you how
to code this is for people that want to

code camp free code camp is not gonna
teach you how to code free code camp is
practice like get that through your head
but if you want to check it out go check
that out man
where is the course where is it I'll
tell you right now you can come right

to think about it like hey man it's just
the first job once you get that first
job your next job you literally double
your money
Thank You 40-somethings like you I told
my mom this code she don't work I'm
gonna be a truck driver she freaked out
this dude's mom jumped out the window
like what Oh God nah man listen man this
is so crazy
alright so in between me learning to
code and between me learning to code to
me getting my first job as a developer I
signed up for uber all right this is
hilarious I send up I didn't sign up for
over I signed up to get the license to
be able to drive right I'll not forget
this this is why I got so pissed off the
other day for him that dude he's like

through like to tell me what I've done
I've not done right so Wow this was my
thing I was like man I don't want to do
IT right

gonna go get the license for be coming
over get my own car and just do this
right bro I got the license which cause
like $250 I went for like a week I went
for like a literally a week on some
overshare and no lie man I just I just
pretty much like I quit I was like y'all

know like when people are out that's
when you start
money but it's like distressed you know
the type of crazy people that you bump
into in the night time I was like man I
need to get into this coding shit like I
quit after a week so you know that's why
I tell people like man I've been through
so much like you know it's not like me
wanting to get pity from people it's
just like I've been through a lot work
hard all the stuff that I do now is it's
not just me it just didn't come in my
hands all that stuff is because I work
hard you know what I'm saying like this
thing's you know I was like cam got his
own stories cam got his own war stories

grow away $800 every few days that I
don't even know how I spent the money
all right if I go to one of those states
it's a wrap man I live like a king sign
you know the reason is like those people
should really take should really take
advantage man you know that's why I was
like laughing about I was laughing about
like when this guy was his name he liked
the computer guy was like crying for you
know it's like he's making he was making
like three hundred thousand dollars a
year now he's making like 250 and it's
like bro cry me a river bro like you're
that's $150,000 where you live at it's
like a million dollars like you live in
like in the middle of nowhere of America

boondocks like where you go outside you
could buy a neighborhood for half a
million dollars like literally you know
what I mean yeah like peoples out here
like you know it's like that's where
it's like it's just funny how people are
like people get so detached to reality
that sometimes it's like ridiculous like
for me now I make some some good money
I'm good and if I if I was to decide to
go ahead I'm gonna go back to work for
another company whatever I'm making now
would be the double of what I will make
working at a company a hundred thousand
plus another 107 thousand it would be
like you know what I mean like it's like
two hundred seven thousand dollars per
year you know they're saying like I
would go crazy but do I want to do that
now I like where I'm at right now
but here in New York man is you can't
stress that money it's two hundred
thousand is like you like your your
upper middle class you got on saying

most of my courses are targeted for
people who are beginners it's like so
it's like if you're a beginner it is the
place for you to be yet
can install homebrew and windows you
gotta look you gotta check other stuff
out man you gotta try to install Linux
manner install Linux on your computer
yeah man get the O access pass man
you're gonna be good man
we're doing a lot of cool stuff in there
today I did three videos for the nodejs
for those people who are doing the
nodejs I did three more new videos for
it we should be finished with that this
week man I'm dying to get off no js' I'm
not gonna lie to you guys I'm not
excited about JavaScript it's not that
great like I love JavaScript but for the
backend is not that great I find it
boring and kind of messy but you know I
did it for the people that I enjoy
nodejs
you know so ya know I think they're all
good man but it's just there's certain
things that I just I'm not excited about
you get what I'm saying like no J's to
me doesn't get me excited it's like I'm
finishing it and I'm not saying like I'm
doing a bad job on it it's just there's
so much other cool stuff out there like
I want to jump into this angular 5 and
just I want to do that were done but for
me to get everything out the way I want
to just finish the note GS it's like I
left it alone for like two weeks and a
half then in doing no videos for cuz I
was doing the the PHP but yeah many come
holidays and discordant listen man I got
the new the new website coming up man
gonna have to chat chat room bumping
I think is gonna get picked up once it's
on a virgin one I think Kristen lang is
gonna get picked up once it's on version
one and it's supposed to be a version
one on January so let's see what happens
man cuz you gotta understand Ruby on
Rails community and the Ruby community
is huge so the next progression for
people is whoever does Ruby is going to
have to do Crystal Lake right because
it's the same syntax implied with the
speed of C the speed of C and it's
actually faster than golang so with that
being said like it's only the the right
progression you know a lot of people
were saying Oh elixir might be better
but in reality elixir is not the same
thing as as our Ruby and rails because
or Ruby in general because elixir is
functional programming not everybody
likes that sure you get what I'm saying
now everybody's into that some people
they just think they can't stand it
yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna add all of that
in there man I'm gonna definitely add
all of all of that in there man
okay he got ads for days man listen man
sometimes we got to let those let those
ads run man that's how that's how we eat
man
we gotta eat sometimes you know what I
mean
unfortunately you know I can't eat I
can't eat likes you know if it was
fuckin cash in on the lights man I would
be out here eating with likes you know
what I mean and even at that people
don't even give those likes people will
be watching this right now and nobody
will give it likes
yeah no definitely you gotta do what you
gotta do man if you find in your area no
js' is everywhere
you got a don't know J yes man everybody
that's what I tell people man
look you can learn it doesn't matter or
which programming language you choose
right if you know if you know a certain
stack you know every other stack in the
world there's really no difference only
difference is when it's different
paradigms like functional programming
and object-oriented programming like
it's totally two different worlds so you
could definitely do no GS you could do
WordPress you could do whatever you want
out there
asp.net it doesn't matter which stack
you choose once you know how to program
once you know web development like I
could go and do it do the same app in in
multiple languages and different
frameworks and do the same thing because
I already know what I have to do with
the stack right so it's the same thing
for you guys like once you know one
thing that you can move it on to the
next one that easily you know what I
mean it's just like I have a friend of
mine who currently right now he works
for a very big company and their whole
stack is in in nodejs right and just
from hearing him he's like stressed out
all the time because there's really not
really good tools to debug nodejs this
like so much stuff man like you don't
even know man like those production
production already applications man
they're a mess out there
it's like spaghetti code spaghetti code
it's like there's really not a good
framework that's set up already because
most of the companies they don't use
frameworks right what they use is no GS
from for micro services and what happens
is that every time that somebody
comes in they code differently right
every time somebody comes in they do
their own thing they do it their own way
so there's not a consistency of how the
code looks you know what I mean like
every time somebody touch it it looks
different so that's the problem with
nodejs for me like once you know
JavaScript you know JavaScript like you
you know nodejs you know all of the
stuff you know
hey returning around from you know a gap
requires a pulse request how to set up
on you know method overriding you know
etc right so those things are easy but
it could definitely get messy man I'm
telling you right now I think there's a
lot of people were like Mary what this
is so cool but so one of the guys has
been doing it for the past two three
years you know they've been working on
nodejs companies it hasn't been that
great man CSS is easy man CSS is like
baby games
trust me Souda that's super easy man CSS
is like there's nothing out there that
you can say hey it's hard man that's
easy it gets annoying but it's not hard
weird man
I say duck Oh the community splitting up
this is like the Bitcoin and Segway
who's going to stay on coding phase calm
or who's gonna go to discord don't
dum-dum now I think there's people that
like this Court better because this is
easier they can have the applications
I'm just gonna also put a chat a live
chat on the website number one to test
out the capable capabilities of crystal
Lang and WebSockets so I'm gonna do that
and just to have it there live 24/7 cuz
even right now like you know right now
I'm about to stop the livestream but at
the same time like I will still want to
continue chatting with people right and
be able to come in and out without
having to get a whole bunch of
notifications of my phone and that's why
I'm just gonna do it you know what I
mean
we still gonna have the discord we're
still gonna have you know I still have
to get her there's people that still
help me up and get her like we still pop
in and get her right now but it's just
I'm gonna have it directly on on the
website you know what I mean let me see
I'm applying for like 12 weeks I guess
it should be more see Francisco
Caballero
Hey Joe any advice on finding smaller
companies to work for that are willing
to hire self to developers listen check
out on Craigslist man those companies
that you see when you see a company on
Craigslist they desperate that means
they need somebody ASAP
when you see somebody on indeed.com
their bougie they have time to actually
go and you know interview a lot of
people and take their time but when you
see them on Craigslist it's like a
crackhead as I can't I need I need to
Vella purrs man like straight up
what did I do for my birthday I don't
even want you guys remind me man I got
twisted I got twisted I got into an
argument with my my girlfriend's family
for no reason I don't even say nothing
crazy I just I called somebody out and
we had into a verbal disagreement and
like drunk like I get disgusting when
I'm drunk so if I'm like really really
tore up it's bad so yeah man that's
that's what I did for my birthday and
then the whole day I just spent in bed
trying to catch up and like trying to
you know recuperate I had a major
hangover that's why I don't drink I
don't like drinking
yeah for me the problem with angel Darko
it's like angel that Co is like most of
those companies is like a whole bunch of
hipsters like I'll be honest there's
like a whole bunch of it's like a whole
bunch of startups everybody thinks that
they have the best product in the world
all the developers think they are the
smartest people in the world there's
like mmm I'm good like keep those jobs
like there's certain people that just
don't want to be around you know like
it's not that or like hipsters it's just
like there's certain hipsters that is
just like bro I can't be around you
like you live in this la-la land you
know what I mean like I live in a I live
in a reality of the real world of like
the world of like what everybody else
lives aren't but then there's people who
just live in this other world where
they've never had to struggle for
anything in their life they've never
done anything bad in their life like
their life has been you know hey my
parents took care me you know they
holding grudges because their parents
had them with nannies and stuff like
that is like like that's their struggle
you know what I mean so I don't want to
be around those people so it's like
those angels are coal companies I just
don't go there man like straight up
it's a whole bunch of startups in there
man
yeah that's a good plan Remi world I've
got a good plan kit
oh yeah man I'm out of here man god
bless you guys we are he's our kid okay
