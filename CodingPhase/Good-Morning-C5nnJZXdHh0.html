of that real listen man right now if you

you guys got a little too employment
which the kid is nice and I love his
music he's killing me he reminds me of
me in high school back in the days
backing into him when I was young and
then in Ireland I forgot the name my
song but yeah man
how you guys doing man you know I
usually do this morning videos live but
today I decided to do it you know what
we just recorded with the camera you
know because it really sucks that
Verizon has no server side I don't
understand why it's not like I'm
in Wyoming I'm in the middle of nowhere
I'm in New York you know so for a
company that says hey they have the best
service you know the best internet
service out there and the fastest
internet service I don't understand why
the hell here in the lining whenever I
use mine my phone for live videos it
looks like that's a business meal
and also I don't know what to do and
also I can't get rid of Verizon because
I just signed up with them you know I
actually signed up with them
specifically because I wanted them to
have good good service and everything
you know for whatever they say online
that was the nation's greatest or
whatever in nation's most coverage area
whatever they call it in their
commercials in shape and I'm like man
there's some right when I had
t-mobile timo was bad too so I don't
know that either wonderful that hey it's
not like I'm freaking super far from the
city I'm like thirty minutes away
now all day acting like the isn't a
Bulldog's or something
but whatever Hammond something cars on
here when just my little drive guys this
is my little drive you know that's the
only thing that I like about live
because it's like you know I'm driving I
could actually see a little bit what you
guys are typing and then I could just
respond to you guys right away
this and that you know but yeah like I'm
actually reading that I'll try to figure
out what day I should pick it will start
bringing back to the podcast kill a lot
of people if that like man we miss your
podcast you know bringing in people for
different different levels of you know
development like we want to see that
again
I'm like cool plus I'm constantly
getting emails from people that I want
to be in the podcast and I'm like man I
haven't done the podcast and like a
month since I started doing the
mentorship program I stopped the whole
podcast so now we're trying to bring it
back I'm trying to do a young jeezy
bring it back
when also I'm like you know
pissed
supposedly there's like family is
like in the house type but
supposedly the freakin dryer in the
house is not working which means I'm
gonna have to either pay for somebody to
fix it or buy a brand new alright and
I'm like I'm not trying to buy
right now like for the next move next
one like I'm not trying to buy any
animal like I'm trying to just chill
because I don't know how much I'm gonna
be spending on this baby how much money
I'm gonna don't have to say how much he
eats how much she poops I don't know so
I don't want to spend money
because I want to have casual
like fixing the dryer or you know buying
a brand-new one that is going to be
annoying but
and I'll just give you a little a little
inside inside Joe's house
they are going to pick up my girls and
boys right now little thing is to go to
Mom's house and all is good sometimes
she wants everything right over there
