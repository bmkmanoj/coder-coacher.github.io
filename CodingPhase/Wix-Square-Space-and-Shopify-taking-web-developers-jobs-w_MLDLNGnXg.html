again coding face.com
your boy is back you're not embedded
again today's topic is is Wix
Squarespace Shopify and any other
platform that's out there for you know
quick and serve web development a
challenge for web developers you guys
this video is brought to you by viewers
like you and people that support our
website coding phase comm go check it
out over 20 courses in there that's
gonna guide you to become a developer
from the beginning to becoming a pro
guys listen you don't understand a lot
of those platforms are creating for
people that don't know anything about
web design you know a lot of times
people sign up to the services and they
say hey I'm gonna build a website on Wix
all I need is a website online that's it
in their head that's all they need but
then they decide oh I need to get you
know something that connects to my
Twitter feed something that connects to
my Facebook feed something that connects
to you know my products so now it has a
lot of things in here with like weight
which doesn't provide everything that
you need for your business or for like
let's say your music website or for
whatever type of website you trying to
sell freaking chocolate that's online
then you know Wix is there but they
can't provide you with everything right
so that's what a developer comes in you
know a lot of people be like oh man you
know Wix is gotta take everybody's job
oh man you know Squarespace oh my god
you know Shopify you can't build no more
stores for people because now they have
Shopify guys
Shopify opinions a blessing for
developers when you think about it I
don't know about you guys I personally
hate having to build the back end of a
ecommerce right it's a lot of stuff that
you gotta build it it gets really
annoying it's already built for you
right now as a developer you can come in
and use that
a form somebody might come to you milady
I already have or Shopify all I need is
a new website and you designed to where
I need some little extra plugins some
extra features that's when you come in
as a developer and just you know go in
there chop it up fix it up create the
layup create the things you know middle
your hours and I say keep it a little
bit you know a lot of developers right
now are are pretty much saying oh man we
can't we can't do it with with you know
Shopify and all those other services
even Squarespace people are worried
about Squarespace guys don't be worried
about none of the services man because
you don't understand every business
every person who needs a custom website
is still going to contact you you know
all the services all they do is just
cookie cutter websites all right they
look exactly the same as other people's
websites you can't really customize it
okay weights you could drag and drop and
put things in centering holders but even
that that all right you give that to a
regular person the civilian somebody who
has no ideal design
who has no idea of like what development
will has by the it's a pogrom your
hierarchy color theory nothing a good
stuff right what happens they come in
and create a hideous website a website
that people go in there and the bounce
rate is about 88% meaning only 12% of
people going there and stay longer than
a minute all right so that's a dub
that's the feel that means it's hard
people are not gonna buy from that
person people and I gotta say that
person seriously you know so then at
some point that I realized anyway what's
going on my my Wix website is not as
good as everybody else's
yeah because the website looks like it
was made in 1992 you know what I mean so
we could definitely help you as a
developer as a designer or you know
somebody who knows about this I can help
you I can cut any mold your little
website fix it out u1l wet school you
don't because I'm doing it for your Wix
thought I gotta fix it out to a little
couple of changes
voila create an x-ray API with other
server and tell them I hate the certain
things that we can't do here or wigs but
if you still want to have more wigs I
can have a helix and you have a separate
server for all the extra stuff that you
might want all right
no you just leave it to the people where
you leave it alone you explain to them
the the good the bad the ugly of these
services but at the same time you don't
have to be like oh man it's the end of
you know the era of developers nah man
it's just the beginning because it means
that there's so many people in need of
websites that now their service is out
there
this is making cookie cutters ok people
realize it's there you come in and they
look at all those look exactly like that
website I went to my competitors and
looks exactly like my competitors they
don't want that they want originality
the most of them that is unique and
people could come in and go oh wow this
is a new experience this is XYZ business
it's not the ABC business you go run
saying so don't worry just keep working
build your sites you know somebody comes
to you and say hey I want you to work on
my site is on Squarespace do this and
that do a couple of changes set up the
layouts do it for them it's not that
hard
all you're doing is using another
platform is like using another back-end
right you could still do all the things
that you need to do on the front we're
honest not how hard so stop worrying
about that is the
the world for 2018 I think having those
type of websites actually good for
developers because it gives us more
value it shows that people are hey man
you see what they do are waste you see
what they do a Squarespace you see what
they do on what's the other one on South
the fire right there's only so much you
couldn't do there you know once you hit
that limit then you realize it's like oh
wow developers aren't really important
in this view so I have to hire some
developers for my own company or I have
to hire a you know developer a
subcontractor can say hey make sure you
fix this can you build this for me you
can trust yourself stop worrying about
that there's not gonna be no jobs guys
I've been hearing this since I was 14
years old when I was 14 years old people
would tell me back in the days people
will call this graphic designer say you
know you say I'll build the website
oh so you know what designer or you're a
graphic designer that's what people will
say Ironman and there wasn't no thing as
a web developer and nothing like that
maybe there was a webmaster right but
back then people go oh yeah you know
GoDaddy has a a pace builder you know a
sec wait what
you know Geocities has a pace builder I
could drag and drop they've been saying
that since I was 14 years old I'm 30
years old this year
I just think 13 I see December 3rd we in
January Rainer matter of fact in
February sorry come on dates are we
February so it's like literally like
I've been hearing this for almost like
what 14 years and it's like in 15 years
it didn't happen it's not gonna happen
now
especially when everything is connected
to the web this watch connected sort of
what to the web this was connected
silhouette my phone connected said oh
well the TV connected to the work the
computer connected to know what the VCR
if there was a VCR will be connected to
the
the freaky the other the ps4 connected
to the web the freaking the fridge
connected to the web the freaking I
don't know man anything that you could
think of it's connected to the web
nowadays man matter of fact this
probably is a VCR out there sigh hey man
VCR you know with Wi-Fi you could
connect to netflix for some reason some
guy still has a are many of your chances
in his house but he wants to be able to
watch Netflix so it still connects to
the Internet so all I'm saying guys is
you're still gonna be valued out here
pretty highly man you still gonna get
your money of course they don't
understand if you're thinking and you
try to compare yourself here in the
United States to other countries where
guys are working for three four dollars
ten dollars that's on you you can't
compare yourself to those guys because
that's in a whole different world to me
that's like a whole different planet you
know what I mean like I don't consider
myself in that space you know what I'm
saying me I'm out here I look at what
other people are making here in the
United States you know everybody could
live comfortably as a developer so yeah
stop focusing on the idea of my dad man
you know which is gonna come in and take
over the world
no it's not they need to stop it with
that you know what I mean so anyways man
