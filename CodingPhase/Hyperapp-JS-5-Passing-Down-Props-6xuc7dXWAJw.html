with JSX
now let's make this work let's make a
little counter do something all right
so the first thing that we want to do is
we want to be able to pass down the data
that we have in the state down for each
component all right so the way to do
this is and I want you guys to always
think of it like this
components are functions so you could
always pass down you know variables
objects arrays you know any type of data
type you could pass it down to it so
what we're going to do here is we're
going to do something like this we're
going to come here I'm going to say
state alright and we're going to come
and say state equals 2 state remember
this whenever you see the little curly
brackets that's to interpret something
interpret add an object interpret a
variable interpret anything that you
want as far as like a variable that you
want it to be on a page like I'm gonna
show you something like right now let's
say an example I want this to say for I
could come here and say interpret this
to be 2 plus 2 which is 4 we save that
as you can see automatically we can for
if I come here face 2 plus 6 and turpis
it to 8 it's just JavaScript guys think
of the day like you're just doing
javascript is HTML full of JavaScript ok
now let's come back to this and let's
delete this from Alice or this believes
there all right so what we're going to
do is we're going to pass down the state
whatever we have here in this object we
want to pass it down to all the other
components so they could have access to
that information so instead of us having
this hard-coded here
what we're going to do is we're going to
have it dynamically come down from the
state so we can say something like this
wants a title and we're going to say
counter all right now down here we're
going to say total and we're going to
say 0 ok so now what we want to do up
here is we're going to pass down an
object and we're gonna say something
like this we want to say state all right
so we passing down the object with the
property of state and we can name this
whatever we want so you could say state
equals 2 state all right and then we'll
have access to it on the header but
since we're working with es6 you don't
have to declare it two times you can
just come here and say like this say
state one time and automatically it
knows that you're talking about a
property name state with the value of
state ok so now what we're doing is
coming down here and we're going to say
state that title and save that let's see
what happens as you can see it says
counter if we come here and say is
something like counter HD it's gonna
change up here on the component well
technically it's down here alright
counter HD alright now let's do this for
all the other different components so we
could pass down our data okay pass this
down pass this down now remember what we
just did here the way how we passed it
down was we pass it down through here
through the props
so we're going to use this again alright
and we'll give you exactly has to
workflow how this thing works basically
we have the component remember this is a
function right so we passing down this
props and then it comes back through
here this is the original function right
so it comes back through here and comes
back as an object right we get access to
that the object of the whole state we
get access to it here then we pass that
object down to the state and then now we
say state that title which is the
property of the state which is up here
it got state title equals to counter HD
I don't know I might flip this around
put this up here and then so it could be
less confusing to you guys okay so we
have to app up here and we have the
components down here all right
so pretty much at any time we could pass
down data using the props like we did
here you see header and then we say hey
state equals 2 state object so we
passing down the state down to this
alright I want you guys to get used to
that and yeah I think we're ready to
move on to the next step which is action
all right guys I'll see you guys in the
next video
boy joke back at it again I didn't did
it again man
I came up with this new course hyperope
jas course guys if you want the full
course you don't want to wait for the
videos on YouTube make sure you go to
the website you know coding face.com is
going to bring you here to the store
there's going to be a whole bunch of
courses of course you can just sign up
for the ghetto access pass and yeah
whenever you use the description below
and you use the link to layer guys
you're gonna get 50% off all right I'll
see you guys later
