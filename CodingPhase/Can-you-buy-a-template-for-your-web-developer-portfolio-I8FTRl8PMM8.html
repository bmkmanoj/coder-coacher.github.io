viewers like you and people that support
our website : face calm go check it out
over 20 courses in there that's gonna
guide you to become a developer from the
beginning to becoming a pro Joel do you
have to code do I have to call my own
portfolio can I just buy a template
doesn't matter oh no you don't have to
call your own temp your own portfolio
you who actually buy a template and say
hey there's the template that I like
this the one that I want to show to
people when they come to my website you
could definitely do that for sure
alright but one thing that I will advise
you is make sure that whatever design or
whatever features that you have on your
portfolio you can actually build
yourself and the reason why I tell you
this because if HR person alright HR
person sees your website says oh great
this is a beautiful website this
developer is legit they don't know that
you bought a template right now when you
go to an interview and I developer
actually
oh you build your your page you're gonna
say oh no this is actually a template I
mean technically no but I don't think
nobody's gonna ask you if you built it
to be honest with you I've never asked
anybody oh do you build this no I
already assume that you built it right
so assuming that like let's say if
there's like peril parallax scrolling
there's like filtering with you know the
different projects like let's say if I
choose show me HTML CSS projects or show
me PHP and nodejs projects and it
filters through and it looks all nice
and low oh pretty whatever make sure you
know how to do that because a company
might hire you expecting that oh this
person know how to do this so we
actually might need this for our website
so if you don't know how to do it now
when you're at the job and that's okay
you do this the same thing that you do
on your portfolio you're like you know a
little filtering and this and that
and you say oh I'm gonna have to google
that peoples gonna look at you like
like yeah yes you schemed it you know
what I mean like you don't you never
want to do that so pick a design or a
template something that you can actually
build don't try to go in there and pick
the most amazing template and then get
embarrassed later on when they ask you
to do that okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
