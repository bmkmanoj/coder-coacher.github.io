again coding face.com
I just want to say thank you for coming
here welcome to the website make sure
you subscribe make sure you register to
the site that's for sure
but let me tell you a little bit for
self I actually came here and I became
just like you guys somebody was
interested you'll just want to learn as
much as I can from what developmental
programming in general right so a few
years ago I said I want to come or
whatever well I don't know how to do it
I found a couple of websites there
wasn't teaching me the right way of how
to learn how to code because yes I can
watch a video but is they don't help me
think like a programmer I want to learn
this right so love it I think I said you
know what I'm going to find the right
instructors I'm going to find the right
resources it took me a while to get it
right yet I'll basically succeed I
became a developer I became a successful
developer I have a successful YouTube
channel and only that I make over
$100,000 and it's all because of what
develop what development has become a
vehicle for me to get to where I want to
be in this world and just to be able to
learn new books constantly I love them
right now I know what it feels like to
be a self-development I know what it
takes to be successful as a self-taught
developer I know what to do and how to
help you I've helped a lot of people get
jobs I've helped a lot of people you
know passed a little bar because there's
a little bar there a little step that
when you learn how to code everything is
harder but oh my god it is so difficult
and you feel like you work quick I keep
helping people move on past that getting
to the next level where everything this
it makes sense once you get to that
point then you're good any technology
and programming language and framework
anything that's been thrown at you
you're going to be able to understand it
and find a solution to it and that's a
joke thank you all right now like I said
just take your time look around the
website find the course any light you
can buy or you can say hey I want to

rush I'm going to be right here you can
