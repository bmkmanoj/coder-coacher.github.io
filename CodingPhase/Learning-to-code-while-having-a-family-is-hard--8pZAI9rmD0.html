it again Mack coding face.com your boys
back out and did it again guys man
listen this topic is learning to code
while having a kid I'll be honest I
don't know if I would have been able to
learn everything that I know now Wow I
was having a kid or now that I have a
kid because it's extremely challenging
like I don't know how people do it you
know more power to them like this is
crazy like I haven't gotten no sleep at
all like this week I feel like my brain
is a mess you know what I mean like it's
hard so
those guys that are actually learning to
code and they have a family now elekid
have a life to have well the whole
shebang right like it's actually
difficult man
I tip my hat to you guys oh I think it's
one of the hardest things for me you
know like being able to focus on coding
and then at the same time it's like I
don't have as much time as I used to
because I have to focus on a baby either
I have a flap so calm custody sleepy so
I don't know man I don't know how people
have done it I think is extremely
difficult you really have to have
somebody that supportive it and pretty
much understands what you're trying to
do like you know if you have your wife
your girlfriend whatever all right she
has to understand the the things that
you're trying to make and why trying to
study
learn how to talk because if not if she
doesn't think that that weight on top of
her like hey I'm gonna take care of the
baby man
it's almost impossible to do a lot of
this especially if you work full-time so
I can just imagine like some of you guys
who who are you know or developers speed
right guys who are learning they're
still touching down the udemy classes
touching down on you know freak old camp
or coke Adam II of entry house whatever
you guys are using right so I can
imagine for you guys have a family and
trying to learn is like when do you put
in the time when do you have time to
actually it's a code like now I really
understand what some people get like man
I totally do this for one hour a day or
hanging I only do this like two three
hours a week now on this thing you know
in my cell phone thing I have a lot of
times that I put into YouTube I put into
my website coding phase comm for the
courses that I create but
I can't imagine like a regular person
like I feel like I'm not a regular
person I'm not the average person who
who works at Walmart and it's
like you know what I'm gonna know how to
code I'm not the guy who's a bartender
and he's like man I want to learn how to
code I'm not that typical person right
so I can't imagine them also having a
kid you know you know wife and
everything and just being like y'all I'm
gonna try to learn it's hard I think
it's really really hard I think it's
really hard to basically try to do this
now I'm starting to notice it I'm like
damn this must be hard for some
people you know sometimes we we create a
course or we create a tutorial movie
like hey guys this is easy and this and
that but we don't know what everybody is
going to you know in life you know
somebody might be having issues with
their families a month somebody might've
just had a kid somebody might just you
know they're late on there and
then I can I kinda gotta work hard I
going to work over time whatever it is
right and then to come back home and
learn how to code it's like a really big
sacrifice you know I mean at the end of
piece off but why are you doing it
you're like man this is a lot of work
and sometimes you just can't stay
focused
well like last night last night I try to
do a couple of new new courses that I'm
working on right and I'm coding and I'm
like kill my brain is just not there so
I just I deleted all the videos and like
I'm starting over today maybe I'll take
a little a little nap and get some rest
but I can't imagine somebody who has to
work you know some people work 60 hours
a week 80 hours a week you know they
have two jobs and then they say you know
what I was going to go home and learn or
till treehouse or udemy or whatever they
got to be really hard for those people
it's not that easy is to basically learn
how to code you gotta come to your mind
pretty clear you have to have your life
pretty clear you have to be able to get
you sleep you have to be able to eat
properly and have enough energy so when
you come in everything that you're
trying to learn stays in your brain and
retaining
it's like back in the days you remember
when they used to sell you lately
during high school or you know peanuts
they used to come in and tell you the
hey you know freakin eat your breakfast
eat your lunch and there's a reason for
you say you come in ty coming hungry you
come in whatever without no energy and
there's no way you're going to be able
to retain there's no way that you're
going to be able to do that because it's
just it's complicated and then on top of
that you just have to use so much power
for your brain links
is Alana safely
like today right now I'm going to work
I'm drained I don't even know how that
are you technically is a park or
something that's very difficult now
creating a component that's very
difficult
a lot of thinking a lot of planning to
get a ring but right now I'm just like
dreams
people do I know some people be like oh
then I go to Starbucks and get me a
 venti triple double quadruple
double Coco boca chica loca I
know whatever they call them sit have a
drink all right thank you triple
whatever super shot for getting iced
coffee isn't selling very and they come
back and again low energy boost but the
same time man I don't think that that's
enough so that's why I say yeah drinking
learn kind of code or coding or do
people in general recording while you
having a baby this
and very viscous kangana sleep you're
always tired
I know energy so all of this stuff
becomes difficult
I already is a little bit difficult just
to learn it so then when you don't have
that that brain power you will have that
that four-game energy that that power
system thinning boiling it's hard man so
I definitely feel for you guys all of
you guys that come in here and ya work
two jobs the guys that come in and work
60 hours a week the guys that you know
yeah I work on a weekend like I don't
know how you guys do let me know on the
comments guys I mean are you guys going
through similar situations where like
you're always tired always drained and
you're still trying to learn this right
I want to know who's in here like going
through going through
so yeah man let's import oak back at it
again quoting face.com
make sure you subscribe they show you
like video guys in the description
there's a bunch of courses of course
that made me and tour developer and
there's also a link to my website when
you go to my website automatically you
get 50% off of everything just because
you came to my website through the link
now you go to coding phase comm directly
you don't get that fifty percent now you
have to go to the link from YouTube and
you'll be sweet when you get an
automatical 50 percent off everything
and yeah when she basically tells me hey
I came from YouTube I love your videos
basically give me some love and then you
get that little love I know 50% off you
oh really
for $5 a month you get all my courses I
think that's the best video helping no
one is going to have a deal like that
trust
alright guys so I'll see you guys later
man take care Wow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
