how's everybody how's everybody doing
your boys back I didn't did it again
you did listen man back at it code and
react once again like I love react but
there's certain things that I hate about
it like you know animations you know
transitions between components can be a
freaking bitch I hate that already
yes sometimes this animation that you
can just come up with you're like oh
yeah great I'm gonna do this you know
everything's gonna be fine but not every
transition that you could think of you
could do or react because there's
 limitations to it right so then
you have your you know project manager
or your CEO or you know somebody else in
the company was like hey man what if we
make this fly from the sky and drop
you know drop in front of the screen and
you know we make the animation like
dammit okay cool let's try it then you
spend half a day trying to make the
stupid animation or react and
it's easy to make it through CSSS me
easy to make it through JavaScript the
problem is the transition between the
two components that's where all the
problems is it and its really
annoying but besides that man I'm good
today man how you guys doing man what's
good 84 guys make sure you sign up go to
learn that Coquette look learn that cold
I'm sorry about the crest learn coding
face.com

register it's free you can register for
free now you just get the free courses
right so go ahead register kids yeah we
in here I'm super tired
went to sleep like I don't know one
o'clock two o'clock in the morning super
annoyed with work because like there's
so much that I gotta do because you
know I was gone for like two weeks and
like now it's like everybody wants me to
you know so hey we need this we need
that we need this we need and it's
 annoying but that's not work
hiss man
so wait to make this left and get to the
the turkey man get the turkey sandwich
from the deli boys
also too like I got lunch man
late like it's already 3 o'clock you're
like 2 hours I go huh you know what I
mean sounds like I must spend 45 minutes
here so like an hour and seven minutes a
sign like that then I go home I met I
see you
yeah that's a pre-dinner exactly man
it's super late pissed I wanted
to leave out of there earlier but it's
like I've been trying to get this
 animation between the components
and it's like man I'm just gonna put a
 fate that's it just fade them
you know it's like sometimes is
just not going it's like you know if
you're stuck in one thing and then
you're trying to force it it's like nah
man like I don't even want to look at
the code right now you know what I mean
like I'm ready to move on to something
else
that's one thing that I freaking hate
about like you know when you're working
just one company it's like you're
working just in one product so you keep
on working it's like you perfecting the
same component of the perfecting the
same website and it's like there's no
change there's nothing new it's just
you're working on the same every
day is like damn man you know how many
cool there is out there's man like
that you know that's why I'll be like go
sometimes I'm like I want to do
something else cuz it's like there's so
much I love coding but I like
coding the same every day
you know it happens to everybody happens
to anybody like you know you'll be
sleeping and right and then you
just wake up you're like man I got so
much ideas like that happens to me
all the time last night that was one of
the reasons why I went to sleep late
like after I did Dawg the the show with
with you guys live last night that
was like for three hours man and
definitely we spend another half an hour
behind the scenes so that took a
long-ass podcast I'm about to
bring that up and break it up and
and make it into small small videos
because I know a lot of people don't
they don't want to see the full the full
four hour video so it's like imma cut it
up into pieces
no see sharpers on it it's just a lot of
work c-sharp you gotta be dealing with
 libraries just to do math you
got to import a library it's like that's
the only thing that'll like about it I
don't like most of the languages that
you gotta import something and like
let's say you gotta import like the
 math library you gotta import a
 library to work with the strings
like that type of to me sucks you
know it's like I hate that now but
c-sharp is good man for what is for what
it is is good all right I'm gonna go get
the sandwich with you guys man
yeah I better stay alive
