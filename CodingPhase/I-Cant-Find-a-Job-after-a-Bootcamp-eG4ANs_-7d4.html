man coding phase comm your boy is
backing out and did it again
alright so I'm answering you know some
emails and you know I was like I'm going
over this so pretty much you boy a
message like hey Joe
I talked to a buddy today that went to a
fifteen thousand dollar boot camp out
here now he can't get work he said most
jobs start here at mid-level what is the
difference between junior and a
mid-level right and I just said middle
of was just saying hey you have
experience in build projects that's why
I tell people to do the projects all
right this is a very simple answer guys
like you went to a boot camp you can't
find a job and the reason why you can't
find a job is because you show up to job
interviews with a portfolio of like you
know a little Ruby on Rails web app
alright and then you have like a little
to-do app with react or of UGS or
angular or whatever right and that's it
and then you have like a little
Fibonacci algorithm on your portfolio
guys people are not gonna hire you
because of that they're gonna look at
that and go this guy's a beginner we're
gonna have to train them no you want to
be able to come in and be like hey I
have real projects real websites I've
worked for other companies I work for
other clients alright even if you've
never worked for anybody your portfolio
should look like you already built five
to six different businesses right if you
go to a job interview and show them that
you've worked for other people then
you're going to get higher when they say
hey they need a mid-level developer
mid-level is more of like saying hey I'm
past a junior level of like hey you're
gonna have to help me out and have to
set me up and give me like the easy task
that's what it means being a mid-level
just means your regular developer
I ain't this in reality there's really
no no made level right there's junior
developers right is it the same thing
when I say in that video what say hey in
three months you can't become a web
developer people took it as if like oh
you can learn what developing you in
three months you can try to become a
developer in three months it's like no
it's like you can't become a developer
in three months it's that simple you
just can't write you can become a junior
developer you need developers somebody
who comes into a company they give you
the chance right they're gonna train you
they're gonna take the time with you
then I say okay this person said you
need developers gonna take them you know
three to six months to basically get up
to par and then teach them the the
technologies that they're using in that
company the way how to do deployment the
way how you know they use a certain
framework how they build their CSS
whatever a setter all right that's what
junior developer is anybody can do that
anybody can become a junior developer
all right like you could go into a
company be like hey all I know is HTML
if they take the chance on you but who
will hire you will give you a chance you
could go in and that's it you're a
junior developer but you're not a
developer all right so when people say
mid-level developer all they're really
saying is you're a established developer
let's say you're a developer and that's
it there's developers there's junior
developers they're seniors all right
that's it senior somebody who who
basically knows everything and when
things are really going you know really
going bad everybody's gonna look up to
him just figure it out
how to find an answer right a mid-level
developer is just somebody who is a
developer who have the skills and it's
like that's it that person is prepared
that's what it means it doesn't mean
anything else besides that all right and
the way how you want to show a company
that you're a a developer level is
basically by having real projects you
want to show that other people trust to
you before
you don't want to show up with like a
Fibonacci sequence on your portfolio
like who cares you know what I mean
you don't want to go in there be like
okay I know what programming is but
you're going to have to show me what
what development is like no like you
know that happens all the time you know
what I mean like that happens so many
times guys even you know people that get
higher from who are college graduates
like they graduate from school yeah they
know programming they know the
fundamentals but they don't know what
development so they are junior
developers all right it's like the same
thing as you guys you guys learning in
your house you didn't have to go to a
four-year school but your junior
developer that means when you go to that
first company they're gonna have to
trust you and and basically teach you
the ropes but if you go in there already
prepare and it's like hey I already
taught myself the ropes I already know
how to build any page out of any design
that you give me I already know how to
do Ajax in be able to send data from the
front end to the back end and vice versa
like that's it you're ready after that
you know people showing up from boot
camps with no skills no history of like
what development like building like
little simple apps like nobody cares
about that I'm being honest guys
nobody's gonna hire you because you're
happy to do app that's not what people
are looking for they're looking for
somebody who has done real websites
before have you know bumped into real
issues like you know how how things
happen in real life and they're not
gonna break when your situations like
that happen you know I was like people
fold when they get under pressure so you
know what I mean that's why you know a
mess that's why your friend he can't get
a job tell him to send me his portfolio
I want to see what he got you know
because when you go into this job
interviews if you don't have a certain
portfolio like how are you gonna get
hired you know what I mean like they
can't trust you it's like nobody wants
to come in he's like right now think
about it like this
we have
to build a building right we have to
build a building we have to build the
house right right and we're like up to
the foundation and then we like man
we're gonna need an extra hand man
because this is you know this is a very
big house can we hire somebody right so
we go in we look for other contractors
to come help us out to build this house
but when we get there and we have this
person come in this person is like oh
all I know how to do is you know use a
hammer but it's like wait we need you to
build this house with us what do you
mean all you know how to do is just use
a hammer it's like people is gonna look
at him crazy
that's the same thing as what
development people show up with just
like a hammer and a hand and they'd be
like oh yeah cool let's build this
website and it's like wait what like you
don't have the skills yeah like we don't
have the time to train you we have to
come in and start building this as soon
as possible you can't just stop what
we're doing to go in and teach you like
developers hate that especially when
they under pressure from other like you
know upper management people where they
come in and like oh we got to finish
this project and then they leave you
with somebody who's a junior developer
who doesn't know anything and you're
like wait like I have so much stuff to
do why am I gonna have a junior
developer here bring me somebody who's
mid-level my level is just somebody who
was like a regular developer who knows
all the things about development that's
it you're not an expert but you know all
the processes that it goes to basically
create a web page okay so that's just
what it is man all right guys so to my
website check the links below right on
the description guys there's a whole
bunch of links that's gonna help you out
save you money and at the same time just
taking the right path to become a web
developer you know like all those
questions that I get are really good and
also send me emails when coding freeze
at gmail.com I will answer your
questions I will put it here on YouTube

would just answer it to you on directly
on your email you know but if it's not
primary I'm gonna put it up
