you can't share it why not
also if you want to earn you know get a
little udemy course that's like 200
bucks and I'm actually gonna give it out
for free to you if you want to get a
chance to actually win it there you know
come to my website fill this out
subscribe you know you already know
simple Joe back at it again well anyways
man let's start like this tell you guys
the time that I got over 100 five
thousand dollars to work for a company
right and to me it was like you know
like one of the greatest achievements in
my life and I don't even take the job
but it was for me for like oh god like
you know I made it more like I busted my
ass so many years you know get to this
point because sometimes when you're
teaching yourself there's nobody there
to applaud you and say hey you learned a
new language you know what I mean for me
the way how I reward myself is with
money and giving myself things where am
i okay yeah you stood at home for nine
hours
well now you could go out and buy
whatever the hell you want you know what
I mean so that's how I repay myself I
don't know how you guys repay yourself
and reward yourself but that's how I pay
myself on my head you know what you
busted your ass for 12 13 hours you want
to go and tricking go to the Gucci store
and buy yourself for $400 belt $400 belt
go ahead
you earned it that's hard thing but yeah
so um yeah so it was pretty crazy I got
I offer for $105,000 in a company that
is very respectful and very respected
out here and in the United States and it
was just amazing but I'm gonna start
liked it so we're gonna go all the way
to the beginning before I throw the big
bu T right so I got approached by a
recruiter and the recruiter was like hey
man
oh do you know JavaScript I'm like yeah
I know JavaScript do you know you know
HTML CSS and whatever telling me a whole
bunch of stuff right all the basics all
the things that I learned like two or
three years before and they like it how
much it I know all that stuff
do you know angular I'm like yeah do you
know react like yeah there's like I know
everything's like so you know you know
Morcar do you know Jasmine do you know
you know test dreams and development I'm
like hey I don't have that much
experience in it
because most of the time I don't really
use it in my own code but hey you know I
heard a couple of podcast I'll
definitely write about it and yeah oh
cool you know if you give me the chance
of politics to take it so in my head I'm
like okay cool I'm gonna try to get you
know a little job here in this
company you know well first I don't know
what company would but I was like okay
the person's aren't gonna be a little
 job and our down moment I was
like I had like two weeks without a job
I was like it I'll take whatever
job there is out there so yeah then the
guy goes like okay I'm gonna get back to
you the guy didn't call me up for like
two days then he calls me up and he's
like hey they love your resume I'm like
I don't even know where you send in my
resume to and the guy's like oh yeah
have you heard his company called Viacom
and I'm like wait Viacom isn't it like
you know the guys from like MTV and like
all those channels as well and then IKEA
you know Viacom right and I'm like cool
so it's pretty great on my okay cool so
I'm looking online I go to glassdoor.com
I'm lunching glassdoor.com and I search
you know Viacom I don't know why I'm
doing it live for you guys well like
searching oh whatever
Oh Viacom right so I search Viacom and
I'm looking at the reviews and it seems
like everybody there is pretty happy at
the job you know as far as development
- give me some pretty high reviews oh my
cool that'll be a great you know
opportunity then you know the guy goes
like oh yeah it's like how much we
charge or you know what's his salary
you know what salary being a nice job
and I was like man it was just you know
at that time was like always only so
many thousand you know and the goggles
are all - that's - sure little man we
could get you more than that one legs
you should oh man I'm like I've only
been doing this for like three years
when the very back listen trust me I got
I got connection I got connections in
the company right so then I'm like cool
all right let's see how much you can get
so then he comes back with offer as I
came we have 105 thousand dollars and
I'm like wait but I don't even know
exactly what the position it's like
listening
you basically have all the criterias you
have all the experience that it's needed
for the job and this isn't that right
and I'm like cool all right I'll go for
it right
so then say okay we're going to do a
phone interview you got to pass it down
to you know the manager well they're
Viacom is I got interviewed through the
phone
they asked me pretty simple stuff like
JavaScript stuff right but then at the
end right this is where the buck comes
out all right so the guy goes like yeah
do you more like what did the recruiter
tell you that you're going to be working
on I'm like well pretty much JavaScript
now okay cool I like JavaScript and the
guy was like here well you know you're
not going to be working on anything that
has a user industry and I'm like wait
what so when I say no UI at all they
just mean you're just coding you're just
creating functions and creating
 that you can't even see it's like
dealing with data and dealing with a
whole bunch of other
they wanted me to do which I can do
because I am a very good program
especially in JavaScript but the reality
things is I would have been
miserable right I would have been
 bored out of my mind I will have
to go into the job like just go in from
9:00 to 5:00 autopilot be bored bored as
hell and then come out of work and
whatever and then I'm like man do I
really want to do this thing so - they
send me a test I send me a cut
whatever I sent it back I passed it
they're like okay we want you to come in
and pretty much have a week with the
team and you decided if this job is
really for you right the day that I was
supposed to go I just woke up that thing
and I was like man I don't want to go
over there I don't want to be coding
something that I can't even see and yeah
you could deal with data and stuff like
that and what I was going to be working
on was actually on you know when you go
to like let's say MTV right you got a
video clip basically before the video
starts basically my job will be to
creating like it's like an algorithm
dinner with errors and troubleshooting
you know like the commercials that come
up so it deals with like sessions those
were cookies it does with what the
person actually have has been seen in
before there's a whole bunch of I'm
not going to go into details because
this channel is not to be technical this
channel should be pretty much on a very
high level of like talking about code
and developers right so yeah and I was
just like wait what like I don't even
get to see no user interface like I'm
not building a website I'm not holding
anything that is remotely dinner with
the website is just me coding somewhere
and like in Viacom's basement slaving
dinner was freaking the Google ads that
they have but whatever ad system that
they had built and I was like I don't
want to be doing this man you know what
I mean so when I woke up that day I was
like I'm not showing up and whatever I
didn't show up which probably I burned
bridges over there at Viacom um but I
don't care because in reality like the
recruiter shoulda told me ahead of time
what what type of job was I wouldn't
never even say yes so even taking the
test or doing anything was even wasting
my time away from that home because they
really wanted me to work over there and
they're like oh yeah you know but it's
pretty much is like grunt work it's like
those type of jobs they pay you a lot of
money because nobody else wants to do it
you know what I mean somebody has to do
it somebody has to be building this as
you know ad system for Viacom but that
was not going to be me and the reason
why I make this video is because it's
just hilarious to me where I'm like you
know sometimes we think money is
everything when reality is not because
if you vote just for the money you're
not going to be happy and that's where
the story the story ends is like if you
go in and be like hey I want to be , you
know I don't know a Scala or spark
developer you know then with big data or
whatever one but just being a system
administrator was like a company that
all you deal with with databases like I
don't know about you guys for me that's
super boring like I don't want to be
done with that you know and no amount of
money would give me happiness to be
working with something like that or in a
project like that so yeah it's just
crazy like and I just wanted to share
this story because it was just funny to
me like I was thinking about it like
right now I'm making a pretty decent
amount but it's not that's close so I'm
too far out there making probably twenty
thousand dollars less than that right
and I was just like you know what man
like I wouldn't have been happy there at
all not only was the thing in the city -
because I don't like working the city I
got to take the train I got to wake up
extra early and when traffic coming back
is a hassle like I never really liked it
like that so it was just crazy to me and
again I do make this video for people to
come here and you know and basically
take this as an inspiration you know in
the sense of like I taught myself how to
code and somehow I'm still pull off
those big jobs if I wanted to you want I
mean I don't have four four-year degrees
in computer science or you know any
mathematics or anything like that so
it's like you know it's like when people
be like hey I could work at Google I'm
like yeah me too if I wanted to but do I
really want to work in a company like
that
well what I'll be doing boring just
for you know to say hey I work at this
big company in you know I'm getting this
this this in this really do I really
want to do that I don't know a lot I
mean some and yeah and also so I just
want to motivate people that also when
they check this video out and be like
hey you know those people who just hate
on me and be like oh I hate that guy
how the hell does he even get to go up
there and earn that much I'm a better
programmer than that person yeah buddy
you probably are but happened that
I could get those jobs school you know
what I mean like if I want to because
I'm actually a good programmer but at
the same time I don't come here and try
to be super technical on this channel
but yeah and that was my story of the
day you know
Oh like I kind of went into it before
and somebody actually hate you should go
into more details of what happened why
don't you work at Viacom missing that
and like how much they would try to
offer you so now I'm sharing the story
and what happened right and I probably
burned some bridges over there by call
because I didn't I just didn't show up
which I kind of regret it you solo hey
guys I'm not interested by but you know
because there probably was another
another developer who really really
wanted that job and I was just like I
don't even want that job you know I mean
they would have been boring like working
with shrieking with ads and just
creating you know though working and
testing the app system that they already
had that's what all right guys anyways
