again man : face calm listen I'm reading
through this article by Nathan
Rafael where he basically goes over why
he doesn't tell people that he's an
entrepreneur right and there's a lot of
things here that I agree with him
because it's like a lot of people think
being an entrepreneur it's just like
that's a it's like I'm I'm doing
something on my own and that's it to me
entrepreneur is somebody who creates
something that wasn't there and it's
independent that's for me right um I
will say I will consider myself an
entrepreneur because I'm I've always
been saying this I'm a glitch in the
matrix right like I know as a developer
I'm not the typical developer I know I
don't do the typical things that most
developers do so I'm a glitch right I'm
gonna click in the matrix it's like
everybody's walking this way straight
and forward and I'm like I'll let you
guys keep walking that way imma walk
this way you know so that's the type of
person that I am right so he said a line
here that is very very you know very
important and I think like it makes
sense you know he's like yo wait I
thought all the kids selling Mary Kay
Cutco herbal life were entrepreneurs and
it's like isn't that what they say on
their Facebook profiles are they all
liars or do they simply not speak proper
English right and that is true
you know somebody comes in and signs up
to Herbalife right and they'll be like
hey guys I'm selling Herbalife's I'm
selling you know recipes for you know
losing weight and this and that and it's
like I'm an entrepreneur it's like oh I
don't know about that you're a seller
you're still working for that company
you're not really an entrepreneur
entrepreneur to me is somebody who
starts something independently and build
something right to me that's what
entrepreneur is I don't know about you
guys what you guys think about that
and I also agree with him where he says
hey why don't tell people on my
entrepreneur why don't share certain
things with people because number one a
lot of people always hate you know
people is always gonna hate on you and
they're gonna be like oh man
like why is this guy you know why is
this guy making money on the side
why is this guy always working you know
especially at work guys I always tell
you guys this like when you you're in a
job
listen I'm sometimes I'm guilty of this
like some cuz I'm such a good person
like I opened up to people people accent
questions in our answer I don't cut out
you know information I don't you know
think in my head hey this is what I
gotta tell this person there's people
that's more calculating than me me I'm
the type of person that just come in you
ask me something like oh yeah I just
share it with you
that's it like I don't really think
about it but you guys should not be like
that because it's like it's even in
situations of where I bring in jobs and
and people ask me Oh like you know it's
like what are you do on the weekends I'm
like oh yeah I just called make videos
online and this this and that and in the
end it comes back to bite you because
people would look at you and be like
wait you making money on the side wait
while we all just work from here and you
know like people start noticing things
you know what I mean like no way when I
have boy like my whip people were like
wait it's like you just got here and you
buying whips in and you just had a
camera peoples like you just had I was
about to buy a freaking Maserati and
people was like their head exploded like
like how can you afford a Maserati how
can you buy a Maserati and it's like I'm
like bro this ain't my main income I
come here cuz I'm mere four for fun you
know what I mean like that's how I
looked at work in my last job you know
what I mean like I just went in there
because at first I was like you know
what I want to work here with my partner
this this and that right but then later
on I was like man I'm not into this this
company at all like they super
irresponsible a lot of
a lot of nonsense there right and I'm so
used to like the city vibe because I'm
from New York I'm from New York City you
know I hear Long Island it's more like
people do whatever they want people you
know walk around and the office for 15
minutes every single hour like bro we
have work to do it it's like me and my
other friend there is like we we always
the ones working well everybody gets to
chill go hang out in the pink parlour
you guys see I do a ping pong ping pong
video that was in every single day I was
doing that like one said oh you know
once a month or something like that or
once every three months because we're
constantly working while everybody else
is chillin you know what I mean and
those were things I didn't like from
there so I was like man you know it's
like people they they hate when you you
really independent when you like you're
not really worried about things like
that it's like even the last meeting
they'll ask me to when I'm there they're
like you know Joe how how can we make
you feel better we could tell that from
your YouTube videos that you're upset
from here and this and that and I'm like
bro in my head I'm taking my bro this
ain't even my main income like I ain't
worried about this place you know what I
mean like I got other peoples cording to
me telling me like hey man leave the
company we want to hire you this and
that and I'm like bro like I
I'm just taking about how like bro you
don't even know like God like this is
like a a 25 to 30% of my whole income
like I'm not even worried about this
place you know what I mean and they're
like oh how can we make you feel better
I'm like nothing I think you know it's
just we gotta call it a day but when I
had you know I had guy in there people
start seeing him I'm making money people
start seeing that I'm flossing they're
like oh wait how did you get this how do
you you know it's like how much money
you're making it's like they saying your
whole income you can't tell people
you're entrepreneur you do what you
gotta do you know what I mean take it
from my own lessons you don't share what
you do if they want to find out let them
find out that don't take their time to
do
Google's on you you know what I mean let
them do their Google's you don't share
your information to people because
that's that's how it is envy and
jealousy is always gonna be there guys
no matter how you look at it you know
what I mean like people is always gonna
be worried about what you're doing you
know it does this person make you know
it's like they care about that you're
gonna be dependent on that job so you
never share that you never share that
you're making money on the side right
you never share that you you were you
don't really care about the income from
that job because people get mad people
get upset because a lot of people only
work on a job and that's their whole
income that's a whole life liquor you
know but when you're out here and you're
like an entrepreneur and you're creating
things from scratch and building things
man people get mad and at the same time
it's like how this guy was saying like
people think you know cuz now they just
ask something to their Instagram profile
and they'd be like Oh entrepreneur Oh
CEO of whatever whatever and it's like
so they got a business cars in for like
do you know the Herbalife and now
they're they're CEOs you know what I
mean like bro like you'll work or see it
forever life you know what I mean like
that's what you are you know you're not
a CEO you're not entrepreneur
entrepreneur somebody who start
something from scratch and build
something so I definitely agree with
this guy you guys should definitely
check out his his article you know as
like people got to understand the
difference between being a worker being
just a entrepreneur and at the same time
you can't share that information with
everybody because now everybody's gonna
be able to process it the right way some
people might come at you with jealousy
and envy some people might come at you
with ignorance and be like even joke
even try to joke on you if you come in
and you'd be like hey man I'm creating
the next Instagram right now
the next amazing app something that's
gonna you know disrupt the the social
media
people's gonna laugh at you like you
ain't gonna do nothing so that's why you
don't tell people your business you
don't share your information with
anybody you just do what you got to do
and that's it because you just can't
share it now everybody's ready for that
information all right you already know
