back I'm back I'm back back man okay so
pretty much let's get back to this right
it's very simple
I always said I were very simple all
right
so pretty much we're gonna work with
text right headers in you know the
paragraphs we basically we gonna work
with that right now there's what we're
doing there let's see how we actually
looks okay so we have something like
this okay so it's actually in a dark
color with black but since this is
already black we're gonna make this
white because black on black
you know black on a dark color you can
barely read this right so also which is
something that I forgot to do we gotta
make this into a section we're gonna
make a box over here another box all
right and we're gonna say okay inside of
this large image let's make a box that
is
description box and then we gotta copy
this put it inside okay now we put
controller from here from the styles and
say okay let's go on description box
curly bracket yeah let's see start with
a h6 okay I wish this wasn't SAS so bad
right now because if it was SAS I would
just say I'll put it inside of it and
I'll be like okay h6 but I'm teaching
you the basics of CSS that's like in the
future I'm gonna show you that but for
now is tip skirt long description box h6
and then you say okay let's put this
color white smooth title so okay so
let's call it is sense
Netflix percent and let's change this to
like an h4 change this to page four so
it could be a little bit bigger yeah
there you go
Netflix four cents and then the h1 let's
make it way bigger let's copy this okay
usually better do it like that put in
order and say okay from h1 and then
whatever comes
you know h2 h3 whatever you want but
keep it in order so I made let's say
okay description box font size let's see
how big that is
yes not the back
so we're gonna fill up every chance
again right see but this thing is
becoming too big now now we need to say
okay we only want this to be only 40% of
the screen size because now we need to
control this now we want this again to
actually come at the bottom so like
let's say description box with 40 50
yeah
yeah all right so all right we gotta at
50% and then the h3 is still the same
thing page 3 color white font size
okay font size page three
what isn't this changing scripts new box
oh yeah
we messed about seven corner see a lot
of times little things like that can
mess you up if you miss this it doesn't
right it doesn't do anything but you
gotta end it with a semicolon at the end
see now it changed so let's try to make
this as much possible see that's too big
well much fun let's make this 25 pixels
yeah that's fine
and this actually make this to 60 pixels
family returns
yeah so let's put how about it go right
do the same to this one but for this one
it's still far away so far away is
basically do you want it bold do you
wanna like do you want it however you
want so the higher the number is the you
know the bolder does the font is gonna
be now the lighter it is smaller the
number is the lighter the fun is gonna
be so like this like this this one if it
just is a main tied with one a 700 right
so it's a little bit thicker now this
command C and let's put it here let's
make this to be hungry
now look what happens to this response
see how they got skinnier that's because
of the weight now this thing has a lot
of padding or margin or something
okay whatever you wanna find out what's
going on you just basically you
highlight whatever it is the element
that you want to find out what's going
on with it and you right click it and
click inspect and this is on Chrome
everybody uses Chrome there's like a
industry standard so pretty much there's
a margin let's take off that margin and
say I will h1 margin zero let's see what
happens
was probably because the other one has
some margin to it yeah so h4 same margin
10 pixels give it a little bit of margin
but not that much okay still a lot let's
just bring it to zero okay see now it's
starting to look more clean I don't know
if you see that let's remove the pattern
off this one the margin actually okay
okay so this gonna be like to date with
don't wait on that
400 yeah that's fine
so now has a higher key has a really
skinny one that's more a really big one
which is the main title then the coming
from November which is the date now but
let's see what else can we do to this I
actually don't like this thing being
fixed like that I don't know let's see
what happiness fixed see now scrolls
with the page I like that better
you know okay we gotta fix this for us
too so those are links usually links are
by default there in blue so what we're
going to do we're gonna say okay I lie
inside of it that's a tag
because this guy visit why is this
this works important means LLL overwrite
whatever is going on it's the right many
of this okay that's why because this for
the right menu now let's actually remove
this and make this black let's take off
from over the aged all the anchor tags
let's see what this does is he goes for
all the akka tax and say
style what that's gonna do is take off
the underline because we don't look so
shitty see sometimes there's so much
things in CSS that it's hard to remember
everything you know second million
things yes text declaration that's
already forgot about that
so like nobody's gonna be able to
remember all of this time thank trust me
if like if you remember every single
thing in CSS and every single thing in
JavaScript like I don't know like I
can't even tell you and I don't know if
you have a life or what the hell you do
that's like fucking you know that's like
trying to remember every single passage
and the vibe that we like come on nobody
does that
you know what I mean so yeah now we
removed it now let's change the color of
the paragraph to say description box and
then the paragraph inside of it
so let's say Martin top-right if I
wanted to just do laptop I will say 25
pixels in there they were to the right
they were to the bottom zero to the left
so that would give me
West is being over here you could change
it's more technically this not supposed
to affect it at all but I don't know how
grapple actually work so let's see it's
probably something the Styles messing it
up
let's see now we got that space that we
wanted also to let's make this a little
bit longer so there's still Laura
and what this does generates you know
basically text for us just so you know
it's like placeholders because who's
gonna be able to write all of this you
know what I mean like nobody so this
just generate to the for us it's a
paragraph okay that's a little bit too
long
so it was cool at the same time
let's say for the moment we are good
actually for now so let's change this
dog whoever it goes so it was pretty
long it's already like 12 o'clock at
night I gotta go to work tomorrow
