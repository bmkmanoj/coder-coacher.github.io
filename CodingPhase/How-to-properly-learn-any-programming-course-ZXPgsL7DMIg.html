face.com your boys back and I done did
it again
listen alright he will be asking me Joe
how do we learn how is it that we
supposed to learn this stuff man cuz we
watching videos but it's not sticking
it's not it's not coming here it's not
staying there all right how do you learn
this stuff in an efficient way
right do you guys remember back in the
days when the teachers would talk to you
and give you a lecture and be like hey
guys
bring out your number-two pencils and
write down notes all right take our pen
write down the key words of whatever I'm
talking about that's how you still learn
I'm not one of those people who are like
super smart and it's like oh I gotta
remember everything in the world no I
got too many things in my life that I
gotta worry about other than school you
know I mean so how did I keep all that
stuff in my head how do I remember
everything very simple you gotta sit
down write down the notes man and also
do whatever you're learning right so
let's say an example I did this this
video about basically learning the map
method in es6 right and how to use it
and what is it good for right so pretty
much what I did was I basically said
okay who are users and then a bunch of
objects with a couple of users you got
Joe you got Matt you got Barbara right
so pretty much that's what I did right
you as the student you're supposed to
copy along and follow what I'm doing
right but at the same time once the
video is done your job is not to watch
the next one right unless you already
you completely understand the concepts
if you say hey I completely understand
this fine if you don't completely
understand it meaning hey I don't
remember the syntax hey I don't remember
pretty much how to write this thing
hey I don't understand what's really
happening if you don't understand that
then what you should do is right after
you watch the video instead of you jump
into the next video
okay complete continue this is not
Netflix kids this is not Netflix this is
not a race - who gets to finish
something first
nobody's here you don't pay your money
to say hey I finished the first guys nah
nobody's gonna give you anything for
finishing a tutorial course first and
everybody else is a I did in 25 minutes
a seven-hour course nobody's gonna come
in and give you an award nobody's give
me you hey this is the quickest and
student ever here's a trophy nobody's
going to do that for you
the idea of this is you're paying money
to learn right and the beauty about
having video or learning on your own
time is that it means you don't need to
move on until you get that concept right
so let's say an example we hear we learn
in es6 and we don't understand what is
let's say the map method for why will we
use it right well you should think about
it start analyzing things first you bet
okay we have a bunch of users in this
array each one is in the object right
let's say an example right so then here
the person is saying okay
user names he's creating a new variable
right and then he's saying equals to
users that map and then he's basically
passing in one user 1 user right and
then return him back just that users
name right now what happens after that
basically like I said you get everything
returned back right you you get one
users name return back inside of an
array so how will you remember this
right the first thing that
I would do is right after I follow this
and I copied it exactly how do you and
the instructor had it as a student what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna test myself
I'm gonna challenge myself and instead
of me going forward and just jumping
ahead if I don't understand it is I'm
gonna sit down for a second and come
back to it and create something very
similar to it but with a little twist
from your own brain right we were
talking about users right so what I
would do is I will say okay artists so I
have a list of artists let's say JZ
camera JZ 44 camera or 40 all right
then I come here and say okay artists
dot map and then I remember I have a
function and inside that function I want
to pass down one artist right then I
pass down that one artist and what I
want is to have the name of each artist
so that's going to return me back in
array right with each artist inside of
the array all right so that's when you
come here it's okay
you do something like this you say
artists names all right so you got this
variable so now far equals to this here
so now what I console.log artist names
it returns back jay-z and camera right
and that's what I all I wanted right now
as you being the student now you
understand everything to happen you have
an array full of objects it doesn't even
have to be full of objects it can also
just be numbers it can just be names
that can be strings it could be anything
right but you have this and then you
understand that okay I have the artist
right and
then if I return that back it returns me
back to artist names now you sort of
understand it so then you say okay cool
this is what happens with objects what
happens if I come here instead of
objects I basically say something like
this I come here and I say 23 a 44 and
let's say something like a string JZ
right what happens there you start
playing around with the code start
messing it up start breaking it alright
so you can understand what's happening
okay wait undefined and then you're
thinking at all yeah I was basically
trying to get a property that's not
there because this is no longer an
object so you come here you delete this
and see what happens
you say oh okay so basically what I did
was I took every single one and put into
this new artist names right you just
start messing with it until you
understand it me personally I never go
from video to video to video to video
what I do is I take my time if I don't
understand the concept I take my time on
that topic and stay there until I
understand it and I try different
variations of what the teacher the
instructor showed me all right I can
come here and put in and like let's say
an array I can come here and put in an
array all right and be like hey all
right so now we have arrays inside of
arrays what's gonna happen in that
situation that's running you know show
every term back 1 or a 1 all right one
all right it's like I know it seemed um
but what I do is I always come back I
break whatever the teacher was teaching
me right I break it and then put it back
into into a working format whatever it
is it doesn't matter it could be HTML
could be
Oh JSX it could be anything out there
it could be whatever it is you take
whatever the teacher the instructor
showed you you break it then you fix it
all right and just play around with it
until you understand then you're like
okay now understand what's happening
hey you underst you understand that what
the map function does is basically
return back and basically returns back a
a brand-new array with whatever you
decide to put in in here if we was to
pass in an object and you'd put in a
property then whatever you're returning
here is basically it's the the name of
the property that is from that that one
artist that single item and that's how
you learned guys I know I'm going too
deep into this map function but the
reality is all about just you guys
coming in follow what the teacher has do
it copy exactly how it is
verbatim then you come you stop you try
to make it on your own right if you
can't you'd make the same example that
you just did what you do is you
basically you try to do as much as you
can and if you you can't do like I say
right now somebody all they could get oh
they could remember was you have an
array of users if that's all you
remember fine right then from there you
come here and you copy this you
basically come back and go into this
thing right or even before you you give
up and say oh man i'ma go I'm gonna go
back and look at the answer that they
struck the Hat nah take a little time go
online and search map method JavaScript
because this is what you're gonna do
constantly oh it doesn't matter if you
work on Google you still got to look at
the documentation you work at NASA you
still got to look at the documentation
nobody remembers all of this stuff
nobody you ask somebody
show me every method in JavaScript their
head is gonna explode right that's it so
you have to think about it like that
it's like okay if I'm stuck let me find
the answer before I go back to the video
that the instructors show me let me go
and look for the answer and then once
you get that done then you come back and
be like okay I got it
I understood it you get what I'm saying
so that's how learn you want to learn
this and you want to take advantage of
what you have now which is basically the
internet just gave you the option to
learn anything out there man we joke
around with joking about this video this
funny little commercial that I did
self-taught gynaecologist it's funny it
is a funny thing but at the same time
it's like I'm pretty sure somebody could
teach themselves how to be a
gynecologist out there and that's no
joke you know what I mean like this if
they go hard and they want to learn that
you can learn it on your I mean it's
somebody gonna trust you I don't know my
butt but is it you know it's like you
can learn anything man it's just uh you
gotta find your way to basically
learning don't skip things don't be like
oh I'll come back to this no no no no
buddy you stay right there until you
learn and then you jump to the next
thing because most tutorials in most
courses what they do is they give you a
easier thing first if you didn't learn
that in the beginning you're gonna be
left up later all right
so love you guys man stay up coding
phase com yes come to my website man
coding phase comm you just come here you
will I hate coding face.com you click
there it brings you to my website it
does not look like that that's my that's
