again man
coding face.com alright so we hear you
know what developers lunch break yeah I
know what I do every day on my lunch
break I come here and share my story
share my my experience with you guys
just you know come share some time with
my subscribers I'll let you guys know
exactly what's going on with me and what
I'm up to
I'm pretty sure you guys are used to
this now alright so I would have started
with this little topic of I don't like
responsibility right I don't like the
responsibility of being the senior
developer I've never liked it and that's
why even though I'm paperwork I am a
senior developer I know a lot of
Technology I know a lot of different
programming languages I know a lot of
frameworks but there's a certain
responsibility that comes with it
the moment you put that title senior
developer means you're responsible for
every fuckup right that's what it means
right so when somebody messes up like
let's say if our remote developer messes
up if junior developer messes up if
whoever messes up right because you're
the senior developer you're responsible
for the and people are expecting
you to give answers on why things happen
and why do you let it happen why nobody
checked this and why there's bugs
whatever it could be a many situations I
don't like being the senior developer so
right now currently I'm oh you know I'm
basically like a full stack developer I
do the front-end of the backend but
mostly the front-end work a lot with
react G yes
Redux right now my partner who is the
other guy that works with me
he's more he has the more senior roles
he does more the the high colas the big
meetings the bigger decisions and I'm
happy with that I'm extremely happy with
that because I used to working another
company where I had to make all the
decisions and I had four or five four
other people
under me and they kept up and
messing up and then messing up and
messing up and messing up and then I
have to give the face of like oh this
happened because it is this happened
because there are and people are always
constantly asking questions like why
should his worldwide is up
you know I hate that I'll be
honest because I know my code I know how
what I do I know if you give me a task I
get it done right but I don't know what
the next person is going to do right so
plus - it brings a lot of stress
man
so whatever make the story short my
partner is not here okay so now there's
like two developers on the company which
is me and him right and there from there
there's other people who are remote
developers and now everybody is reliable
we have one guy who's very reliable we
trust him but then there were other
people who were working on the code who
we just couldn't trust they weren't
doing the job you know - the best right
the best that they can
some of them didn't want to even look at
laravel don't even want to look at the
documentation then I oh I wanna I know
everything already
watch the videos don't even want
to watch the videos okay but whatever
that's a long story but my partner's not
here
he's actually on vacation which to me I
think there's like really the bad time
to take a vacation because of everything
that's going on we switching to a new
website we there's like so much
behind the scenes guys when you work for
large companies that you know it's just
a lot of work you know like you
guys are gonna get to that level to
pretty soon and you're gonna see what
the hell's going on and don't think like
the person that's on top it's not doing
that much work that person is doing a
lot of work that person might not be
doing a lot of coding once you get to a
certain level you're not doing that much
coding but dealing with people and
dealing with problems that come up
constantly
that's how you know it's like they did
their job you know what I mean
like my partner I know he he does his
thing he's definitely a great employee
great developer you know he works harder
than me I'll be honest he does because
he puts in way more hours there's been
days that he stayed over night like
crumb comes in at 11 o'clock in the
morning till the next day at 6:00 in the
morning and he's still working on the
company like he me personally I don't do
 like that but him you know he
definitely he earned his his kick right
now because he's on vacation
I gotta handle everything I gotta handle
people coming asking me questions about
 I gotta handle explaining people
why there's bugs I got a handle
every I don't know man every
 Under the Sun right and for me
I hate doing that because all I
care about is coding I don't care about
office politics I don't care about you
know explaining to people that
don't understand how code works I
 hate that you know what
that means but that's how it is that's
what some people would ask me oh why
haven't you gone to work I
 Google Facebook and all these
 places every time that
I'm going to like you know I'm
like I'm thinking on my hand I'm like I
should just apply to one of those
 companies but soon as I talk to
the recruiter they don't want to
put me in as a regular developer
I'm like yeah I just want to go in as a
regular developer I wanted to do code I
want to do automatically they want
to put me in a box of being a senior
developer I don't want that
title I'll tell people all the
time I don't want to have the title a
senior developer I don't need it
it comes with too much responsibility in
too much
and I don't want it no like a while back
somebody was telling me hey I
hadn't recruited I wanted me to go to
work for LinkedIn but they didn't want
to hire me just to be a
relative developer they wanted me to go
in there as a senior developer I'm like
okay I have five years but doesn't mean
I want to get a senior role I don't want
that you know what I mean so I
don't know everybody has different goals
if I become a senior developer number
one I have to code less cuz I have to
worry about other people I gotta
manage other people which I don't like
to do and number three I got a deal with
more of the office politics of talking
to people like when I go into work I
don't want to talk to nobody
I'll be honest with you guys I want a
coat and that's it and get out of there
I don't want to talk to people I don't
want to be friends with nobody I don't
want to be lovely w-with nobody know I'm
there to work and get out of there you
know I come in through one door I leave
through that door I don't do it no extra
activities once in a blue I might hang
out and do some ping pong and like
that
but I'm there to work and when you
become you know I've seen the developers
you got to do so much other man
that's not just coding and I don't want
to do that you know plus you gotta be
more you got to dedicate more time to
the company than just being a regular
employee you know just a regular
developer if you're just a regular
developer you go in nine o'clock five
o'clock you're out you go in nine
o'clock maybe you'll stay till 6:00 or
6:30 when you're senior developer and
something hasn't gotten done you're
responsible for that if you have to
stay there like till the next
day you have to stay there you're
getting paid a lot of money you're
getting paid more than everybody for a
reason and me personally I wouldn't want
to be doing that I see you now I
saw in the last company I was working on
and I see it here I'm like yo I don't
want the responsibility
you know cuz when you you do programming
you're not just like somebody who works
at I don't know customer service
marketing or something else right you're
pretty much you can't turn off
like meaning you can't turn off of like
oh man it's the website yup it's
everything working is the database
working is everything done right is
customer having a problem of signing in
or whatever even after you leave from
work let's just stay on your mind right
so when you're senior developer you have
to deal with all that even
afterward me personally I don't like
special and that was just a quick little
rat
a high
which is ridiculous how hot it is
yeah man nah there's definitely good
money being a senior developer like what
and when you look at it on paperwork
it's only like ten twenty thousand
dollars all right extra just to become
you know to become the head ite or head
developer whatever you're only gonna get
$10,000 $20,000 more than everybody to
me that's not working for all the
responsibility to stress all the
 you gotta go through all the
 meetings is not worth it
because just here on YouTube I can make
up extra $60,000 a year all right so why
would I want to a you know bust
my ass so hard and and leave out of work
every day stressed out you know what I
mean it's not worth it you know ten
twenty thousand dollars for my health
it's not worth it at all
you know so that's what I'm saying you
know it's up to it's up to you guys
right everybody has their own goals
their own things that they want to do
with their lives me I don't want to I
don't want to like climb the ladder with
oh now I'm the head of all the
developers I don't want to get that
I could care less about that I want to
work about own code but I don't want to
be having the responsibilities
of worrying about everybody else or or
people coming to me all the time and I
have to answer questions what's going on
with the company what's going on with
with the stack whatever I like I don't
care you know what I mean so for me ten
twenty thousand dollars extra I rather
not even do it
I think becoming a senior
developer or becoming the go-to guy for
a company that should be paid at least a
quarter million dollars or half a
million dollars because the stress level
that you get out of it you guys don't
know
like it's not worth it that's what some
companies a lot of startups they be like
oh they want to hire people but are we
gonna pay you $120,000 and then we're
gonna give you our position money or or
 stocks or whatever because they
know they're putting so much pressure on
those developers to create this new
product and it's like for them then I
kill this is not worth it why would
you want to have that type of stress for
just a pain and you're not even
part on other company you know what I
mean like but yeah man let me see let me
see what's up with everybody man
yeah I've been senior I've been seen
here for a while I just don't want that
 on my title
whenever I'm telling you right now
whenever I see that on any higher
colors on any job description I
don't apply to it it's that simple for
me I'd rather have to you know when
you're just a regular developer right
let's say for you guys you guys are
junior developers yeah get a wide open
space of up meaning hey you came
in late today oh it's ok it's the junior
developer oh he forgot this oh it's all
right
the junior developer right when you're a
mid-level developer say ok they expect
more from you then ok you're gonna come
in on time you're gonna do your work you
don't need nobody to babysit you right
but when you are senior developer now
it's different it's a different type of
responsibility you gotta be responsible
for all the other developers whoever's
there that's if there's not another
senior developer now you're like the
 you're the grandfather of
everybody in the office right and
everybody comes to you for questions
everybody comes to you for four answers
are on certain things me personally when
I'm I work I just like to code I don't
want to talk to you you know what I mean
like me and my partner's my boy Joe he's
super cool like we we have a lot of
in common so me and him have a good
dynamic of working good together but
with other people I don't want to talk
to you when I might work I put on my
headphones I want a coat I don't want to
have conversations of helping
you out or how to code I don't
want to be telling you like oh yeah
check Larry cuz I do this because number
one people everybody thinks they know
everything right so let's say you bump
into a junior developer who swears he
knows everything under the Sun you as a
senior developer will have to tell him
hey you're doing this wrong then from
there it becomes into a debate
oh but I can do it like this and
do like that don't it doesn't
matter I'm the senior developer
if I'm telling you don't do it like that
just don't do it like that right that's
what I want to say to him or to the
person whoever it is but you can't do
that because it's a working environment
right you can't just be an asshole and
just shut people down but when you're
just a regular developer you're like all
cool this guy up okay cool I'll
do my job gun I can't worry about him
I'm not responsible for his work you
know what I mean yeah so that's how it
is man that's what my god and it kind of
sucks I think it kind of sucks when
you're just looking for a regular
there's a lot of people like me they
don't want to have you know any type of
manager type job right or any type of
responsibilities over others right so it
kind of sucks because it's like okay if
you want more money you have to keep
 going up right but then if you
feel happy where you are you could just
say this I'm happy where I'm
at man you know what I mean you make I'm
not trying to have that stress that that
drama
where they hire for front-end developer
I mean look all indeed calm man in here
guys
yo ya better stop playing man yeah I
better stop playing go to coding phase
calm guys listen go register stop
playing you want to learn this trust me
your boy got the cheat codes I got a
pretty good course and the ones that
have started there's a lot of people
that signed up but I haven't gone back
to the website they haven't started the
courses guys you're paying for something
alright do yourself the favor take the
time man I'm telling you guys you do one
hour a day right you do one hour a day
is going to pay off a million times
trust me there's like a skill that after
you have it you're always going to have
to scale and then from there you're
going to be able to learn so much and be
successful in this world it's like right
now like let's say in a sample somebody
is a you know you work it on
retail right you work at a store right
you work at a store somebody fires you
that's it you got fire you can't do
you got to look for somebody else to
hire you again but if you are something
like a carpenter you are engineer you
are a mechanic you are you know somebody
who creates with his hands like
you're always gonna have to skill so
come on guys like stop playing man go to
coding phase comm if now if you if you
don't trust your boy that I can teach
you in the best way that's fine I have
another links right on my description
that's gonna teach you how to code
everybody has different ways me
personally the way I'm teaching people
is a way
of the self-taught I'm calling it
I got about to trademark this it's
called the self-taught method right it's
a way to teach you when you're
self-taught when you're learning in your
house now most of the people that teach
courses they teach it in a way of how
they teach computer science which is
they give you a video of all the
examples or whatever the syntax is or
the programming language and then go to
the next part and they say okay this is
functions go to the next one this is
objects go to the next one this is a
race go to the next one right but
they're not teaching you what an object
is they're not teaching you what is it
useful so in your head is like okay this
is an object that's how it looks but
what am I gonna use it for so that's
what I do
I'm teaching you guys in every single
section why is it there what is it
useful and then I give you the exercises
and I give you examples man if you're
struggling on JavaScript trust me guys I
got this courses oh I'm
surprised I'll be honest I'm surprised I
was doing it yesterday there was one
video where I talked about data types
which I redid where thanks to I forgot
his name
it wasn't cameras uh another care forgot
his name sorry you told me about
I said data structures instead of data
types so what I did I just redid the
video uploaded it and everything's sweet
and that was because I was like doing a
laravel course and also working on the
JavaScript course which I kind of
learned from that is I'm gonna just
finish the whole JavaScript and then do
the lab of course later on because I
can't have my mind on two different
courses I have to do one at a time so
yeah but yam and the way how I'm
teaching this course man is is legit
guys man take take the time take the
time to go in there if you were
struggling with JavaScript before or you
still haven't gotten it trust me guys
give this a try it's five dollars the
link is on the description link on the
description just do that
alright guys like it's going to pay off
trust me man and just put in one hour I
don't want everybody to just be like hey
I'm gonna try to knock out the whole
course in one day now don't do that yes
you could do it cuz I think it's like
six seven hours long but take your time
just go in duel every exercise
understand what you just learned don't
just jump to the next one if you didn't
understand it if you understand it fine
if you didn't rewinding watch it again
one good thing too that I'm doing and
the courses is basically instead of me
just giving you the answers to every
single thing under the Sun I'm teaching
you how to find the answers of whatever
you want to learn right like let's say
an example I was talking about a race
right yeah I was showing people how to
create an array how to add into an array
using push how to remove an item from an
array and then I told them check out the
JavaScript references now I want you to
basically reverse this array most most
of this arm you know tutorials or
courses out there they teach you in a
way where you're always going to be
dependent on what the developer said so
if the developer didn't teach you
how to find the answer now you're lost
you don't know how to do it on your own
so what I did say you know what guys I
show you how to do you know add things
into an array how to use push which is a
method now I want you to actually go
take your time and find out how to
reverse an array it's super simple it's
just saying that reversed and then
parenthesis so that's easy but what that
does is I didn't teach you that I just
told you what you need to do now you
need to use your brain and find it I
gave you the website where to find all
the different methods for arrays and
then from there you have to go on your
own and basically figure it out
if you can't like you gotta understand
this guy's nobody knows everything under
the Sun all you need to know is how to
find things you don't have to remember
every single method in JavaScript
because I think I don't know this
hundreds or thousands of methods
all right so you can't remember all of
that
you're only gonna remember the things
that you use every single day now
whenever you have to do something that's
outside of your comfort zone or outside
of what you do on the regular then
you're gonna know how to search it
you're gonna know how to look at the
documentation and find something all
right so that's my self taught method
that I'm teaching people because
I feel like you know it just has to
change
like I've been watching a whole bunch of
courses and a whole bunch of different
instructors and now I'll be honest I've
taken a little bit from this I'm taking
a little bit from now taking a little
bit from that and then say okay what
worked for me as a self-taught developer
I'm not worried about hey I'm a computer
science major and I want every detail I
want every technical thing know what
worked for me as a self-taught developer
and then that's why I implement in this
course but yeah definitely man and on
top of that I'm gonna constantly add
things like my plan for the JavaScript
is the JavaScript course is to actually
just once I finished the syntax teaching
you guys the syntax which means how to
write JavaScript after that it's just
every week just add a new project in
there because that's another thing where
everybody comes to me people come here
all the time and leave a comment say Oh
Joe what type of website should I make
what type of application should I do to
practice my JavaScript what type of
things should I do for you know for me
to get a job I'm going to add all those
things in there because like once you
learn of course our learning a
programming language right you need to
practice and you need to have real-life
examples so if you don't work for a
company it becomes hard cuz now you
gotta not only learn the language but
now you got to look online how to
continue learning and how to actually
find write examples and this and that so
that's where I'm I come in and I'm gonna
make this courses just a continuation
it's not just like oh you bought a
course once and that's it that course
never gets updated the course is gonna
continue getting updated because like I
told you guys I'm making coding phase
calm like my business
that's gonna be that's my exit plan my
exit plan for next year where I'm just
gonna focus on coding phase comm I have
500 users right now it's not a lot it's
not thousands and thousands but the goal
is to get 10,000 users and I know I can
do that alright so the goal is to get
10,000 users and not just have them
there register I'm talking about active
users that people gonna continue coming
back and that's the plan man so this
isn't like a thing where you're at oh I
signed up for something and never got
updated nah that's what I'm gonna be
doing every single day for the rest of
my life updating new courses for you
guys or updating the older courses for
the people are coming in
but yeah man your boy is back and I
didn't did it again guys I gotta go back
to work
got an East Side
yeah Barbara said it best man no
hand-holding here because that's the
thing that's how that's how you don't
learn man people don't don't understand
they're like oh man I just want you to
show me a video of how to do everything
it's not about teaching you how to do
everything it's about teaching you how
to actually find the answers to problems
and how to not give up
that's what's more important what you
need to know is how to find the answer
how to Google where is the documentation
how to read a documentation how to
understand when somebody comes to you
and tells you certain terminologies like
that's what's really important
yeah man
drive safely ya know I'm gonna
all right guys I'm gonna see you guys
later man it's probably cutting out
probably my my service is cutting out
you already know how Verizon be doing me
all right I'll see you guys need a man
guys go to coding phase comm subscribe
it's not that hard if you don't believe
me and you want to go straight to the
sources and you're like oh you know what
I just want to take the courses that you
took Joe you want to take the longer
wait cool it's right there on my
description like what I say what I'm
doing is I'm creating courses for the
people that want to learn as soon as
possible the people that want to get
hired as soon as possible
they have order the technology that and
frameworks and programming languages
that you need all the skills that you
need all right or something yeah being
here man
live coding face.com love you guys man
