what up guys good morning good morning
kids
alright so we're going to talk about
primetime hours to actually cold
especially when you're working in a
company like a lot of times you know
employers will try to squeeze as many
hours day as they can out of you because
yeah you're gonna paid a lot per hour
but at the same time are you productive
in all of those hours I don't think so
alright for me I believe that the most
well the best time to actually code is
from 10 o'clock to maybe 130 2 o'clock
you know that's like working on a
full-time you know as a full-time
developer in the company because at nine
o'clock when you come in you're half
asleep you know you're tired you're
basically talking to where your coworker
see how was the day how was the weekend
whatever it is right and then you start
working on your project
like a 10 o'clock then from there from
10 o'clock till 1:30 that's when you're
really busting your ass that's when
you're really going hard you know then
you go to like lunch half asleep no
because once you eat you get you get
tired you know you got a little Stevie
you get a little relaxed
whatever right then after that you're at
work and you're like I get to get outta
here so from 2 o'clock to 5 o'clock
up for like glitter
pulls down down goings here what
you know you just can't wait to go home
and I don't care what nobody says people
will be like oh you know you know you
 find a job that you love and
you'll never work a day in your life or
some like that right that's
 because work is work man
this is difference when you work on your
you know personal projects you enjoy it
when you're working for somebody else's
project is boring most of the time
because a lot of times it's like you're
not working on Lila on edgy technology
or like the bleeding edge or
 the latest code or you most
likely working with like old you know
old technology you're not working with
the latest framework you're not working
with the latest programming language
most of the time you're working with
something that's old something that you
you know you learned like years ago so
no matter what it's gonna get boring you
know to you it's like right now man like
where I'm at
in my in my career I don't know like I'm
at a point where I've been here for five
years right and to me I love coding I
love coding every day but I don't know
if I'm getting so so much excitement out
of web development because I feel I've
already learned everything that I needed
to learn to build any type of
application so now I'm not being
challenged I'm not creating coaching you
know so
now I don't even know what's my next
step that's how I feel right now
man I got to find something else so I'm
trying to get into what you know was it
fake apps development so I don't know
I'm gonna see I got actually see which
way I'm gonna go for the next five years
because what development school is a
great way to start but I feel like I
already graduated from me I'm at a point
where I want to graduate something more
like I really want to work with crystal
Ling like I love crystal like I love
Ruby Ruby on Rails and then now crystals
like the wild wild west where it's like
is brand-new technology nobody
when I would be back
have created a Soze
impacting the commute I want the cash
and then I also want to be doing
something else something cool something
fun
it was like the base store tutorials I'm
gonna do some tonight and I haven't done
it because it's like it's hard man it's
hard to you know doing your house lair
about 9:00 my house
dude I rebellion at work right and they
come back home in two tutorials online
well to me is like it's kind of boring
it's getting kind of boring like I know
I want to teach a lot of people to learn
it because for a lot of you guys is
something new to me is old I've been
doing that before three years already
I've been doing this for a long time
it's kind of getting boring
something that I've never done before
like I was on and looking at this
tutorial from fazer Jas which is a game
engine for JavaScript and I was like you
know I was excited cuz I was like man I
don't know nothing I'm like a noob and
this thing I like I don't know anything
so it's like I'm loving it right now
it's like I'm exploring something new
something that I've never done before
understanding WebSockets more because
I'm creating this like multiplayer game
you know and then from there I'm gonna
release it to the app store so you guys
could play it it's dumb it's a dumb game
but it's freaking it's like my my first
game that I'm creating you knows

Taemin I try to get back into the golang

annoying this like the third time that I
try to get back into it and like I
bought another another tutorial from you
on golang from another person and I'm
just like man this is boring like
I'm trying to like it but it's boring
it's like it's not really it's not a fun
languages it's like a mixture see see
with like I don't know with like
JavaScript and then the way how the
packages work and the folders are are
set up and that you got to have a go
environment like I don't know miss

better process a better working
environment for building websites or web
apps

afeeling even elixir got a better
environment enough the is this guy
