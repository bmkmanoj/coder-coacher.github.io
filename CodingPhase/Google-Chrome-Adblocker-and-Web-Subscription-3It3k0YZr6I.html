but it's not live
I'm sorry guys man I know you want me to
do the live videos but i'ma leave it up
for Sunday's man
I'll leave that for Sunday's and for the
podcast you know cuz I want to give you
guys good quality man I don't want to be
giving you guys you know no more shitty
quality that you guys is not gonna
be able to come back to it and be like
oh man what the hell happened so today's
topic is gonna be about you know Google
Chrome you know so Google Chrome is
releasing a new version I guess this
week or next week where they're pretty
much gonna add ad blockers to it right
and I think is a good idea because this
website that you go and you're like man
there's a million ads on this website
why am I watching this why is
already so freaking advertising in the
beginning or on the side why is there a
pop up you know like that right so
that's where this new a blocker is
coming out from chrome which i think is
going to be good and it's going in the
right direction right so I think there's
my you know developers intuition there's
what I think it's so I think that Google
is going to come a little way that users
can pay Google right and then pretty
much if you have a website
description so you could pay $5.00 a
month ten dollars a month right and then
you won't see any advertising on any
website now the website will get paid
depending on the views and depending on
the clicks or whatever they decide to
come up with Google is is a bitch Google
will find out the best way to make money
and monetize websites right because
there's so many people who are using ad
blockers so Google's like you know what
we're going to get into this we're going
to actually knock it out the way we're
going to create our own and we gotta get
in front of everybody because we're
Google so you know me I'm definitely
gonna sign up for that you know to pay I
guess $10 $5 $10 or whatever it is to
pay a month to basically go on the net
and not see any advertiser I'm fine with
that that's at the same time I know I'm
supporting the websites that I like
if somebody creates up a good blog or
creates a good video on YouTube like I
want to support them like that's the
truth
so I think whatever Google is doing now
whatever they're going for is a great
idea I think that's like the best way to
go
people hate advertising okay when they
want to see something and they had to
watch like 20 commercials so yeah
just got here to my you know my little
deli there's the spot there's the spot
where I get my food you already know
all right guys man you already knows
about Joe back at it again man I love
you guys make sure you subscribe make
sure you like this video and share it
with your farm man let them know Google
out to release something that might
change the internet because everywhere
you go people say hate the Internet is
free you know you go on the website and
it's supposed to be free and this and
that
well hmm maybe not not anymore
people are coming up with new ways to
monetize everything on the internet like
I wouldn't be surprised they try to
monetize I don't know you know
 saving things to to the browser
or saving things to the the
bookmark like somebody's got to monetize
something right I already see it with
you know Chrome extensions people are
monetizing anything you know they'll
tell you analytics from YouTube for 50
bucks 50 bucks a month which you're
already getting under Linux from YouTube
for free but people find find a way to
make money right I was talking to buddy

video man I love you guys
