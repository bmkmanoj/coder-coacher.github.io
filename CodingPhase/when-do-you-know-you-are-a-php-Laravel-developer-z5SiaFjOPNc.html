back out it again
I didn't did it again yeah man trouble
just get out of my house Reina
going to work yeah when somebody acts
from tonight Joe when do you know that
you know Lera well right well is that
you know that you are actually a laravel
develop well I will say the moment you
can create an app a web application
right move degree and web application
with multiple routes and then you can
post a tattoo server right you post a
this observer pull data from the server
what else have user authentication
create something like permissions you
know like let's say permissions of one
user ticketing into this area and one
user cannot get into the other
what else something like they should
know you know it should be comfortable
with using PHP artisan and I like how to
create a model because you shouldn't be
creating those things Manning you should
never be creating a model or controller
by yourself you should be using PHP
artisan let me see what else you should
at least know what tinker is like
sometimes you want to mess around with
the data through the terminal so you
should know at least a little bit of
tinker how it works what else you should
know
that's pretty much it and just know how
to debug things like you know sometimes
you might miss a variable on a page and
what it is going to show you is a thing
that says whoops there's an error but it
doesn't tell you where the variable is
my stuff I like let's say you you want
to I don't know display a a total of
items on a cart right
but items is missing right so you got to
know how to debug that page to find
which variable is the one that's messing
up and it's just about commenting things
out it's just like how JavaScript is is
just you go into that page on that view
and then common things out and basically
see which one which variables work in
which one is not working and that's how
I usually find it also to knowing PHP
blade the blade template understanding
it knowing how to use it is very
important
another thing that I tell people please
don't go crazy or creating you know
they're from includes by people start
making everything into a include
that sure is really annoying
let's say you create a a page right and
your page has multiple sections and then
you break up that page into multiple
sections so every section has a
different page and then you just include
them into that one page that's
annoying guys don't ever the lesson
right because I include it should be
taken out out of a page if it's going to
be reusable somewhere else so that's
like a component right only reason you
should have include like separate a
patient multiple sections if any of
those sections you're going to reuse it
somewhere else if you're not going to
reuse it somewhere else
don't split it up because it's
really annoying I hate when people do
that we're sad I hate when people
to lash it with matter I hate to
talk various like people day like that's
like smart or like in a witty like oh
yeah I just broke down one page into
several files and then oh just
now if I want to edit something I have
to keep jumping from file to file
instead of doing it in just one file it
doesn't make sense to know what I mean
we're men
so it's very small
they want a lot of tires my slacks
I hurried it yesterday I heard like a
pop I thought it was something else
so I guess I
there was some time
maybe shaking out a window
annoying
anyways guys
yeah so those are the things I think
like are very boring when it comes to
Clara those other things that you don't
pay attention to if you know those
things create a web app and the sound
cliche to say this but if you know how
to do
I heard below the station ready
I also understand it was you know how to
return a JSON data and like I said
before most importantly is how to debug
things is really important
to understand that happy birthday
what are you doing with any questions
you guys have send it to me on a TL and
coating fees at gmail.com any questions
I think I'll see you on the chat room on

to learn it down straight right trust me
guys I'm telling you now ahead of time
like there's so much different things
that you have learned from Java school

tasks have slowly
trust me even if you pay just for one
month just for that course alone it's
