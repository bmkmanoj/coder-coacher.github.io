back at it again man : face calm listen
your boy is back make sure you subscribe
make sure you like this video and also
when you got a chance go to my website :
face comm subscribe there putting your
information most likely I'll gives you a
free course Wow alright so I'm going
over my stats which is pretty great I
think I've done pretty great in the past
two three months and you know my channel
is going up every single day but that's
not the point the point of why I come to
the staff is to basically see exactly
which other videos that people want to
see and which ones they don't want to
see and something that I noticed which
is very important a lot of people they
want to find videos that's gonna give
them the easy route of saying hey become
a web developer you know in two
weeks become a you know freelancer in
one day I'll teach you over the tricks
and tips and whatever the you wanna
say on a video to basically catch the
attention of people because one thing
that you gotta notice is that a lot of
people don't want to put in the work
do you know how many people sign up to
courses on udemy alright they saw a lot
of people signed up on courses on udemy
but then they don't finish it or most of
the time they go through it and only do
like 10 20 percent of it right because
it takes time right and just a lot of
people so to you know not to bring up
coding bootcamp but a lot of people go
to these boot camps with the hope of
becoming a developer in three months and
then they like okay I got my little
 certificate that says hey I
went to whatever boot camp and
now I'm a web developer it doesn't work
like that guys you have to actually put
in the work
just because also on just because you
did a course up on udemy or just because
you did a few projects on YouTube and
just because you date one month in
talking to a treehouse that doesn't mean
that you're a developer yeah like and
when I say that it's like okay people at
OU soon as you make a webpage you're a
developer chances you do this net and
I'm like no no you're not because you
still don't even have the skills that it
takes to become like a full developer
like I don't know maybe later on you
guys want to say it because I say this
like a lot of times I've noticed that
people just want the easy easy road to
this thing and then oh let's start like
hey man you got to go out your way and
basically start making projects like you
have to build projects I'm going to
continue the people using every video
you got to create projects stop just
doing the tutorials and say hey I know
how to build a saml page and then you
don't build nothing for like two weeks
everything that you learned for a video
for a course on udemy is gone or like
two weeks because you haven't practiced
it it's displaced not like oh yeah like
once you learn it and it's like riding a
bike no it's like riding a bike
your brain doesn't work like that
this is something that it can get
complicated because you have to practice
it if you leave it alone you gotta come
back and gonna be rusty you know I know
you can't just keep leaving you know
learning web development so hey I'm
learning in two days and then you know I
won't touch it till next week it doesn't
work like that you have to take them
serious
alright guys and you know like I want to
say this man my videos right now the one
that should be popular raina should be
the tutorial in which tutorials I will
say um the learn HTML CSS by building
Netflix the other world which is
learning HTML CSS by building Instagram
I dull should be the most popular ones
because you guys should not only come
here just because I come here and talk
to you guys you guys should come here to
try to learn something and learn take
the knowledge that I give you
and then a fighter if you know if you
don't want to take the the tutorial I'll
make cool take one of the courses that I
put in the description because those
courses work like you don't have to like
me you might say man I like the guy but
I can't learn from him
and that's fine you don't have to learn
from me but I can guarantee you the
courses that are on my description they
got to teach you how to become a web
developer but at the same time I don't
want to say hey guys this is guarantee
because the only way this thing's going
to be guaranteed that you're going to
become a developer is if you want to be
a developer now because I tell you hey
take this course or hey take this this
 bull camp or hey go to this
Community College or hey go here
whatever the I give you it doesn't
work like that it's all up to you only
you could do it nobody's going to be
able to hold your hand and make your
developer there is something that you
have to like to do you have to be able
to be a problem solver because you gotta
understand this most of the job and most
of the number let's say like this cut it
down bring it back get my thoughts
together the number one thing that you
gotta learn to become a web developer is
to become a problem solver
right and be able to look online
meaning Google Stack Overflow Cora um
the documentation of whatever you're
working on could be a language could be
a framework it could be a library make
sure to understand how to look to things
in the documentation right all this
stuff takes time and takes work this is
not something that's going to be easy
for people to understand in a month in
two months and three months there's
people that are lucky that just you know
I've got people would they hand me up
and they're like oh man I watch this
video
Krishan like oh he got in in three
months but man that was the
determination
it wasn't the timeframe of him becoming
a developer entering
it wasn't like hey this time it only
takes three months to become a developer
no it doesn't work like that what took
him that you know that small amount of
time was the determination he went hard
he won like super hard if you haven't
looked at his story look it up go to his
channel the kid went hard he didn't just
be like hey I'm gonna become a developer
in three months it doesn't work like
that you have to put it put everything
into it and be like yo I'm just gonna
 do this man and delicious
3-4 hours if you gotta wake up early in
the morning wake up early in the morning
five five o'clock in the morning to two
hours and then when you get home by six
seven o'clock
to another hour that's just how you
gotta do it man it's like going to the
gym man it's like I think I was like
learning how to become a web developer
like going to the gym you can't expect
to go get a 6-pack and by basically
working out one hour of the week it's
not gonna work you know what I
mean like you have to do that
almost every day you know at
least for a set amount of time so your
body could get used to it and it's the
same thing has to be the brain you have
to go hard for the next you know three
months three to six months you have to
go your heart this is not like oh
I'm doing it part-time know this you
gotta go hard if not gonna take
your year two years to learn this I
keep getting emails from people that
like oh I've been doing this for a year
and I don't know if I'm ready
you know wait and those people are not
ready and I'm sorry guys that you know
you guys tell me messages is because you
guys haven't been able to go hard are
the things that's in your life either
stopping you know family friends you
know having a full-time job and all
those things are stopping you guys from
basically going super hard and saying
hey I'm going to take this three
months of learning web development three
to eight hours a day if you
could do that freakin do it man if you
can't do it do at least two hours a day
man and the weekend you got a
 go hard and like I'm sorry and
cursing but on the weekends you have to
 go hard like stop
hanging out with your friends start
chilling with your girlfriend tell your
girlfriend listen listen baby I have to
do this because if I want to change my
life I have to be able to become
a developer in the next few months
if she can't understand that that's not
a woman for you or that's not the man
for you you know what I mean like you
have to or even a friend if your friends
can understand
cut them off man those are now friends
that you need because they probably not
doing with their lives most people
that are busy and making money
and being successful
they're busy every second like
right now I'm just getting a little
taste I feel like I'm getting a little
little taste of being successful I have
a beautiful wife
so fiance we had not married yet but
beautiful wife
oh oh fiance beautiful care on
the way I got a beautiful life my mom's
here I got a nice crib I got money
coming in I'm not worried about paying
no bills cuz everything is already there
all the money that I need for the next
six months is there like I don't even
have to think about right I don't have
to think about car I don't have to think
about nothing everything is already
there I have the money there to pay for
this next fix alone well everything is
going to go with YouTube and everything
is going to go with like you know my
website like all this good stuff is
coming now and you know what was
happening I don't have time to do
anything like I have my friend setting
me up or or Instagram and messaging is
that hey man let's hang out let's hang
out oh and I'm like man I don't
even know when am I gonna have time to
hang out because I'm so busy like you
know what I mean like I'm constantly
coding I'm constantly learning new
things I'm constantly making videos
right here I'm constantly thinking of
new ideas of what I'm building on my
website like in mail on top of that I
a full-time job which I got to think
like tomorrow I got to think about all
them things that I got a built for that
website that company that I work for so
I don't have time for anything so you
guys shouldn't have time for anything
either
meaning if you want to become this just
go hard man and trust me after that you
could just chill and actually you
already have a joking you're already
working on a company just do the work
from your company if you want to because
at the same time you could get burnt out
so if you do too much but in the
beginning man you just have to take it
it's like going to you know
going to the army or something like you
have to go through a a certain type of
test to become you know that freaking
army officer or whatever or that marine
like you just have to go hard guys all
right man stop thinking that you gotta
find here on the internet the easy route
but you know here's the a quick easy way
to become a developer in two months in
one month and three months or four
months it doesn't work like that
everybody's different it depends how
much time you put into this you know
what I mean so just go hard start and
stop looking for the easy answer because
it's not there or you're going to find
especially from this channel there's no
easy answers to this it's just pretty
much if you want to become developer
courses that I guarantee are good or the
worst be no now do you want to come here
and listen to me talk that's fine and
that's cool cuz that's helping me I'm I
get a little cut from YouTube you know
that little wasn't like $200 a
month for people coming here I'm gonna
get that regardless because people's
gonna come here and watch my videos but
if you come here and you spend time
watching me leave out of here with
something don't just come here you're
don't come and give me your time give me
your time and take my knowledge all
right
