two weeks it's going to be live you know
I think that's where we're gonna be
started starting to do it for now you
know what I mean like I'm going to be
releasing videos on my website first and
then they're gonna be like a week two
weeks late on YouTube right for the
people that want to watch it they're
like yo I want to watch as soon as
possible I'm gonna go to the website and
like I said all my videos are free the
only reason why I want people to come to
my website is because then I can
literally come back and tell you guys
when I drop a video right like I drop a
video YouTube doesn't give the
notifications to everybody alright
people find out because they come to my
channel right so they come back to my
channel and that's the only way that
they found out but that's you know
that's like one of those problems where
I'll be like man if that you know what I
mean
so it's crazy man I'm trying to see you
trying to find this page where did I put
this page I said this one new tab yeah
so I just wanted to show you guys you
know coding fees calm pretty much you
come here man click mentorship show you
know coming here got season 1 season 2
is currently doing that's plane you come
in you can watch season 2 or episode 1
if you haven't watched it you can watch
the late latest one that's gonna drop in
15 minutes man 15 minutes man and the
best part is that for those of you guys
that actually don't watch it you guys
get to vote for who gets to stay and who
gets to leave for next week alright so
that's why I will say hey go check it
out because by the time you watch it on
you
two is gonna be too late you you know
your vote is not really gonna matter
because the votes are already have they
are gonna be counted already all right
so throughout this whole week there's
going to be a bunch of how you call this
a bunch of different a lot there's gonna
be a bunch of votes being counted and
that by Friday it should be good you
know what I mean we'll find out who
exactly cool staying in it who's not you
know I mean yes sir yes sir yes sir we
in here kids make sure you give this
video like man this is just to remind
you guys man there's like a countdown
this is for me to come hang out with you
guys right cuz I know a lot of people's
like man we like to see this live
alright and because of the chatroom and
have everybody watching at the same time
but at the same time is like you know
what I mean like it's better to watch it
on the website
you know you come back you leave a
comment that's another thing to say
people forget that you can leave a
comment on under video so why are you
watching it live leave a comment
everybody else is gonna be able to see
your comment the same way how the live
chat works here so for real man yeah
it's gonna be the link is on the website
the link is on on on the website right
it's right under the video right under
it and that's that's also good because
it keeps away from the trolls right
there's people that's not gonna watch
the whole video there's people that's
not gonna watch the whole the whole
episode and they're gonna vote for like
you know for whoever they like get out I
like this guy vote for him and it's like
that's not how how it works you know
what I mean so we don't want people to
cheat we don't want people to come in
and start voting people off for the hell
of it we want people to vote for whoever
they think should be cut next week you
know somebody that you guys feel like
didn't put in all the work somebody that
we feel like we didn't like his style
winning like what he did with you know
whatever it is whoever you think had the
most mistakes it's up to you man however
you want to judge it it's on you you
know what I mean
see like even even under you know
there's people who I've never seen on
the chat and it's like automatically bro
you just got blocked because it's like
we don't know you and you're leaving
crazy comments that pretty much is it's
gonna get you blocked you know what I
mean like you come and be in here and
being an a-hole this is like the problem
which what I was saying the other day is
like we come in here and it's like the
bigger the channel grows like the more
random people that come in here and they
think like they say dumb things which
they think they're funny and it's like
you know what now you're blocked now you
could never say anything in here period
you know I mean I didn't I never used to
do this but now we're doing it you know
blocked goodbye you know what I mean so
that's what we're doing red you know you
want to be a douche bag have a good day
[Laughter]
you know what I really like I'm dying to
move it anymore man you know what I'm
saying like I'm out here trying to do
something positive and people's like
trying to get me in a bad mood like ya
know how I get like I don't want to spaz
out I'm having a good day today so now
you just get blocked good old days man
the you know the good days where it was
just like a crew of people that will
come in here and just be you know
positive vibes seems like those days are
gone kids you know you know I mean so

up the projects they've built when's
that coming up now it's definitely in
there man
is definitely in there man for sure and
just go to the website you should be
able to register it's free registering
is not gonna cost you anything at all
plus we in here man
nine more minutes man coding face.com
guys go check that out man yeah I think
I think you know it's like now I just
not in the mood you know it's like when
it comes to like people that's like if
you're not here this is the truth this
this house gonna be from now on if
you're not here to give positive
feedback and give you know constructive
criticism if you're just here to
literally just be like all again so
whatever I say if you're just here to
just pretty much curse on the on the
chatroom pretty much just coming here
for nothing besides like learning if
you're not really in the community if
you're not trying to learn what
development this is not the place for
you you know what I mean the people
coming here and they're like oh they
want to be talking about other stuff and
it's like man your block like goodbye go
to another channel because this channel
is about education right it's for the
people that want to learn and people who
want to challenge themselves
alright if you're a developer somebody
who's trying to learn something new if
you're somebody who is you know working
a different career and you're like you
know what I want to start working with
you know programming and learning how to
code then this is your channel you know
if you're if you're here to just pretty
much like talk BS
those days is over those good days where
Jovi died okay cool just you know
putting the other cheek those days is
over your ass is getting blocked that's
it I just don't need it
you know what I mean because it's like
I'm working too damn hard that's how I
look at it I'm like I'm working too damn
hard to be constantly looking at dumb
people out here you know so that's how
it is but yeah man
we got seven more minutes guys seven
more minutes
yeah and I'm not saying I'm not saying
that people should be like just here for
learning what I'm saying is if people
come in here for disrupting what I'm
doing or I just to just mess around and
really ruin it for other people's then
I'm just blocking them you know what I
mean we we just blocking people you know
it's 20 18 kids that's a the channels
growing you know the most that you're
gonna be able to do now from now on if
like if you're just constantly doing
dumb things over here on the channel is
give this a dislike you know we whenever
you want to talk bs we won't even hear
you because you're gonna be blocked it's
gonna be like a crazy war like that's a
automatically blocked word as when you
button my new favorite button blocked
we're bad
no I was saying that people shouldn't be
banned for like what I was saying was
like people shouldn't be banned for
stuff like between other you know like
if another youtuber not even another
youtuber another like the same example
Matt is fighting with a met right like
what the hell does that have to do with
me you know it's like I'll give him a
one ability oh come on guys chill young
this right disrupting the whole the
whole chat room then gear if it's
completely disrupting the chat room here
is like banned you know what I mean or
if you're like completely trolling the
channels like you know what have a good
one kid you know what I mean just banned
I'm not really in the mood no more so
that's how we're doing it now cuz it's
like I want to read the comments I want
to be able to be in contact with you
guys I want to be able to keep this
relationship with you guys the way how
I've been having it this whole time you
know what I mean like I don't want to
switch up I don't want to be one of
these youtubers was like I don't talk to
nobody
I don't answer questions I don't come in
the chatroom I don't do live videos I
don't want to be one of those people
right but what sucks about it is that
the bigger the channel gets the broader
audience and gets right so there's like
people who maybe they're like one video
of mine's right they subscribe and then
they're like you know what I like this
channel and I just want to mess around
every time that this guy goes live I
have nothing to do
let me just mess up the chatroom or
let's talk about something that has
nothing to do with code or this this and
that and it's like after that you're
like wait what why are you here it's
like oh I like going video of yours
seven months ago it's like if you don't
really follow the channel you shouldn't
even be here you know what I mean so
it's like blocked get him out of here
well yeah man we ain't here kids man 28
Sene then tonight three minutes man it's
the countdown man it's the countdown
right now coding face.com you know what
I would do if I was you guys right now I
will have another window open let's have
another tab open and pretty much go sign
up for the website mentorship show you
click on mentorship show and you should
be good you should be able to watch the
video I have it that ain't two minutes
is going to go live right two minutes is
going to go live and it's going to tell
you hey start watching the episode man
and like I said the main reason why
we're doing this is because we want to
be able to every time that we release a
new video or a new content we want to be
able to be able to contact you right so
if you register you get the notification
when you visit the website don't say hey
new video released or whatever right so
that's what we're trying to do man
because it's like it sucks when we
release a video here on YouTube and
nobody gets the notification or nobody
knows like people that that watch each
video is because they go to the channel
a lot of people don't even get the
notifications at all so you know now I'm
taking it to my own hands to really
support the channel and help people out
