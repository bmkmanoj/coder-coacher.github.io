how is this same hi on the screen right
especially where we just have it here in
JavaScript how is it automatically
showing up here alright that's the first
question that should be your first
question so let me break it down to you
guys
automatically since we set up the web
pack and you know we set up everything
here I have you know automatic reload
every time that we save setup for you
so you should be fine you'll have to
reset every time you do a change
everything should be there we also have
you know some settings that we put here
on the plugins so what this does is
basically takes our JSX
which is like HTML and JavaScript
because we did that here it compiles it
to this file here JavaScript components
hyper and then this is how it looks
right so remember over here and view
that was a function so what is returning
back is a way to hyper app you know
create this element on the screen so
it's looking like this saying okay hyper
run this h1 you know create an h1 tag no
attributes and it has inside of it state
that message okay so that's just regular
vanilla JavaScript if you guys want to
look into this
alright now the other question is how is
this showing up on a page especially we
haven't chosen element so we who
actually mess around with like we
haven't chosen an element to say hey
hyper add add this message hi to this
element we haven't done that but hyper
at behind the scenes does this
automatically on the body tag if we come
here you will see died added it by
itself so it basically appended
to the body tag if that makes sense okay
so that's one of the things that I
wanted to show you guys now if we come
here and we look at this and we pay
attention to what's inside of this
function we have an object right so we
have app which is what we import it and
then we have a function so then inside
of it the argument is an object and this
object it has multiple options right
most of multiple properties so basically
you have state you have view now if we
wanted to do something else like we have
here on the API which I will recommend
everybody to check it out you know all
the things that you can do with it all
right
you have room right now route we can
come here and actually decide to put it
in a certain element instead of us going
automatically replacing everything in
and adding it to the body tag here
because that's what it's doing adding it
to the body tag instead of doing that
let's say we want it inside of IDF ok so
what we're going to do here is we want
to say something like this you're gonna
come here straight route just like the
example here right and then here we're
going to put in the element
so just regular JavaScript we've come in
say document dot get element by ID and
then you come here say app now let's see
that run everything is fine and it's
showing up on the screen and we come
here and say something like this hi Joe
I'll change refresh the page as you can
see here every time we save something it
compiles the JavaScript and then shows
are here all right
and that my friends is how you basically
display an app or a component onto the
page all right so I'll see you guys in
the next video
boy Joe back at it again I didn't did it
again man I came up with his new course
hyper fjs course guys if you want the
full course you don't want to wait for
the videos on YouTube make sure you go
to the website you know coding face.com
is going to bring you here to the store
there's going to be a whole bunch of
courses of course you can just sign up
for the ghetto access pass and yeah
whenever you use the description below
and you use the link to layer guys
