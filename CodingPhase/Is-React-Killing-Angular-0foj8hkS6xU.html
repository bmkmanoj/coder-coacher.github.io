at a game man
total face calm listen I'm out here once
again answering a question from horror
so I found this pretty cool question
which was is react killing angular what
the white beat right um I think react is
something that was amazing in component
you know pretty much introducing a lot
of people to cs6 because well it wasn't
because of react even myself I probably
were you and be interesting and ESX or
anything
types there or anything like that right
so when it comes to angular angular was
one of the first ones to come out first
frameworks and get a lot of good things
but at the same time it was like one of
the first so what does that mean I mean
that we're gonna see all the mistakes
that they made and then the things that
we hate about it you're gonna fix it
again but at the same time we can't
leave how angular because angular it's
pretty much too deep into the industry
right like if you go online and you
search the same go to movie calm alright
let's say research
nowhere in the search engine this like
most likely late so many jobs 10,000
jobs 8,000 that so you know just to be
an angular developer is a very process
hey come on there's so much legacy code
what everybody saw jumping in on the
corner framework single page app
everybody jump awesome angry so now
react which is actually fix a little
things to egg Euler has all the mistakes
that they made they basically trying to
do a catch catch up online and also to
check really similar text we could look
alive see how many website actually I'm
running anger which is already give me
one second
now as if Athena's 500,000 websites
there are actions and anger and then
91,000 are actually yeah
now numbers door lock so as you can see
there's a lot of people using that you
know a lot of people tools also using
the react but you can't even compare
this you know one to five pieces so
here's I think it is a big difference
well it's a killing angular I don't know
I don't think they're both gonna coexist
in the industry they're both gonna be
there you know next and next I work
great I think in the next three four
years you're going to start seeing
angular go down as far as new websites
and then we have coming up so then it's
gotta meet up right in between random it
right but there's gotta be companies
that it's gotta be hard for people to
just let go of angular because they've
been doing it for three four years
it's like myself right now I've been
working on react for two years already
right it's going to be very hard for me
to just say hey I'm gonna leave react
I'm gonna leave everything that I
already invested on and just jump on to
something like Vijay s or riot Jas or
what's the other one home I saw
something called Maddox or MLK something
like that so weird javascript framework
that supposedly is popping up now right
or even polymer to which Google's trying
to promote
I don't know MIT I think angular is
going to be king that's why I think no
matter what that little crown is going
to be there for know what guys like we
like it or not but the same time
developers who are more experienced in
this field most likely will choose react
over angular whenever they're working on
a new project now
they work on legacy code they just have
to you know coding that legacy code of
angular one because most of the sites
even do you see angularjs here they're
not talking about angular two not that
many people have picked up angular 2 at
all right so everybody's working on
angular 1 still even in 2017 all right
so that's my opinion on this question
yeah man make sure you subscribe make
sure you check out my website coding
phase comm is coming down pretty soon as
you can see I'm still working on it but
this website is going to be so legit is
going to be a great community for brand
new developers it you know people who
have new questions right make sure you
subscribe to my channel youtube.com
slash coding face alright you're the
road goodbye Joe back at it again
Wow GG you already knows you put Joe
back at it again man listen make sure
you subscribe and make sure you like
this video man by the way if you want to
know exactly what courses I took to
become a web developer they right there
in the description it's no secret it's
nothing crazy is no secret gift that I
had it's just pretty much I took the
courses they're pretty cheap they're
like 15 dollars each on specials and
just recommend change your life change
the lifestyle do something fun is
something cool that you could call a
career Wow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
