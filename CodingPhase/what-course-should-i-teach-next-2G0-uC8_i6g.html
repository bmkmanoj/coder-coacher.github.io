at it again man coding phase calm your
boys backing out and did it again
hey guys question man I gotta ask you
guys huh I don't want to waste your time
I don't want to waste my time right so
I'm here to ask you guys
which course do you guys want next all
right you know I know a lot of people
you got told me last time hey we wanna
go y'all know Jes cause I created the
node.js course it doesn't seem like a
lot of people want to get the nodejs
course or that they were up to that
level to learn nodejs right a lot of
people are starting from the beginning
so I wanted to just give you guys the
option to decide of which one you guys
want right which course you guys
actually want to see so we definitely
gonna give you that right whatever you
guys want I give it to you right so in
the description below I have a forum
when you click on that link it takes you
to a Google forum where you could pretty
much vote for which course you want to
see next right I have the options are
Python C sharp object oriented
JavaScript Ruby Java Scala goal a
crystal Ling angular 4 or 5 right Elm my
sequel MongoDB or game development with
html5 it's up to you guys you guys
decide which course you guys want to see
it's in the description below click on
the link go home let me know what you
guys want to see and yeah we're here man
we're here just help to help you guys
out and take you guys to the next level
let me see who's online right now okay
you guys see me Raina
can you guys hear me right now
what is it that you awfully which one
you want man let me know chit chit chit
chit let me know Philippe
integrating
know every act that's pretty much is
it's all the way that one it's probably
gonna be part of the react course it's
just I'm not doing it right now at this
moment to touch it touch it yeah let me
know what you guys want to see man let's
open up the farm right now let's open up
the phone let's see what what the people
are voting for let's see what the people
are actually voting for right now we
bout to go live in two seconds give you
guys the life count see what people are
actually voting for
let me see share the screen alright so
far right now that's what we got we've
got three people four rwby we got one
person for python one person for MongoDB
one person for my sequel one person for
angular four and five other ones in here
man seems like a lot of people want to
get Ruby I mean I'll do if you guys know
if Ruby's literally my favorite language
if people really wanted to see Ruby I
would do movie like I'm super
knowledgeable ever only two so I could
definitely help you guys out it's up to
you guys you guys decide which one you
guys want to see object-oriented
programming with JavaScript MongoDB my
sequel and gonna four or five angular
for 5l my sequel going to be game
development with html5
crystal lang Ruby Java Scala which one
guys go ahead vote man listen if you're
here there's 27 people I want all 27
people to vote for this man because it's
really about you guys it's not really
about me man like all of this stuff
already know it right so the idea is you
know we want to create something that
the people want to see and the people
want to learn you know I don't want to
create stuff that nobody's gonna see you
nobody's gonna use or to them it's not
useful all right so I want to create
something that you guys gonna like all
right there are a lot of people hitting
that c-sharp
seems like c-sharp is growing oh no
that's angular my fault
so angular seems to be coming up it's
almost a tie between angular Ruby
object-oriented JavaScript Python 2 for
Python 3 for Python their MongoDB and
guys try to uh you know only vote once
don't know music don't be like yo vote
30,000 times you know I mean where is it
let me check the settings on this limit
to low response you got 27 volts 28
volts seems is between Python Ruby
object-oriented JavaScript interesting
alright so as we seen between Ruby
object go into JavaScript and Python
seems like Python is at the lead right
now seems like everybody will really
like to have some Python course
listen to be honest with you the ones
that I really really want to do is
between Ruby Python and I wouldn't mind
doing a I sequel MongoDB course right
but it seems like it's between Ruby and
Python seems like Python is waiting
right now kids I was like the the you
know my commercial seems like Python is
where is that everybody want to get on
Python yeah we could definitely do
Python man do you know do the latest
Python it teach you guys sort of good
stuff it's up to you guys you guys
decide the community decides what people
should learn you know Python there's a
summary right now kids let me know let
your boy know which one you would like
to see man it's right there in the
description below
currently the winner is Python Miletus
there's our farm be there I'm gonna let
it run I'm gonna keep reminding people
throughout the day so go vote I'm gonna
let it just run see how many volts it
gets which one is gonna be the winner
and then from there what I'm gonna I'm
going to do is I'm going to actually let
me see does this thing keep let me see
this thing keeps the the emails damn I
should have set it up to keep the emails
out of people then I would just give in
somebody one of those random users the
course for free once it's done let me
see where's the settings let's see let's
see let's see let's see let's see what
I'm gonna do is I'm looking about the
course for free for matter of fact three
people three people that vote I'm giving
them for free once it's done I'm gonna
give you the code you know whoever wins
today which of course wins you know
whichever topic once today Python C
sharp object oriented programming Ruby
Java Scala : crystalline angular for Elm
my sequel MongoDB game development with
html5 whichever one wins oh you know
what I wanted to add them almost forgot
see if anybody wanted to get like a I
react native course I was wondering
there Oh
to put PHP my phone oh I forgot to add
this this is the thing I forgot to add
to two topics that I wanted to give to
people man which was PHP and react
native excite we're gonna have to start
done we're gonna have to start it all
over should I start it all over so I
start the votes all over man
so I react natives will react with oh
the Redux is going to be added to the
react course guys so don't worry about
that
the Redux is coming in next week for the
react course that's already been
recorded I just haven't been able to
edit it if you already bought or you
signed up to this description and you
saw the react course the whole the whole
real estate app that we built that was
one project off like many of them like
I'm still adding a whole bunch of
projects to the react course we still
adding Redux I'm still adding the same
thing definitely but once which is
adding react with nodejs like all that
stuff is being added to it
now I don't hate on PHP I've been
telling people to learn PHP and
WordPress that's like one of the first
things that I learned like literally
like I'm like a wordpress master I just
it's not it's not fun for me you know I
mean it's not like exciting like right
now if I was to create a Python course
I'll be excited because oh you know
Python is the type of language that I
like like I like Ruby I like Python I
like crystal a there's a certain type of
syntax that I like for me right in this
foreign is clean something nice to look
at we're presently I'll be like okay
co-op make it but it's not I don't be
like super excited because I'm all this
makeup WordPress no I'll be like
whatever I wanna be the very best
WordPress listen I'm gonna do it again
I'm gonna I'm gonna edit this let me see
we're going to add PHP and react

we just gotta give him a coat there's
gonna be giving you free the course for
free on my website and for free on udemy
so you have access to both places
yes this definitely riemann says I'm
looking for startup where you can only
code and react that's all I want to do
yes there's places like that like you
know what I mean
yeah let me know yeah let me know man
how do we do that how to add an email

go ahead go ahead go ho go vote you need
go vote man go vote it's right there in
the description then it's right there in
the description kids there's a forum you

far I don't know what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna send the email out to every
member of my website which should be
another couple of thousand people right
and then from there I'm gonna send our
email to everybody that's on on udemy or
all 7,000 students over there and let's
see which one wins let's see okay kids
I'm excited I'm excited I wanna see
which one people really want to see

let the people win
we got 50 more responses already here on
YouTube hey let's see what's gonna
happen when we start sending this out
all you were to me let's see how many of
the people from you to me what courses
they want to see let's see let's see
people who wins which course made out
personally I rather do you to me neither
Python Ruby or on my sequel MongoDB
course that's my preference that's what
I will rather do right now next but it's
not absolutely it's not what I wanna do
is what the people want to do listen
guys I work for you guys man I'm your
personal I'm your personal or instructor
when it comes to this is okay I want

email sent everybody gets an email
k9 goes guy
let's see man let's see how the results
start going out man I want to see what I
see which one wins I mean it seems like
Python is where he's at kicks
seems like Python is the big winner
right now my longshot it's like 35 40 %
see let me see what the people want man
I'm here to please
oh yeah missiles good would you guys
want you guys doing today man
Oh
Stephanie Stephanie wants that PHP man
cam-cam Perry's working on a project for
the mentorship man poaches like PHP PHP
PHP
let me know guys come on let me know
Oh
so a lot of votes coming in now okay
okay that's why I like to see oh shoot
things are changing oh sure
I'm under this room man I want to see
what's gonna happen this is gonna be
very interesting there's like a I'll
pull between about 10,000 people right
10,000 people to see which one is gonna
be the winner
you're not like about 2,000 on my
website 7,000 on on you to me we have
another 10,000 here but I know the
notification gang is very small not
everybody here gets the notifications
right so when we drop a video we get
about 10 to 20 percent off that 10,000
so I believe we're looking like at
10,000 people that could actually reach
this video or this this form right now
it's only gonna reach to like about
10,000 people even though we got 10,000
people on YouTube I know that everybody
gets to see this videos man take your
time man it's right there in the
description below what course should I
create next there's a forum you click
that you put in your email you basically
you are you come in you freaking you
vote and then from there I say
bangers are yo hyper at I mean if you
take the the restaurant of course that
has a hyper app in it and it shows you
more of the power that you can do with
hi Brad like there's so much luckily you
know I mean like we created I'm gonna
give you guys a preview of the hyper app
like what level it's at right now so let
me see where is it
let's see I perhaps it's localhost
readouts and that's where I got it right
now
so this is the page
alright but also you guys that haven't
taken this course you guys should be
taken it's like there's so many
different topics that I go into you know
breaking down the page from HTML CSS you
know there from there how to loop with
JavaScript to come in and use the data
to loop in and create elements on the
page you know to creating a random quote
generator coming here creating a slider
as you can see here you click next you
know creating the slider we got all of
this data all of this stuff here is
dynamically coming from the data and
like it's a lot of stuff man and then
the next thing that I'm doing to this
well today it's gonna be creating a
reservation so when people click
reservations is going to come up with a
modal that motors gonna have you know
information I'm like hey how many people
is coming in what's the the one like
freaking a table next to the window
whatever it is right we keep it a nice
and simple but we keeping it legit like
a real restaurant right
so we adding all those things you know
click
we're gonna create the fuel the full
menu being able to see a full menu pop
up for a user like it's a lot of stuff
man you know yeah man
and they're from there for those of you
guys that don't know how to do it we're
gonna make this like let's say when you
click on our story is going to scroll
down to this section and then if you
click on reveal Luz is going to scroll
down by Austin the reviews like etc
right so yeah there's a lot of stuff in
here and this course alone teaches you a
lot of things you know it's not just
like oh let's just build up to do that
like that's kind of boring
if we're building real life experiences
in here like these aren't things that
people's gonna actually to do in a real
job so you know it's definitely a pretty
cool thing and everything that you learn
from hyper app you literally come take
that knowledge and take it to react so
when I talk about hyper habit I talk
about or you know react like in reality
this this all connected to each other
because they're both using JSX
so whatever you get to use here is the
same thing that you get to use and react
knowing hyper app is pretty much like
known react okay only difference is that
hybrid doesn't have life cycles for
every single component like react that's
the only difference
all right oh yeah man missing Google
Hangouts open this up man let's see
let's see what we up to on this form
seems like the winners Python kids
second place is object-oriented
JavaScript and then third places is even
between angular 4 5 Ruby and PHP
all right stop Batman
ringing through the comments written
through the comments let me see how long
YouTube so it seems like the current
winner is Python I really don't know
what white people not fight on someone's
when you know blah blah Thank You Man
thank you for being here man he says
Lama says thank you Joe for even doing
all of this listen thank you guys for
just listening to me
just coming hang out with me it and
being interested in this stuff man like
you know I'm really happy that you guys
are all really getting into all of this
stuff like what to find a man and
program it cuz it's cool man like trust
him right now a lot of you guys are like
on a beginning stages but this thing is
like it's like legit man like this
thing's gonna hold your life and be like
okay once you're a developer what's your
program it's like it's something that
you're gonna be that for the rest of
your life man you know what I mean it's
like a it really takes ahold of you like
it's one of the best things for me is
one of the best things that I ever did
you know Barbara says hey
like there's already 10 million Python
is out there well there is but one thing
that people don't understand too is that
a lot of times you might take a course
you might buy a course from people that
teach them Python and then you're like
I'm still lost you know what I mean
people still feel nothing I've noticed
that Python is really really popular
with people people who want to learn how
to program people who are going to
college people who are because in
college they teach a Python right that's
the new language that everybody's like
jumping on top of right so a lot of
people my books on class a computer
science class and be like oh man this
professor is teaching in a way that's so
boring I'm falling asleep in the class
like you lose interest right and it's
the same thing people bring that type of
style of teaching Python to online
courses and people lose interest people
be like oh I don't want to see this so
that's why there's so many different
courses for Python because one is
popular - a lot of people don't know how
to do it and keep people engaged and
that's why there's a lot of courses for
it you know what I mean but even it's
gonna be even if it's like a lotta a lot
of courses on it
people still like they wanna check it
out you know what I mean
Barbara's like I refuse to move out of
London
no matter just reading people's comments
seems like a lot of people like to have
PHP I guess there's a discussion of
chatroom about Java you know
yeah man seems like the winner is Python
man well let's see we gotta give it 24
hours so let's see let everybody get to
know you know it seems like
object-oriented programming with
JavaScript it's coming up now the top
three are Python Python number one
object-oriented JavaScript number two
and number three is angular four five
votes are coming in kids they are coming
in
yeah man PHP man PHP is it's one of
those languages man that I think
everybody should know some point man for
sure man look it seems like PA is funny
PHP is coming up seems like the more
people are coming from you to me more
people are actually voting for PHP the
votes are coming in kids
seems like PHP might take second place
pretty soon votes are coming in they are
coming in there yeah man let's see man I
wouldn't mind doing a PHP PHP ever do
that chorus pretty easy so you know it
is good because then I won't hear people
complaining like oh my god Peter like
you know installing things on oh you
make it seem so easy or Mac and I'm
installing on Windows I gotta go through
this this whole process and I'm gonna be
like yeah you know when PHP PHP works
the same way as it does Mac and Windows
so there's really no big process it's
like you download man and I say you're
good so let's see how that goes man
let's see if PHP wins that would be
pretty easy I don't know man seems like
Python got a big lead man about to share
the screen that's what we got so far all
right so that's what we got we got
Python too
in 2% object-oriented programming with
JavaScript and we got a number to 13
percent 11 percent angular 4 or 5 PHP 8
% o rupees got 10 people still mess with
Ruby man you gotta be careful out there
will be still good and people be acting
like you know there's no jobs for Ruby
this job movie you know some don't be
sleeping on Ruby man it's just the
problem of Ruby is that you gotta be
really good you can't just be a bum it's
the same thing as let's Python you can't
just show up me but I hey man I know how
to create a small app on on Python it's
like learner's you gotta be really good
you know what I mean so let's say Ruby
and let's say we're gonna check New York
let's check 50 mile radius so look the
minimum minimum for a ruby developer is
$75,000 which is really good cuz this
you know you start looking at PHP PHP
starts at 50 45 you know there's people
that are trying to scheme is try to pay
you the least amount of money for PHP
that you see Ruby is at 75 let's see
I've got 85 now let me see Python
there's one thing that people don't
forget to use like you gotta focus on
the title because sometimes people add
things so I call this two different
areas like they'll add it to like the
description they'll put Python ojs and a
whole bunch of stuff but in reality it's
really not that much jobs for it so in
reality for Python developer and a
fifty-mile
radius of New York is let's say the
cheapest one is at 85 85 k let's see how
long
Ruby C Python a wall groovy got only 67
but look every single one is like over
$100,000 man that's the thing man if you
get a Ruby job you good man look junior
Ruby on Rails developer man let me see
what they asking for be part of her
agile team have a big world developing
new features see Ruby on Rails develop
my skills JavaScript skills server-side
database integration experience with web
services competitive salary and equity
so seems pretty legit then I hate your
resume is a match yes I know I couldn't
take that job if I want to nah I'm good
you keep the job you keep that job man
let's see man you know I was like
telling like I was telling wife and
today I was like man I might just like
literally I might want to just get into
contracts like do contract work three
months of the year right if I get if I
work for three months of the year that's
all I really need you know what I mean
and then the rest of the yeah I don't
have to do anything so I was thinking
about that because this this recruiter
was hitting me up the yesterday morning
and was telling me like a man we got a
couple of contracts for you you don't
have to work in the office you don't
have to come in it's just pretty much to
Skype in this dis and that it it was
like you just work five months out of
the year and you're good and I was like
thinking about us I mean no
interesting you know and devil pay me I
believe is $70 an hour so I was I
thinking about I was like hmm maybe I
should do that you know that worked for
five months and then the rest of the
years like chill you know what I mean I
don't know what you guys think what'd
you guys think like in a few months from
now should I do that should I do like a
contract work for like four for three to
five months what do you guys think you
know that's like the only thing that I
miss about working in a company it's
just I come in with new topics every day
you know what I mean like when I used to
come in pissed off and be like y'all I
freaking hate this this and that like I
had a topic for you guys every single
day so and we had the web developers
lunch breaks every day we had a new
topic about something because it's like
I'm working with other people and I'm
working in the industry so I'll come
back and give you guys insight but I
don't know what you guys think in a few
months maybe like I don't know six seven
months from now maybe I'll work for like
five months what you guys think should I
do it like a little three-month contract
everybody trying to hit up while Barbara
Maine
that what Joe you are witnessing growth
of teen coding phase we global oh yeah
Barry in here in I got a global team and
we got the squad coding phase CPT that's
the cpt man is the cpt man coding face
team man yeah three-month contract you
know like one of this our recruiters was
hitting me up yesterday morning I was
like man and it sounds pretty cool man
I'm analyzed like let's say like good
let me look it up let me do the math let
me see it was let me see let me do the
math because I like to bring out the
calculator so let's say 70 times 40
times 4 times 3 yeah that's not bad
so pretty much they will pay me thirty
three thousand six hundred dollars for
three months right that's not bad right
you know for three months that's not bad
it'll be like a contract I don't have to
go into the office I don't have to do
anything all I have to do is just they
give me the project I finish it and then
I just get it done but that's the thing
is like I already make just from from
everything that I do like on my own side
thing I already make probably more than
that right per month I'll make more than
that then what they offer me well the
only reason why I will do it is just to
have extra topics with you guys you know
what I mean cuz I feel I still feel like
you can't really give advice you can't
really talk about
stuff in the industry if you're not in
the industry know what I mean like I
still I even hold myself to that you
know I was like if you if you don't
freaking I call it lucky if you're not
in the industry you're not part of the
community but you're not really working
on real projects it's like it's like can
you really give good advice you know
what I mean
so that's the only reason why I would do
like a three-month contract or a year or
something like that so let's see yet a
part of whatsapp is that then now you
have then now you have like people's
phone numbers like that's the right line
to their phone like that's a lot you
know yeah exactly
Bell says you know contracting means you
can usually ignore all the stupid office
politics and I'm like yeah it doesn't
think that's why I don't I don't want to
go back I don't want to go back to like
working in office unless it's like a
cool team like everybody's cool I don't
want to work with all people that's the
truth I'm being honest companies that
are being run by all people I don't want
to be around them because they just
don't know you know what I mean like you
know what I have job I was like man
these guys don't know anything like I
don't even know how they make money like
one of the worst things in this world is
which sucks I really think that it
really sucks that part people with money
get more money right that automatically
sucks in this world right so it's like
people who have money they open up
businesses and then they hire people
people who are talented right and they
have no talent they have no ideas they
have nothing right all they have is just
the money that they came in to set up a
business
but Dana may not like you know creating
new stuff they like their ideas is so
dumb and so outdated you're like wait
what like I don't want to work with
people like that
I want to work with like young people
maybe like if I wants to go back to one
okay I'll start up something where
people are cool like people that
motivate me it'll be like a team of
developers like I don't want to be like
the only developer in the company or you
know I'm the only senior developer in
there that doesn't help my growth that
doesn't help me at all you know what I
mean like I need to be around other
people that's on my level for me to feel
happy to go into work who wants to go to
work and feel like oh man the whole
company is on top of me
and you're like wait this is not my
company you know what I mean like I
don't need to be worrying about you know
for you know trying to fix other
people's bad decisions like I don't want
to let you know what I mean
plus you also gotta be careful with this
recruiters man you know this recruiters
man like they tell you something and
that's not what it is man you gotta do a
real research out here kids when you you
deal with like recruiters and they tell
you hey man you're gonna get hired to
this company it's a great company and
they have a great team and this this and
that
a lot of times they're BBS and man like
I'll be honest like I regret not going
to title like that's the truth like I
was like looking it up the other day I
was like looking at a couple of
developers from title and like looking
at the stuff that they were working on
it and like all the perks that they get
and I was like y'all the only reason I
chose this other company that I was
working on was because the recruiter
told me it's like hey it's super easy
work it's just HTML CSS you know a
little bit JavaScript you know help them
out transition from older platform to to
laravel and then when I get there it's
like literally the company is a mess and
like we get there and we're supposed to
somehow fix everything
wait what you've been running a shitty
business for like 13 years and nothing
is in order and then everything is
breaking and it's on us we have to fix
everything that you guys already broke
for years like like it was bad man like
a year from now I'm gonna make a video a
full video about the company I used to
work on like just to it you know not to
bash I'm not to talk bad about them just
the experience as a developer for me
like how we went you know I'm gonna talk
about how to recruit her pretty much
life you know when I got there they
really was like like the littlest stuff
man you know there's like so much
yeah but that's what I'm saying like
there's so many cool things that they
doing on tighter though like now looking
back at it I was like y'all just because
I was like oh I wanna know I don't want
to go to the city and you know I
supposed to be so recruiter told me
everything is gonna be you know there's
gonna be easy work and this this and
that and I'm like man I'll choose the
easier work right now I'm regretting
that I'm like you know I'm never working
for like small businesses and like again
in my life like it has to be a start-up
of young people or it has to be like a
legit company of a really big
corporation I'm not working for small
businesses I'm not working for you know
freaking people who are just coming up
with ideas in their bathrooms like I'm
not doing that you know what I mean like
those taking a fish in there in the
bathroom and coming up with ideas I'm
like I'm not working on that type of
comfortable you know what I mean no soup
I don't still holding it down man
where are you
you want instant loading well it seems
like the website for the title website
right has a lot of images a lot of
images in a lot of videos like there's
only so much seem like it takes a little
second to load everything okay also -
they have a lot of high quality images
man like me personally this hard no I
will fall right in into this team
because I have so many good ideas to
make this website faster and just make
things a little better but at the same
time it's like you can knock it because
they have videos they have a whole bunch
of JavaScript loading just like so much
loading let me see how much stuff is
loading here
the network go all refresh the single
cache which it was the biggest size I
mean look at this like this image along
is 1.5 gigabyte well sign 1.5 megabyte
like that's crazy they have not even
it's still loading oh my god is a 4
megabyte image of the yo Guardian I
still AM documentary you see like this
tells me that they smacking like this
how you know I will fall perfectly in
this scene like I will clean this whole
website I'll make this thing super fast
let me see what's good man let's see
what's going on in entitle what they
look in Florida I'm bout to hit up that
recruiter be like yo what up let me know
I'm available now let me make your
website fast real quick look web
developer obviously now it's Oslo
that's like Sweden I think they no
longer take one for here in the US all
slow is no yeah that's all the way no
way man
there goes that job Riley this is easy
man Charles Korea six backbone view rxjs
redux experience using ajax oh my god is
so easy like you know I look at this I'm
like yo there it's so easy
oh god we ever yeah now they
finally gotta do something with that
image that images is four megabytes like
you don't do that you don't go in and
load a four megabyte image on a page
that's ridiculous because I could just
imagine people and their phone trying to
load that you know how long that takes
now let's see oh Spotify I seen on
Spotify got their pain another thing is
a title isn't a good company but it's
still a baby compared to spot applying a
pin music let's see look this is pretty
fast
see that's okay Oh God Lena's definitely
need some help if I would have been now
to help them out okay so let's see
what's the biggest image that they got
53 kilobytes so that means they're using
a whole bunch I mean there's the fit the
biggest thing a script 68-69 see they
got a bunch of JavaScript
so probably all these images are SVG's
which makes the page load super fast and
this is a Java Script so this loads
asynchronously so now let's see Spotify
let's see what see what a Spotify happen
I doesn't think I'll tell people to
maybe will be like you know man I'm
gonna get into the tech industry I don't
know how to get into a mic go to these
companies figure it out find out which
was they they're looking for look like
you couldn't be doing business business
support which is a customer support
content you could literally come in and
just do like little stuff like look rice
clearance senior engineer management
data services senior editor music
program before Argentina like
let's see engineering item see what they
got
so engineer which I tell people they
keep calling people software engineers
and it's like really no front-end or
back-end no more it's really software
engineer that's it so let's say machine
learning see everybody's just bending in
here that's it
that's what it is now see the backing
engineer
see and there's the beauty of it
kids we strongly believe that diversity
experience perspectives and background
will lead to a better environment for
employees and better product for our
users and our creators which means if
you are a minority you're a woman you're
black you're Spanish you're Asian you're
whatever you get like a little extra
help like let's be honest you get a
little extra attention a little more
attention than what everybody else will
get because in reality a lot of
companies they want to bring in
diversity like you know this is usually
like one black guy in the whole team
right they'll be like a hundred people
and it's like one black guy right there
might be like two Spanish guys one guys
Mexican one guys for every kid that's
eight right they probably are like two
three girls and that's it now everybody
else is like white males and I mean
that's fine because that's where you
know they've gotten into this industry
before you know before everybody you
know babe
that's what school usually is more
interesting in this right but now I was
like if you are from other coaches and
other ethnicities is like you have a
chance out here to get into this major
companies is like just be talent they
have to write long portfolio right
projects and you're gonna be good
Felipe's like you I'm 30 now I'm not old
I don't know what companies you work
that for me I'm being honest I don't
know what companies do work that that
you're saying like everybody you work
that work with it's like diverse there's
not there's really no diversity right
now it's like when they say diversity
they punch everybody em together like
every minority and women they punch them
in together them but I oh yeah you know
we have twelve fifteen percent diversity
in its light weight twelve fifteen
percent and then it's like when you
start bringing it down into groups you
start seeing guys like three four people
of each group it's like wait what you
know what I mean like the industry is
not diverse yet because not a lot of
people are interested in this that's
okay women in pharma you know I don't
know I haven't worked in any pharma
companies I don't I'll be honest maybe
they have a better ratio over there but
tech industry I'm not talking about this
another thing so that people get mixed
mixed up like when we talk about
diversity in tech industry we're not
talking about you know the girl who is a
designer the girl who's who's working as
whatever ray or product manager or
distance an act like this a bunch of
girls on there right we all know that
every company has a whole bunch of women
there
we're not talking about that was talking
about the IT team I'm not I don't care
about who else is in there man I don't
care who now you know the girl who gives
you a coffee
she don't care right we're not talking
about the girl that's on the phone as
picking up the phone when I talk about
customer service we're not talking about
Nona stuff I'm talking about strictly
the IT team right there is no diversity
in that man like this is like maybe one
and that's a it's not like it's because
in reality is not being pushed to girls
there's like if I'm a girl I don't see
that as an option for me for me to
become a developer because that's not
something that society pushes on you you
know and it's the same thing as
minorities I don't see the push on it
you know it's like me growing up and
seeing how other kids grow up they see
minorities like black Latinos they
mostly are sports and you know trying to
become popular best-dressed and this
this and that fashion like those things
are cool because in reality you got to
have some type of sauce and some type of
swag to be good in those fields but at
the same time you don't get that that
push where you've got okay you could
become an engineer you could do this in
that you know I remember seeing like
there was this kid I forgot his name is
this black in for one of my classes
everybody used to make fun of him he
used to have glasses and people be like
oh man you're not even black man that
you know people sitting on this kid for
no reason because he's smart in because
he was really good at school he he
actually used a console of public school
with a basically a suit on like a soup
time but now sir the whole shebang my he
used to come in professional to school
and people used to make fun of him and
looking back at it I'm like girl and
people still do that right now like
being smart is not cool
in the minorities and nothing because
people have pushed all the stuff to them
and I owe you could do sports you can do
this and that well how about we make
being smart and being part of let's say
being part of you know the group of
people that get good grades make that
cool how about we make the people that
are you know good at math cool you know
like you which is the thing totally a
lot of people see it like oh man I don't
want to take no math classes
that's for nerds how about we take like
hey you could be yourself and just swag
it out and be good in math you don't
have to be a nerdy guy or you know come
in with the little glasses but nice
mister howdy mister he's an apple like
you don't have to be that caramel you
know what I mean
like that's why I want to tell people
you know and that's another tool I will
also bring that up so for barber barber
say company shouldn't hire because of
just for diversity right they should
have hired just whatever is in it to say
okay we have five black guys in our
company and be like hmm it's like game
wasn't cooking because we got five black
guys in our company company shouldn't be
trying to get you know cookies you know
social points because of that what they
should be getting is the person who is
the most qualified but the reason why
they have to do it like that Biden for
now is because currently there's if we
will so go by the ratio of like
minorities going to really good schools
and take getting good education we
wouldn't even show up we would even be
able to get no anomalous opportunities
right so at least now by bringing in
people because of diversity and they
want to have things more diverse at
least they bringing in those people
which in the long term
is going to bring in more people later
on like I've seen this terms well I
think there's some people that were not
qualified to be working at a job but you
know there were a different ethnicity
and they they got hired I felt like they
got hired because of me
all right well then the reason why they
got hired is because of that right now
the good thing about it is that when
you're around smart people you become
smart you know you you level up your own
game right it's like a candle goes to
the public school and everybody is it's
like messing around and nobody cares
about classes nobody care about the pure
SATs and stuff like that his level is
not gonna be at the same level of a
capable so school what everybody's
trying to achieve like the number one
spot his level even though he's number
one in that public school he still can't
compete with those kids that went to
that private school because they are not
another level right for that kid to
compete he has to go to AP classes and
AP classes and AP classes and there was
another thing to which this is
documentary about I don't know if you
guys know about this I think it's in
Arkansas or something like that there's
a high school the first high school that
they they try to do integration between
black and whites and basically people
were they had to bring in the army to
let those kids go into that school right
so this day because that the high school
means a lot to say I think is Arkansas
City or something like that high school
so say to go to the high school you get
approved to like automate your colleges
like Harvard MIT Duke a whole bunch of
different colleges right so people go to
that college even though they have money
it's a public school they go to that
college there's not college they go to
that high school so pretty much say hey
I went to Arkansas City High School
whatever right just to say that they
went to the high school
in colleges look at them and old days
are a very respectful high school we
gotta give them you know scholarship but
we gotta let them in Harvard right for
example right but what people don't know
is that even till this day the school is
segregated completely segregated right
these kids who are coming in with way
better education from middle school
junior high school so when they go to
high school they way better prepared
than the other kids the other minority
started they're mostly blacks right so
they in there and what the way how they
separated is they separate all the black
kids on the regular classes and then all
the white kids they have AP classes I
don't know if you guys know about this
AP classes is like supposed to be
Advanced Placement or something like
that right advanced courses alright so
what happens is now all of your teachers
are inside the AP classes and all the
bad teachers are in the regular classes
so now for this usually there's a gun
let's say four out of ten kids nine of
them are white in there's only one black
kid in each AP class and what happens is
everybody that school alone has gotten
so many people to go to Harvard and go
to like Stanford and all those big
schools but when you look down on it
people say oh yeah look you know it's
not was the integration work so well but
it's like it's still segregated you know
what I mean so they have those
opportunities that you can't compare
somebody's I give myself I don't that's
why my my goal in life is I don't like
the pilgrims right now right everything
I do is an achievement you know it's
like when Eli the computer guy was
saying the other day say Oh self was
itself something self brand or whatever
it's like everything I do is an
achievement right because I'm the first
one here I don't have nobody to take
care of me I don't have
to pay for anything for me I don't have
a little pillow a lot of people have
pillows right pillows that hey we try
something if they fail ah you know dad
could you hold me down for $10,000 and
you know piggyback later when I'm back
on my feet here son I don't have that I
don't have that that pillow when people
you know you know what they say think
you could come in you mess up once and
you get opportunities come back up
people I mean don't get that right I
don't get the pillows I don't get the
pillows to just fall back and say if I
mess up I mess up I have to start back
to zero you know what I mean so what I'm
saying is you got a free game you know
you don't understand like I don't
compare myself to those guys this guy's
that is out there that's like man deep
they got everything you know what I mean
like they they got the whole process you
know I was like oh it's like Mark
Zuckerberg right look at what Mark
Zuckerberg history from the beginning
like all the schools that he went to
order high school the high school that
he went to the college that he went to
directly straight to Harvard they all
lot of stuff right there's a process
it's like a process of Education a
process of the whole and you get all of
those things right and it's like how can
I compare myself to one of those guys
when I'm like nah they got they got a
good you know they got a good luck off
in this world of being born with the
right people right parents and taking
the right education but what do I do am
i I didn't have none of those things so
it's like I make myself to where I'm at
right so everything that I do is an
accomplishment right me being here on
YouTube with the city current and the
background of you know the closet right
behind me know that you're making
cookies right there you know what I mean
like all these things are an
accomplishment I'm here by myself you
know what I mean I'm doing all the stuff
I'm earning the same amount of money
that was earning full-time if I go I
work full-time I'm still gonna make the
same
money that I'm getting right now so
that's twice the income right all of the
stuff is unheard of for people that I
know of people that I know people that I
grew up with this is unheard of there's
things that they could only dream about
you know what I mean I made it happy but
can I compare myself to other freaking
people who had the the whole let's say
the whole American experience no I can't
compare myself to that I'm a pilgrim
right now I'm basically I'm building
myself up my son is gonna get all of
that my son is gonna have the whole
opportunity to become everything that he
wants to be right now what when I say
that it goes back to the the same thing
that I just told you one of the reason
why there's no like there's barely any
minorities in the tech industry as I
tease I'm not talking about you know
some people bring it up as I tease
we gotta separate I tease I tease when
you think of IT you think about our
connecting servers and doing an
associate in and becoming a network
administrator those guys are like at the
bottom of the bottom of the bottom of
tech industry right we're talking about
the guys on the top it's all about
developers guys making a hundred
thousand-plus
guys who are software architects on you
know engineers like that's the people
that we're talking about yes there's a
lot of minority at the bottom it's like
that you know you look at WordPress
developers it's full of minorities
WordPress developers like you line them
up everybody's is a minority we not
trying to become you know get the
minorities into becoming WordPress you
want to get the minor is at the top you
know what I mean you come like you know
machine learning
engineers and this and then another
thing what I tell people which is
totally different when people come in
and be like oh you got the you got
Asians who are minorities and to me
that's annoying because it's like people
were at home we've got Asians we got
Indians in our team it's like we're not
talking about
yeah yes there's Indians in this Asians
in there you know whoop-dee-doo right
but we're talking about the people that
it's coming from the bottom people are
getting you know arrested all the time
people who don't have that people who
are like you know it's like you come in
from the bottom you know what I really
like people don't understand that I feel
like you know I'm probably gonna have to
delete this video anyways because you
can't really talk about none of this
stuff on YouTube but you have to
understand like there's a divide you
know what I mean like this people who
are just like who have nothing you know
what I mean people think like oh man you
know Asian man came in they coming from
China they make it happen and this
doesn't matter yes they can make it
happen that's great big you know really
did a lot of sounds Asians are actually
doing better than their whites in every
other race out here right they earning
way more money than everybody because
they get that education and they get to
look to have that right but you've never
heard of an Asian guy walking down the
street and you gotta get harassed and
everybody gotta check your pockets I
okay okay uh Chinese Kate take out your
your wallet they're not going to that
stuff you know I was like forget they
not set up with my pay you can't vote
you don't have an ID they don't go
through that whole process like you know
so many things here that people don't
really realize then I kill we have to
get this minority which is blacks and
Latinos to become better in society
because at the end of the day if you
don't push for that then what you gotta
get is people who's gonna be out here
bitter people who's gonna be pissed off
like at some point people's gonna
rebelled
you know what I mean like yeah so with
the whole riots and the whole shebang on
you know Ferguson and all this
affect how you killed people and you
don't even go to jail you knows like
that that's not telling people that kill
like people get the short end of the
stick you know I mean and there's like
and it comes to the tech industry people
act like oh man like you're not supposed
to let this people win is like this this
man is like man what we need to do is
promote that from all people to want to
get into the tech industry so that will
trickle down as if like right now I come
in and I'm making a hundred seven
thousand a year I could do that for my
son I could also help out my nephew to
go to a school my sister needs the money
I could help out it trickles down right
well it doesn't trickle down is when you
just say you know what pick yourself up
by your boot strapping do what you gotta
do and somehow survive in this world we
did it in it's like yeah you did it when
you're not going through the whole
process that weird going you know what I
mean so that's what I'm saying you know
what I mean like and how people just
don't don't like don't like the reality
of things you know what I mean and I'm
not saying like every like somebody was
saying oh man every white person is is
you know they got money that's not true
that's a lot of guys that live in the
trailer parks and a little stuff like
this guys who if you guys remember this
like indentured servants right there's
guys who are still seeing the
repercussions from the ancestors
becoming like you know being indentured
servants because they were like
Hillbillies in till this day those
communities are still not getting
education like you know the thing that
they looking up to is to go into the
coal mine oh yeah say my father what my
grandfather was a coal miner well my
father's a coal miner now I'm gonna
become a coal miner right it's all about
breaking the mold slag is that you
supposed to break all the molds and all
the barriers that you got you know so
that's what I'm saying no and like Bargo
say if you go you can get a tech job yes
nowadays you can that's for sure
you can definitely get a tech job man
but
you know people at the same time as like
you can't you can't hide the you know
the Sun wave with a finger but I okay
I'm look I'm gonna cover the Sun with
this finger and be like everything
that's already in the Sun are covering
it it's like it doesn't work like that
you know but that's what I'm saying
that's exactly what I'm saying
quintic I just run it up I think people
get that wrong I really do
I really do think people get that wrong
it's not that I'm saying like oh because
you're minority you're not gonna get the
job that doesn't work no no that's not
that doesn't exist being a moron
minority you actually get a plus that's
like a plus now in the industry to be
honest that's like an extra plus that's
like extra you know if you want to be
like oh I got five projects I got my
resume I have a degree and I'm also
minority that's like an extra plus
that's an extra check that you get right
the the problem is the whole process of
somebody growing up in a certain
community and coming from the bottom you
don't see I never met nobody that was
like oh I'm an engineer there's nobody
like that right there's nobody that you
can look up to you have basketball
players it's got baseball please God you
know artists you got rappers you got
singers you got this and that those are
people that you look up to you know
should look that person make money you
know or even you might see somebody who
is a doctor like you go to your doctor
you'd be like oh yeah if my doctor you
know this guy became a doctor this is
nice you might get inspired to become a
doctor but kids are now seeing
developers that look like them that talk
like them in this fields and people feel
a certain way they my god that's not for
me
I won't fit in I won't do this and that
when in reality is more of a thing of
like you're not having exposure girls
are now developers we
they can't is not because they can't
become developers it's because that's
not an option for them that's not
something that they'd seen exposure to
right if there was more women in the
field and they say oh cool this are a
whole bunch of tech developers are women
more women will get into it you know I
mean so it's the same thing as like
blacks and Latinos or blacks and Latinos
are in the teams and we're not talking
about freaky at the bottom at the had
the bottle of like the tech industry you
know they people be like yeah we have we
have uh you know twenty percent of
minorities is on a company you look at
the company you look all the way at the
bottom is like oh yeah the guy that
connects the printer he's black
you got the the guy who comes in and
every game and you know checks who who
lost a password he's Spanish
like we're not talking about that we're
talking about getting more people into
the top positions man so other people
could come in and be like oh I can be
that one day you know what I mean like
me being here on this channel I know for
sure this brings it up for a lot of
people that it motivates them and be
like okay cool like I'm gonna you know
support this kid and help him out you
know what I mean and like you know
coming they see me here that oh he did
it I could do it too you know what I
mean so that's what I'm saying
you know people if you will get so
touchy you know we wouldn't like to to
be honest sometimes man and then one of
the worst things is when one of the
worst things is when it it'll be like
I'll be like one guy who's a minority
and be like I've seen minorities on for
my company and and then a reality is
like wrong like there's not that many of
them and then you're like no but they
are you already know it's like only the
best of the best get here and it's like
makes the best break that down for me
you know what I mean that's how I look
at things you know and I just want more
people to be really get interesting into
this man and that's what I'm saying man
because people get so touchy touching
you came and speak the truth to people
you know
that's true too yeah but I think it's
gonna change in Texas
I don't know high school kids make fun
of people into coding you know make fun
of people who are into coding and that's
true man but I think that it all
changing it was time you know math said
that did that didn't really happen in my
school but every school is different
yeah that's the thing I don't know what
school you go to math I don't know is
there you go to but people get make fun
of if you like smart if you smart you're
not part of the in-crowd let's be honest
you're smart you're not part of the
in-crowd you know you're doing cool
projects on your own time you're not
part of the kids who get into girls
you're not part of the kids getting
invited to parties like you're not in
that crowd right usually you'll be like
dudes who are like you know who are just
like in the cut like you know I mean
because even myself like even when I was
going to school when I was going to
school there will be times where I will
play it off like like I'm not even smart
like I don't even wanna act like I was
smart like I'll be in class and I could
raise my hand and I'm like I'm not gonna
do it I'll leave it for the Nerds
to answer that you know so that's how it
is man you know so it all depends man
like that's just how it is now man so I
think it's just about pushing it forward
to people and just show it show it to
people like y'all you can just come in
and like doesn't matter where you come
from you just need to have that
motivation to get into the industry but
at the same time people need to see
people there man
you know what I mean it's like when you
think about it you go back into time man
if somebody yeah obviously that there's
a great picture this is a great picture
where they say there was like y'all you
couldn't go into a restaurant and sit
down at the table you couldn't go to the
bar and sit down at the bar if there
wasn't one guy one black guy who sit
down at that bar nobody else would have
sit down right so that's how I feel like
that's how it is in the tech ministry if
you don't see other minorities in there
there's gotta be kids who are now gonna
be getting turned on to it because in
reality being in a place where you're
the only person as a minority it sucks
because it's like you have nothing to
talk about
you come in as a you you want to talk to
somebody about the new hey man have you
heard the new mr. King and then I reach
the what I've never heard of first mr.
white
like you know is like you're not in the
culture you know what I mean like it
sucks I think it sucks that's what I'm
saying you know what I mean but but
anyways man I'm outta here man I
actually got work to do right now man we
hanged out for a little while hope you
guys get to show love to the channel
make sure you vote yeah I think I tell
people all the time man
one imma leave you guys with this last
thing which is like you know there's
like a answer to you know from what like
Philippe was saying before he's like man
if this from what I got from what he was
saying man in my company Big Pharma you
know like it's a lot of minorities here
you know a lot of people that I've been
working you know
so then after like his point of view is
like hey my experience is good and was
good but the reality of it because my
experience was good everybody else
experience is good and it doesn't work
like that these are all was this guy's
name I just saw this yesterday you guys
should definitely take the time to watch
this I'll leave these guys you know
leave this video for you guys from you
guys to actually watch this thing you
know because sometimes we can't we gotta
put ourselves in the perspective of
other people's because sometimes I might
have opportunities that a lot of people
don't okay you know I was like which is
the same thing when I bring it back to
like programming languages and this and
that people be like oh man you know
nodejs is the top programming language
in the world and the whoa backend
language in the world right now because
they live in New York or San Francisco
outside of those cities is not number
one right most of the time it's PHP in
asp.net but people be like oh this is my
experience so this is how it works you
know it's the same thing as as a mat
just brought it up it's like in my
school is it's not like that but then at
the moment go to a mind thing is not
like that what you do is you X out the
reality of other people's you know you
can't do that you can't just be like
inviting my experience my experience is
amazing compared to a lot of people who
have really bad experiences in life but
what I do is I take everybody's
perspective of things that have happened
to them and then I'll be like okay if
the majority of people have had bad
experiences in different situations I'll
go okay so most likely this is how it is
for everybody else for me I'm one of the
lucky ones to have a good experience you
know what I mean but it just doesn't
work like that you know this guy
this guy I'm gonna put it up right now
on the video before I leave so everybody
can check this out okay then where is it
all right so this guy this guy is the
definition of somebody who does that all
the time you know not to bring up
policies or anything like that but just
to pretty much explain to you guys what
is the problem when somebody who becomes
a doctor who becomes he's really from
the project's like this guy he was
raising projects became a neurosurgeon
like super famous super smart dude but
because he he's had opportunities and
his life has been good
he believes that everybody else life
should be good indeed they can do it
then I oh you can do it yourself because
my life was great and I've had
opportunities guys it doesn't work like
that
man the world does not work with a
single person but I hate because my
opportunity about eight I'm not gonna
give a homeless person they have four
hours because hey when I didn't have
four hours nobody gave me five dollars
and I made myself who
I am today it don't make no sense right
it's the same thing like right now if
I'm gonna train when I was in a train at
one time and I'd have no money to get
back home and I'm asking people for
money like yo could you swipe me in on
the met MTA to get home if I was to be
your a goal like this guy who pretty
much says hey because I got
opportunities and I didn't get no
opportunities from anybody and I did it
myself now I'm not gonna help nobody
else then this is what happens right you
can never be like oh everything is about
me I had opportunities I had a good
experience and then X out everybody else
so the only reason I bring this up is
because this guy he got bodied by
basically a representative I forgot what
was take our green basically just body
him explain it to him he said you know
he's asking him at oh why did you cut
housing and you know pretty much stuff
for low income and it's like you came
from a low income you know what I mean
you came from the projects like how can
you somebody who came from the projects
and the opportunities at the end say hey
I'm gonna cut down on money for the
projects and for housing because I got
opportunities people should be able to
do with themselves - and that's the
problem when people be like hey my my
experience was good so that's it if my
experience was good everything was dead
everything is good in life it doesn't
work like that you know my experience I
seen a 30 minority developers that's not
the reality of the world right just
because in New York there's you know a
lot of people using low GS doesn't mean
that's what's happening in Pennsylvania
that's not what's happening in Illinois
that's not what's happening in other
families now what's happening in
Cincinnati it's not happening in Florida
people are using PHP alright so I'll
leave you guys with that and I'm out of
here bow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
