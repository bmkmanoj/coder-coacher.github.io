projects for now on I started it last

modern web pack - the whole shebang
basically I built it so you guys could
just focus on coding and stop focusing
on oh my god how do I set up you know
web pack how do I set up go blah I set
up all this stuff but for now I just
want you guys to worry about the cold
case there's the prerequisite to
everything all right nice so all you
have to do is you go to github.com /
coding face comm right just like that
and then you go starter - K - 2018 or if
you use decide to come here and unite
okay let me just go to the squad let me
see what Joe got alright you got the
starter kit we got rocky stat community
rocky documentation right so we click on
the starter kit both now we're here
right okay so this how you do this guy's
basically you're gonna come in make sure
you have no GS right installed on your
computer you install your arm right
download atom which is this right this
beautiful text editor right okay and
then from there you're going to store
all the atom packages that are so you're
gonna make sure you download this
project right so you are the cloning or
download it so click here download the
zip all right start a kick
once this thing downloads you could name
it to whatever you want you could name
it to bake store you can name it to you
know whatever right whatever project I'm
actually working on or whatever project
you're actually working on right so cool
for me right now I named it the base
store alright so this how it is the
sound folder
works all right so we have all all the
files here right let's get this party
poppin okay so after everything is
installed you run this whoa you copy
this you run this here okay this is
gonna install all the packages that I
have and then from there you're gonna be
sweet all right
okay so I just fast forward through this
whole thing now make sure you install
all the packages from no js' all right
so how do you do that just run one and
that's kind of stole everything right
I already installed it so should be done
right okay now let's jump on to how to
start the server you say yard what's and
you should be good you should be seeing
the starter kit all right guys that's
the prerequisite make sure you follow
the steps it's pretty simple any
problems you might have send me a
message in the comments or whatever or
even my email wherever you want to send
it to me all right guys I'll see you in
a little bit all right guys so you
probably asking yourself why the hell
should I care about this thing why would
I want to install this why would I take
my time to install this prerequisite
all right guys listen you're gonna get
laughs reload you're gonna get compiled
CSS well sass right and then compile es6
and react or any other framework you
might want to be using so you're getting
everything wrong shop so you're gonna be
great all right so let's start it up
like this let's test it so we have to be
on run watch but yarn watch right so
then from there we come in here I'm
going to say okay hey hey just switched
up hey looks good automatically so you
don't have to go in there and start
refresh on your page you can literally
not set this up like this and start
coding you just say okay I got my Col
here
I got my screen here and I could just
start coding like this you know this
test test shut up right all right not
only do you get that but you also get
you know your JavaScript this is
actually a component this whole area is
actually a component form react and you
already set up for it
everything is compiled you see you
become here say my first component let's
work with this so now it should be
compiling you see Joe's component
automatically refresh giving you the
whole shebang
all right guys now let's talk about CSS
which is I think to me there's like a
lifesaver
because now you can just come here and
say hey I want to change something on my
page and I want to see the change now so
you come here and say hey Becker purple
you see without having to refresh what I
happen to do anything it's already done
for you all right you can comment this
