it again man listen today we're gonna
talk about you know how frameworks are a
pro and how frameworks are actually a
car for a new develop let's say right
now you guys most of the people that
come to my channel I actually new
developers it's mostly guys who are just
having an interest on becoming a
developer or becoming a programmer we
come in a software engineer we're coming
up a video games developer whatever it
is but most of the time it's new people
come in it so I'm just here to lighten
up the spark right people they look at
online and look at a list that says hey
top programming languages and then I oh
my god I gotta learn you know ten
different languages because those are
the hottest ones and reality you don't
and something that's really slowing down
people it's pretty much frameworks
because you come and you'll be like okay
one person says angular is the best
another person says react is the best
now people are saying UJ s is the best
before was ember Jes and before that I
was back for so it's like every few
months there's a new framework coming
out and pretty much everybody's just
like okay they got scrambled to try to
learn what's the newest one because
everybody's doing it or wheels on it but
at the same time they haven't learned
the basics you have to be able to
understand how that framework was
actually created like what's behind me
do you understand object-oriented
programming
do you understand classes do you
understand
you know how variables work do you
understand how if in L statements work
how loops work how for each works like
this people who are using frameworks
like angular view GS and they're
basically putting a lot of cool things
into their their first website one
and they have this they have a slider
they have a list looping or something
you know something that's cool at the
end of the day they don't know how to do
that themselves
on JavaScript so it's really really
hurting them so that's something that I
think people gotta address here like one
of the main reasons why I love react is
because you're actually just basically
coding JavaScript you're not in there
doing something that's out of this world
or learning a new new language or
learning a new syntax like rebind or
whatever you know angular had the same
things where it was like binding HTML
tags and you learned something else
you're not learning JavaScript and this
a lot of things are good what is hurting
people my thoughts on this guy's is
pretty much to learn the basics don't
come in trying to learn a framework
first learn the basics and stick to the
pieces until you're very comfortable on
creating you know your own framework or
your own library don't start using
things if you don't know what's really
behind it if you only know that if I put
this here is gonna drop up a loop of a
list or a table like you don't want to
do that you want to know how that's
actually work make sure you subscribe
make sure you like this video man it's
your boy Joe back at it again man I did
it again alright guys make sure you
subscribe and make sure you like this
video man if you want to support the
channel just click on the links below
and basically click either the Amazon
link or you click on the udemy link so
whenever you buy an item basically like
a little personal things like 3 or 4
percent we get it back over here at the
channel and we actually help our other
developers if you didn't know we
actually give 25 percent of all the
earnings so basically all of the
developers here they're actually
subscribed to this channel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
