again man coding face calm your boys
backing out and did it again
um I was just watching this advertising
from HubSpot all right somehow they
created this video which is explaining
what is artificial intelligence to be
honest I don't know why this is on
HubSpot it's pretty much a way to get
people to find out more about their
brand I mean it's good promotion and
whatever artificial intelligence is hot
right now everybody want to talk about
it
alright so anyways did I say just did
you you already knows you're good you're
back at it again coding phase comm did I
say that I don't know if I did but um
yeah so like I was saying man you know
they basically created this this video
it's they explained it pretty well
explaining pretty good but why I didn't
like a body was the fact that they make
is so like so scary like oh my god
computers are gonna destroy every job
out there and artificial intelligence is
gonna take over that's how I felt after
watching this video I'm gonna link it
below on the description so you guys
could take a chance and and you're
actually watching and you know give us
some views to UM but it's pretty crazy
like I think everybody right now not
everybody but the people who are on the
computer like you know marketing
designers or you know even programmers
now it seems everybody's like scared
because of artificial intelligence guys
I'm gonna be honest with you guys um I
don't think it's gonna be that bad you
know why because if we are smart if we
are smart human beings which I think we
are and even though some people say I'm
a pessimist sometimes but I am a
positive person what I'm gonna say about
this is at some point is gonna be lost
like if people are smart if human beings
are smart they're gonna say hey there
can
only be 20% of the workforce to become
you know robots in automating whatever
right artificial intelligence editor of
artificial intelligence I don't care if
it is a Cuffy african coffee mug I don't
care if it is a machine building cars I
don't care if his a programmer or a
computer that builds websites I don't
care what it is all I care about is that
only 20% of them should be allowed right
now because what this made it seem like
is like oh man there's not gonna be no
more job so it's like everything's got a
big sort of chill because there's not
gonna be any more jobs and you could
pretty much do a lot of cool stuff on
your own time that's not the reality of
things right and that's why I tell you
guys try to make as much money now
do very smart investments you know just
be smart first 20 30 years from now
we're gonna look back and when they're
gonna be like oh man you remember all
that time where I could have been making
a hundred thousand two hundred thousand
dollars you don't know how this world is
gonna flip in the next 20 30 years right
so you want to be like those people that
were in the 50s the 60s you know the 40s
where they came in they bought their
houses they they got land they you know
they did investment like you see all
those Oh old people walking around and
you know brand-new Mercedes and you're
like wait you know how do you have a
Mercedes how do you have a Tesla how do
you do this in that most of those people
make good investments back then back
when they were factories back when there
was a whole bunch of jobs right luckily
for us and for the people that are
watching this you guys are actually
ahead of the curve in the sense of like
hey you trying to change careers you're
trying to make as much money as you can
you're trying to make something positive
for your life right if we leave it to
destiny and say hey we're just gonna say
we're just gonna leave it to the destiny
and we're gonna leave it
so somebody else figures it out right
you're going to get effed up because
what's gonna happen 20 30 years from now
if things do get automated and let's say
somebody like Trump who doesn't care
about the people and only cares about
let's say just making money they're
gonna be like oh you know what let's
automate everything and let's make up a
basic pay for everybody like a welfare
for everybody it's like everybody gets
welfare which means like now you have
enough to live but not enough to be good
now the people that are going to be good
are the people that mean money now those
people are gonna be good because it's
like this once you make money you always
gotta be good in the sense of like you
have money you have equity you have all
you know freaking a bank account that
have been generating you know you know
let's say your portfolio whatever
etcetera there's so many ways you can
make money right but once you have money
in the long term if you're smart that
money keeps growing you know you've
definitely heard of seeing from people's
going like oh you know the rich get
richer and the poor get poorer that's
true that happens right so if you're
poor by that time you're gonna be effed
up right and that's if we don't have
somebody representing us I like what
Elon Musk was saying like we have to
have laws for artificial intelligence we
have to have laws for robots I'll be
honest this is the only thing that I
want from robots that I think that they
should be used for is for the fool in
services like you know you go to a
restaurant you should have like a little
robot that comes in and brings you your
food somebody like a robot in your house
to clean your house for those people
that don't have you know nobody to be
with like a sex robot yes I said it
those people need love too you know what
I mean of course there's gonna be people
who's gonna abuse him but like
never touching another human being I got
sandy right here and he was like what
like no you missed the point you know so
um but yeah those three and I think for
like real dangerous jobs those are the
type of robots that that we need all
right I and when I mean dangerous jobs I
mean like minors and stuff like that
like nobody should be working that type
of job right now automatic trucks
automatic cars automatic all of this
stuff that human beings can do there
should be a law that says only 20
percent can be robots period because if
not then the poor people are gonna get
effed up that's it that's what's gonna
happen you know people that are rich
they're gonna get rich because they own
the companies once you have money and
you own a company and you say hey you
know why like this was one uh you know
my last company the owner was like oh
man you know we should just get oh ok
you know at some point get more machines
that automate everything I'm like
thinking in my head I'm like wait people
are making the same job they work in it
and they doing their job good but you
want to get machines to basically cut
them out and then now those people don't
have jobs now of course if you look at
it in the side of I want to make money I
want to make as much profit as I can hey
I'm spending you know a million dollars
on employees I could spend $400,000 one
time and fifty thousand dollars every
year for maintenance I'm gonna save a
whole bunch of money all right so it
makes sense but for human beings it
doesn't now this whole video to me just
there was things that made it positive
there was things that made it negative
it's one of those videos where it's like
oh man I don't know how I feel about it
I'll be honest you know I really I love
technology but at the same time I I know
that it's dangerous and can be dangerous
in the sense of like even now like I
told you guys my mom used to be a taxi
and one of them on one of our boys
father was a taxi driver and now he says
he don't do taxi driving oh you didn't
drive the taxi right no more because
over shut down all the smaller taxi
companies there's no more store you know
small taxi companies that you could call
up and but I all can you guys come pick
me up there was this uh a company called
Phoenix Phoenix doesn't exist no more
because over eat it up everybody even
the drivers that were working for
Phoenix and they were making good money
now they work for over because now the
competition everybody is calling uber
there's nobody calling to their phone to
the companies before for the taxi so
imagine that that was just over so over
replaced all the smaller businesses
automatically with just an app what's
gonna happen if they be like hey you
know what we want to have 100% you know
cars driving automatically out here you
know with Jess
artificial intelligence what's gonna
happen there you know how many people
gonna lose their jobs what's gonna you
know what's gonna be the effect of that
in society you guys think like oh man
this is just who cares this the taxi
drivers like this is like a ecosystem
everything works around it it's like hey
the taxi drivers don't work now the
mechanics don't got work now the
mechanics don't have work the guy who
was the in the butcher shop
he doesn't have work because now not
that many but can excel by me for their
family etc cetera cetera or whatever it
keeps going it's an ecosystem right we
saw what happened with Detroit when
those companies left and everybody
started shutting down people thought
like oh they still making cars over
there it's like no but almost like 80%
of all the smaller companies which were
the ones that really hired all the
people around there they don't have jobs
no more so the people that used to make
you know timing belt you
the screws for for the cars and this and
that like all of that stuff they don't
make it in a factory they make in
smaller companies and then those company
hired you know 50 100 people to do it
and then those companies sell it to you
know to Ford in they sell it to
what's the other one gee bring all the
other companies out there right Cadillac
and this and that when the smaller
business has started going away because
now in China and Mexico they're making
everything but the people here got effed
up you know what I mean so it's like I
don't know artificial intelligence I
like it because I like what I could do
for me I don't know if I like it for
what its gonna do for society right now
I'm not saying that for you guys to be
scared I'm not saying for you guys to be
like oh my god we're not gonna have no
jobs no no no we are at a golden age for
developers programmers all right we are
at the top where we at right now it's
never going to be this high I don't
think so right so the people that get in
now you have an opportunity to get in
make as much money as you can and like I
said to you guys from the beginning you
always have to have an exit plan all
right I keep telling people you know
people you know keep thinking like on
like I know everything under the Sun I
don't know everything under the Sun I
just see what happens and learn from
other people's mistakes right like you
gotta have an exit plan you gotta have
for Plan B Plan C plan D always you
can't just be like oh my a plan a is is
everything no you gotta have plan B C
and D because things go wrong things go
left nothing ever goes right
I always think about that there's not
it's like the car never goes right the
car is just left life it's a car and all
it does is go to the left
think about it like that right now I
want you guys to get motivated I want
you guys to really go hard for those of
you guys that haven't signed up to my
website sign up to the website if you
don't want to sign that's where I was I
fine go to you to me click on the links
below I have a whole bunch of courses
that you could buy from you know you
don't mean just to get in the game if
you don't want to fine
go find a type of service that you want
it's plural cytosine treehouse disco
Academy this a whole bunch of stuff
right when you go over there and you hit
a wall come back to me I will explain
things in an easier way something that's
gonna make your life like that that easy
alright now I just want you guys to
really go hard guys this is the golden
age watching this video reminded me of
like the fact that you know things could
go left
you know I was like we right now we need
to start making as much money as we can
save as much as we can you know we don't
want to be like one of these people
that's like man I taught for it you know
for 10 years I was gonna be making a
hundred grand every year and this is
that nobody that doesn't happen in the
world the real world even though the
biggest businesses don't have a plus
profit every year it cools down at some
point alright I tell people is like yo
you don't want to be the nokia of you
know programming you don't want to you
know always be behind or always think
like oh I'm on top I'm never gonna go
down think this is gonna go down you
know don't leave it to next year next
year you never know how the economy
might be right the people who are in
there in once you're in you're in that's
eight you good once you got the
experience here you're good but what
happens to those people that we're
waiting we'll sit down in their house
and it's like oh man you know what I
will take six months next year you know
I'll get into this next year I'll leave
it for two weeks from now you know some
people be like you know you I love you
and I'm gonna subscribe to your channel
but you know what I'm gonna start
this you know next month I subscribe I
must start this next month right if
people be like that
you know it's like fine they could be
like that but you know don't tell me
next year something happened on your
town you know your your city is is going
broke or or something we you're like
it's out of your hand now
so those opportunities that you could
have gotten this year you left it for
next year and next year it's not as good
as this year in the economy that's on
you you know what I mean like that's all
I can tell you like me I'm good in the
sense that you know I do this things go
left I could go and get a job ASAP
right but what happens to the people
that were leaving this for last minute
you know people is like think about this
it's like this man is like it's like
when people or you know they have a
project to do you know to graduate
school and they leave it for the last
date and then now they can't do it
because there's not enough time not
enough hours to do it
it's like bro you did it to yourself now
you gotta get enough back now you gotta
take this
summer school you can't graduate with
all your friends on Jun you gotta way
into August
like that's how life is you know now you
guys are adults you guys really gotta go
hard man you know I have a couple of
kids in here who are teens and this
doesn't that but me I could say 94% of
you guys are all adults so how long you
gotta keep leaving this to later on
right now to bring it back to this
artificial intelligence thing it's like
like I said there could be positives and
there's gonna be a lot of negative
negatives to this thing like positive is
gonna be our life is gonna be easier
right but what is really easier if you
can't afford all the things that you
want cuz you can't find a job you can't
have you know those easy
jobs he has like you know in the summer
times like listen when my kid is sixteen
he's gotta work at McDonald's and earn
his his money you know for the summer so
he could go to school in September and
buy his own clothes those days is gonna
be over you know what I mean
people who are like man you know what
i'ma work at at this data entry phone
service telemarketing you know at one
point that's gonna be over - in the next
five years that's for sure that was
definitely kind of be gone cuz I
remember when I was like around 20 I
used to work at Universal telemarketing
in Manhattan that was another job that
was working I worked there for like
three four months horrible place
calling people up every single day
asking them hi can we take a survey or
can you tell me do you have Sprint
Nextel t-mobile or Verizon and people
the first thing they were like Oh take
me off the list that's the first thing
that people tell you is like take me off
the list click they're gonna have
machines for that they don't have
machines for that for sure right so all
I'm saying is think about it like this
guys we are in the 1950s all right and
then we all work for Ford right we all
work for GM all right what's gonna
happen in a few years and there's no
gonna be no more jobs but because he
worked in the 1950s
you're gonna have your house you're
gonna have your money safe you're gonna
have investments you're gonna be able to
say hey I work for five ten years at GM
I'll have enough money to open up my own
business hey now I'm a business owner
it's the same thing that's happening
here in this community in this you know
career this career of programming
development like if you're getting now
you're gonna be good if you leave it for
the last minute that's on you you taking
it taking a big chance there you know
you leave this for
I'll try to learn this two three years
from now we don't know what the economy
is gonna be at so the jobs might not be
there but the people that are gonna get
jobs are the people that already had
experience now those people that is just
trying to come in with no degrees with
no uh you know no background in this no
history no resume no nothing that says
hey what the viola means no company
trusted you before you're not gonna get
that job because it's gonna be even more
competitive so that's what I wanted to
say and yeah go check out this video
it's positive and negative at the same
time but yeah man we in here man coding
phase comm your boys back and out and
did it again guys listen I'm still
working on this course right now I got
the phaser one course this is pretty
cool right here we're knocking out this
one out which is the hyper app course
it's not really hyper app it's a hyper
restaurant MPM run watch show you guys
exactly what what's the course that we
building right now we got this there's a
full restaurant got the reserve you're
gonna be able to click here or click on
reservations and it's gonna pop up and
you're gonna choose how many people you
want the reservation for etc etc right
you got this this is gonna be a slider
you know if you guys always wonder like
hey how do you do a slider you're gonna
learn this here there's so many
different little things now all of the
stuff that you see here we're gonna make
a dynamic coming from data instead of
how it is right now where everything is
actually you know built in static with
just straight code all of this stuff is
coming in dynamically which is how
everything works on the web so it's cool
sometimes when you learn HTML and see it
says you know yeah I build websites like
this yeah but 99% of the time especially
now cuz everybody connects the API
it could be node it could be Python
could be golang it could be PHP laravel
or whatever
everyone is can
into some type of API pulling that data
out and then displaying it on their page
all right so every website now is
dynamic okay so that's what we're gonna
do here - all of this reviews they're
coming dynamically - and at the same
time all of this is responsive okay
so there's so many different things that
you're learning in this course go check
it out it's coding phase comm click on
the description below so you could get
the 50% off on everything right that's
the most important thing that I want
everybody to know if you click on the
link below
you're gonna give you no 50% off
everything automatically or you could
just say hey I wanna come here let's say
all courses all right let's say an
example if you wanted to buy this for
yourself whatever you can come here and
roll now all right and this is a coupon
code that works for everybody it says
from YouTube 2017 I believe it's like
that valid from YouTube so anytime that
you buy any different a website and you
use that coupon from YouTube you get
automatically 50% off you could do it
when you buy the course by itself or you
could do it here when you said get all
access pass you can come here but I'm
all cool I'm gonna get it from here I'm
I'm rolling this choose whichever one
you want you want the one-time purchase
you want the yearly you want the monthly
come here you put in from YouTube apply
coupon now it's ten dollars a month
right you get every single course that I
created and every single course that I'm
going to create anytime you want to just
say hey I'm gonna buy at one time and I
get access to every single course no
matter what I don't want to pay monthly
come me and paint a long time fee just
be like yo from you two
50% of okay you say hey I just want to
try it for one year I want to see how it
goes if everything is good cool
do they yearly I think this is the best
deal because in reality you're getting
everything for 45 percent of the real
price so you're gonna say hey let's say
from you to $45 guys if you leave it
hopefully if you think about it it's 10
times 12 that's 120 alright when you do
the yearly you're paying 45 so for let's
say four or five months four months and
a half you get in the whole year you
know what I mean so it's up to you guys
you guys decide what you guys want I'm
just here to provide the content alright
it's your boy Joe back at it again man
coding phase comm your boys backing out
and did it again alright see you guys
later
