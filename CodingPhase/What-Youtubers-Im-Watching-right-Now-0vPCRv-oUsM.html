joke back at it again man coding
face.com listen today we're going to do
something special you know people ask me
all the time Hey Joe what channels do
you watch what is it that you're
watching right now like who are your
inspiration I mean some of these
channels I can't say I'm like they're my
inspiration but those are people that
respect I like their channel like what
they're doing and yeah let's start it up
right now right so we're going to start
with the real Cassatt with it the real
casado cuz of darou dareka sodaro
right so ill boy out here I love this
channel because he's actually doing
something different he's creating it's
like a mixture between a vlog and also
real life situations and real advice and
it's not just a vices more like follow
his date and I didn't like it like that
you know he's like a family man I like
that you know he's working with a were
on Microsoft oh I like his story on how
he got in there like a lot I liked his
whole vibe man he reminds me of like my
cousin like straight up my cousin
Stanley but he looks just like you know
what I mean like he's like not only
opposed to show you a picture he looks
just like so yeah but I like his channel
is pretty cool and then from there we
have the real tough cookie
well the real tough candy sorry sorry I
get you mean let's start ma but I like
her because I feel like there is a new
trend when it comes to this web
development there's a new trend that
basically people are creating YouTube
channels have their personalities in it
if you guys have been on YouTube for a
while you know that there's been nothing
the squares on YouTube I got to have no
personality guys that you see the
ministry like they cool whatever but
it's not like somebody like oh I would
love to hang out with that person you
know what I mean and no because they're
bad it's just because they just don't
show their personalities doesn't show
their funny side and show their sides
when their pistols gonna show where
they're sad show nothing there's no
emotion
it's just like yours code and dah dah
dah dah dah like that's boring to me man
so yeah I really love her channel man
real self candy you guys should
definitely subscribe to her she has a
lot of smart and witty stuff any late
she's pretty legit I will say check her
out for short and then let me see this
is my old G I've been watching this guy
for years and when I say years I mean
years guys I've been watching Johnny ft
for a long time guys like this ain't
brandy with this ain't no English guys
like I've been watching this guy for no
the like he's been making money over the
years right he's been making passive
income he's actually a digital nomad you
know when I first started becoming a web
developer my dream was to become a
digital nomad and it was like man what I
want to do is go to Thailand what I want
to do is just when I grow up or whatever
we come just like this guy but then at
the same time I was like man I don't
know if I want to do that like I want to
travel the world I don't know if I wanna
you know become a digital nomad but it's
like a fantasy of mine sorry so I like
to watch him I like to watch his life
and how things are going for him but he
makes money guys like good guy he makes
money talking about 20 30 40 50 grand a
month
he's just traveled in the world and it
was amazing about it is that you could
go and look at his first YouTube videos
from years ago right and you can see him
broke you know I think to me
that's amazing to see the growth for
somebody then this shows you like if you
put your minds away you could do
anything that you want in this world
period like there is nothing that's
gonna stop you like you could go from
being broke to have a lot of money and
just have a legit business that you
created on your own so I love his
channel and I've been watching his
channel I'm a player and I'll send
someone I'm gonna go into my history and
let me see I'm gonna tell you right now
from seven years ago I've been watching
his videos for six to seven years ago
like it's been a long time I've been
watching this guy like man I'm telling
you guys I've been with using for a long
time and like he's definitely one of my
favorites and people that I'm watching
right now cuz that's what the videos
about Who am i watching right now you
know cuz like I told you guys I stopped
watching other youtubers other youtubers
are doing cold like me either because
I'm finding out that they're copying my
style or I'm finding out that they're
taking that I started different
formats like there's little things that
I know are influenced by me and I just
wish like it could be like man create
your Shinta i watch all of this guys and
I don't take from nobody I just come in
and create my own shake if I see
somebody doing it I don't do it because
then that makes my channel different so
there's a lot of people that I'm
actually watching right now um let me
see who else
your boy King flip man I love his
channel man you know what I love this
channel because I feel like I know it
like I feel like me and him have hanged
out a couple of times like if you guys
haven't checked out
kickflip is legit late he's not out here
to do know fake shake like meaning like
you're not here trying to get money from
you guys not here trying to promote
anything he's not here
like he proposes himself like you know
but he's not here like you know that hey
I want to make money from you soon he's
there because he wants to create content
like you know this time about YouTube
goals in a freaking blocks is counted or
like let's say he puts music like from
Drake and other artisans that of course
he's not getting paid from that because
of how monetization works so that goes
to show you like he just cares about the
art and to show you guys you know his
life and show you what he's up to
so I really enjoy that you know and then
you got Christa freelancer
I like his story I like a story of how
you know he just he started as a what
developer like now I don't know exactly
what exactly is it that he's becoming
because before it was he was a digital
nomad somebody who was doing web
development marketing now he's just
becoming like a travel guy type of dude
but it doesn't matter because if we go
into the beginning of his or his videos
man it's like a journey I like the fact
that he's documented his journey over
the past two three years of like coming
out and creating content and sharing his
story how he became or what develop or
how he learned online like he's been
doing this one for maybe two three years
we've been doing this for a year but
he's out here guys like he's doing this
thing man I really enjoy his channel I'm
not like he's one of those people that I
