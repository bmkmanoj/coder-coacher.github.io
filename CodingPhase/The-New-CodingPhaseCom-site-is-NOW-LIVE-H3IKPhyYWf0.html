fees.com your boy is back and I done did
it again one more time I don't know how
I do it but we here life again guys all
yeah
a newsman the the page is up so you
literally could go to coding phase come
and see the new website all right now
easy let's say a hundred percent done I
will say about eighty seven percent done
alright now what's interesting about
this is that I'm giving you guys the
opportunity to be part of this you know
I say hey I could do this and knock this
out myself fix the little bugs that
might be on the site and it's not like
major things it's more like hey you know
fix this font move a little bit to the
left you know changed a couple of little
things here and there as far as like
being responsive I say you know what
let's leave it for the people right
let's leave it for the people let's see
who wants to collaborate so I also put
it not only is alive but I also put it
on my github
so coding face.com let me share my
github so you guys could have access to
that you can do a pull request right
this is the whole project this is the
whole website here okay you could
download this right now and run in your
computer if you want to okay and you
should be fine at the same time you can
also basically go in here to fix a
couple of changes say hey I wanna go in
there clean this up a little bit you
know there's a misspelling somewhere I
don't know whatever it could be right a
little thing that we gotta move
were you know being responsive whatever
it is right you have the opportunity to
come in and pretty much change the
website yourself you know to a pull
request send it back to me and Ephram
there
I will definitely definitely add it to
the website so feather who is going to
the site so coding phase comm is already
live we got a couple of things here I
will be working on this still all night
you know you guys find any bugs any
issues send it's a coding face at
gmail.com let me know what you think let
me know
were you having some issues at as far as
the courses for all of you guys that are
already subscribed to the website you
pretty much could just literally just
click here members area and that's gonna
take you to all of your courses that you
are ready a member of ok most likely
you're gonna have all of the courses
there because you've signed up to the
description okay
so you're gonna be fine for new members
or even you know the members that we
already have they want to check out the
courses through here they could go to
courses you know and find out what other
courses there might be new or you
haven't actually taking it so you could
check it out through here you got a link
directly to the chatroom you got a link
directly to the channel the Settings
area will be changed to the resources
area
there won't be no settings for the site
um reason why I haven't changed it I'm
giving you guys the opportunity to
actually go in and change it yourself I
want you guys to be part of this I want
you guys to do a pull request and you
know commit to this project change the
documentation here this is coming
straight from my starter kit right I
want you guys to be part of this you
know a lot of times people tell me Joe
how can we you know as a community work
together how can we come in and you know
create one project well here you go
here's the website guys
this your website tool so it's like at
the same time you see something that's
wrong fix it Hey
go ahead you know I could go in there
and knock it out but at the same time is
like I think this is gonna be cool you
know and at the same time even if you
just came in here and change a little
wording right let's say you came in here
you changed some some of the wording
right you're gonna show up over here as
a contributor okay and not only is this
gonna show up here is gonna show up on
your github portfolio when you give up
profile we're pretty much you're gonna
be able to say hey I worked on this
project and yeah so I don't think I got
to show it to you guys
let me see yeah because I know a lot of
you guys don't know too much about
github but yeah so you can pretty much
pull pull the project okay download a
hey work from there
right do some changes and then
automatically as soon as you push your
changes I will look over your changes
and then say hey everything is fine he
this person did not put anything
malicious they didn't put a virus they
didn't put a freaking link to their
adsense they didn't put a link to
whatever right so if everything goes
good I'll accept it and then you show up
right here as somebody who is also a
contributor to coding phase comm new
home okay so yeah I just thought about
this you know you guys know me I'm very
spontaneous I like to come up with
things and ideas if something comes up
in my head on my weight this should be
something that people could do cuz I've
been teaching you guys all of this stuff
already a lot of you guys are very
comfortable with it even though I
haven't taught get yet on my site but a
lot of you guys already know this so why
not collaborate and at the same time get
you know get your kudos points you know
what I mean from being part of of this
rajat so you know I mean sometimes you
you gotta join a community man you know
so things could be good for you in and
you actually look like you're working
out here right all right so let's sing
hey Joe yo yo okay I'm reading
everybody's comments Jay guitar what up
son
yo shout-out to Jake man Jake definitely
helped out a lot on the descriptions
he's definitely gonna be part of the
coding face team for the learn of the
long term you know we we got a lot of
cool stuff coming up now I want him to
be part of and yeah so let me see who
was in here we got Jay guitar Mike Colby
flowers two kitties Freddy Martinez we
got Sasha stole Jack Big Joe CF site
doesn't work properly on mobile guys
that's what people are saying yeah and
that's why exactly why I'm leaving it
like that for this literally like a few
small things on the timeline that's not
a mobile-ready and I said hey let's
bring everybody in let's get this done
okay
let's finish it together and yeah Edgar
Martinez needs a favicon yes go ahead
I know Martinez a D man I want you guys
to be part of this man look if nobody
goes in fixes it or finds any bugs from
now til tomorrow 3:00 p.m.
I'm gonna fix it all right I'm gonna fix
me I'm gonna get everything done but I
just thought that it would be cool if we
all just came in fine whatever little
things that you say hey man there's a
misspelling here hey we could use
something else here
hey we could change this title to this
whatever it is guys it's there I will go
over whatever you push in there from
there I will merge it that's it
very simple very easy yeah hey Joe
downloaded the get look forward to
working on a love react let's see that's
the only time being or forever I need to
learn get up better side looks dope
using your using Erlang nice I'm using
nodejs
it's very simple I will see says when I
click on front end it asked at the pace
it will take you is that to complete all
the front-end courses yes and that's
another thing there's more stuff that I
need to add to the front-end courses to
the timeline I also need to have for the
backend in the timeline but like I said
I want to give you guys the opportunity
the guys that want to be part of this
and I want to go and then you know get
your kudos for being a contributor I
wanna give you guys the opportunity to
go in there into the changes and add
those things ok if nobody does it
tomorrow I'll do it by 3:00 p.m. by 3:00
p.m. everything should be fixed but I
want to give people the opportunity to
be part of it you know what I mean let
me see how can I perfect HTML this and
design skills you got a practice only
way to do it is to look at the design
and start building it section by section
start with the header and from they jump
to whatever section there is probably a
large image with a title and finish that
then jump to the body area and then
continue like down so you get to the
footer take it one time one piece at a
time ok let me see
so yeah
said go ahead definitely not
oh well let's see man I want to see what
people actually you know what I mean
let's see what people add to a I want to
see how people you know fix the small
bugs on the site there nothing crazy
it's literally just CSS stuff there's
really no problems with with the
JavaScript so a reality you don't have
to do anything JavaScript just CSS
things like mobile let's say check it
right now couple of things in mobile
that's pretty easy let's see of course
the sections is good it works let's say
life after okay everything works and the
course is the main thing that I see is
the timeline okay now you can definitely
fix that literally I don't know like two
minutes it's not that bad
that could get done like less than 10
minutes
let's see how how people actually softer
issues solve the problems you know is
right
coding phase at you gotta go to
github.com slash calling face a few dead
links wonder which ones send it to me to
my email coding phase at gmail.com guys
if you find any any new things that
maybe I missed send it to me yes the
homepage missing
click on news those haven't been added
and that's fine because I'm actually
setting that up with an API that's gonna
connect to hacker noon calm but let's
see maybe somebody else here can figure
it out how to connect to an API you know
there's like an extra project you know
for the people that are interested in it
you know I know a lot of you guys work a
lot of you guys do this and that you
know but there's people remember right
now we're about to go to sleep pretty
soon but somebody else is waking up at
this time right so while we sleeping
somebody's working when this video is
done automatically YouTube saves this
and then from there you know it's up to
them if they want to work on it you know
tomorrow when I wake up and I am
I'm gonna finish everything on the site
I'm gonna wait to see what everybody has
by 3:00 if nobody has anything then I'll
push my changes but for the desktop it
works fine most of the changes are
unresponsive making it responsive Jake
guitar is like yeah it's 2 p.m. in
Australia here yeah
see awp Nomad is like you know I woke up
45 minutes ago at 5:00 a.m. so look it's
like 6 o'clock over there where he's at
so for some people they're already up
man we about to go to sleep but some
people they're up in a little while a
couple of people are gonna be waking up
pretty soon and they're gonna jump on
this it's a great opportunity to become
a contributor it's a great opportunity
to add new changes and yeah Joe any book
you recommend on JavaScript um there's a
book I forgot sorry what was the email
coding face at gmail.com Harmon my pannu
says Joe any book you recommend on
JavaScript yeah I mean was it John
pocket JavaScript JavaScript dawn pocket
okay I think everybody has seen this
book there's two books you can get the
HTML CSS and ego JavaScript and jQuery
interactive front-end web development
first edition is literally like one of
the most beautiful books that you could
see anywhere that talks about JavaScript
or anything like it's just a beautiful
book and at the same time a very good
book and they explain
that you need to understand JavaScript
let me see this like so much stuff yeah
local storage good Oh local storage
yeah so it's not that bad yeah so I'm
looking at my emails right now yes the
biggest bug on the site is being
responsive which is the easiest thing
and that's why I left it there I want
you guys to try this out man I want you
guys to figure out how to pull right
download the project installed in your
computer all you have to do is do I am
with an NPM run watch and I'll run NPM
run server and you should be fine
of course you got a half note on your
computer okay or you could just say no
dot node server that Jes and that's it
and the project should be fine okay
matter of fact let me show it to the
peoples because I know some people
they're gonna be like wait well how do I
run this there's no documentation for
this okay very simple you're gonna first
of all you're gonna have two windows
open you're gonna have one that's gonna
see
MPM run watch or if you have yarn you
will say yarn run watch okay as a matter
of fact before that you say yarn stole
it so you could go after that yarn and
run watch a sedan from there that's
going to run it and your website is
going to be running on localhost 3000
okay but we're using you know react
router so you need to be running it on a
server so local 3000 is just a regular
server that gets spun up but if I try to
go to like I say Tom line is gonna give
me an error okay it's not set up for
that okay so that's why right here you
wanna also run this you wanna say node
server a Jes that's gonna run on port
5000 so you're gonna say local holes
5,000 time line and everything works as
if it was on Heroku calm which is the
host of the website okay so you pretty
much have access to the whole site and
think of it like this you have localhost
3000 that's like your local environment
and local holds 5,000 that's the
environment of dot-com think about it
like that
okay so let me get back to here
let's see who's online who's who's live
right now now for everybody who's
watching ism is gonna go to the website
you might see this on mobile guys it's
not that I mean 90 percent of the
website works completely fine on mobile
the only thing that's off is the
timeline and the homepage okay so if you
click on the menu and you go and check
out the courses and you check out all
the other links everything works
perfectly we given people the time to
come in and help and actually fix this I
want to see who's able to actually fix
it
it's not that hard it's pretty much the
CSS if you used CSS grids before from my
course then you should be really good
with CSS grids okay so now of course if
you see any other changes anything that
you say hey there's a bug send it to me
let me see
book called Cody face your logon John is
crazy
let me see yeah man those John docket
books they're the best ones to me
because they just break it down very
simple you know there's people that cool
say hey I have this other book that go
super deep into JavaScript ways like
listen what John docket did that's it
that's all you really need like
sometimes you don't need to go that deep
into JavaScript at all especially to get
a job yes Jay katar says for some reason
I'm still seeing the old site yes
so I just put this on how you call this
on my host yeah I just put this on her
oh cool calm and I just changed the DNS
through the domain and everything that's
gonna take a little bit time to go all
around the world that doesn't go like
that and honor me like it doesn't work
instantly sometimes I could take I don't
know an hour or two for some places and
also to make sure you're not cached make
sure you're not cached
so when you go to refresh hold the
refresh button cuz sometimes I could be
cached hey Joe when you click on of
course what are the red boxes at the
bottom the red boxes at the bottom are
going to be I had this idea of also
putting in like okay the first box I'm
gonna share it with you guys
I wanted to put here right I wanted to
put here on the trailer so this is where
the trainer of every course is going to
be okay and then the two red boxes here
what I'm adding is links to different
udemy courses that I think will
complement that course that I'm doing
okay I don't know I was thinking about
doing that because you know sometimes
people come to my website and they just
didn't want to sign up and that's fine
that's completely fine sometimes people
say hey I just want to look at the
timeline I want to be able to have a
checklist okay so that's completely fine
I want them to have a checklist you know
you come to my website you learn from me
if you want to I want to be able to give
people the option to say hey I like you
Joe but at the same time I also want to
get other courses so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to add other courses by
other people from you to me that I think
are really good like let's say my es6
course right somebody says hey Joe
I still feel like I want to take some
more es6 then on the website is gonna
have Stephen graders es6 course okay and
then on the side might also have what's
this guy's name traversing medias es6
course or you know etc right it could be
whoever it is right whoever I think has
a really good courses to it because like
I told you guys the website itself it's
not really like a place you know how
some people they swear is like this is a
place where Joe is gonna become a
millionaire and try to make money from
people nah the website is a resource you
use me as a resource if you want
if you don't want to use me as a
resource and you say hey man I want to
get another guide that speak like this
and he has charts and he has numbers and
he has whatever you want right I will
also add it there like okay cool go
ahead use me as a resource to find the
best content out there right and use the
website okay so I don't know you guys
tell me if the idea is good or if not we
could just add in those two red boxes
related courses so like let's say if
you're watching something English saying
let's say for example react right let's
say you was in the react course you
could go here to the react quick and
easy okay right here will show up
another to react projects that you can
also take okay so it will be like a
related to this course okay I don't know
it's up to you guys it's up to the
community to see what you guys think so
yeah
let me see I gotta send me an email Jake
you guys send me the email of your
account boy
so like that we'll see where CR was your
account why you can't log in or
something let me see hey Joe see what
else
Joe what's the next step after having
basic knowledge of JavaScript what's the
next step
that's why is there you DS l DS Peralta
go to my website you are on your
computer right now all right you come to
my website and this is why the timeline
is there okay you go to the website you
click on timeline see right here's the
third one that's timeline and you say
okay I just started your first step is
gonna be front-end development right so
you come here you say hey how many hours
per week an you devote a lot of people
can only devote you know you know maybe
22 hours per week so you click Next and
from there it tells you how long is
gonna take you to actually finish this
whole path okay for you you might say
hey I already know how to use a text
editor I already know HTML CSS I already
know how to make a website responsive I
already know some advanced CSS like CSS
greater flexibility really want to but
is very recommended okay so you can say
hey I already know the stuff
future-proof JavaScript okay you
hey this is what I know this the
beginning of JavaScript was my next step
your next step will be jQuery and
somebody here might be like oh man why
the hell you gonna learn jQuery this
isn't that guys jQuery is still leading
out there when it comes to front-end
frameworks or libraries whatever you
want to call them
right there's so many opportunities out
there for jQuery that is not even funny
and not only that that whatever you're
gonna go as a junior developer your job
is going to be dealing with legacy code
when a senior developer says hey man
somebody gotta change this jquery table
that somebody created five years ago who
you think is gonna do it it's not gonna
be him he's gonna pass that down to you
because you're the junior developer so
the least that you can know is jQuery
right that's where people's gonna test
you they're gonna be like least this
person can know is jQuery jQuery is like
is like the most basic JavaScript okay
so learn jQuery you could take that
course in like I don't know like it's
like a two-hour thing to three hour
thing you know a lot of you guys are
still beginning I don't even know how to
properly use Ajax jQuery teaches you
that okay you click complete then from
there you build a restaurant web app
which is a single page app nowadays
everything is not being done how it was
a year two years ago where people were
saying hey let's build a single page app
all the time it doesn't work like that
no more people are actually doing
server-side rendering they they'd rather
do it like that because it's less bugs
and actually more efficient but you
still need to learn how to work with
single page abs and how to make one
yourself because you're going to bump
into one of them it doesn't matter where
it could be on angular could be your
react that can be
you jes I could be on anything somebody
created an application a year ago two
years ago and then it was a whole
single-page app and now somebody has to
maintain it and you just got hired and
because you've never touched a single
page app now you're gonna have to spend
a whole week to understand how this
thing works so before you even get hired
how about you learn that right build the
restaurant web app understand how
single-page work okay from there you
complete that and as you can see it says
hey learn react - yes quick and easy so
watch a pace of you know 20 hours per
week which is let's say 22 hours per
week which becomes 22 divided by seven
let's say you have three hours per day
to actually work on your things
you can finish this course in two and a
half days so let's say two days you can
finish that course so it's about six
seven hours and you can learn react okay
so that's why the timeline is there
that's what the timeline is gonna be
essential so they're learning of a lot
of people and yeah that's what we added
it to the website you know what I mean
just try to make your life easier guys I
want you guys to be able to come in
use the website for what it is usually
as a resource learn continue learning
you know and yeah what else
yes this what is a some JavaScript
warnings guys JavaScript warnings are
not the end of the world
don't worry about it but yeah oh let's
see what else any
comments any of the messages answers
what questions that you want me to
answer yo what up camp let me see let me
see
starting : 3 months ago learn HTML CSS
for what else awesome project beginners
can really work on to level up huh man
I've gone over this stuff like a million
times you got to do some search you know
searches through my my youtube channel
there's like search five projects or
just search projects and you don't see
all of that there let me see wrecking
war coding phase bought your PHP
wearable course last week loving it so
far can wait to the final project thanks
for everything man yeah man I really
appreciate it I'm glad that you enjoying
it
listen everything that I have on the
website is stuff that you guys gonna be
able to use on your job on your web
application you're trying to build
whatever it is man make all this stuff
you take this knowledge and use it for
other languages there's a lot of stuff
man Jota you designed this in Photoshop
or just kind of made it on the fly just
kind of made on the fly I think some
people yeah watch me when I was like
building the site just like you know
just building it and it was just on the
fly everything those days on the fly
I'm a very spun it was a spontaneous
content I don't even know how to say the
word but yeah
I'm just like I think of something I'm
like okay cool let's run with it it's
like right now I was about to finish
this stuff up finish this couple of
little books that's on the site and I
say wait before I do that let's give it
the chance for people to actually come
in and fix it and become contributors
and at the same time get their practice
in with CSS grids and at the same time
get their practice in with github so
let's see who does who does it who
doesn't do it it's fine I'll fix it up
by tomorrow morning um thought some
graphic you out Joe it's like a gold
mine Allah I don't really I'm not I
don't know how to say this like I'm not
really deep into like all the new stuff
like especially with JavaScript like
there's a lot of stuff that I just don't
like or just don't have a lot of
knowledge of like graph QL I haven't
really looked at it
I took a a course from Steven Grider on
it you know to play around with it I
think somewhere last year and I was like
why would I use this when I could use
you know my sequel or I could use
MongoDB to me it didn't make sense you
know but that's the thing I'm more of a
practical person like if I don't see
myself working in a company that is
gonna use that then I don't go too deep
into it might look cool and stuff like
that but I just I'm I'm at some place
right now where I can't really spend
time learning too much things unless I'm
gonna get some money back out of it
because it just doesn't make sense
anymore
especially when you put in so much time
like I learned so much guys like I
learned angular I learned pretty I even
learned via J yes I hate PJs
I used freakin riot Jas I've done hyper
app I've done Elm I've done elixir I've
done Ruby on Rails I've done PHP I've
done job I've done Python I've done
every single thing that you could think
of Under the Sun I've done iOS Objective
C Swift like I've learned it twice you
know I mean Android Android was the only
thing that I at least liked like
developing for and it was boring to me
but I don't know it's like nowadays you
know there's a lot of cool stuff that's
coming out but it's like you can't just
really spend so much time on every
single thing that just pops up busy ran
I got to start tracking my hours yep
that's what I do man do you recommend
power into courses and getting familiar
with it Oh or is it something we should
take our time with I would definitely
say you know you're supposed to take
your time with it but I think the way
how all of my courses are set up and
start to bring it back to me is every
single course is built as a project
right so like let's say you take the
HTML CSS course and you build that page
you learn HTML CSS then from there the
next course that's there you're also
practicing now your HTML CSS but now
you're learning how to make things
responsive with css3 media queries all
right and then from there you jump into
something like sass now again you're
still using HTML CSS but now with sass
so it's like by the time we gel to gel
script you've already practice like four
or five projects
which is exactly what you need to
actually you know get your skills up
right the problem comes in when
sometimes you go and like let's say you
buy a course on udemy right you buy one
course and say the web developer
bootcamp which is an amazing course I
tell people to learn it
but the problem is when people just go
in they buy it only that course and then
they only do those projects and then
from there they jump into something I
hate now I'm ready to jump into reacting
it's like nobody like you haven't even
built anything yet in HTML CSS for you
to be jumping to JavaScript like don't
jump right into JavaScript unless you
already have a couple of projects in
there you got what I'm saying so that's
the the problem where people bump into
because they start learning all this
stuff and going over it as if it was
Netflix it's like you trying to binge
watch it and it's like it doesn't work
like that
you know everything that I do is like a
connection to something else right even
like the next syndrome I'm doing this
week which is rebuilding um rebuilding a
Craigslist application right it's like a
Craigslist clone but with HTML CSS
JavaScript using react as the framework
using react router as the as the routing
system and using no GS as the simple
back-end for the website okay so now
you're pretty much using all the things
that you already built before but now
you reinforcing it and that's why I tell
people it's a great place to sign up
because you pretty much is like you
follow if you follow the timeline how I
have everything set up by the time you
finish everything you're gonna be golden
okay now at the end of the timeline I'm
putting a section that says you have a
whole month right a whole month to go
and build your portfolio
over again meaning not only are you
gonna use the projects that we did for
our courses right I want you guys to
spend a whole month on building projects
that's separate completely different
projects right with everything that you
already learned because I see a lot of
people in their portfolios and they have
like little projects like you know color
pickers and a little BS like that like
that's not real projects you wanna have
on your portfolio that makes you look
like like a little kid that's like a
little kid coming to you and be like can
you hire me and he has like a you know a
freaking crayon around like a image like
you know how they give you a little
tracing paper and you're like could you
draw in here for you know for the low K
and the little kid goes outside of the
line that's what it looks like for you
guys to have things like that you know
color pickers are little API things that
connect to the Weather Channel or
whatever right like those things make
you look like a little kid you want to
look like you a grown man a grown woman
out here like already in the game right
so you need to give
you
now you gotta build your portfolio now
you gotta build your your projects that
are solid right any project that takes
you two days to do is not a legit
project okay like even this site right
this coding face side it has minor bugs
into it right but how long did that take
me to do and this site is very simple
all the things there it's been like a
week I've been working on right of
course I was saying though some days I
was saying so I was like really like
pushing you know hard to try to complete
it
I was just sick I was like sweating his
fever at the whole shebang right but
let's say how I did the design storm on
my website right that's a full project
that's a full PHP project that took
about I think like 8 to 12 hours to
build okay now if you take down your
divided by a week for one of you guys
who can only work on a three hours per
day that's like four days let's say four
or five days you know one day you work
in three hours one day you only do one
hour one day you do three hours I know
that you do four hours let's say it took
your whole week that's a solid project
something that took you two days a
meaning like two-three hours to build
that's not a project you want to show
people all right so say yeah me let me
see what else who else is in here
oh man I'm sorry guys I'm still sick man
grats on a new project the website thank
you thank you now
that's why 2 d-m d-m he says congrats
but what happens to your subscribers on
your teachable your new website is
charging again just asking nope that's
why there's a link there that says
members area if you are a member you
just go to your members area ok your
members area is gonna take you right
back to that section of your teachable
ok this is the website right you come
right here you land here
new videos gonna show up here you click
here is gonna take you directly to the
YouTube video any new courses that's
gonna pop up right here and the news is
gonna pop up right here I'm opening this
John your scholarship pretty soon so
yeah so as a new member right basically
you click on courses have all the
courses right there right now let's say
if you are a member already to the
website there's a thing that says
members area like I know I'm gonna have
to retrain a lot of you guys I know some
people yeah forget this type of things
and y'all need like a little training I
might do like a video like completely
once this thing is completely changed
maybe tomorrow I'll do this is create a
video explaining everything like every
single section for everybody so you
don't be lost because I know you was
your name d-m d-m is already lost he's
at y'all Congrats
but what happens to your subscribers on
teachable your news website is charging
people again just asking now he didn't
sound like that but I need it to be
dramatic alright so as you can see guys
there's a thing that says members area
if you are a member you click on members
area that will take you directly to your
enrolled courses on teachable calm okay
now if you come here and you will say
hey I'm clicking on let's say I haven't
bought or I don't even have access to
the SAS like a pro alright you click on
there is they're all cool if I want to
buy I could click buy if I'm already a
member is that subscribe for unlimited
courses I could just click there you see
that's for the subscription you already
a member to it so it's gonna show you
all of the courses already because you
remembered to it you're already part of
it you get what I'm saying so there's
like I know I definitely gonna have to
do like a little training and just show
it to people you know what I mean it's
something new is a little the layouts a
bit different than what you used to you
know from what you've been seeing and
it's there for a reason
right at the same time you have the same
links here so you have my courses is
gonna take you to the members area which
is your courses okay all courses is
gonna take you to the all courses pages
okay same thing again if you click on
timeline it's gonna take you to the
timeline page okay but in your time
it shows you your courses right now by
tomorrow afternoon all of the courses
are going to be added to the timeline so
right now is literally just give it a
few hours although the courses gonna be
added there because if you click a full
stack and you come here
you see nothing happens there's nothing
there the only one that's showing up
right now is just the front end okay and
that's because the full stack kind of
messed it up so yeah so there might be
some bugs there guys
but for everything that you need just
like I said this is something you know
you guys know me I'm very spontaneous I
come in I get an idea I say you know
what I can come in and fix this and
spent all night on it or it gives people
the opportunity to come in and give it a
try and give it a go try to fix it right
change the CSS change the background
color hey change the color of the fonts
change the font you know so we given
people opportunity to come in and change
themselves through get up okay now by
tomorrow everything's gonna be a-okay
all the bugs should be killed
we're gonna hit them with the raid
killing them gonna be out here with the
chopper chopping up chopping up the bugs
umm but yeah so it's gotta be fun you
know just get used to the idea of
clicking where it says members area if
you're a member you remember like if
your mobile just click on members area
that's all you have to do click on
members area
I don't know how more do do we have to
click like change instead of members
area should I just change it to like if
you remember click this should I change
it I'm joking
look man I don't know sometimes it's
crazy you know as a developer I'm so
used to like things that I would think
like oh this is people will get it like
that but then you got to think about it
the users who are the users even though
you guys are developers to be a lot of
you guys are still having gotten used to
how a lot of things work so you might
see something like wait this doesn't
look like what I used to see before it
all got stroke you know what I mean so
but don't stress out things are gonna be
fine is a new layout new flow but
everything's gonna be there all you have
to do is click on the members area guys
it's a thing with a little house in that
in that little house we all live right
there all other members is in there like
that
you know we in there like y'all members
area on the little house okay so yeah
man so I'm sorry I'm sorry if I'm a
character guys I don't know why I have
to be like so visual when I want to
explain something why I can't just stay
still you get what I'm saying like why
can't just stay still and explain sign
well I gotta do all this extra stuff man
somebody right now yeah it's teachers
teacher was updated too
but yeah
you should throw up model notifications
tell people go to your teachable sites
regular expressions maybe Pathfinder
wouldn't drop like an hour trying to
learn what right in the middle
motivational talk other z-j guitar Joe
I'm right here man I've been here let me
see like the new sign well done things
you'll appreciate in deaf reply a good
tip with the project can you make a
ecommerce front-end and react yes of
course Joe when I get a job can I send
you a testimonial yes sir send it to me
yes ecommerce website with react will be
great
wait Joe you have a repo in this yes
there's a repo go to coding phase calm
we're not coding face.com go to
github.com you go to github.com go
github.com slash coding face not be OT
CEO m so it's like you can't put the dot
so what i did was i try to be clever and
say coding face.com so right there you
will see where it says new home and
already we already got three people
forking it ok so yeah so three people
already for the shout of this i don't
know who forty who forking out here guys
stop working it so hard man don't fork
it so hard man put some spit on that you
know don't forget to hot sorry guys the
worst place taken whenever you see fork
like it's not right
alright yeah so you go to there you
click on new home and here's a project
here you go change the readme if you
want change whatever you think should be
changed if you want give your boy a star
why not and yeah
anything that you can fix fix it you
know push your changes
I will merge it and voila you will show
up as a contributor you know what I mean
so it's like you know we're Andy and
when did you shave your head we shaved
my hand man where you took the Netflix
tutorial and the other day was able to
back my first client all right Alexis I
see you ma you out here
West Coast in it still doing your thing
out here that's what's up let me see
thank you thank you thank you when I get
pay me for my fast-food job why of
course you have the best teaching style
listen man
take advantage man ten bucks ten bucks
man listen and trust me the stuff that
you seen on YouTube sucks to be honest
with you compared to all the things that
I've been doing on the website is legit
people can vouch for that man like we
coming out with like very legit things
that it just helps people out it's like
I wish somebody was like teaching this
like how I'm teaching you know it's just
like projects with projects projects
that relate to other projects that help
you you know get better in whatever you
will learn him before you know so that's
how it is what are the Ben
of coating entire site when you have a
platform like WordPress like why will
you code a shopping cart over using
WooCommerce
well WordPress is like I don't know you
could almost compare it to something
like square space or Shopify like you
could go in there and add plugins at
this and that but you don't have full
control of it okay like you're always
going to be fighting against that code
because it's not really your code you're
basically following something that
somebody created ten years ago all right
so when you're doing stuff and you're
saying hey I'm gonna build a website for
a client
especially from scratch you're gonna you
gotta always be like yo let's just build
a Maribelle let's building in Ruby on
Rails this building nodejs this building
you know something that is already
programmed right and something that you
have control of the whole codebase you
don't want to be using somebody else's
code like it's cool in the beginning but
as you become more experienced as like
you don't want to do it and that's what
happens so those are uh you know those
are the good things about it
skeleton what
Suns been a minute heat and I'm sweating
your boy I swear somebody tell wifey
turn off the heat ma
yo that should be your song somebody
tell wifey let me hit him with the why
keV why clever John somebody down why me
turn off the heat MA somebody tell wifey
turn off the heat ma you killing me yo
I'm a character sign like yo will you or
do you already have a bull strapped for
course listen with everything that I'm
already teaching you don't even need
bullshit how things are now like you
don't need blue strap at all trust me
especially with everything that you know
you learn in advanced CSS which is flex
boxes and CSS grids I mean if you want
to learn it you can learn it but it's
just not needed anymore plus I always
for me I always thought that bootstrap
is like once you know CSS like you use
bootstrap for the grid but now since
they're CSS grid like you don't need it
now there's gonna be times where you
might see bootstrap here and there but
it's like you don't need training for it
because all you have to do is read the
classes and read what the properties it
has that's it somebody tell wifey
somebody tell wifey somebody tell wifey
turn up the heat mom you're killing your
boy out here
sweating up my eyes and somebody called
up wifey and I turn off the heat yeah

night I was watching this documentary
about
Australia like this badass hog this
badass family in Australia who who were
like selling heroin like to like people

you know Alan cuz he is he drunk nah man
I'm burning up I'm sweating I'm I'm
tired I'm just like I'm trying to keep
myself up because I wanted to keep this
live stream until 12 a.m. so I was like

drunk right now nah man it's just we
just having fun right now but yeah so
let me see we're watching the stream for
real Joe why are you using develop
memory AK instead of production why
because we just put it up live nobody's
really you know it's for people to go in
there and change it doesn't really
matter you know that's why it's not
really a big deal it's not blood is not
a hundred percent complete I waiting on
to see what our people are adding to it
and then from there I'm gonna you know
put the last final icing on the cake but
at the same time there's no information
on the site like you know any passwords
any database connecting to anything
there's no API key so it really doesn't
matter what's a good laptops to start
off I mean you could start with a
Windows computer and just put in our
Linux you know you can find really good
ones for like two hundred three hundred
dollars no matter if I like four hundred
dollars anything that you see for three
hundred dollars don't buy I remember I
never forget this we put my sister or
Windows 8 computer like a few years ago
and that computer was so garbage from we
bought it from Best Buy
man they're like oh yeah for 300 bucks
you could do everything that you want is
like you know we took that shit to the
house that shit caught a virus the name
the next thing and she had a virus
already that's the thing that's why I
don't mess with Windows
it's like I haven't had a good you know
experience since young like windows have
always been pieces of shit no matter how
you look at it and you know but if you
can't stole Linux on anything you're
gonna be fine word a factory virus like
soon as yeah some shit that that
computer already came with sign you know
what I mean yeah freakin Windows 8 was
the virus word not for real man that was
funny man a factory virus man that shit
came with the system yeah you guys
remember when they they used to have to
McAfee you know I was watching this
thing about the the guy who created
McAfee and he was talking about like
people only he's like you know people
don't even know that when they install
McAfee we installed the virus inside of
the computer to make sure like you know
to be like oh hey we caught something
it's like he already had the virus in it
like that's crazy man
but yeah man coding
Apple or Linux what this drove factory
right word damn freaking hot but yeah
man guys go check out the website if you
wanna fix it up you want to contribute
to it go ahead there's literally just a
few bugs within like CSS great if you
want to go in there try to fix it if now
it's fine by tomorrow morning should be
all done alright send me anything that
you want to merge go ahead add it and
