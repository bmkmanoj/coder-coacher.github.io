do you hear your boy now you know I
apologize man I keep forgetting that
once I disconnect my laptop from the
screen I need to actually connect it but
we laugh man we here we live man I just
wanted to share this moment with you
guys you guys are definitely a part of
this moment for me and yeah I just
wanted to share this with you guys man
we here live coding phase comm live
again let me just let me make sure I
could hear myself can y'all hear me yeah
man and yeah we're here man we laugh not
yeah no I just wanted to share this with
with the peoples so yeah like I said
before your boy Chris hooks gave you a
boy or I'll mention and it feels good
man like for those of you guys that
don't know yeah your boy Chris Hawks
gave your boy a little shout out you
know like it feels good it definitely
feels good for one main reason guys like
you know when I first came in this thing
I was you know a hundred subscribers in
and I was like man I'm gonna hit up
Chris wholesome what do a collab
everything's not me sweet and I didn't
really take into account that people are
busy like there's a certain point that
you're like man you're you're doing
videos your doors serious you have a
family you have so many things man going
on you might have problems in your
personal life you might good day Stan I
was like man I just feel like yeah you
know this guy he's my motivation
you know like Chris was just like you
know I'm busy right now
and I took it to a fence you know I was
like man like - like
young minded you know what I mean like
so young mind in the game of like
YouTube and and just in life in general
you know sometimes you get so so amped
about SIA and when things don't happen
you get mad
right and that's under type of person
that you know I get pissed off I have a
temper when it comes to certain things
and if I feel disrespected I feel
certain way or what I think should be a
certain way like I get pissed off right
and you know I told the Bhakra salt and
all right oh man he's such an a-hole
because he didn't wanted to collab with
me this isn't that and there's like
broke people are busy you know what I
mean like now looking back at it and you
know the fact that you know almost
10,000 subscribers later you know he
gave me a little shoutout is now that
Joe wants to get a collaboration with
Chris Hawkes to get the subscribers up
like I could care less about that but to
me it was important because Chris Hawkes
was my motivation for creating this
channel when I created this channel me I
don't know like a year before I even
mean my first video was because of Chris
Holt's and I was like watching him for a
while I remember him took out my react
and I was like doing angular I was like
man why should I switch to react and
listen and listening to him made me want
to do it and I was like okay cool I'm
gonna try it out and I love react and I
was like oh man like Chris who you know
Chris Holmes was right you know what I
mean I look back on it now you know what
I mean but it really felt good today get
getting a little shout out good because
that's like my granny you know what I
mean like I'm not here for you know to
make millions I'm not here to you know
waste my life away in front of a
computer
I'm not here for any of them here to
help people out and at the same time I
was also here to be like hey man at some
point I'm gonna be working so hard and
doing so much work that even Chris
Hawkes is gonna have to be my girl I see
you kid
I see you little n-word you know fill
that in for my for my people in the hood
I see you Lord you know what I mean like
hey man I mess with him and I really do
I really do love his channel you know
and I love the n-word I love it
somewhere in the Internet's like oh my
god you can't say that work I'm not
gonna say it but I do love it yeah cuz
for my peoples yeah but uh like I was
saying man
Chris hogs is the man and you know he he
just said a lot of good points there he
was like man I can't really be doing
collaborations like that it's like I
would like to but the same time I was
like I'm shy I don't you know I'm not
really comfortable like that with
certain situations I might come in and
say the wrong thing it's like right now
I'm live I'm trying to I'm just talking
to you guys as my friends somebody might
take that little snip and be like he
said Edward he likes that word like I
say my career's gone I can't even work
at a company or anything but um that's
how the internet works nowadays right so
you do stuff live that you might regret
later
me personally I don't care um because I
know what I do and no matter what I'm
still gonna get hired
plus it's like we listen to music that's
us and the word and you're in the hood
that says Edward whatever let's move on
but yeah man if is the feels good man to
get that shout out you know it's like
when I first started this thing guys I
don't fit in with what developers I
don't even programmers or any of these
guys like you know I wasn't one of those
guys in a basement playing Dungeons and
Dragons I wasn't one of those guys you
know on Facebook playing Yahtzee I
wasn't one of those guys that you know
you freaking see them on the lunchroom
table playing pokemon cards and you yo
nah I was in the back chillin
you know box of play ball you should
play
a squirrel with two couple of dots you
know what I mean like that was me me and
my boys we chillin you know reckless in
school like that was me I wasn't one of
those kids you know going to the math
team I wasn't one of you know like
that's not my background my background
was the streets like to be honest with
you like that's what I'm comfortable
with
right so I'm not a typical developer
yeah I'm not a programmer so seeing him
he's not a typical program or acceptable
developer at all like if you listen to
him you could tell like the type of
person he is he's not like what most
developers and programmers are like he's
he's a glitch in the matrix which that's
how I felt my whole time as a developer
I'm like man I'm doing this because I
love to code but I know certain people
that they look at me crazy like this K
yeah I don't know how he's here I don't
know how he does this I don't know how
whatever X Y Z right you know somebody
sent me a comment and it was like man
you too you too ghetto foot is this and
that is like he's like hey now wannabe
rappers are developers and it's like bro
like you're from a middle of America
small town where everybody's name is
Billy and every girl's name is is
Britney like we're not from the same
place man
you know what I mean like that's your
town like the way how speak you know
it's like the guy who sent um I feel bad
for him he's like from Poland he's like
man how can I get that black accent man
is like I'm moving to America I would
like to get you know get comfortable and
be you know get the black accent it's
like bro this isn't a black accent this
is well from this way I'm from you know
I'm feeling neighborhood that this how
we speak you know I mean I'm from New
York kid you know what I mean so that's
just how it is and why get from Cornell
for Chris Hawkes is just he's not the
typical
developer he's not like this regular
dude you know who it's just like you I
was like watching Star Trek like now
he's not doing that stuff like he's you
know he got into this because he wanted
to create a website for his favorite bag
like and just create a website for bands
like you know it's like that's not
usually doesn't know why some some some
people get into this stuff then I came
in how can we create you know an
algorithm to make things faster than
what is already fast like I'm not one of
those guys you know what I mean so I
don't relate to those guys no and when I
was coming into this I was like man this
you know this guy's like fun fun
functional those guys like I was a the
co training where you look at them and
like man this guy's they really really
know their stuff but I don't relate to
them I look at the channel and I'm like
I can't watch this for more than two
minutes you know it's not because
they're not giving good content it's
just uh I'm the type of person I gotta
relate to somebody you know I was like
even I bring to bring this back to music
I'm the type of person like I don't even
care about like let's say if I'm
listening to a rapper I don't even care
about that much about the music if I can
relate to what that person is saying I
like uh if I could see like their
visuals it's something that reminds me
of like my neighborhood things that I've
gone through then I like right if I
can't relate to you I can't watch you
every single day I can't come in it you
know it's like this is one of the
problems with I think with you know a
lotta toriel website not websites but a
channels is just people come in and they
use your videos as that's a library
right hey I want to learn angular today
let me go to this channel to learn
angular then from there they leave never
come back a year later oh I wanted to
find out how to do something with or
react oh you have a react video okay
coming and watching a year later right
they have thousands hundreds of
thousands of subscribers and it's like
you can't really relate because you
don't know who the person is you don't
know what they do what you know what I
mean it's like you don't check for them
every single day you can't come in and
check somebody's channel every single
day if all they do is just code you know
it's like when I listen to Chris whole
channel is like I could listen to that
as a podcast this times I just put it in
a playlist and what I'm driving like an
hour two hours I just watched a whole
bunch of videos for him just listening
to what he says because even though it
might be a topic that I don't like might
be something like you know like Django
I'm not a huge fan of Django but in
those conversations he has things that
he brings up that are you know gems and
nuggets write things down be like oh
shoot like he's right about this and
like I could implement this to my
library I can implement this - no
Jessica implement this to Ruby on Rails
so you know what I mean so it's like for
me to like somebody I have to actually
be able to listen to them constantly you
know I mean like or have like some type
of they have to have some type of
history or background back her relate to
them you know what I mean that's the
only way besides that I can't I can't
really watch the channel every single
day but like maybe days are coming in
and I'm like ah man Chris didn't drop a
video this sucks
like there goes my night you know what I
mean like he he's not dropping on it
it's boring cuz there's really nobody
else who I really wanna watch out here
you know sometimes I watch Chris chard
to see how his life is hopefully you
know I mean man let's check out
Christian see how his life is you know
that he get back with midori they you
know like I feel like you know it's like
a soap opera for me you know I mean I
got I love his channel I love to see him
doing good I like to see his positivity
I want to see what when you can
year he got because everything is always
looking better every time I go in there
right that's why I go there I go to the
real cast Darrow because real cast
iris-chan was just quick stuff is like
you know straight to the point giving
you knowit's and like life experience
and stuff that he's been going through
but quick right so I enjoy that I like
the real tough candy because I go to her
and she'll just flip something a topic
and just make it funny for me I'm like
yo I gotta check her out you know what I
mean but besides that and those are all
the people that I named you those are
people who are just regular people no I
mean like they're not here like trying
to act like super smart and trying to
act like this and that like they all
have a back right let me so that's like
their dad and so today is I forgot my
famiiy hey Mike I got a little Grammy so

so you know I mean so yeah man we in
here we live man now everybody who's in
here man come on be nice this is a
family channel
stop stop going at each other just chill
where it's the internet man it's the
Internet
yeah you definitely gotta be careful
I'll hear what you say that's why I
don't curse I mean I do curse but our
curse in my own time
you know with my own friends my own
peoples I say I don't really do anything
crazy on YouTube like that no more
especially because you know people just
hate man you know ten years from now who
knows where I'll be you know I'll be
working at a freakin Microsoft or Google
or something and somebody comes saying
but oh this person said this in 2017 and
this isn't that and they'll copy and
paste you know freaking videos together
to try to make me look bad like that's
just how the world is now so you know
Chris Hawkes was talking about that so
like during live videos can be dangerous
because live videos is like keep talking
to your friends and peoples but at the
same time not really because this thing
gets saved as there's videos so people
could later on you could come in and
download your videos you know what I
mean and I just like hate your whole
life from you know and I've been I've
been done the whole corporate thing man
that's why I'm not there no more man I
left that alone I'm not planning on
doing that that was does this good video
this guy
search I'm leaving the u.s. on YouTube
I'm leaving the US and it's a video let
me see if I find it I'm gonna tell you
guys even the US and it's by Charlotte
Aires
I'm gonna show it to you guys
you guys are up right now after I do my
live video I'm about to end there pretty
soon
watch this video why I'm leaving the
u.s. part 1 and watched the whole series
each videos like 10 minutes and it's
funny that he calls that I'm leaving the
matrix because that's what I've been
calling it for it for years you know
working in companies is like working in
the matrix it's like when you disconnect
you like Keanu Reeves II like use like
you finally got your first breath like
you can finally breathe well you finally
be yourself own and not be put into this
little box you know what I mean like I
tell you guys all the time and that's
why in my my course sorry for plugging
it but in my course where I talk about I
know how to code now what I talk about
an exit plan because people need to have
a exit plan you know you you can't live
your life working for somebody else
especially a corporate company where
you're just a number you know 10 15
years like if you live your life a
certain way and put everything in there
I'm gonna oh man I gotta buy a car I
gotta buy a house I gotta buy all this
stuff you're just putting yourself more
in debt more in debt to keep yourself
having to work for a corporate company
and like you're always in the system but
nobody told you that that's how life is
supposed to be you know you don't have
to do those things you do it because you
want and because people tell you oh you
have to have a fancy car you have to
have a you know a freaking big house and
this and I like you don't have to I
don't know you don't have to do a lot of
things so me myself I feel like I'm
lucky I'm turning 29 right now and I
figured that out a while back but now
it's the time that I finally got to get
out you know it's like at the same time
it's like you're feels good man
I'll be honest it feels good like I'm
not
not living under anybody's thing like
I'll make my own money and I make my own
decisions on how to do things like I
don't have to be under somebody else
yeah now that's that's my dream I always
wanted supposed to tie that man but now
with a family who knows if that's ever
gonna happen you know but that was my
dream you know move over there and were
like ten fifteen thousand dollars a year
you live uncomfortable you know
