so I want you guys to really really just
come to my channel man go to youtube.com
go to youtube com right / holding phase
man just go there right now right go

would react crystal camel and yarn
tutorial right you're going to click
that and you're going to play all you
ready knock you want here it is your job
guys listen you have to take this
tutorial I'm gonna continue making
tutorials and videos every single date
for the next probably the next month you
know explain to you guys how to become a
web developer how to become a full stack
what developer learning how to deal with
the database lesson learning how to deal
with react you're gonna see this is
gonna be a long term series there's not
gonna be you know six seven episodes off
you know little videos and let's say
we're done guys no we're going from 0 to
like probably 80 videos because I'm
gonna teach you guys every day now
what's cool about this is that I'm
teaching it to you guys in a way that
you go understand meaning I'm not gonna
give you know big words I'm not going to
give you know side you know explanations
of things it's just more of like hey you
want to build a website this is what
happens this is what you gotta do to
become a full stack web developer you
know how to do it you know how come in
here and show you guys love it and
create something that anybody could
learn that's what I do that's why I
created this channel now I created this
rocky stack because this is gonna be the
future guys like I I'm getting tired of
repeating it but if you ask anybody
before that's how you know no Jas came
out and look where no Jas is that right
now elixir is super popular left right
all those guys that started working on
those stacks in the beginning the very
beginning right now they make it a lot
of money because now they are experts
you know yeah you could become an expert
in nodejs but hey there's a million
nodes es experts or PHP expert there's
already a million of those guys you know
now the wawa wes is pretty much
crystalling golang like those are the
language is that right now if you know
what the hell you're doing you're gonna
get paid the big bucks and then not only
that that you're gonna know so much
about you know the web servers me you
know being a web developer and dealing
with databases and dealing with HTTP
requests and creating api's and creating
components for react that when you want
to jump into any other stack it's easy
because now you understand it in a
higher level meaning in like you know
dummy talk that's how i calling you know
basically that's how i like to teach it
to you guys because now because you guys
is not smart enough it's just sometimes
when your brand new developer you don't
want to hear all these big words you
don't want somebody taking ten minutes
to explain one thing you're like how do
I build a website what is it that I
gotta do how long did I gotta create
this mess how is it God wanna create
this database those are the things that
you care about right and then of course
you know later on if you decide to go
more in depth into it that's why I got
the tutorials that are here you know
courses that I say hey you take those
courses you're gonna learn a lot from it
right but for now guys this is free i'm
doing this out of my own free time i'm
giving you guys my all like a hundred
percent like I'm giving everything into
this did because I believe so much in
crystal Ling and I believe that you know
like I was telling us you learn one
language you learn them all once you
understand one language you understand
them or and if you guys have looked
online if you search what's the easiest
programming language out there it's
literally Ruby right now the reason why
people walked away from ruby is not
because it's bad it's a bad line
it is because it's smoke now imagine
this a language Tessa's fastest scene
right but with the syntax of Ruby the
same tax means the way how is red
basically is written almost exactly like
Ruby which means is super easy right so
now you're working with a very powerful
language but with something super easy
like come on guys there's like once in a
lifetime opportunity I'm telling you
guys like I see it that's why I jumped
on it so quick I say you know what I was
gonna do a lot of larval tutorials I was
going to do a lot of kno jes tutorials
and as you can see in my channel i
started making a couple of them but then
i realized on my cake what am I gonna do
compete with guys who have been doing
this for you know ten years freaking 15
years or even more or start somewhere
where is a brand new language and a
branding community where you could
actually make it different it's like
right now guys like I got five star city
right some people not say oh that's
nothing right but they look at everybody
else they start getting 1500 likes you
know 50 or 7,000 or stars like it's
gonna keep growing and then I'm pretty
much part of the pioneers of this
language you know what I mean so I want
you guys to be part of this because I'm
telling you in the long term is gonna be
like hey I know you know crystal leg and
that's gonna mean something even right
now even if we just know crystal name
you pretty much go say hey I know Ruby
because it's the same language pretty
much you know so everything they were
doing and crystal and most likely do it
aerobie so it's like urine is not like
you're wasting time you know plus i'm
teaching it in a way where you could
jump and just you know pick up any other
language after that like you could ask
anybody once you know learn language you
know them all so
come on guys take this journey with me
man gotu Kola face calm or go here to
coding face youtube / coding face right
come here guys click on Cleo that's what
you have to do it if you really know if
you want to watch the whole series guys
I'm gonna add two more videos today but
God trust me man take this with me you
guys are not gonna regret it I'm telling
you ahead of time this is a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to just
be part of something from the ground up
I think this thing was gonna blow up now
people were telling me about this you
know a few years ago they were telling
me about elixir I was like ah I don't
believe in the elixir I even made a
video about how lik sir is pretty much
 and a reality now elixir is popping
is doing pretty well it's not a language
that I prefer well it's doing pretty
well and this is a lot of jobs pumping
up now so I'm like you know what they
shut me up and what did i do from that I
learned from that I say you know what me
you know what it's time to step it up
and get my get my game up Brina you know
so I jumped on crystal leg and this is
where we at man we trending on it
there's the future guys trust me all
right i'll see you guys in a little bit
