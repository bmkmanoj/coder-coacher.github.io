doing this calling face.com all right
guys I'm gonna teach you about you know
a little bit about arrays something
simple which are just a list man so
let's say an example you want to create
an array an array is basically brackets
right so there's two brackets and inside
of it its properties so like I say I
wanted to say car car store whatever
folks you call also have inside of it
you know numbers
bullying's you could even have a
function so like let's say name all
right now or variable that could just be
a variable right there so let's say an
example VAR list equals this list which
is an array so now while we check what's
inside of the variable list we checked
let's see what's inside of it now we
have this name is blank because it
hasn't been created yet so like let's
say if it was a function function name
return write run that you see just say
name is actually a function all right so
how do we access this properties that
are inside of well and all right right
very simple we basically say list and
then we say brackets
and then inside of it we put a number
basically the number of where it's
actually placed the index number right
so you say you start with zero so you
say 0 1 2 3 2 3 4 5 yeah so basically
you start with 0 1 2 3 4 5
all right guys let's say I wanted to
print the third one so the third one
remember that I started with 0 so 0 1 2
so to print this I would say hey see I
got both
let's 2 equals both so let's say also if
I wanted to change this to false I would
say 0 1 2 3 4 so I would say list
property for change to false
now they got changed now let's say I
wanted to see what's inside of the list
now see car store bought to false so now
what we did was we changed the original
list that we had and then now because I
changed this property for to false it
got changed
so now down the road it has become now
false right it's that simple
I mean what more is there to teach about
arrays it just lists remember that you
basically created by creating a variable
so you save our car names then you say
ok put that list BMW
Ben's right now aside of it you have car
names you got BMW Honda and Benz C
pretty much it
alright guys make sure you subscribe and
make sure you check out all my videos
and keep learning from me man trust me
you're gonna see a lot of stuff coming
you know pretty soon so make sure you
subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
