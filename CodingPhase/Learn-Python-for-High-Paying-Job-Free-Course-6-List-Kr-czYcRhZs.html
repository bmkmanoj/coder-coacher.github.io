about lists so list if you're coming
from JavaScript or any other programming
language usually they call it a race
okay
in Python they just call it a list which
in reality and arrays just a list of
items okay so it makes sense all right
so we're gonna say and here I'm just
gonna put in a comment just to let you
guys know we working on lists okay so
now what we're gonna do is we're gonna
create a variable and when I say my list
okay
and we're gonna come here and say my
list and then we're gonna say brackets
and then inside of here we're gonna put
in a well the letter A then we gonna say
letter B letter C
letter D okay and the letter e alright
now if we gonna come here we're gonna
print this out we're gonna say print my
list okay we run that and do it one time
and as you can see that's our list okay
now let's say I wanted to get access to
let let us see okay we kind of went over
this before
when we're talking about strings but now
you're gonna see you more in action with
an A List okay so we're gonna come here
and use indexes so let's say I wanted to
get the letter C all right now remember
we have to count the indexes we could
say hey it starts with zero so we say 0
1 2 so if we come here and we say square
brackets and we put the number 2 when we
print it it gives us the letter C all
right now if I come here I wanted to get
the letter e so we are 2 3 4 so now I
could come here and say for all right
gotta give me the letter now if I want
to say I want to start from the end I
could literally come here and say
negative 1 okay and that will also give
me e if I wanted to get C I could say
negative 1 negative 2 negative 3 and
then that will give me
the letter C okay we also seen this
before where we say let's say tool and
then : and that basically returns us see
the e alright now if I wanted to get a
CD I can say 2 8 4 and that will return
back CD all right so now let's say I
wanted to change the letter C for the
number of 55 how would I do that
this is actually pretty easy I could
come here and say something like this
like my list and then I will put in the
index so it's 2 and I will say so 2 is
equal to 55 and then now when I come
here and I print out my list you're
gonna see what happens
so you see a b55 so we pretty much
changed whatever was inside of that
index of two we changed it to 55 we
could do the same thing here let me copy
this again and then I mean change let's
say four I'm gonna change for for 100
okay come here run that as you can see
it says a be 50 50 100 now I want to
make sure that you guys understand that
we can put any type of data type inside
of a list we can even put a list inside
of a list so we could come here and say
okay cool we have this is the list and
then inside of it we're gonna put in
another list so we put in another
bracket and we're gonna say something
like 34 50 say well 5476 and 9 all right
and when we run this you can see that is
a be 55 the 134 5476
and 9 but as you can see that's actually
a list inside of the list now how can we
access that right so now this is like
multi-dimensional list and it's like a
race inside of a race listings out of a
list how can we get access to that well
very simple we could say hey I want to
get access to this list so we know that
of basically that e is the fourth index
and we basically say hey I want to get
access to the the fifth one so I'm gonna
say like that five we take this copy
pasted here and when we run this
sometimes this thing be going slow so
okay so thirty four fifty four seventy
six and nine all right so now let's say
I wanted to get access to the number 76
how would I do this then I will come
here and put it in another bracket right
and then I will say hey I'm using the my
list list okay and then I'm using the
index five which is this and then inside
of that index I want to use the number
76 so we say 0 1 2 so then I will put
here - ok print that out and it says 76
what happens if we go in and we have
another list inside of a list we do the
same thing so if I come here and I say
instead of 9 I'm gonna put in another
list all right I'm gonna say something
like 5622 + 77 if I wanted to get access
to this third well this fourth list
that's inside alright we could come here
and say like this 3 right let me print
that out
okay when you see 56 2277
so if I wanted to just guess 77 I will
have to come here and putting another
brackets and say give me the second
index so 0 1 2 for some reason a lot of
people have issues with multi multiple
dimension lists and you know
multi-dimensional arrays etc right you
can call it whatever you want um but
it's very simple okay let's break it
down one more time just because I know
people usually have issues with this so
this is the list okay this is the first
list all right so we're saying 0 1 2 3 4
5 so now we wanted to access that other
list that's inside of it so that's why
we got the fifth index okay and then
inside of this fifth index there's a
list and we wanted to get the third list
which with the third index inside of it
which it was holding a list so we say
okay so this is here right and now we
call me say 0 1 2 and then 3 which is
this list here and then that's why we
say the third right and then now we
wanted to get access to 77 so we say 0 1
2 so to get access to 77 that's why we
added the 2 all right so I'm just
breaking it down for the people that
sometimes they get lost in this all
right so just to make it simple for you
guys and remember this you can put any
type of data type inside of a list all
right so I'm gonna see you guys later
