do so we gotta split this thing up into
sections all right so let's keep
breaking this thing up let's duel
div class card header and then you got
an image we got title and then low
location and you know one hour all right
so we got like three four sections now
we got it all right so on the car head
every minute or div class this class
image
alright let me see if I don't know and
then we got how long it was it was like
one hour all right now let's put this
thing glasses on it so let's see class
class time alright so right now it looks
like that looks like but if we come
in here and we say hey okay card header
car header right and then we say profile
image info it's a play online block
split in my block and we have another
one which is time let's play in my block
all right now after we have that just
clean this up display:inline-block what
else we got it though okay we got one
two three
okay let me see what else can I go to
this date
okay the image we're gonna leave it for
last profile info class name class was a
location all right so I'm going to do it
okay
size 12 pixels color is the color this
thing name so we say native font size I
love this for size 14 color and then we
do font weight which is going to make it
bold
alright see that should be working right
now card
Cory Hatter see if you try something
some reason I don't know if it's working
yeah it's not working right now
so I have to figure it out I have to
debug this why it's not working
this thing should be saving
okay so saying give me an error color
sighs where is it
last 65 minus this game yeah oh because
I'm missing a semicolon there so stupid
yeah all right it's not it is working
okay let's say for this let's do a
profile for now we're just gonna put a
background right out so we got an image
and then hi 50 pixels with 50 pixels
should be saying something profile this
image
oh that's why I didn't have to write
okay now you see how big is that should
be smaller than that all right
so also tool it has like a padding
around so let's do that to the car
header so you say hey patty there's a
little 15 pixels all right yeah that
seems right and then let's make this 225
yeah all right all right
and then it's at a time let's do this
what should we do at the time we should
just go a float right you do like font
size 12 pixels yeah there you go now
let's do something else with this we
need better fast in this there's still
open sans okay and then we come here
fetch it we take this import so what
this does is it brings that font into
our page but through the CSS and then
for family now what I do is for now I'll
say so now all the fonts through all the
whole page is going to be that let me
see why is not working right now it
should be changing
missing name whatever reason Leslie I
guess we put them here for whatever
reason it should be working
I don't know why so let's just do it
individually you know so we say hey I
think this image should be a little bit
bigger let's say 35 is it that big on
the page now let's do it good 30 think
this up all right little this is 50%
right it's for now
okay let me see this card could be a
little bit bigger
yeah that's starting to look better now
so let me see what else
remove the spacing change to whatever
and then you do something like this we
come to the emergency station relative
and then we saved top five pixels that
was a little bit more Center mommy cool
yeah there you go
all right your boy is back all right let
me see what else what else what should
we do little to the right margin
all right five pixels there you go
starting to get cleaner all right and
then for this where as they look our
time all right
gift of similar font let's do this top
ya think this even looks smaller yeah
there you go
listen yeah that's fine
definitely far from there and then
that's about it guys

next video and you already know we got

car container and let's continue with
