chit chit cheer we in here kids yeah
yo man times it's hard man
like for real man like times is really
hard right now man for the internet you
know when it came back from the gym a
little while ago you know your boy is
trying to get back in shape you know get
this going you know what I mean
get that beach body back yo man we in
here right now man was good was good man
listen I got some news for you guys man
like it's really messed up man it's
seriously messed up when you start
looking at it you know maybe people
would just you know straight up hey in
well let's look at this this is
ridiculous
right now we have real Chris shark
I say Oh Krishan channel is pretty much
it was down for a little while all his
videos I seems to have been deleted
somebody went in there and hacked or
something something happened you know
the first person that told me about this
was let's look at the comments I believe
it was Casey
yep here you go kids now sometimes
people be reacting like I didn't get
this messages from other people like
people come to me I'm I'm half way bout
to go to sleep in you know late-night
stuff be with me oh my oh yeah
chose you to restart some Krishan he
probably gotta make a video button that
you know on you know somebody hate it
somebody got tight they seen him that
he's doing good you know
and ideally the day like this is
providing for him you know he has a lot
of good videos that it's helping him get
out there and I hope that it doesn't
mess up his his fan base and I don't
know I don't know people were asking me
for what's Midori I don't know I don't
know I don't think so
that would be she don't seem like that
type of person I don't think so I mean
that's dark
what would did it is like that's like a
dark thing or what somebody else told me
on a message is like you know if
Christian was to be the one to delete it
it was like in this you know I don't
think he's not a type of person you know
people crash on deleted his old thing
because of whatever reason bro trust me
you do not want to delete your videos
where as a youtuber I think that's like
the last thing that you wanted to you
know I don't think he would do that at
all cuz it's like that's a whole year of
his life to put into this you know what
I mean like it's not like he he freaking
you know I was like he's doing this
stuff - not half of any of his videos
and stuff like that they're what you
know what I don't know I don't know what
happened that's really messed up
what yeah man that's one thing and then
we got yeah you know is funny when
people start hitting you up with the
fake accounts I recall guava like don't
that name sounds funny like his fake
account
this guy's like yo look at this guys
coming
you have stunning professional with oh
my god wigs man shut up seriously wakes
up yeah I'm looking at this guy he's
like it's funny when you talk about
Eli's mental elk we show signs of
paranoia yourself in regards to Erik
guys on that paranoid it's like you guys
don't know a lot of things yeah I don't
know emails and stuff to where I'm like
literally like your bro don't copy what
I do what don't copy what Christian does
just do what you do and then from that
time currently started changing started
copying a lot of stuff somebody creates
a top frame works of 2017 is like new
frameworks to 2017 somebody creates a
another video of you know well whatever
is popular out there it's like okay I'm
gonna go and take this and then just put
one word that's different and just say
my own spin on it it's like I don't know
to me that's whack you know and like I
could tell like a lot of stuff but it's
like okay I'm doing you to music oh I
don't go to you to me to and say and I
started doing movie for you know for the
playing reasons that people were asking
me what courses that you take it's like
if I'm a developer who actually have
done udemy courses and have learned from
udemy courses it makes sense for me to
tell somebody hey but you can't disclose
from you to me this will actually help
me right that's like a recommendation
it's not more like oh guys go to you to
because now don't make some money and
it's like you see me doing that you know
what I mean it's like that's whack you
know I mean but I'll leave it alone
you know there's a lot of people that
they act like I was in the first one
doing this and then people start copying
what I do I wouldn't be surprised it
wasn't like you know like I didn't start
the mentorship program and then the next
day somebody else is like
I'm gonna show my girlfriend katsu or
become a developer what happened tonight
you know what I mean like people come
here they takes ideas they look at what
and they they see what I do and then
they take ideas and then try to flip it
in a different way like hey he's doing a
mentorship program how about I flip
instead of using the subscribers let me
use my girlfriend let me teach my
girlfriend how to do list hey come on
man make it obvious man it's not like
that's not paranoia whatever it's like
people come in they see what I'm doing
there oh let me repackage it a little
bit better
well let me try to put my own little
spin you know without the sauce and then
things fall apart and they don't even
finish the series right you know what I
mean so it's not me with a mental
illness I'm not the one fighting against
the war against YouTube you know you
know what I mean this was like retarded
you know yeah man but it's really funny
man but yeah let's it was in a chat room
right now man oh by the way guys as I
know if you see this when you guys
cursed ya not getting you're not getting
those messages through you know I was
like you could curse but they're not
gonna get us something so what's good
what's good we got max we got a bunch of
stuff we got George FinTech we got Larry
Cohen silence except yo I hope somebody
if somebody decides to to show this to
Eric I have nothing against every like I
could give to rocks
I don't wanna curse right about Eric he
could do whatever he wanted can't be
what he wants he must flip little things
around whatever but look at this comic
here I hope somebody could zoom in a
Miss America zoom into this see you can
zoom into this thing
okay meri Gonzalez says all his best
concert was fairly stuff yes that's
exactly what I was messing with it and I
promoted him because his content was
original was something new he had
different content but what happens he
wasn't getting a lot of views right so
it's like now he's trying to find and
went over trying to see what other
people are doing it
copying what other people are doing oh
this is working for this perfect person
let me try that will do it replicated
here and si bro that just make his
channel like it goes down I don't f with
that you know I don't have for people
who I just like leeching onto whatever
is out there like that's what heck you
know what I mean like this is really no
point of it but the people sometimes
does youtubers they don't look at what
people say and that's the thing that
bothers me you see where people leave a
bad comment I look at it and I'm like yo
if they have a point and they're right I
listen to them I made a video about
elixir along something go where a lot of
people was like ill after the main you
realize hey it looks it's not that bad
I deleted they're saying okay you guys
are right alright but most of these
youtubers 99% of them all of them
basically nobody looks at the comments
they don't care about the the bad stuff
that people say and they don't look at
the things that people are just leaving
on the comments like oh you know it's
like 900 people on YouTube is telling
elide the computer guys like your bro
just do content that's what we hear
where's that you know with the latest
things how to connect a printer in 2017
where are those videos at right that's
what people subscribe to but I'm the
crazy one because I'm pointing it out
I'm a youtuber who was
dang it out and as I broke if me with
less than 10,000 subscribers is doing
good pretty good how are you with almost
a million subscribers crying what is it
that you want from YouTube like YouTube
basically gave you everything that you
could dream of you know what I mean like
there's so many different things like
way you look at it you like wait what
you know so I tell people I actually
look at everybody's things man
yeah like I look at I look at
everybody's things man like and you know
you leave her a comment you leave her a
thing it's like I look at everybody you
know what I mean like that's what I do
like I look at everybody am i okay I
look at what you say if it's good I look
at it if it's bad I look at it right I'm
not gonna come in and and like leave
everything behind and then you know
whatever may be cold and friends

tough right that's how it is - that's
how the world is nowadays man you come
in you come in to show love and you get
free content people come in and try to
shut you down man but oh yeah let's talk
about that
so Aryan beta lost his job because of
outsourcing and and all the other stuff
man
but yeah like that's my stuff but at the
same time I'm not surprised it happens
all the time guys you know like it's
happened to me like in the past like
people let you go they're gonna hate the
project is done and then the only tool
that matter like let's say there's a a
bunch of developers in a company right
and then only to developers stay behind
so everybody else gets fired because hey
we finish your project we don't need you
no more
but the senior developers who were here
before you they stay so goodbye kid you
know they do that
the Camila excuses like oh you know I'm
sorry we downsize in we you know we
would given it to you know we downsizing
we doing like outsourcing mind you in
reality is like that's it they don't
need your services
go home okay things like that happen
little time man but he's gonna be fine
man
you know my boys snugs man work people
get hacked every day be like yeah yeah
this is crazy you know what I did I
changed all my passwords wait 30 minutes
ago I changed all of my passwords you
know what I mean like I changed my
birthday I have a crazy birthday let's
just leave it at that
like I have a crazy birthday right so if
somebody tries to come in and be like yo
you know what this guy's birthday you go
out and try to hack into cuz that's a
thing that's where people mess up when
it comes to passwords you come in and
you put a number one you can put a
password that's super simple number two
you can come in and actually make a
password that's difficult but what
happens is you go in and you put in your
information like your birthday what city
you were born or like you know what high
school you want so like people always
choose the the the things like that like
like they have those questions like Oh
in case you lost your password what city
were you born and you give them your
real city if somebody knows you in the
back oh yeah this guy was born him you
know and if we came Manila Philippines
they put in Manila Philippines now they
got your password now they're inside
your account now they changed the
password now they you know hit it from
the back row no loop you know what I
mean so now you you effed up you know
what I mean so yeah man but you know as
I our laughing man is this a waste time
message but it was that thing try see if
I can find it you know like when you
start getting Eli the computer
so the subscribers the loyal fans the
guys who have been there since 2009 with
fake accounts Rico guava never heard of
this guy
zero subscriber there's like his his or
this other guy's name whatever fucking
his new account is like they just
created it today just to leave this
comic you know that's one thing madness
you know it's like people who come in
and take ideas for me do what I do
take topics like I don't even do certain
topics no more because I know if I do it
people just come in and just kind of
copy it now what I do is things that
people cannot copy there's certain
things that they can't copy they can't
talk like me they can't swag it out like
me they can't do tutorials like me like
I just do everything my own way to make
sure that people just don't copy because
what sucks is my my problem is when like
I say somebody copies my work and then
I've been doing this for a while this
other person starts getting popular and
they keep growing and then now their
subscriber base comes back to me and say
hey you copy from XYZ and they don't
even know that I'm doing that created
this you know what I mean like a lot of
those guys didn't even want to show
their faces out here like a lot of this
guy's wasn't doing this you know I was
the first one over here sourcing and
swagging it out now everybody gonna act
like they're their cooling hit you know
what I mean is like man I came in
disrupted the whole thing and that's it
you know I was like like this other
clown boy was told that it's like oh man
you only got 10,000 subscribers and this
and that and that's all yeah man but
somehow
I'm happy you seem sad you know that we
like we making money out here you know
what I mean
in there on top of that it's not just
with YouTube it's like you if you have
skills I said right now right if I have
skills and I know what I'm doing now I
know all the stuff that's like why
wouldn't I just freelance or why
wouldn't I create other stuff like
there's so much stuff that we know as
professionals that people want to learn
why wouldn't you want to share that like
there's no way you can't come up with
new topics you know what I mean so yeah
man that's how it is nowadays hit the
like button kids I mean I want to do the
like buttons do anything for people like
I mean I wonder you know especially with
the algorithm and stuff I dialect you
know - freaking you to give us a cookie
like you know will they be like hey guy
you get a cookie because you got you
know 98 percent of the people to give
you likes and it's late you know I don't
know I don't know if they do I don't
know if that really does anything for us
you know word
well this Kate Casey's birthday today
it's a birthday sign it the suspects are
worried yeah yeah this is funny this is
this company right this is no joke

comes in and sends us a apple pie like a
real apple pie with the whole thing as I
can't cooked and this and that I was
like whoa I don't know if I'm
