you subscribe make sure you keep
following your boy man coding phase calm
man all right I'm just chilling right
now but let's break it down okay
how did I go from working on the more to
eighty-five thousand dollars a year
right and that's just from my full-time
job right that's not even counting the
extra money that will make from YouTube
and extra money that I make on a
freelance which most likely I'm probably
gonna make like another ten fifteen
thousand dollars on time so this year I
might break the you know $100,000 mark
or at least 95,000 but how did I even
get here right how did I even get to
this point in my life and you know I'm
not gonna come in with an inspirational
story that I like no man this is just
about like you know busting my ass while
everybody else was hanging out and just
chilling and you know going out for the
past two three years I was home everyday
you know hitting team tree house coating
to coat academy.com watching videos on
YouTube go from job to
job to more job to real
 jobs and just like you know all
the jobs are you gonna get in the
beginning as a web developer or
 like straight up there's no way
around it you just have to go through it
like they're gonna have you making
 HTML emails Oh copy you know
convert as PSD into a you know HTML CSS
frickin marketing stuff like html5
banners for Google Adsense well Google
or Google AdWords whatever
but like that like things like that
that's what you're gonna be doing you
know what I mean
but all of that stuff like you know it's
a way just to prepare you man you know
like this thing did not happen overnight
you cannot give up I saw you know
brand-new web developer even if you go
to a bootcamp man I've seen people who
go to boot camps come out of boot camps
and they're like oh yeah they say that
they hire people you know for ninety
thousand a hundred thousand dollars
right away listening that's out of a
class of thirty people one person gets
hired for that nice position
right so if they have five to ten
classes right in every class one or two
students is gonna get hired for a really
high position life is not fair life is
not it's not easy in life is a bitch
like it or not so you might think oh I'm
gonna get the hundred thousand dollars
right away no man it doesn't work like
that man
you have to bust your ass like this is
not easy you have to just keep grinding
and keep pushing yourself to the next
level and never stop learning whatever
comes out next you know could be
how Chris Hawks idea and the other day
it could be the Harry Potter framework
look at it take a look at it you know
it's irelia is view jas is whatever
 framework that's coming out
then just try it
it doesn't mean that you have to use it
it just means try it out just in case
one day you go to any other job and but
oh do you know Aurelia even though deep
down inside of you you're like I hate
this framework but yeah I've actually
played around with it don't be like oh
wow and don't don't hire you trust me
that's just how it is
so um yeah man so that's my story man I
just pretty much busted my ass a hit
team treehouse check videos on YouTube
there four videos on YouTube
started sending out my resume and you
know doing little websites on
Craigslist for people for like $100
you know websites that took me to three
weeks I will get paid $100 just to build
their website ended up being you know
 you know little jobs
little design our agencies that
they thought that they were big-time and
they're only paying you freakin $14 an
hour and you're like I know I'm getting
exploited but I need the experience you
know what I mean it's only you have to
do it you got somebody's gotta get
exploited and it's gonna be you like it
or not because you don't have the
experience saying hey I just graduated
from App Academy and this and that
it doesn't work out like that man you
know this is like 1% of the 1% it's
gonna get those really really amazing
jobs right away you know what I mean so
you just got to work hard and I say not
give up because the money is there they
hire people every frickin day every time
I went to an interview and that was
another thing where I kind of messed up
in the beginning I would be like oh yeah
I don't even know what to ask for
I'll be like um yeah maybe though I
actually was his salary on my own maybe
forty five thousand at that time I'm
like I thought that was a lot of money
and then I'll be like oh maybe 50,000
million 65,000 made 70,000 now I was
like nah it's eighty thousand or not
like anywhere that I go is eighty
thousand or not because I put in my ten
thousand hours into this so you know
what I mean like give yourself value man
you know that's something that I had to
learn in the long run like now wherever
I go from now on is 85 and up and if she
gets crazy by next year I'm gonna be
saying hey it's a hundred thousand
you're not automatically off the bat if
you want because in a year too
I'm straight up going remote I'm not
going into the office I'm not working
for nobody because I already have the
skills to work from anywhere in the
world you know what I mean
like I could literally now I have so
much skills right now that I could
literally say hey I'm just gonna be a
consultant I'll do my work for my house
I'll see you later
you know what I mean so yeah that's how
I just know I went from working in the
more back in the days nothing that was
working no more two three years ago but
I went from somebody that was working a
little more the mall parking lot to
actually now making 90k and maybe more
this year
and that's just because of web
development you know what I mean so it's
like you know sky's the limit man don't
put no limits on yourself man you could
get whatever you want but you just gotta
put your mind into it and keep going you
did anyways you already know it's your
boy Joe make sure you subscribe make
