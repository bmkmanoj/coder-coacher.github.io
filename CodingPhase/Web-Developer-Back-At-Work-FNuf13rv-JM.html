know it's gonna be like my channel and
my girl is channel

you know how girls are but I feel like
the way she is is very entertaining you
know somebody could be very entertaining
word or if like you know our lives and
just enjoy you know see what the hell
we're up I think people will like it
you know doesn't have to be like
like one of those big youtubers who have
like vlogs every day were like fake with
fake content it's like oh my god are
freaking I got stopped in the airport or
some crazy it's not gonna be like
that it's gonna be just family you
know see us hanging out barbecues you
know a little barbecue a little feeding
the baby teaching the baby how to walk
you know me cooking in the house or
people don't know I know how to cook and
I'm actually pretty good so I cook all
my meals I can cook anything you give me
the recipe I can cook it you know just
keep it nice nice and simple - puppet a
what up yeah baby Joe's coming through
soon man it was crazy the baby he looks
like his his mom like he looks a little
bit like me well he looks like his mom
if you've seen you guys don't follow me
on Instagram go on Instagram man go to
Instagram calm slash coding face and you
will see me just hanging out walling out
with the family and you know it's like
personal right there you're gonna see
the personal side of your boy Joe but
yeah man I'm missing what I'll do to
these people over here at the freakin
freakin store so what is the stand that
you don't use for service most on there
but where is this idea that people think
that most people don't use a full strap
like a lot of people guys don't listen
to the Internet man
I'm being honest don't listen to the
internet because you got to understand
that's like why I did the video about
about nodejs right if you look online
they say no js' has thousands and
thousands of jobs right but it's really
more for front-end what they're asking
is people do you know how to use gulp do
you know how to use grunt do you know
sorry how to use NPM and when they put
NPM they add nodejs
but in reality you're not really working
in the back end with nodejs and the
companies right and it's the same thing
as online people come in you know tell
you oh nobody uses bootstrap no more but
every company that I go to they use
bootstrap every company that I've seen
every developer that I know using
bootstrap so like real life you know cuz
there's a big difference between the
internet in real life like in the
internet anybody could say anything
anything can become popular like you
could come up with an idea of saying hey
I don't know Java is super slow right
and if enough people retweet that and
repass it around that becomes a thing
online and it'd be like oh man don't
learn Java Java is super slow and you
know what I mean so you know trust me
man
bootstrap right now it's always gonna be
around guys bootstrap is like jQuery you
know it's the same thing as jQuery
people be like oh nobody uses bootstrap
or nobody uses jQuery but it's like come
on you know people are still using
jQuery so I don't know
yeah plus also to depends on the
location you know sometimes and depends
on the company that you work for you
know some companies don't need a full
CSS framework at all
so that's the thing some companies just
need a couple of little things to be
responsive and that's it and you could
do that yourself but if you really need
something like a website you're like
you're building a full-fledged web
application or a full-fledged website
then you need something like bootstrap
or foundation or bhumata IO or like if
you want to be on the cutting edge use
boom ah right boom ah the IO right
that's like the best one that I've seen
from all the new CSS frameworks but if
you're like working on something I don't
know something that needs to be seen in
Internet Explorer then you have to use
bootstrap because bootstrap works with
everything like every browser even
things up
Epis also - you know you gotta talk
about it's like I would say not
everything not everything that I say is
right not everything that somebody else
might say is right on the internet
because it's the Internet guys it's like
anybody can come here and and make a
video online and and say hey this is the
best is the worst this is good this is
bad anybody could do that right and with
the right audience and if Google decides
to start giving you views then people
might believe it but it doesn't mean
that the person is right you know that's
why me whenever I talk about any topic
or anything I say to my opinion right
from what I think like if somebody asks
me about honor
like nodejs I will say hey to my opinion
I don't think that nodejs is it's the
best framework right you know what back
in language or in the backend framework
that I will use right for different
projects
just react dying view taking over nope I
don't think so god I think there's been
a I call this a huge propaganda for UGS
but it's mostly if you look at it it's
mostly people who just don't they're not
really good with JavaScript like I'm
being honest they just not really go
with JavaScript um if you makes it
really easy for a beginner to start
using a framework if you is like it's as
easy as jQuery to get into a framework
right but it doesn't mean that it's the
best what it means is just it's easy
it's easy for somebody who doesn't want
to go and spend an hour creating a gulp
file creating a task runner you know
somebody who doesn't want to do that
they could go ahead and use for you but
to get the full extent and get
everything out of the framework you
still got a set up of you you know yeah
I really appreciate it everybody you
know that is donating a little sunny bit
cold like always man big coats
definitely getting some some of the
merchandise that I'm building soon
because he already he's already thrown
like 20 bucks 30 bucks into this
you know just to support and I really
appreciate it so you're you know you one
of the first ones to get started
john Ramat you know Thank You Man
appreciate it loving it loving it right
now throwing you know you just bought me
lunch right now you just pay for my my
little lunch yeah man and like to be
honest like I still have every money
that I've gotten donated I haven't spent
not even one dime out of it I'm leaving
it there because like I told you guys
any money that you guys donate any money
you get to put into Conan face is going
straight to the to the website and like
right now I haven't had the need to to
use it but at one point once the website
is complete then from there that's when
I might use that money that money's
gonna be on Google Adsense they're gonna
see you're gonna see in Google ads
you're gonna see you YouTube
commercials body like I'm trying to
flood it out you know yeah going back to
view like it's just propaganda guys man
like people who there's a lot of people
who like angular and they know angular
is not that good right but then they
think about it and they're like oh I
want to jump to something else which was
the best one then it's react so react is
more complicated all right
it's more difficulties for people who
really know JavaScript you can't just
jump into react without knowing Java
super like doing an on JavaScript I
don't and like you could join
angular or view Jas without knowing no
JavaScript at all like you could just go
in there and say hey for each this or V
bind is or V model this like you
could do it just like that man let me
get something to eat cuz a lot of people
get in there already
