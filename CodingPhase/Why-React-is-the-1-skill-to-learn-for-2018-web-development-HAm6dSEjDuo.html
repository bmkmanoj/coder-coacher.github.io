Conan face.com
listen guys today's topic is why you
should focus on react on 2018 alright
guys so basically I'm going over the
reasons why you should definitely focus
as a web developer if you're looking to
become either front end or even back in
you know you should focus on react right
and the reason why I say even for
back-end developers is because nowadays
it doesn't matter where you go you're
gonna bump into somebody who's using
react so even if you are a back-end
developer you might as well know the
basics so when somebody tells you hey
I'm doing this component I'm connecting
it to an action or Redux at least you
know what's going on all right so now
let's talk about jobs right so there's a
whole bunch of jobs out there when it
comes to front-end developers right now
most companies will tell you hey we want
somebody who knows angular react view
ember
backbone they'll throw like 20 different
things on a post okay so don't get
scared about that right but when you
start going to this job interviews you
realize that even though they have like
five different frameworks you'll find
out that they're only using one of them
right it's either going to be angular or
is going to be react okay now for the
long-term react is the way better option
because react pretty much you can use it
anywhere right I've seen it being used
inside of electron apps which are like
basically desktop applications you could
use it was react native you can use it
with just a web I've seen people put it
inside of applications for fridges like
you know literally like a fridge like
you go to a samsung fridge the UI is
built with react like I don't know like
that's crazy to me right so you're
pretty much learning react once and then
you can reuse that skill throughout all
this different
ways of actually building the UI for
different applications all right so now
let's talk about the jobs okay so if you
go to indeed.com or you go to dice or
you go to monster.com you could pretty
much come here and find that you could
look on the search results and say hey
man put the title call and react and
you're gonna find a whole bunch of jobs
here okay
and one thing that you're gonna notice
is that their high-paying jobs it's not
like little BS jobs where that I hey man
you know a little HTML CSS is like oh
here's 50,000 here's maybe 60,000 here's
45,000 not we're talking about the big
boys we turn about 80,000 90,000 a
hundred thousand if you have like two
years in two three years in you're
looking at $120,000 okay like you can't
go wrong right like this is the main
reason why I tell people hey focus on
react stop focusing on everything else
like yeah you can learn angular you hate
you could do a little something for your
side project your view Jay yes but those
things are not the things not gonna get
your money out here you get what I'm
saying like okay so let's move on from
that okay so there's a lot of jobs out
there and one thing that I notice right
I've been doing research on this between
Ruby on Rails ii technologies ii
framework the second skill that's out
there that is paying the most for remote
developers is literally react okay if
you are a good react developer if you
are somebody who knows their things like
you know know how a components work
knows how the life cycles work know how
pass things through the props know the
basics right if you know the basics and
you have solid applications as your
portfolio you'll be like hey man i did
an application for this I did a
application for financial services are
there application for a real estate that
application for restaurant etc right you
have solid portfolio which react right
you could pretty much get some very good
jobs working remotely all right now I'm
gonna look into this all right so look
at this
so they offering remote react slash
nodejs developer if they put react first
is because mostly you're going to be
focused on react okay now do you all
know a little bit about no - yes you
understand how it works so most likely
they're back in Essen no - yes they're
not going to hold you to wait to say hey
we're looking for expert in nodejs
because that's not really what they're
looking for right so pretty much this
one year of experience one year
experience of no DES one year experience
working with my sequel guys whenever you
see something like this with says one
year of experience that one year could
have been you learning on your own and
basically working hard and building your
portfolio okay so that means they're
pretty much hiring anybody who has the
skills and and could actually give them
an extra head right most likely this
company just needs somebody to come in
and do a couple of extra components
coming connect you know to their API
that they already have set up like
simple stuff right and they're paying
you know eighty to a hundred and ten
thousand dollars guys like you know
eighty thousand is where you start off
right if you're a junior developer
that's what you start off right somebody
like me and have five six he is in the
game I started off at the one hundred
ten thousand right and if I could swing
to myself in there and be like hey man
my last job was pay me 120 most likely
don't give me that extra ten thousand to
get that one hundred and twenty thousand
dollars right now for you guys to if
you're a junior developer you have to
write skills and you say hey you know
what I want to start out a hundred
thousand don't be like hey but you only
have a year two years and you know what
I'll take ninety you know that's how you
that's how you got to negotiate this
right so you gotta learn how to play the
game alright so you start off pretty
high and then you bring it back down you
said okay cool I wanted to get 90
anyways alright so it's a great
opportunity it's a lot of jobs you know
there's definitely a lot of cool stuff
going on in the ecosystem off reactor
right now let's go into the numbers
right let's go into the numbers and
compare it to other frameworks right now
one thing that is cool about react is
that everybody's talking about it
okay you know well you can see right
here this is reactor yes okay is that
the blue one alright red one is angular
okay angular has bang on the top for a
long time but it's keep on dropping
every single day all right now from
there you got the new baby around town
which is view J yes still below
everybody no matter what okay now one
thing that you're gonna notice is this
big boy right here this green boy right
this is react Nina so pretty much if you
know react you could take your skills to
react negative two and create fun
applications now react native is
actually more popular right now just so
searches right and this is just to be
100% clear this is just on searches
sometimes people get confused with
Google Trends and other different laws
statistics they get it missing screwing
and gonna messed up right this is just
for searches right this means that
there's a lot of people searching either
for questions tutorials examples you
know so pretty much react native his hot
Reina it's more hot then react GS
angular or VJ s right but if you know
react you pretty much know react native
like all you need to do is literally
just go over the documentation and
you're golden okay so that's pretty much
it
one thing that you're gonna notice is
that you know react is everywhere all
over the US even China pretty much same
thing with angular but if you come back
here to this one you're gonna notice
that the one that's dominating the most
as you can see it's like react native
everywhere everywhere is like react
native wherever you go okay now the next
thing that we're gonna see is we're
gonna look into MPM trends so MPM trends
is gonna tell you how many times either
angular react or view GS is being
downloaded okay
and even angular 4 which is you know you
can say angular 4 I'm gonna five which
is like angular core pretty much you can
actually see how many times is being
downloaded through NPM which is like the
standard of where people download either
one of these different libraries okay so
we're gonna say right here first of all
as you can see green is react okay the
blue one is angular core which is like
angular four or five or even two and
then you have the orange one which is
the angular one and then the red one is
view GS okay but you can see this a huge
difference of how many times people are
actually downloading reactant compared
to angular and your core and view GS so
pretty much it's like react is in
control of the industry right now right
and this is something that you guys
should definitely look into man like do
your research don't just take you for me
man you know what I mean because
somebody might come in and go hey Joe
your body is because you love reactive
like air I do love react and I'm a
little bit biased but it's like the
numbers don't lie and the jobs don't lie
right the opportunities the
opportunities are there they don't lie
you know it's like is there it's right
in front of you all you have to do is do
the research so for 2018 is the same
thing as 2017 like you know or even
better now because you have to focus on
react guys you know you gotta learn
react you gotta learn react router you
definitely gotta learn Redux Redux is
it's pretty much the standard of you
know state management right so
definitely look into that and I gotta
say guys I have my website you know at
the end of the day you could either take
it from me you who try to learn it from
me or you could go through my
description and literally find other
people that teach you know react learn
it from wherever you want to learn it
right
but definitely come check out my website
give it a chance
see if you like your not a lot of the
people have been loving this course that
I created react quick and easy super
simple you come in you learn react and
at the same time you can follow the
timeline if you are just a beginner and
you're like wait I don't even know what
react this guy's you start from here and
you come in and say hey man how many
hours per week and you devote say hey I
can only do let's say 15 hours per week
he'll come in and he'll tell you how
long it's gonna take you to actually
finish just everything that you need to
learn to become a front-end developer
okay so you come in here you got to
learn text editor you get to learn HTML
CSS build a responsive app learn
advanced CSS sass future-proof
JavaScript learn how to use gulp 4
basically just managing everything that
you're gonna need as far as you know web
pack you know sat on your local
environment I know it's a lot it might
seem like a lot but if you dedicate
yourself and you say hey man I'm gonna
come in here and instead of me doing 15
hours per week you know what let's come
back to the timeline let's say I'm gonna
do 30 hours per week right 14 days you
can finish all of this right so pretty
much in 15 days you could go over every
single course that you're gonna need to
become a developer just a front-end of
course if you want to become a
full-stack developer you're gonna have
to learn the backend there's way more
stuff that you need to learn but to get
hired and to get the opportunities
that's out there it doesn't take that
long guys
so I would say come in try this out if
not on my description there's a whole
bunch of udemy courses that's gonna take
you to different great instructors that
are gonna teach you the best ways to
become a developer right now it's up to
you if you want to do it but like I said
man the opportunities is there guys like
literally like 80,000 to $100,000 a year
like come on and he doesn't so a hundred
and ten thousand dollars a year with one
year of experience like you're not gonna
find this anywhere guys like you're not
gonna find this in any type of industry
you're not gonna find that man this guys
that have been working in factories for
ten years there's guys that work
everything you know you could be at
McDonald's for 20 years and you're still
never gonna get close to anything like
this right you could be African I don't
know what the company that you work on
right you work at a company right now
and you know damn well that the mostly
gonna be growing is like 1 to 3% per
year right and there's like a maximum
that you could grow any so it's like if
you came in at $40,000 the mostly gonna
be making there is $70,000 by the time
you retire that's just how it works
that's how the world is right so it's
like do you want to stay there forever
or do you wanna take a chance that give
yourself the opportunity to say hey man
I'm gonna learn something new I'm gonna
change careers I'm gonna become
something that I can be proud of and at
the same time something that I could
love you don't I'm saying now like I
said before react is the best way for
anybody to start with what development
right if you're coming in using HTML CSS
JavaScript what's your next step after
that maybe learning a little bit of
jQuery just in case you have to come in
and touch them a legacy code but you
definitely need to learn react doesn't
matter if you want to focus on the front
end or you want to focus on the back end
or even if you wanted to just do full
applications like literally you have to
learn react so this is something that
you cannot keep running away from it
