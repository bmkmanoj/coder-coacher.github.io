world why do developers even quit number
one you can't choose your own project
you can't just be like hey man I want to
work on inbox I want to work on Google
sheets I want to work on YouTube I
wouldn't work on the cool stuff that
people are doing with Python no it
doesn't work like that buddy somebody
comes in holds your hand brings you into
the company shows you around and then
now they basically put you under a shelf
and say hey guy you work in at Google
cloud he's anything at Google cloud like
nobody cares about that right or they'll
put you at a project that you're like
wait I don't even want to do this you
know what I mean like this programming
language I don't even want to work on
this I didn't want to do golang I didn't
want to do whatever you're gonna say
whatever BST is putting you to do so
most developers quit because of that
right that's a big no-no if you go into
a company you're like man this has to be
the best company in the world but you
can't choose what team you want to work
on that's a big problem number two in
Google almost everything has already
been done like literally almost
everything that you could think of some
guy has already done it so most of the
time you're either just maintaining it
cleaning up old coal or just doing
debugging you don't want to say like oh
there's an error on Google Analytics hey
will you go fix that that's the things
that you're gonna be working on it's not
like fulfilling to be like oh man I'm
working on this new application most of
the time you know you're pretty much
just maintaining somebody's cold from
like 10 years ago they barely do
anything that's new I go was so safe
there that you can't really make an
impact I don't know about you but for me
I like to take pride in like build this
whole application I build the whole
back-end from the ground up instead of
like hey man I spent six months you know
fixing the menus on on YouTube wait what
number three is extremely hard for you
to get promotions okay it's such a big
process to get promoting Google that is
kind of ridiculous you could be working
at Google at the same position for six
seven
years and still never go up you know
what I really like it's a process of
like upper management
do they even like you or do they even
know who you are like if they don't even
know who you are like you're not
drinking coffee with them you're not
going to the lunch with them
you're not going to Starbucks you're not
coming back and be like hi hi Sean you
know it's like you're not getting
promoted buddy you could be there for 10
years and you're not getting promoted
right so most developers quit because of
that last one is basically you don't
really have that much freedom at Google
right and most of the companies that
Silicon Valley this happens in almost
all of them they're super left-wing
right I myself I'm in the middle I'm
left going I'm right wing on everything
that you want to label me right I'm
everything but if you have ideas are
different than what everybody else is in
their thinking like hey man you're gonna
stand out right you will get fired you
share your personal opinions that
somehow are a little bit different in
everybody's you're getting fired like
it's that quick it's not like oh yeah
now we we appreciate employees opinions
and this isn't that no it's like a group
collective and it's like okay if we all
going laughs you have to go left look
online barely anybody that works at
Google shares their opinions or anything
because they're so scared they they're
gonna get fired right so a lot of times
developers is like man I don't need this
like I'm a great engineer I'm a great
developer I could work out anywhere like
I don't need to be censored I don't need
to be constrained in this small
environment and I have to say everything
that other people like I have to follow
what they want now the biggest reason
why every developer leaves Google is to
start their own business okay a lot of
people going to Google I had a day like
man soon as I get there I get that
google stamp I'm set for life right
everybody knows I'm an experienced
developer everybody
knows I'm a great developer because
Google gave me that step right so now
they just say hey man I'm smart I don't
need to be working for somebody I could
go out of my own way and build my own
startup build my own company build my
own product something where I could be
more hands-on and not being stuck at
Google cloud you know and YouTube doing
menus you know you can't add any new
features to to the website you can't do
this in that like now it's my own
company now I can actually do whatever
the hell I want with my own company now
I could speak out however I want I could
share my opinions on the internet will
be myself where that happens to be a
robot
you got what I'm saying so if you want
to learn more about why people quit from
Google do a quick search of pora
and you're gonna find it do a google
search and you're going to find it you
do a little YouTube search and you're
going to find it I've seen this video
from I think Jarvis some cool kid he
pretty much talked about all the points
that I just said in his video make sure
you check that out I'm probably gonna
put it in the description I'll see you
guys later that's your boy Joe back at
it again coding phase comm make sure you
subscribe make sure you like this video
wow this video is brought to you by
coding phase economy all of its members
make sure you go visit a website it's
the only place where you're gonna learn
how to become a web developer with real
projects take it from me it's your boy
Joe back at it again concrete's calm
keep it real keep it trill</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
