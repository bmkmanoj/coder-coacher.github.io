the CSS let's make sure we go to website
that has font icons all right so we're
going to do is I'm going to come to here
we can search box awesome
icons right Oh awesome icon so we're
going to click on this link it's going
to bring us here and what we're going to
do is we're going to search for icons if
you
we're gonna say group we'll take that
one
well right now doesn't matter what type
of icon PR then I exactly like them what
was important is that we have icon right
so most of the times when the designer
comes to you we're going to give you the
icons for it
currently we don't have to icons were or
we're not on topic which is going to
hold this design okay so let's do this
do this and we basically pasting we're
so good take that there right now for
this to actually work we need to get the
CSS of this because it is actually just
like google fonts this is a CSS all
right so then look it up requires I
download it right Oh black or we could
come here and do something like this
cause also CDN that's what I usually
like to do is leave here quicker or
equals here popular take this HTML on it
and you're going to come to the header
on the title we're going to come here or
cases
so now we want to have access to that
icon now let's continue looking for the
other icons or similar icons to it
alright we're going to come to the front
awesome
we're gonna come to here get started
come to the icons right and we're going
to search message which other ones they
have okay now let's just keep this one
come now
something similar it is only difference
that this one squared but basically it
was copy this okay I'm going to come
here paste this here now we got the bell
let's come back to the iPhone search
spell usually it's the same time so most
we're going to copy this
okay cool
now that we have those icons let's look
for search and X all right which usually
means closed switch okay put it here and
then we have other X which is this one
let's search for clothes get this one
expert here also the things is name
equals search so we're actually on what
type of input field that is whenever we
submit it alright now let's go back to
the page we have cool we just added the
icons and if you pay attention to this
as you can see this is just classes this
is just I the regular I tagged with
classes on us right and what this is is
just a font but whenever you search a
class as a and then it has the F a user
it displays that image which is just a
regular font alright and we're getting
that because we're linking that CSS
that's coming from full stroke that CDN
which is a font awesome CSS right we're
linking our page to that file and now we
have access to that file you alright see
in a little bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
