uh when I what I what I'm kids will sup

yeah Chile your boys out here your any
no coating face calm man your boys out
here chillin lunch break my favorite
time of the day get a little lunch break
you dick man I'm just checking in on you
guys man same with you guys is up to
today see what you guys are working on
man oh this a message to um I forgot his
name but the guy that keeps asking me
about the rocky stack that the videos
are done buddy
the videos are done they're coming it
just they need to get editing you know
it's like it's not like I could just
make videos on the fly I have to edit
them so there won't be mistakes and
there won't be other stuff on it that
don't need to be on it you know what I
mean but they're coming for sure
um yeah man we all here chumming bro you
know I got I got you guys looking
straight from the side like you were
sitting right here in the passenger seat
you know what I mean yeah riding on
shotgun right now you dig what you dick
you riding shotgun right now kick butt
yeah man um what the hell am i up to
like I said guys I'm working on a
rebuild of the company that I'm working
on so we've rebuilding the whole website
so it's gonna be a brand new website
once it's done I'm gonna give you guys
you know the name of the company I
working the website that I work for and
that I've been building for like the
past half a year yeah cuz right now I'll
be honest the the the current website
from the company I work for is pretty
old and outdated it was built fifteen
years ago you know and somehow they've
been you know making money with that
website you know like that but we
building something so cool man in
so many cool features that I've been
working on that I could literally be
saying you know I'm proud of and and
show to you guys and but I hey man
that's what I've been working on but the
only issue now is that for you know
situations in the company we want to
launch it earlier than what it was
supposed to be so we basically trying to
cram in 15 years into two weeks so
that's the thing that's where I'm at
right now that's where I've been super
busy and it kind of sucks because it's
like I have a lot of cool stuff that I
want to keep making it on the channel
but then at the same time I was like I
have a full-time job I don't make money
off this thing you know what I mean it's
not like a group could be like hey guys
huh I'm home all day and and you know
make your videos all day like you know
I'm not uh what's his destiny
I'm not a simple programmer like he
could just stay home he worked for many
years and he said he set himself up
where now he could just make videos and
even if you don't make money he's still
you know he could still make videos all
day in his house without doing nothing
me personally I can't do that I gotta
work I'm still like yeah I'm just a
regular worker I'm just working on him
trying to survive I'm broke I'm broke
man you boys broke so I gotta work you
know what I mean so but yeah but oh yes
I was like you know and to me I think
that's cool like you know what I mean I
I think Christian I was going through
something like this similar I don't know
like a week or two ago where he was
basically he got to go away for like a
week a week and a half and he had to do
certain things for his job or
thanks for his church and I'm like now
I'm going through the same thing it's
like I can't I'm making a lot of videos
I make I feel like I'm making a lot of
videos I'm dropping one um what
developer lunch break I'm dropping a
video
a day sometimes two it's just the
tutorials take a long time so since it
takes a long time what I do is I try to
become on the weekends and then I gotta
edit them and it just takes a long time
it's a long process it's not as easy as
you guys might think cuz I'm not a
genius not all of the stuff that you
make can get shot and can be done in one
shot so it has to be done in in multiple
shots and multiple edits in multiple
videos so that from there I added them
and then put them together and then you
get the tutorials but yeah so it takes
time you know what I mean so and like I
was saying I got thing is cool that if
I'm uh I'm a fan of the channel and I
know this person actually works on the
industry because that's another thing
like I know a whole bunch of youtubers
who don't even work in the industry like
you know I mean like I will feel weird
taking advice from somebody that doesn't
even work on the industry well
the last time that they worked in the
industry was like five to ten years ago
and like now all they do is tutorials in
and that's it and it's like wait all you
do is tutorials but you're not in the
industry you know what I mean so it's
like what the is you to give me an
advice on some new like you know
like that's people who I see all the
time they're talking about give advice
or react or giving advice on you know
view Jas or whatever but mind you they
don't even work in the industry so it's
like what type of advice are you giving
like you're not even in the industry you
can't give an opinion if you if you
don't use a certain product every day or
you can't use it in production like your
opinion doesn't matter you know what I
mean like that's a few so it's like for
you guys nothing will be cool to know
like you know I'm actually working
I'm not like some dude that's in my
house making videos saying hey I work
for this company I work for that company
but in reality they don't you know what
I mean so I think it's cool that I work
let me see what else also I wanted to
know what you guys think I'm gonna check
the messages that you guys leave but
also leaving a comment even though
you're on the live chat leave me a
comment on this video I want to know if
who's gonna support me on this right so
I'm gonna have my coding phase channel
which is this one which is just about
code and then I'm gonna have another
channel which is just about me meaning
just meanwhile I'm out with my friends
meanwhile in are going to you know
 Six Flags me wanna now bothering
my girlfriend meanwhile I now bothering
my baby when he's born meanwhile I now
playing video games you know like I
don't know I don't know maybe I call it
your boy your boy Joe the channel or
something like that
alright cuz here this is just mostly
about cold but like as you guys can see
like I'm a character you know
what I mean like like I feel like me
getting cramped into just cold it's like
it's just about cold you know what I
mean so I'm just wondering who's gonna
subscribe to the other channel when I
create it I don't know when is coming I
don't know what's gonna be the name of
it I don't know when I'm gonna make it
but you know because it's like I do a
lot of cool besides coding and then
I'm like man I can't put in my coding
phase channel because this is the
channel that got the most subscribers
that I have right now so it's like I
can't put it here because if people are
here for coding you know what I mean
like it's gonna be weird if I come here
and be like hey man I'm on six flags
doing the vlog like I find it weird you
know I mean because people are not here
for that
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna create
a channel that is just gonna be about me
myself one you know just chillin hanging
out you know maybe doing some gaming
videos maybe doing some some cool
you know maybe is doing some pranks not
like corny pranks cuz I don't prank some
people all the time but I'm gonna do it
like oh I want to make a professional
prank video nah it's just me
with my girlfriend or with my
mom so with you know my friends
where you guys gonna see more of me not
just hey Joe the coding guy like you
know this side of me is the corny
version of me like you know what I mean
like I don't know like that's how ha say
like you know like the coding side of me
is like the nerdy you know weird
weirdo coding his house for hours okay
that's cool
that's how consider this side of me
right but then the other side of me is
just this other person that just
chills loves music makes music plays
video games super funny super friendly
and you know like I can't really show
all all of my my skills all of my little
features that I have as a human being on
this channel because this channel is
about code so I might just create
another channel man and let's see what I
grow so you know what I mean
somewhere where I could really bowl out
you know and just go all out and be like
hey man I'm in a strip club poppin
bottles with the hose not you know man
that's what you're gonna get or on my
other channel just me you know you're
gonna have this and it's like my coding
channel and then I'm gonna have another
one which is just going to be me
children making a whole bunch of
different type of videos it's not just
gonna be coding
cohdon based videos yeah oh yeah and let
me see let me read the messages see what
you guys are up to
okay when I would I would I want our
FinTech what up Freddie what up Matt
what up Casey what up Casey no remember
kissing a shotgun beer watching from
Egypt Egypt what up man I need to go to
Egypt man that's like one of my dreams
one day I gave up a hundred thousand
dollar job so you talk alone what the
fella me give the video a like yep give
the video like man
listen Casey if you made a hundred 100
before you can make it again that's not
them trust me because it's like it is
very hard to go from a set standard that
you already have to go lower than that
you know so it's like once you touch
it's like I know like a lot of people's
like once they touch a million dollars
it's hard for them to come back in and
earn less than that you know what I mean
so it's the same thing so you touch a
hundred thousands like you know them
well you could make more than that on
your next job
or dislike DIY shopping yeah gaming face
the gaming face chapter and I'm
definitely going to create another
channel because there's also to like I
have a lot of vlogs which I haven't
posted up here like a lot of cool vlogs
like this weekend we went to my
girlfriend's nephew's first communion
right and then from that we went to go
eat a hibachi and then we went to the
beach after that so those like a lot of
cool you know so it's like I can't
add that here because this channel is
not about that you know what I mean so
this channel is about Co so you know
what I mean
where it your boy in the strip club man
yeah I don't want to see your boy out
here man
listen I'm telling you guys like that's
what I love I saw the guy I loved me man
sounds sounds corny I love myself man
like straight up because like I know
like what people might think of me but
like oh man this guy's crazy
this guy's this and that but I
love myself like like I know I'm like
super cool man like I do so much cool
 man like I wish I could find
somebody that was like me you know cuz
even my own friends they're not like me
they don't do all this cool like I
do a lot of cool and coding I do a
lot of cool in music cool
 gaming I when I go out I
 I do it big kid you know what I
mean so it's a whole different you know
whole different aura like you know so
it's like I want to create another
channel where it's just gonna be about
just me walling up you know
like I don't know if you guys you guys
remember this guy what's his name
Bam Bam Margera like I think doesn't it
Bam Margera the the skateboard who had a
show on MTV right I'm late I'm very
similar to that guy for some reason like
I do a lot of cushion and it's like you
know people don't think that I do all
this other extra now you know I
made the strip clubs you know slapping
ass and throwing money in the air you
know once in a while we do that too you
know but you know we can't throw that
here on this channel you know like that
will be crazy it's like hey guys no J
ass and some ass like
right now let me see yeah man don't
worry I'm gonna make it pretty soon
chit chit chit chit yeah Casey is not a
big deal a lot of people here sounding
like he made a mistake he did a big deal
man like look the job that I was working
before I decided to take on full-on web
development I was already on my way to
earning like you know I was earning
already fifty thousand right and then
from there I was already on my way to
get 70k as an IT worker IT workers is
just fixing computers and
connecting networks and and
like that right now I left all that
in my first job in what development like
what development related was for $15 an
hour so anybody that would look at it
and be like oh this guy's crazy
but in the long-term it paid off
even more than what I expected you know
what I mean so Casey you good it's not a
big deal you know any nothing it's like
you know especially after taxes man
everybody thinks that oh you start
making so much money man you're talking
about maybe $500 $800 difference like
it's not that much you can't really do
much with 500 hundred so it doesn't
really matter I love you too I'm all man
my lunch my lunch is the same lunch I
always have every time just turkey was a
turkey sandwich less lettuce and tomato
no mayo it has to be honey turkey
sometimes if I if I'm in a good mood a
little bit of mustard on top that's it
no J ass and gasps that sounds good no
yeah yeah yeah
yeah exactly man now I do it on what hey
now I do it I want
hey now I do what I want a Oh God listen
guys you got to have fun in life enjoy
yourself enjoy your time in this earth
cause we gonna die anyways that's the
reality of things and Psyche just have
fun you know but yeah man I'm gonna be
creating this new channel which is going
to be like vlogs and like you know cool
 making some cool man that's if
you guys also if you guys don't follow
me on instagram man make sure you go to
my Instagram go to Instagram calm slash
coding fees or search coding phase on
Instagram and add me right away man
Emile Instagram stop playing you will
see some of my my crazy shits over there
so yeah I mean on Instagram man yeah man
wake sing guys stop worrying about
those the little apps that that has
nothing to do with you guys because when
you get higher you're gonna get hired by
a company a company is gonna need a
developer they don't need wigs the
people who uses wigs or people that
don't know how to code meaning like you
know a small little restaurant or like I
say if one of your friends acts you know
hey can you build me a website even I
don't know don't worry you could just go
to wix.com and build it yourself that's
it but it's not like a platform for
people to make websites like legit
websites and you're gonna lose your your
money you know you're gonna lose loose
time and lose all opportunities because
oh my god
the big bad weights is out there
man everybody that comes from wigs and
be like okay I create a website on Wix
and then I realized I couldn't build
everything that I wanted what do they do
they go hire a developer and that's when
you guys come in and just step take that
job you did when I'm getting a Tesla I
don't know one day man if I call afford
it if I go for it
the Tesla I don't know which one is the
the SUV I will buy the SUV I'm an SUV
man you know what I mean like as you can
see I'm straight SUV up like I like
having space back down on us that's a
little space for my little Ethan little
Ethan's gonna go right there put him
right there you know then you got space
in the back and back of the back where
where are the mentee videos man most of
the mentees could have make it this
weekend well this past week and I
couldn't make it so you know
mentees are coming up this Thursday for
short let's see who shows up I know a
lot of people are busy it's hard guys
people have full-time jobs you know what
I mean and it's like I can't make it any
other day throughout the week because it
has to be on Thursday you know so if
they can't make it you know it's just
gonna be me Matt Ken and you know who
else and Tommy you know then everybody
else might not be able to make it
because they have other things in life
you know they all work too but on
Thursday for sure I'm gonna make up even
if they can't come in I'm gonna tell
them to send me the projects and then
we're gonna go in there and we're gonna
actually you know just the project see
where they upcoming they basically got
an extra week which is great they got an
extra week to to finish their project
which it's okay it's fine
okay John said what do you recommend as
the ratio between learning code and
making pages from my portfolio but what
do you what do you mean what do I
recommend us the ratio between learning
code and making pages okay okay okay
I got it I got it you meant like should
you continue learning to code or start
working on on your portfolio pages I
will say men start building your
portfolio if you already know the basics
HTML CSS start working on your portfolio
build a page get a domain get a hosting
from namecheap.com and upload your or
even Heroku and upload your your
portfolio and then from there continue
learning more but at least have
something out there that one day
somebody searches your name so if your
name is I don't know
Teresa Jones or oh I don't know Jamie
Jones whatever right if your name is
Jamie Jones if I search Jamie Jones I
want to see your face and your website
on Google you know so that should be a
goal because when you start applying for
jobs people are going to search your
name when people search mining they come
up with everything is about code you
know you search Joan Santos Garcia
everything you're gonna find there it's
all about code and people are gonna be
like okay this person's in the industry
this person is having the open-source so
it's like you know then I see some cool
stuff and they're gonna give you more
respect and most likely they're gonna
hire you over somebody else okay besides
adding interactivity to the page well
can you really build with JavaScript and
depending of a webpage I mean this
thing's call electron-electron Jes which
you could actually make um full
applications for the desktop right that
you don't need the internet right
so if you wanted to create like a
application you could just create a wolf
JavaScript or you could create a back
end with no js' or like let's say an
example somebody let's say your friend
is creating a phone application right so
he's creating a phone application he's
creating the next Instagram now he needs
to connect the users to some type of
back end so that's when you come in even
i hate i could create the back end for
you i could create a rest api for you
and then you know you could do it
through that that's a lot of that
you could do with javascript that
doesn't need to be in the web there's
people even doing like controlling
robots and little cars and little things
like that that you could do put it all
in javascript
I know people in the industry easily
working 80 hours per week
me personally I don't like working
anything past fifty fifty sorry and it
anything past forty-five hours a week
period
now do I put an extra work in my own
time for my own projects yes I probably
code for about 80 hours a week for
different work and probably another 40
or more or my own projects
now I'm gonna is not a coup plan it's
the SUV
the other thing is that you know you
might be dedicating Matt you know it
takes time you know sometimes people
have personalized you know some people
might have boyfriend/girlfriend you know
they need that touch and if now they're
gonna be cheating on them so but you
have to give attention to your your
significant other right now there's a
lot of situations a lot of different
situations that that could be happening
you know via me guys I'm out of here man
you boys out here I almost came out the
car with without like nice to me some
like drugs
we are like Red Bull I don't like
alcohol I don't like none of that all
right I'll see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
