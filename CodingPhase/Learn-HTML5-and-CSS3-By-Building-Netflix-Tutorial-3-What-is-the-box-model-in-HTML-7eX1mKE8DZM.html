your boy Joe aka I do this aka calling
face man
alright man we gonna start breaking down
the Netflix website right remember we
did a screenshot
now we're gonna break it down and see
how we go I should build things you know
section by section right so we come in
over here this the screenshot that we
actually did too much but yeah so pretty
much we're gonna break this down you
know there's a logo there's a left menu
there's a right menu there's text this
is like a title there's a smaller title
there's like a paragraph this is a
button there is a button and this
section is actually on top of a large
image so basically what I want to
introduce you guys to is something
called the box model right pretty much
everything is on top of each other so
they're pretty much just layers right so
let's break this down like this let's
forget about this section here which is
like the bottom because in reality we're
gonna do that later on okay so let's
just focus on this sections that we got
here all right we've got Jumbotron and
we got the header so we have two local
left menu right menu all these white
boxes are text and these two points are
actually you know it's two buttons here
and then behind it there's a section
which this we could call this
their section right all right let's
bring this up there section all right so
remember how this looks all right that's
how the website looks we got to break it
down we say okay let's see how we can
break it down there's a background to it
behind the Netflix logo there's a
background color which is black it's
like a black with an opacity of maybe
seven or maybe eight right and then we
break that down so we say okay we got
the logo that many oh right menu right
so we're gonna start with that right so
as you can see this yellow boxes are on
top of this div if you remember what I
told you guys inside of here so like
let's say an example we wanted to do
that header right we basically we start
with a div div means you know it's just
creating a box right so let's say header
and then we have another section which
is a large image so let's delete this
part large image so this almost exactly
what we have on the image itself it's
just pretty much we breaking it down
large in this section and we got the
header right so inside of the header
then we bring it down even more and we
say ok inside of the header addition our
logo there's let's say logo there's left
menu right menu all right now we gotta
put this into sections so we say ok give
me a div right now I'm just basically
doing a copy and paste copy and pasting
the same thing right now I'll be
learning is just a div tag which is the
simplest tag cuz you're always gonna use
it constantly the div is just a divider
just basically create boxes for you to
put things inside of it so let's say ok
now you have to live let's say in your
large image right which is this right
here
you have the large image then you have a
div section inside of it and inside the
div section you have fonts so like let's
say this is a title there is a small
title there's a paragraph and there's a
smaller title too right and then you
have two vines so let's say for now
let's break it down like this we have
a really small title which is a header
right so you have sidle a small tire
small title this copy does say we have
h1 so going back to this alright h1 is a
header and h6 is a header so the smaller
the number is the larger the letter
becomes and then the higher the the
letter is the number is so I say if it's
a six the smaller the letter becomes so
like let's say an example you see small
title right so this is the first title
that we have there and we look at it we
say okay that's a small title that's a
large title and then there's like a
medium title and then there's a
paragraph right so we come back here we
say okay large title small title and I
say what's in between one to six so
let's say we do our h3 and you say
right there we have paragraph which is
just a bunch of gibberish all right
nobody cares what it says right it's
just a bunch of gibberish for now right
so now let's see let's go back to this
page right now we missing two lines
right so let's say now let's create the
two lines we still inside of this right
just inside a section so let's say let's
copy and paste this again
all right now let's click run
we got logo left menu right menu small
title large title a medium title a
paragraph button one button - and that's
pretty much it so it's that simple
that's how you break down things into
boxes so before you even think about how
the images is gonna look or anything you
just start breaking it down just regular
text and you say okay
inside of the body I have a header
section and inside of the body I also
have a content section which is the
large image right now if we wanted to
basically identify this we could say hey
listen name this by an ID so this right
here are actually parameters right so we
say div tag with an idea of
Hatter and they say his div tag has an
ID of large image so we have that like
that now we just broke it down and now
we know exactly what's actually going on
we have the header we have the large
image and then that's about it for now
I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
