it again man Kota face calm listening
your boy is back I didn't did it again
I'm going to show you guys my top 3 apps
that I use as a programmer right and I'm
going to show you also another tool that
I like alright so for now we're going to
start with solo learn listen if you
actually want to get into programming
you say hey call this life right
coding is life for you right now right
then you have to download this app solo
learn so solo learn is good because it's
just like a way to practice you know you
can come in and say here I want to
practice you know JavaScript right or I
wanted to practice Ruby you could just
go ahead and change it so let's say you
got basic concepts right so it tells if
I hate what is Ruby right definitely
gets you a little test a little
something
so that's oh you got it wrong you can go
through the comment or you could just
come in and say ok click back click on
what framework you got it right cool
right so also to like let's say you go
in and gives you like a little
explanation it tells you hey was a
variable it shows you how to do it you
see X you know X y equals 8 and then you
print it out when you say put 8 put X it
puts up you know eight so you go also to
click there and run the code which is
cool you can practice it's a little bit
slow sometimes I don't know why but I
believe it has something to do with much
and you know you know how it is with my
internet right now I think is the way
how the program works
so that you can come in here and create
something to say this slide
and you come in and put got that sauce
and then let's see if we come in and say
slag see it prints out eight because we
put eight and then it also prints out
got that swag because I invoke that
function right so this is cool because
it also have a whole bunch of different
languages like it's not just Ruby is not
just JavaScript just like a whole bunch
of cool practice of Ruby you can
practice PHP to practice sequel you can
practice Python JavaScript Java source
fundamentals c-sharp you know they have
like symbol a little courses
and that they have here but besides that
I like is for this you know all the cool
 you know just to practice but
sometimes you want to Train sometimes
you are in a doctor's appointment you
know go home and I got to stay here for
so long man you got this app right here
that lets you play around with the code
you go either learn the new code or a
new programming language or just play
around with the code and you say hey I
mean gonna play around with it right in
the console you can create it people
also create cool stuff here too so let's
see let me see
CSS cube list you could actually run it
see actually see what other people are
doing which is cool you know I don't
have time for that and I have something
with it coming here and create a whole
bunch of cool things there's like a cold
pan within the app which is cool but I
don't see myself doing it okay I just
use it for like learning or practicing
like Ruby
you're practicing JavaScript sometimes
just to keep my mind fresh you know what
I mean so this is one one of them right
another one let me see another one of
course it's programming Hut this also is
like solo learn but the only difference
is that you know they want you to pay
for stuff more like whether you come in
and add out of course they have more
courses than so to learn I have a whole
bunch of them so let's say we wanted to
learn a little bit of Java right
preparing a Java course you come back
you have Java here click in there it
tells you though advertising whatever it
not now you go to the course and then
it's like it's like a documentary go
document by documentation like
documentation right so you can go
through the features I think they they
probably just copy this straight from
like somewhere some documentation they
just posted it delay ok cool here's our
characters are here's a flow this is
that this is cool for me because
sometimes I want to look at a you know
documentation and not actually go to the
website I just come here and search it
get I go that's how you do if statements
in java or you know if statement and c++
right or a loop like do a while loop so
that's why use it for all right now got
their commercials all right now of
course you know your boy got a have you
them in here like my other account got
banned so now I have a whole bunch of
courses that I had to rebuy again a
whole bunch of those that I already
finished
they say that still have a finish done
but it's okay because the reason why I
rethought them is because I like to have
as like documentation from myself like
sometimes there's something that I liked
about cold steel's way of how he did
passport and I I might just want to go
in here and actually look at the lecture
okay just doing this loading right now
give it a second
trust me guys is much faster for you
guys my internet sucks but basically you
have all your videos you have all your
lectures they're all all the text and
information that they put within the
course you have it in there so that's
what school you call ask questions
directly
you see oops yeah so you come in see the
course watch the video Q&amp;amp;A there you
could watch the announcements whatever
announcement the person released you can
watch it right here directly if you have
string cast you could share it to your
screencast you know I'm watching with TV
I do that all the time let me see what
else oh yeah and that's about it I think
you know you guys know what udemy is
good it means we're basically we buy
courses for ten dollars and then from
there we just you know watch them right
I usually watch courses that like if I
already know what a if and else
statements right I usually just watch
every part of the beginning of probably
like the first two three hours of a
course I hear it on the car so while I'm
driving I just put it to play so this is
cool cuz it's on your phone right it's
directly in your phone you could use it
like a podcast now another one is
stitcher stitch is one of my favorite
apps and one of the reasons what I added
it because as a developer you guys
should really be part of the community
when I say part of the community I'm
saying like you guys should be listening
to podcast listening to people that talk
about code you know like JavaScript
jabber is
good I want to show you guys my station
so ghosts are like dismiss okay I got
what you should be following : face
podcast right you got the big web show
you got old JavaScript podcast you got
mostly node or angular podcast even
though I don't do angular anymore I like
to know what's going on and that that
our framework just because because
that's one of the first ones that I
started with
I love Ruby so I have to listen to Ruby
podcast the front end happy hour is my
number one podcast is basically like
real developers guys how that work on
Netflix guys that work at LinkedIn
Evernote and they pretty much have a
legit show you know it's not like Joe
Schmo with his little podcast now these
are guys that they're really in the
industry and it's good to hear what the
hello guys are doing in San Francisco
you know what I mean like it's different
for us human in the East Coast or like
when you work in a smaller company but
it's good to know what the guys are
doing at Facebook and guys are doing on
LinkedIn guys are doing on you know
Instagram I like to hear what they up to
you know what I mean so I can get a feel
of the whole industry see exactly what
everyone is working on alright now let
me see do I have anything else for you
guys well now let's talk about like
documentation there's one that I really
like
I come here laravel documentation
yeah so I really enjoyed this one you
know a lot of times I download it I own
the story download it uninstalled it but
it's good because it's like now you have
it on your phone you don't have it on
online where you say oh if I don't have
an Internet or I'm somewhere where I'm
getting no service I could still see the
documentation through here
alright so that's why I like to download
it directly it's pretty cool for you
guys are trying to get into laravel make
sure you download this this app and let
me see what else we got
there's another one that I like let me
see I like the Ruby documentation is
pretty good so this one's not bad
enjoy edit I played around with it
before but it's not one of my favorite
ones I like this one the Ruby handbook
cars a little tutorials is like
documentation and yeah those are my top
five all right
so anyways got make sure you download
those apps and I'll see you guys later
