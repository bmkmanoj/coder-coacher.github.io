doing for you right now so you know
while we do that we just gonna chill
here hang out a little bit I'm gonna
talk about good old solo learn just for
the hell of it just to play around with
it like this is for practice guys you
know this is what I tell you guys like
things like free cocaine coke Adam and
all those stuff like that's for practice
that's not gonna make you an amazing
developer that's not gonna teach you how
to build websites it's just gonna teach
you how to practice all right you can't
learn how to build websites with
something like this but it's great like
once
you know how to build a website how to
build web applications this is great for
whenever you need to let's say you're on
the bus or you're on a train or you're
waiting at the doctor's office
hey download this app so alert it's
pretty cool it's just great to just like
come in just play around with it you
know what I mean so I don't even know
what a hell I'm at I think okay let's
see what they got array manipulation
yeah man let me bring out the chat let
me bring out the chat so I can see
exactly who's in here right it's down
for one month none balance forever right
so whoever signs up pretty much that's
how much the price is going to be seven
bucks a month right I'm doing this like
I'm doing specials every holiday you
know what I mean like if you didn't get
to sign up for the far out a special
before a lot of people I'm telling you
Allah Allah Allah brother lat
a lot of people are actually on the five
dollar plan and they've taken advantage
you know that's really great that's
exactly why I made it when I first
created the website say hey man I'm
gonna start this at five dollars for the
people just because you came from
YouTube right and I believe that was the
code from YouTube or something like that
five from YouTube or something like that
nothing that was the code and then from
me I said you know what I'm not gonna do
this for our special no more the seven
dollar special is not gonna be there no
more
but for this limited time only the new
people who signed up you know people
have been scared to say hey I want to
sign up but I don't know if I should
listen it's seven bucks you don't like
it you cancel it I'm telling you right
now most of the people that are on my
website nobody has really cancelled the
people that have cancelled is because
you know they feel they already got
everything that they need it it wasn't
like hey I cancelled because the website
is bad nah most of the people that have
cancelled have been literally hey I
already got a job I appreciate it
I learned everything that I need to
learn and that's great once you're you
got everything that you need to learn
and you feel like you're done with go
ahead cancel it any moment you could
cancel you know what I mean so yeah man
so I'm just here trying to help people
out man as you guys may know and you
guys can see literally nobody puts
prices like this at this at this price
right and the only reason why I do this
is because I want more people to come in
and learn right like this really nothing
for me that I get out of this to say hey
you know 20 people took my course I
don't care about that I want to see hey
thousands and thousands and thousands of
people took my course so I'll make it
accessible to those people that cannot
afford it and you know once every three
four months I do like a special like
this for seven bucks at seven bucks I
think everybody here can afford that
even if you live in a country that is
not here in the US you could definitely
afford this like we're not asking you
anything crazy then I start freelancing
when I first started I mean I did a a
couple of websites for my friends I can
there's no secret like I used to do
music so also - I have a lot of friends
that is still in that industry and still
doing music so what I did was I was
still going to school doing IT work I
was getting my degree for programming
systems and then at the same time I was
like you know what what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna build the website for my
friends and stuff like that so I did
that right but I don't consider that
like work because my first year I don't
consider anything that I did my first
year I don't consider it work
I consider work once I I got that first
paycheck from a company that was like
okay here you go
you're a developer or hey you know I was
working for a company cuz even the first
company I work for I didn't
work as a developer I mean the title of
it wasn't developer the title was
content editor right but the
requirements were HTML and CSS so that's
how I got that job you know what I mean
so and yeah like I still do freelancing
like I just finished helping out one of
my boys you know for a strip club joint
that he got sounds funny but listening
is money man like that those are the
times that we live in right now you know
what I mean like we are here we ballin
we we're doing a whole bunch of stuff
man we are here throwing money at him
holes but that's what we doing out here
is 20 was it's 2017 like it's the world
that we live in now you know 20 years
ago would have been like hey I'm helping
my friend out to build his lawnmower
company now it's like man my boy just
opened up a strip joint so that's just
how it is man like that's that's what we
live at brain out man you know what I
mean
Filipa say how was the food Joe the food
was great man for the Pinot food man
straight Pinoy straight Pinoy food man
Nicholas went is like yo you too real
man it's true though man I that's that's
the truth man like I'm not gonna deny
money like somebody comes up to me but I
hey man could you build me a point site
yeah I could build you a porn site cool
and give me a free membership so you
know what I mean like I'll build it do I
use WordPress no not anymore I think my
first two years was all around WordPress
and little things like that but it was
definitely surrounded by WordPress like
I used to do themes like let me see I
don't even know if I go let me see if
this websites even there
anymore jsg like this is like super old
portfolio like super duper old but this
was like a wordpress site that I built
back then in this crazy man I look at
the websites that I did back in like
2012 or on there and it's crazy man what
was the name of this thing
world class demo let me see if the
websites still there yeah this thing
still exists all of the stuff here was
actually yeah I built this whole team
for this company like my boy did the
design and basically I built it HTML CSS
and then I did it was with WordPress and
I mean this website looks horrible you
know to my standards now I mean even
back then the reason why this website
looks old shitty is like I was working
with this company call what was it crazy
no cats I a story and cats I astoria I
was working with this company cats I let
me see I don't even know that they even
closed down cats I design yeah cat site
web design it was like a super sketchy
super sketchy digital agency but you
know I was getting money but what suck I
was just getting paid by by the hour and
I wasn't getting no benefits I wasn't
getting nothing the person that died
managed this whole team
she didn't know anything she liked her
websites look horrible
because in her head it's not about you
know it's not about building
good-looking sites and web sites that
you know people are gonna come in and be
like oh wow this people created this
website not to her it's more about hey
how fast can you build a website like
all of these websites the maximum
turnaround was like three days it's like
okay builders in three days do a
front-end back-end and freaking launch
it on the website like because in her
head and she was like oh yeah it's like
when I send it to the Indian workers
like they build it right away and it's
like you don't understand that they
selling you themes like they're selling
you pre-made themes and she didn't
understand that and I was just like I'm
out of here man I need I need to start
working with like real real companies
man now I mean I don't listen to no
Hopson man
I don't listen to no house and get old
man get that kid body here man you know
who I listen to I listen to rich the kid
I listened to risk the kid I listened to
your boy flexing fab I listen to a
little peep I listen to little Tracy I
live listen to who else I listen to
little baby he's dope right now he's
killing arena I listen to a lot of
southern music man yeah I've been
listening to southern music since 2001
when the tea ice album come up 24 TI 24
24 hour
what year did that come up well 2003 all
right and before tea I used to like
outcasts and our UGK because at some
point we used to live in Texas and if
you know about Texas Texas is all about
UGK so I've always had my thing for like
UGK because the thing is like even how I
speak now like people but all you speak
yeah no you speak slang listen man you
know when I came to this country I
didn't know nothing about English man
people used to talk bad about me behind
my back
in English they're like oh this kids so
stupid he don't understand why I'm
saying and like they look like little
kids will say stuff like that I remember
in third grade and then I went to a
party no matter of fact before that like
before that I learned English because I
heard I went to a stupid high colas like
a thrift shop and I bought DMX get at me
dawg right this sounds crazy now to
think about it like what the hell was I
doing like in third grade
listening to get out or look this one
this hour it wasn't even an album it's
like a a CD this is the first city I got
so I remember before that I had got
introduced to hip hop because of JC's
hard-knock life and I was like oh it's a
hard life and I don't even know what the
hell the guy was saying I was like and
then I like that I was like okay this is
cool
but before that I was just straight you
know straight merengue bachata straight
Dominican mode somebody put me on my my
cousin who used to live out here he put
me on to hard-knock life
I didn't have an hour right then from
there I went to a thrift shop and I
bought the get a me dog CD which was a
single city I still don't know ain't no
English right definitely I continued
continue listening to music I bought was
a puff daddy's what the one after the
notorious big died the one that had
Benjamins on it I bought that album and
there was an old thing I started
learning English so my English comes
straight from rap like I don't know my
English is not like all this person
learned it from school now or like hey
your parents speaking nah my sauce comes
straight from the mother tree you know
what I mean like hip-hop like that's
where my swag comes from you know what I
mean I got I don't know anything
different than that you know what I mean
like hip-hop raised me you know and
that's just how it is you know what I
mean but it's crazy you know I was like
those other people that taught me
English yeah life after death yeah man
so then at some point we was living in
Texas I remember listening to you GK
like the people will be talking about
you GK educate this Oh got that link and
I'm like what the hell they talkin about
and then I picked it up I like okay and
I started slurring my words you know
like the sauce that I got I've been
having that sauce like things that
people do now people were doing that in
Texas years ago man like the sauce man
ace town man like we was out there
dripping okay like that's been around
for a minute all right and then now it's
like a resurgence of like people coming
out and then the person that really
brought it out you know when you talk
about sauce you got this guy I'm gonna
give you guys a little history down down
the line with the sauce back in the day
is with the sauce there's this guy
called j-money show you right now
j-money mister futuristic like one thing
that you're gonna know about me like I'm
like I don't know like a hip-hop
historian kid like I bring it back so
yeah there you go
mr. futuristic he's the one that started
bringing it back I'm talking about the
sauce right and that was like a while
back that was like I don't know maybe
like 20 2009 20 2008 something like that
right now
then from there like almost ten years
later comes out the sauce twins you know
what I mean and then this with the drip
comes from you know what I mean like
people come in but like you know I got
that drip you know we got that drip you
know what I mean so that's the socially
all right there you know what I mean now
from the socially accom the other kids
it's like his kids who are like famous
decks
you got famous Dex he brought back the
sauce he continued with the sauce and
then you know it's like I expanded the
sauce ah ah cool you know one of these
days somebody's gonna be on YouTube like
yo man I remember when this kid your boy
Joe some guys some developer man he
expanded the sauce to web development
and then the sauce just continues being
passed down you know what I mean like we
in here man you know what I mean that we
we passed down the sauce you know that's
what we do out here
wear it man
wherever and we in here kids but yeah
man we here for that seven for
Thanksgiving man if you want to sign up
to the website this is your chance guys
I'm gonna repeat this for the next few
days Friday Saturday Sunday Monday so
those four days by Tuesday at twelve
o'clock in the morning that's gone right
and we only gonna do this like once
every four or five months so take
advantage now like you're pretty much
gonna pay way less than everybody else
and that's fine you know the people are
paying 10 bucks 15 bucks 20 bucks in
reality you're getting what the course
is worth I mean you're getting more than
what the courses are worth but at the
same time we also want to welcome people
that are still second-guessing
themselves you know what I mean like if
they still think like man I don't know
if I should pay 20 bucks I don't know if
I should pay 15 bucks like you guys know
the quality that you guys are getting
and you're getting cool projects you
know so it's up to you man
and do it all now I was in the army
getting drunk every day man
oh no what was I doing on that man all
night I was still in school man and it's
crazy because I finished school I
finished high school in 2005 all right
so I finished high school 2005 I was out
I was out of school and then I went I
went to I went to ABS freakin school
called IAR right I went to IR to learn
how to become a audio engineer which is
the reason why I tell people don't go to
this boot camps because they charge you
so much money for something that you can
learn on your own and when you get there
you're gonna realize that hey you're not
getting top quality education you know
what I mean like you're just getting
people that's trying to get money you
know and that's just how it is that's
how it is with Apex that's how it is
with DeVry that's how it is with every
school out there and that he could think
of like all those independent schools
like they just out there for the money
man is a business all right and then
you're the Sheep that ends up in those
businesses you know what I mean and it's
like the same thing that I tell you guys
with what people out here just trying to
kick it like me I'm never going to be
one of those guys that are here to to
prey upon the people that that need help
like you guys know me people leave me
comments and messages all the time like
you know Joe you the realest person out
here this is not yeah because I was just
like you a few years ago man like why
now like okay I got all the knowledge
that I need it I learn how to build all
this stuff and I could get any job at
any time that I want but okay I got to
that skill set but that doesn't make me
different than anybody else here you
know what I mean and then at the same
time it's like it should be that
we want to empower people to have more
skills and get more more opportunities
so society can actually be better you
know because there's like a lot of the
people that complain and a lot of the
people that do bad things in this world
is because they're not set you know what
I mean like if I'm somebody that's like
you know I'm working on whatever
McDonald's I'm making $8 an hour you
know I'm already bored with life you
know there's people out there they're
just walking around looking for a fight
looking to get into some some problem
looking to get out of work and soon as
they get home they want to get drunk and
they want to get high whatever right
but that's because they haven't found
that call and they haven't been able to
to find a place where they could be
comfortable so if I found a place where
I could be comfortable
why wouldn't I share that with other
people's you know what I mean like we
don't need to be multi millionaires
multi billionaires like that doesn't do
anything to us
accumulating wealth doesn't do anything
to nobody you know what I mean like
those people that be like oh man I'm
freaking I blow five thousand dollars in
one shot throw in the air yeah you could
do that but how about you just use that
money if you want to throw money in the
ate throw 500 right use the rest to
build something that you can help other
people and hire them and you know it's
like a cycle man you know like I believe
in what people call like you know the
the Reagan economics or was it
Reaganomics where it's like if you are
in power you can come in and trickle
down money to the people below you and
Britt helped them come up the scale of
classism right but the problem is that
the people that's on top they like now
man we already on top man how are we
gonna give money to the people at the
bottom how this thing is gonna get
trickled down now man let's let's try to
make as much profit as possible and say
hey we know we could sell this product
for let's say you know this this freakin
Samsung right this
doesn't cost a thousand dollars to make
like everybody knows that this thing
should be $200 right but what do they
want to do they want to sell it for you
know uh $800 profit it's the same thing
that happened with EA EA games the other
day they released a game and then as
soon as they released the game
everybody's like you know we're not
supporting you because as soon as you
come in you gotta pay to win you know
what I mean it's like every day you're
already paying $60 why do I have to
continue behind stuff of a game that's
supposed to bring all those things so
it's the same thing with the courses you
know people come in and be like hey man
I'm selling you a course for like seven
hundred bucks right but you know what
I'm gonna be nice to you I'm gonna give
you you're gonna pay that seven hundred
bucks and like three payments right and
they they make you think like oh yeah
it's like 700 bucks is not that bad if
we come in and we divided by three we
say you know 700 divided by 3 we get
$233 oh that's not bad as $233 that I'm
gonna spend for you know the next three
months and I'm gonna get so much value
out of it and it's like yeah but you
know damn well it's not worth $700 so
what is it that you're doing you're
basically pocketing so much money you
know you pocketing so much profit like
who are you helping you know it's like
20 people are gonna sign up you know me
I try to you know try to give people as
much as I can like I rather this would
think that a lot of people don't even
understand like if you come in like look
right now I'm doing a seven dollar gift
for tens giving this a seven dollars for
Thanksgiving so all my courses you get
access to all my courses for seven
dollars the people on udemy they pissed
off because they're like yo you
releasing courses on udemy so then in
reality it bites me in the butt behind
because if I release on udemy
exclusively then they'll come in and
promote it like you
the people that support me will come in
and buy courses from there so then my
course will become popular on you to me
and then it becomes a cycle of like the
more people that buy buy and also the
more people that get on high colas that
get to review it the more people that
don't know me get to buy it so in
reality that makes so much money if I
was to do it like that but what happens
what happens is that I rather just give
it out to the people and get you know
thousands and thousands and thousands of
people to come in and enjoy the courses
because I'm this is something that I'm
gonna do forever like I'm not planning
on stopping to doing courses and
creating stuff like the website called
coding fees but there's so many other
things that I want to do with coding
phase two like you know so many skills
that I have like I haven't shown you
guys you know a graphic design web
design I haven't given you guys my 3d
work I haven't given you guys you know
how you call it creating games with HTML
CSS in JavaScript we haven't talked
about using C sharp to work with stuff
like unity or or using this alone how
you call it this game engine called
Godot gold that but some people call it
go don't go down and this like sky's the
limit plus tomorrow might be that
somebody comes up with you know angular
7000 you know what I mean angular 7000
so then I from there will create another
course called angular 7000 so in reality
as a membership you getting so much
value like you constantly gonna get
courses no matter what you know what I
mean like when you buy courses from you
to me you buying one course at a time
every single time right like our person
personally would like to have like a
membership to if Stephen Ryder had work
right Stephen Greiner had a membership
he had like let's say 15 20 bucks $10 or
you know membership I will be a member
to well but our cool every month that
Steven granite drops a new course I get
to using and then I get access to all of
his courses so that's something that
they're not doing so that's what I'm
doing you know what I mean you get
access to everything but yeah man I'm
here to help man you do the food bank
right now I don't I don't even know is
that
you know that's how it is man yeah I
agree with you Casey Casey say give some
$1,000 who are poor next week there will
be poor so next week don't be poor
anyways and then take away money from
someone who has a thousand dollars and
then the next week that will have it
right back again and that's true
live from Africa live from Kenya what up
how's my people doing man how's my
Kenyans
how you guys doing man what up you know
I love it I love the fact that when I go
to my website I see all the time like
people all over the world man like I
constantly see that I wonder I mean
right now people probably busy
let me see Google Analytics let's see
where we got people on the website right
now I know tonight it's probably not
gonna be too busy because it's
Thanksgiving but let me just see who's
in here you know on Thanksgiving we got
people all over man let me see locations
you got United States we got Hong Kong
like you got people all over right and
in the day time it's crazy when it's
like morning time I'll be seeing like
this whole thing lit up like Africa lit
up all right and then certain times like
at this time you're always gonna see
people in the United States be on all
right then later on like I say when here
is like 12 o'clock you start seeing
Europe being lit up then when it's like
4 o'clock around here you know I'll be
seeing you know a lot of people in India
I don't know what's the time difference
between 4 o'clock here in India but it's
always people for India
here at that time so it's like it's cool
man
I wish I could reach out more to the
people down here in Latin America
because it kind of sucks man it kind of
sucks like a half a lot of people in
Brazil I have a lot of people in
Colombia but I feel like it kind of
sucks that you know more people could be
enlightened you know what I mean like I
was telling my little brother my little
brother lives in Dominican Republic and
yeah he lives in Dominican Republic and
he just had he just got his girlfriend
pregnant and he's super young he's like
18 19 years old
and I'm telling him yo you got to get on
this you gotta learn how to Co so when
you come here to the US I can help you
out and help you find a really good job
but for him it's hard because there's
really not that many people Latin
America doesn't have that like you know
nobody's really pushing for that you
know that's like one of our dreams and
that's one of the things that I said
from the beginning that I wanted to do
is like I want to go to this countries
and and help help it grow you know what
I mean
you know that mean so yeah man
look we got people from the Philippines
without Philippines what up
Pinoy camasta come on start with the
bias on the televised you're my Filipino
sucks my Filipino accent sucks man
starting the portfolio lesson pretty
soon man as good man
word word word Argentina sucks
I hear Argentina's good man the people
that created crystal Lang they're from
Argentina seems like there's some type
of business out there you know what I
mean it's some type of business out
there man but so that's good just here
looking at this let's see was this
filling the blanks to create an array
see like this is like this is great for
somebody who already knows this stuff
like I can't see somebody learning
anything out of this now you come in
here solo learn like yeah you can follow
along but you can't really learn how you
know somebody sent me an email I hope he
don't I don't know I feel like putting
it up because sometimes people don't
believe that when somebody sent me an
email like they're true or something but
they are true somebody sent me an email
that right now they're doing the the web
developer bootcamp and they did it one
time and now they're doing it a second
time and it's a great course but you
gotta have some type of knowledge to
like really understand everything right
if you're trying to learn JavaScript I
don't think you could learn everything
about JavaScript from that course you're
gonna have to continue looking in other
places to continue learning JavaScript
and getting better and I think one of
the biggest problems nowadays with any
programming language is the fact that
nobody tells you hey this is where you
use a loop this is why you use an array
this is why you use etc right like I
don't see that happening in a lot of
courses I see it in my courses you know
but I don't see in a lot
people like and you know that's why
people get lost because it's like you
could come in here and go through like
something like this like so low learn
and being okay what is the output of
this code okay you're lost already
you're like okay what the hell so you
have to come back read through this
whole thing and you're like wait what
the hell how do I do this but once you
get all of the stuff and you come in and
you put in the answer what happens next
how do you use that to build your
applications or the applications of your
job how do you how do you work on that
right how how do you choose which one is
better do you use an array do you use a
string when do you use a string when do
you use a number you know like it sounds
dumb but at the same time it's like if
you don't teach people when is it that
you gotta use those things then they're
not gonna know the language they're just
gonna know how to follow along with this
little there's a little things here like
oh drag-and-drop this tool to try to get
this right
and if you don't get it all you have to
do is just keep trying until you get it
like this happens all the time people
keep trying and trying and trying and
trying until they get in then I oh yeah
I got it and they move on to the next
thing you get what I'm saying
so it's weird you know
yeah I agree with you I definitely agree
with you skeleton hours on watching this
guy because this is a thing I still buy
courses even if I don't need it
origins learn the things that I need
from the documentation I still like to
buy the courses because when I buy a
course it's not because I want you to
teach him I want you to break it down
for me so I don't have to waste my time
you know and that's one of the things
that a lot of people can't do that break
down you know because we call all come
in here and be like hey you're like
let's say an example skeleton could
literally could come here to solo learn
copy everything that's here read it word
for word on a freaking on a video and
then sell that course and you know hey
here's a course but it's he breaking it
down you know what I mean like breaking
it down means like hey this is a
difficult subject how can I
Johnny Johnny doe who has never done
programmer who has never done anything
like this how can Johnny doe learn this
you know what I mean like people forget
about that they forget that people don't
know programming you know
why do I buy courses if you don't need
them because you still got it at some
point you know like number one for me I
like to see which one are the good
courses number one because I like to
learn from them I like to learn the fact
you know if somebody breaks it down
pretty well or not it's like personal
reviews like if you go back to all my
videos in the beginning I used to do
reviews of every course that I used to
buy but now I just don't but I still buy
courses because I want to see what the
other person has you know what I mean
and sometimes there might be a subject
that I could learn on my own but I don't
want to spend the time of looking
through the documentation you get what
I'm saying
like for example like i'ma show you
right now let's go to you to me let's
see let's see what courses I have two
accounts I have one account which got
banned from you to me and that was
because I was abusing it like I will buy
a course and then if it was garbage I
will return it that same moment so then
they flagged me and they were like oh
man like you're you know you're freaking
how you call this I will flag it know
they will flag me because I will return
it right away
and I will buy like five courses in one
day and then be like oh garbage garbage
garbage garbage because there is a lot
of garbage on on you to me there's
definitely a lot of garbage and I'll be
honest like this was one of them like
this course for fazer Jes is horrible
like horrendous and then the guy he
realized that the course is so bad that
he might as well just give it out for
free on a frickin udemy
so this course is like introduction to
face at us and understanding colliders
and tile maps and distance and that but
it's so bad like like this is the game
like who wants to learn something like
this who wants to look at something like
this no like I'm sorry like this is dumb
you know it's a horrible course for you
to me for phase rjs
and then you got this other one hold on
where is it and then you got this other
one which is just as bad like like I
don't know how to explain it like the
way how this other guy teaches it it's
so bad too because he doesn't even give
your introduction of how things work how
games are how games actually work or how
things colliding like it's just dumb
like that's not how you teach because if
I'm a developer and I come in I'm like
yo I'm trying to learn how to make games
in HTML CSS and JavaScript
well html5 whatever that's not how you
teach people you teach people in a way
that you keep them engaged like I
started like this is so such a dumb game
that I don't even want to build it like
I started taking this course to see what
this guy has and in reality I don't take
the course like to do it I take the
course to like listen to it on the car
and understand the concepts and then
when I get home I built them but they
myself it's not like I'm following the
video but
the game is so stupid like who the hell
wants to actually build this who the
hell wants to come in and spend two
three hours building a stupid horse that
goes from the left to the right every
time you click on on the little arrow on
the side like teach people by building
things that they're gonna be excited
about you know what I mean can you make
really cool games we face a J s yes you
can
let's talk about this okay so we got
it's that I oh there's a website for
those of you guys that want to get into
creating games all right you know just
because you started as a web developer
doesn't mean that that's where you're
gonna end up at you gotta understand
that so okay like there's so many
different games that you can do let me
see a lot of these games are made in and
phaser so let me see if I can search
phaser real quick find one that's cool
a lot
it's that I oh yeah like I really like
this thing this website is pretty legit
let me see browser tools game assets
okay game assets this is cool cuz you
could get like a whole bunch of little
game assets to build your game and get
you started so let me see search for
free there's a guy who who creates low
light this is hot
like something like this like you take
this free assets and and create a game
that people are gonna be excited about
like people want to learn that from you
you know what I mean but if you're
making a stupid game where you got
horses and freaking puppies and stuff
going from left to right it's like who's
gonna be excited to want to learn that
you get what I'm saying
okay like this guy this game right here
is made with with freaking phaser Jes
and this is cool cuz it's like a full
game this is not
oops this is not like something that
that is hard to do
that's pretty simple yeah what I'm
saying like the guy who created this
thing I forgot what's his name his name
is Aang CMAs he got a whole bunch of
assets that he creates
he's are a pixel artists see it's
loading there and then there you go like
all of this there's a looks dope man
and also to is all about the the
resolution like just because the
resolution looks all pixelated like
that's the idea of the game that's how
I'm supposed to be but if you have other
bigger assets like you can do this
and you see the the parallax scrolling
in the background like this is pretty
dope all of this is done with phaser Jes
and like you could create any game that
you could think of that is on that you
see like on something like on iOS or
Android
you could build games like that for face
like Jes now if you're dealing with 3d
stuffed and that's different then you
want to do something like unity or or
something like oh that see that's
something that he gotta fix you gotta
fix the colliders right here see this
thing is supposed to go up like that he
didn't code the game that well
all right so yeah I mean sky's the limit
man it's all about your imagination if
if you could think you could build it
fine eating I mean it's one o'clock in
the morning I mean I'm not gonna be
eating at this time
yeah man
yes sir tell me whatever you like guys
if you if you want to learn read books
don't buy courses from anyone most of
the developers out there have bad habits
and don't know the complete knowledge of
the language save you move it saves your
money please
yeah I agree with you this is not
definitely a lot of bad things out there
but you can't just completely
generalized everybody to be in that same
boat you know g-money say yo you review
Co Co new events boot camp choice
I mean it's alright but that course is
is not really cold steel's course it's
like cold steel already has his name
he's very popular so what he did was he
reached out to other developers that I
already had courses and basically said
hey do you want to be part of this do
you want to be a co-owner of this course
and then we split it even between all of
us and it's like yeah it's like is it
really a cold steel course or like you
know what I mean like this this course
to like you guys remember the PHP course
that I told you so I like this guy
what's his name Ruby on Rails
yeah
so look this course says right Percival
created the Kois so me personally I
don't like Rob Percival all right but
for a lot of people they'd be like all
right Percival I bought the what
developer 2.0 whatever from him so I
like his courses listen once your name
is popular on udemy you got other other
instructors that hit you up like hey man
I got this great course can you sell it
for me and I'll split the money even
with you so that's what's happening here
like I like this guy much what's his
name I start master husain his courses
are pretty legit right but what he need
to do to actually sell courses he needed
to go and give it to Rob Percival
because Rob Percival has been here since
the beginning of time so it's the same
thing that's happening with cold steel
that course is not from cold steel that
courses from other developers that gave
it to cold steel because cold steel
already has a name so it's like at the
same time you kind of feel like I don't
know like backstab because you're like
man I'm here for a cold steel course and
then you realize it's like oh it's
Johnny Schmo from the block selling you
this course but it just happens to say
cold steel and that's why I haven't
really supported it out here I haven't
told people I hate go get a kiss if I
like cold steel I'm there for cold steel
like let's be honest a lot of this
topics a lot of people can teach it to
you there's not something like oh this
person is the the most expert in the
world like the most expert in the world
those guys they're not teaching online
they just not right but when people buy
a course is because thief they have a
certain connection would our instructor
and feel like hey this person could
teach it to me break it down for me in a
way that I like it all right and that's
what happens with cold steel that's why
I like him but with this other games
like I don't know man like this other
guys I don't know if you know
I can't really mess with them like that
but as a thing is like people you know
people care so much about money man like
coast he already makes mad money man
like he makes two million dollars a year
like this is not like chump change guys
Cold Steel made two million dollars this
year and still with the years not over
you know what I'm saying so you're
getting paid two million dollars a year
like come on you guys pay me two million
dollars a year I'm busting my ass I'm
working super hard and I'm building
stuff myself but it's like then from
there now people feel like oh they like
me they like my name so now I'm gonna
take other people and put them under me
as my pupils you know and it's like coke
like I'm here for you man I'm not here
for the people that's below you you know
what I mean it's like it's like people
go to was this guy's name Tony Robbins
show right and it says Tony Robbins and
his friends and when you get there
there's no time there's no Tony Robbins
only his friends you're gonna be pissed
off you're gonna be like what the hell
like I'm here for Tony Robbins like what
the hell you got what I'm saying go to
gap that ai gap that AI what the hell is
this seems like I already found this
place before or something the channels
free strange individual liberty free
flow information online what the hell is
this
that sounds like
this is another freaking social network
like I can't imagine this place is full
of like Trump supporters like I'm not
going into this place man like a lot of
these places where it's like you know
free free flow information individual
liberty a lot of those places like the
idea it seems good but then it's like
people who'll go in there they mess up
the idea
like I could just imagine this whole
thing is like flooded with a Trump
supporters like I mean it's cool free
speech but it's like you know man
I'll check it out
I'll definitely check it out yeah man I
wouldn't be surprised somebody trying to
take me down like you know I'll call
somebody a thought out here and they out
me like Joe calls a thot to somebody or
something crazy like you know what I
mean so
yes it does recurring payments but for
some reason some people like if they
don't have money in their bank account
the next time you know it stops right
there it gives you like three three
times to give you the opportunity but if
you don't have money in there it will
just cancel your account Joe called the
Queen of England I thought it word and I
say yeah like I myself I'm trying to
like stay stay how to not assay like the
more of a public figure I'll become like
more people get to know me like god I
gotta go through like my social media
clean it up like you know what I mean
like there's so much stuff that probably
is out there from like me being or sixth
grade or something on MySpace talking
ish or something I don't know you know
what I mean like people be pulling up
stuff from like 2001 is like you said
something sexist in 2001 and you're like
wait I was like 14 years old like yeah
you can't be a political anything
nowadays it's too bad right now it's
it's too ridiculous even with this whole
thing of like that's happening right now
everybody getting out it like where was
where was these people like you know
what I mean like people like oh he raped
me he raped me sounds like now now
sounding like us if it's like Oprah
giving out gifts and stuff like you'll
get a rape charge you'll get a rape
charge you'll get a rape charge you'll
get every like it sounds crazy you know
many people are crazy nowadays I think
social media kind of messed it up for a
lot of people
like it's crazy nowadays it's too it's
too political like and then it's too
political and then people the the real
things the real issues out there people
don't want to talk about like that's was
crazy
now I don't know I don't know about that
man
the problem with right-wingers is you're
not to go too deep into it it's just man
I like a lot of the ideas from it but
then there's people in there like the
Bad Seeds like this racist people out
there man like that's the problem like
there's certain things I like about the
right-wing that's why I would say the
best thing would be to add another
another political party because this
thinks that you know somebody that I
mean I wouldn't go with in the left side
and these things that I wouldn't go with
on the right side so there has to be
like a middle ground like a middle party
like I can't be too right I can't be too
left so it has to be they need to have
like a middle party and it kind of sucks
cuz here's like the Independent Party is
it's like a joke to everybody because
there's not enough money so that's the
problem you know what I mean so yeah
yeah that's what I'm saying I think I
consider myself very conservative in a
lot of things but at the same time we
can't deny like this people that just
there's more racist people on the
conservative conservative side then on
the left-hand side and it's just part of
America that's just how it is you know
they just gotta come up with something
right I don't know like in the middle
link you know somebody who's just not
who was not too much sort of left too
much to the right
now I don't think I don't think the
programmers that are out there they're
not to the right guys I'm being honest
like they're like super leftist like
they super to the left like trust me
like anybody like transporters or
anybody out there like those guys are
like they're not to be seen at all you
can't say anything like that's against
the left side as a developer like you
just can't because the the majority is
so overwhelming oh it's like a 95 to 5%
it's like you know what I mean like it
just it doesn't work like that
somebody who dies before he began his
speech word now I think look
although the stuff is gonna die out at
the end of the day I'm being honest I
think all of this stuff is gonna die out
with time give it some time I know it
you know cuz the thing is there's still
a lot of people from the old generation
there's too many people from the old
generation those people gotta once they
start dying out then it'll be totally
different you know cause it's like I
could bet you know 50 years ago there
was more racist things out there right
of course
like you was dinner where people were
like a few you know was 60 70 years ago
people you can't drink from the same
water fountain can't be in the same bus
etc right um like by now all that stuff
has been taken away now with time the
people who are still old and still have
those power like those people are gonna
be away by that time you know what I
mean
exactly we're gonna be dead but that's
how it's gonna be for the next
generation for my son or his sons you
know like let's say by that time look
when my son has his son the majority
pretty much the minority might be you
know all the white people here
and I don't think it's just you know
it's a big issue like being white it's
not a thing it's just here in the US
because in Dominican Republic there's
white people that's black people this
people who have descendants of Indians
it's all type of people but you don't
feel this thing of like political racism
and all the stuff that happens here you
only see that here in the United States
and South Africa that's the only places
you see there like you don't see it any
other places even in Europe is not like
that
listening is gonna happen the numbers is
there man conservative Marco program is
like why is when I would be a minority I
mean they already are in the world if
you start looking at it there's so many
mixed people like who's white anymore
you know what I mean like this who's
white who's black holes
this isn't that like that does in a few
more years that doesn't matter that's
not gonna matter at all
yeah exactly it's only here in the u.s.
man it doesn't matter you know like at
some point all of this stuff is gonna
change yeah exactly everybody's mixed
I mean let's see before we go to sleep
see if they have
look the largest race in the whole
planet is Asians like Chinese like you
know and I wouldn't be surprised so to
say that you know that white people
would never be a minority like it's
already happened you know I think that's
one of the reasons why so many people
are so scared to hold on today they're
they're a race so so bad it's because
they see it like everybody's mixing like
soon there's not gonna be a race
soon there's gonna be just human beings
so everybody's gonna be mixed so some
people don't like that some people they
were like oh we gotta stay separate you
gotta stay with this race you got to
stay with this race because we don't
want to mix but it's just gonna happen
this the people who are pure breed or
whatever you want to call them like they
gotta be such a minority like people are
gonna look down on them like you're not
mixed you don't got aging black and
Hispanic on you
you're weird like that's how it's gonna
be like for little kids in the future
we have an
conservative marker programming now we
just say like it's just not gonna matter
you know whatever race you're from it
doesn't matter that's like so dumb
like we're in 2017 you know I was like
you know by 2037 is like nobody's gonna
be like oh I'm this it's like I'm just
like I'm a human being that's it you
know what I mean so anyways guys if you
