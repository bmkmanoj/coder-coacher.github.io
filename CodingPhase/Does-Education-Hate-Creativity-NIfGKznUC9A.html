man cutting face calm your boys back and
not and did it again
guys listen there's a very special
article right here hacker news man
thus education kill creativity this is a
very bold statement from this guy
his name is Eric PM vermeulen he's a
professor executive an entrepreneur
shares insights about how digital world
is changing the ways it's too long buddy
your your subtitles too long and we love
you me now but um guys like this is
special right because I agree with this
a lot of times I'm gonna tell you this
little story I don't know if I told it
here oh I was going to Brooklyn Tech in
Brooklyn make sense right Brooklyn Tech
in Brooklyn yeah so I was going there
for my communication design degree are
you bachelor's degree and pretty much
I'll no forget this I was in an HTML
class HTML 101 I've been doing HTML for
over 10 years I started doing this at
freaking 14 years old like I know HTML
like there's really no need to anybody
come in and try to teach me anything
cuz I know HTML I know how to do I know
how everything works I've been doing
this for a long time right
there's like when some people come in
and try to tell me you're missing this
HTML why aren't you using the header
attack so like your header Dave like bro
I've been doing this for I've been doing
this is 14 years old
shut your mouth don't tell me nothing
right so I'm joking man but yeah
basically I was in this class and one of
the teachers don't say okay she's
teaching us like a real ugly website
like the basics on top of that she was
using
how you called us Adobe Dreamweaver
right
and she's like okay guys I want you guys
to create a menu system on the top and I
want you guys to create a little
paragraph with you know something about
you and then just on the bottom put a
little footer copyright by your name
right and I'm like okay cool
I'm gonna come back to class I'm gonna
create an amazing website responsive I'm
making you know the menu click on the
many on the table the menu pops off to
the side every single icon shows up you
know by using delays and animation so
it's like a nice something that you
could be proud of something that if I
was showing it today would be like on
the top page of compendial alright so
I'm there creating this stuff I build it
I show up to the class she goes like
where is the menu this looks nice it has
some nice colors but where is the menu
and nothing in my head I'm like wait are
you good teacher or or not like in my
head I'm thinking man you're teaching
HTML 101 and you've never seen a
freaking hamburger write a hamburger
menu and she's like literally go like
this with the mouse moving from side to
side she's like but where is the minion
I can't find him any and I'm thinking in
my head like this I'm like this was what
this was like 2013 around there 2012
2013 and I'm like I'm like this shocked
by the fact that this person is teaching
HTML and I go like you come here to the
right you click there there's a little
button see that little thing that's
actually a menu that's actually a
standard online now and she's like oh no
this isn't what I asked you
I'm like
this is how things are done right now
this is how the web is going this is how
things are made and she's like oh no
this isn't what I asked or what I axed
was too many just on the top just the
words here and that's it that's all I
wanted from you and I'm like I can't do
that but that's not being creative
that's not coming here and creating
something like people were coming in
with websites like this man no lie guys
I'm not lying people were coming in with
websites like this I came in with a full
design like guys I've been doing this
for so long man
like I'm really good people were coming
on the websites like this in 2013
because they're brand new developers I
mean there wasn't even developers there
designers who are learning HTML me I'm a
developer I know what the hell I'm doing
I was just taking a communication design
degree but I've I'm a freaking developer
I've been doing this for a long time I
had interest in this for a very long
time right so I go in there we're an
amazing website and this lady she's just
picking apart my website and I'm looking
at other people's websites like this and
I'm like are you seeing what I'm seeing
right now yeah uh-huh are you seeing
what I'm seeing in this course in this
class and she's like no but the problem
is that you and you didn't do what I
told you to do when I run it was a
simple many on top and this is where it
comes to this guy's message here you
know what he says does education can
creativity why we must be more creative
about the education of the future right
now of course he goes into more details
and other stuff but the title alone hit
hit up a core in me right and it's just
like man education it's pretty dumb
marry in the sense of going you somebody
creative when you're somebody smart and
you're out of the box like you're you're
not supposed to be in that type of
because they haven't created anything
like that teachers come in with a book
that tells you oh this how you supposed
to do it if anybody else does it a
different way than this that's a - right
so mind you I know all this stuff I
helped out every single person in the
class to pass the class because people
you know there's people that just don't
like to come there's people that just
hate they look at that and then I they
brain start freaking turning into mush
right they look at the code they're done
it's like glazed over their eyes and
everything but I helped everybody in the
class fast you know what the teacher
gave me a b-minus
and I actually why did you give me a
b-minus she was like well on your your
very first test I gave you a 65 and I'm
like when did you give me a 65 she's
like oh you remember that time that you
didn't do the menu and I'm like I'm like
this literally I'm like how the how
do people become teachers if they don't
know what's going on in the industry
this is the main reasons why I tell
people don't even go to college man
because college is not guaranteed the
best education college is guaranteed a
paper doesn't mean that you're gonna
know everything you know how many people
hit me up with computer science degrees
oh my emails and you will think like
somebody with a computer science degree
then I super smart and they know all the
stuff and they're very secure on
themselves it's like no yeah it's like
they got a degree and in reality didn't
even get you know educated the proper
way didn't teach them anything and I saw
that firsthand I was like man how the
hell do I know more than the teachers
and I get a lower grade for being
creative being somebody who is coming
out with some
new something different something edgy
something that's ahead of his time I was
doing stuff that people nobody
understood what the hell was doing I was
like no lie stuff that I see now on
websites I was doing back there so you
know it's like you don't get applauded
for being different when it comes to the
educational system people are are
supposed to follow a certain way a
certain way of doing things
yes I got a look at people you know my
little nephews homework it's like you
could go in there and get the answer and
let's say a certain division right the
you doing a dividing a number you could
go ahead and say hey 12 divided by 4 is
3 right so you come in and somebody will
tell you hey this is wrong you be like
why because you didn't do it the same
way that you were supposed to do it and
you're like wait what you didn't do it
the way how you was supposed to do it we
have a certain format that this is how
you supposed to get the answer if you
didn't follow that way and you're
automatically wrong yeah but it says 3
there that's the number 3 12 divided by
4 is 3
isn't it and in the educational system
nowadays they're like nah you have to do
it our way if not you're wrong that's
some BS man like you know what I mean
this happens all the time that's what
I'm like to me college high school I
mean you gotta finish high school but
college is just straight-up BS man it's
a way to get money it's super expensive
you know it's like a way to get people
back into the the debt system only
certain people get to actually really
get something out of college like if you
go to an Ivy League school and reality
you there for the connections you're not
really there for the education you know
unless you go to MIT yeah you could go
to MIT boy even MIT I don't even think
that they have cuz I look at the courses
they have uh-huh I'm like these are cool
this is our nice is it like mind-blowing
is it totally different than what I was
learning in a community college when I
was doing computer science no it's
pretty much the same but the only
difference is things in MIT you have
teachers that come in and encourage for
you to create new stuff you have other
talented students in the class so that's
what a reality what you're really paying
for to be around those people but the
education itself is the same thing that
everybody else is teaching they're not
teaching you anything else but the good
thing about it is like I said it's the
people that are there right so you can
go in there and be around kids who are
geniuses people who are gonna push you
to become a better developer better
programmer but the education itself is
nothing amazing all right so yeah man
you already know simple job back at it
