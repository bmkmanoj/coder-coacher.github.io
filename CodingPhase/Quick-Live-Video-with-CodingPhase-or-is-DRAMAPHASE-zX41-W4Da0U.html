at it again
coding face.com out here with my West
Coast wag man I'm out here with this
busters man now guys man I love you guys
man I love everybody in here man
it's kumbaya I'm awesome Jesus
right now man you know okay guys kumbaya
everywhere man we all about that kumbaya
what's the etiquette what's the the
right YouTube etiquette when it comes to
comments I mean should I should I not
post like if somebody sends me a message
right I understand if they send me a
message and say hey Joe like privately
you send me an email right and basically
you will send me an email and you say
Joe I got a question about this I got
some calming about this out I got some
suggestions right what is the right
etiquette for somebody to come in and
basically like if you send me a message
right if you send me a message to me if
you send me an email I think that I
shouldn't put you on on YouTube right
now if you send a comment a comments is
a public thing it's like right now it's
like if I go outside and I walk around
naked you're a whole can all right naked
and somebody takes a picture of me naked
in the streets as I bro you can't sue
nobody because it's like you're outside
naked like that was on you you decided
to go to a public space and and be out
here walking around naked you get what
I'm saying like that's how I look at
comments so um yeah so I wanted to do
this quick live because I'm about to go
to the dealership right now in a little
bit and uh you know get a little sunny
yo so word we took this hat from from
your boy cam man so I don't know what do
you guys think what is the right
etiquette right do you guys think that I
shouldn't
when somebody comes in and leaves a
comment which is a public forum right if
somebody comes in and leaves a comment
and I want to answer it all right
because I think they're interesting
there's a lot of comments out there
there are very good comments all right
the comment from yesterday that I
answered like I want o'clock in the
morning was a very good comment I think
I needed to answer to that one because
it's just misinformation I wasn't
getting at the guy wasn't sitting saying
anything to the guy but it was
interesting is if I don't answer to a
comment right if I don't answer to a
comment if I'm not in the in the
community constantly if I don't answer
to everybody's email I get hit it off
because I didn't answer to that person
right so that person hates me like oh
man he answers everybody but he never
asked us to me the moment I answered to
the person then they get mad if things
do not go their way you get what I'm
saying like I don't even think I did
anything wrong last night like I use
literally putting some numbers like okay
this is how you actually do searches on
indeed.com
how is that wrong you know what I mean
like you know I come in here man kumbaya
I'm not even doing it man this is
kumbaya man like this is what I'm saying
man like it's crazy laughing man I'll be
laughing for real man like there's no
way out you know what man this I know
this I know we're doing good man this
how you know you doing good when you
can't do nothing right and this man you
know I'm starting to understand this is
like you know when you're doing good
when you doing so good it's just no
matter what you do everything is wrong
you know what I mean
like we are here but you know what I
mean it's like without cause you know do
my little my little cholo hat real quick
what up cuz you know what I mean yeah
but
now I'm not gonna change the formula
because now I'm really noticing we
getting big this is kind of crazy you
know what I mean like when you get to a
certain point where it's like nothing
that you do is ever gonna make everybody
happy
like if you don't answer people's gonna
cry oh man he's bougie now he don't
answer to comments it'll answer to
messages you don't do this if you do
answer
oh man you know it didn't go my way so
damn you should have had answered my
comment and it's like wait what like you
know this is crazy man now I'm not
getting no no me back man we're just
doing a little upgrade to the car you
know what I mean we're doing a little
upgrade you know what I mean so I'll let
you guys sleep up to that you know what
I mean I'm no longer person you know
material things online I'm not posting
material things online because I noticed
that people started taking it like your
boy is like making money off them and
freaking killing the game too much and
it's like nah man look I wish I could if
I was to go like all over like my whole
income and like literally break it down
you will notice that all of my income
comes from services online literally
like all of my income comes from
services everything else I'm using it to
basically pay the taxes on those
services I told you guys the best thing
to do is generate stuff like you know go
in there create application defines the
best lyrics keeps tracks of your lyrics
also another thing that that really
works out really well is like stuff like
Bitcoin like I told you guys people
constantly searching for that so do a
research online of the things that that
people are searching for create a
website just for that niche and then
from there you create like 10 different
websites for different niches and
and that's how you really make money
like you you don't even need a job like
this is what I tell people is like you
don't even need a job like straight up
I'm being honest a job is good to come
in and get that experience but you
really do not need the job now as far as
like you know everything with Matt and
everybody guys that say that's dead guys
we don't need to call no names we don't
need to call nobody from rogue one you
know any names man things is it in the
past Matt did a lot for me I did a lot
for Matt it's even let's just say we
even right now you know I mean there's
no point of us being mad at each other
it was like we chillin man you know I
mean it's kumbaya man that's all I'm
saying you know I mean we we kumbaya
mode and that's where we at right now
man you know we we can't let the busters
separate the squad man no matter what we
still a big squad it's just you know we
still here you know what I mean but it's
just crazy to me man I'll be like yo I
guess yeah I guess you boys don't mail
it man
I'm excited man this this a whole new
world now there's a whole new world you
know it's like I could imagine somebody
sent me a message until my job man don't
worry man once you start getting big I
wouldn't be surprised somebody opens up
your own sup ready and I'm like your
word or somebody calls in it on a
freaking high cornice what's that
Wikipedia and adds a page for you like
all your accolades and accolades that
you didn't even know that you had you
know what I mean some like I guess your
voice starts to get bigger sighing I
mean we only got like what like 12,000
13,000 subscribers like we not even big
guys like what's gonna happen when we
touched that hundred thousand that 1
million would be like dabbing them real
quick you know what I mean like people's
their blood is gonna boil you know what
you ever seen that that scene we're like
was this guy's name Naruto when he's
about to turn into the the ninetails and
his blood is boiling that's how the
haters is gonna be the
turning into night tales real quickly my
blood is boiling how is this guy winning
oh Jesus Christ man you know what I mean
so it's like yeah we good man we go we
definitely good listen man we gotta get
to a million watch we gotta get to a
million that's for sure people's gonna
be out here turn into the 90s like how
is he yeah but yeah I just wanted to do
a little quick live just to hang out
with you guys for lo way before I go to
the dealership right now maybe I'll do a
live video on the dealership ah with the
phone I'll be like me ninetails what up
well you never know if 2 million is a
rat now the only way that we could come
in and get to like 2 million would be if
we take it up a notch like you know what
I mean like there's so many things
there's so many things that I want to do
like you see how we started the whole
competition right like I want to take it
up a notch like if I'd ever get to the
opportunity to get to like 250,000
subscribers then that's enough incoming
enough you know like energy on the
channel that I could actually go out and
be like hey try to get some investors
and be like hey man how can we come in
and make like a reality show like a real
real a reality show and like bring in
all this developers from all over the
country to come in and actually you know
come in and do like a competition live
night man laughs but like a two three
week thing was like they have two three
weeks to create an application or build
a start-up like that would be hot I
think they tried to do that before it
was like a phone application or
something like that and it didn't work
and that's because the people that were
doing it they were wack man like you
gotta have some type of
and there's a thing that people don't
understand so and that's why I put the
thing is quick live video with coding
fees or is it drama
face don't uh don't like you know people
gotta understand man
listen code is cool code is cool core is
it is what it is man you know what I
mean code programming it is what it is
right but at the same time it can be
boring you cannot come in here to
YouTube YouTube is not a place for you
to be like hey man are we gonna watch
these tutorials are we gonna watch it
this isn't that that gets boring after a
while right so what did I do
I made something different right I came
in and I added all of the things that
are surrounding around my life with
coding right the stuff the good parts
the bad parts the things that I love the
things that I hate and I basically
portray to you guys you guys get to see
my life as I'm also teaching you guys
and giving you guys experience the
things that I I tell you guys about is
because I do research it's not like me
yeah so hey I pulled it on my hands here
you go I got a gym you know what I mean
is I got a brown gem for you guys nah
man like I actually come in and do
research man because the worst thing
that and that could happen is you come
in here like I don't know if you guys
seen that arm that freaking ty Lopez
interview it wasn't gonna interview but
some guy was like debating with him and
made him look stupid cuz he doesn't know
anything about the things that he talks
about nobody could make me look stupid
about nothing because I do my research I
don't talk about things that I just
don't know about you you know what I'm
say like I just don't go out of my room
the web development realm I got that I'm
super singing up in this bitch you know
what I mean like I got you know what I
mean like I already done leveled up I'm
super saying for right now you got I'm
saying like only thing that I could get
now is God level you know what I mean
like that's in but as far as like the
web like you can't tell me nothing
because I already freaking been through
this stuff I've been doing this for so
long while you a lot of you guys you
know come in and do coding like two
hours a day
I've been doing like 8 to 12 hours a day
for five years calculate that can we can
we do that real quick let's say your
average of 10 hours let's say no matter
fact is more than that because 8 hours
was at work let's say in total let's say
average of like 14 midnight like
probably twelve twelve times 365 times
five I put in 20 1900 that's a minimum
over this past five years a lot of
people kids they don't have that you
know the people take this as a as a
hobby people take this as they go into
work they do they work and they go home
and they don't even touch it again
not me I go in you see me here 24/7 you
see me in front of a computer constantly
I go hard you know and I pretty much
could tell you guys like hey man if you
really want to get all this stuff
give yourself a year to just go hard
eight eight hours a day in a year you're
gonna be solid six months you're gonna
be good three months you could get you
can slide yourself into a job alright
but are you gonna be like good good you
need a minimum from six months to a year
that's to be honest this is not me
coming in here giving you guys you know
some some BS hope I don't want to give
nobody no BS hope you know what I mean
this is not you're not gonna get an
award for winning second place right
like this is not the place for it so
it's like I'm just honest with people
you know what I'm saying so it's like if
you really want to go hard go hard and
like for the people that we like when
they try they try so hard they try too
hard it's so hard to be like here's a
card man we pulled your car we we know
more than you as like then you come out
and you pull out the numbers and then
you're like okay here's your numbers
here's your numbers buddy is the numbers
man like I don't know why people get
upset man like all I'm like
I'm just putting out the numbers
somebody tells me hey Ruby on Rails is
dead and tells me hey I live in San
Francisco so if you live in San
Francisco then you will do your research
that compared to Ruby on Rails pretty
much even no - yes doesn't have as many
jobs as Ruby on Rails on Silicon Valley
which is San Francisco that's Silicon
Valley area the whole San Francisco all
right so if you look at that then you
know if you do your research you
wouldn't notice that you know what I
mean so I don't know so it's like if you
give the numbers it's like you're wrong
if you're you don't give no numbers and
you just like to ignore it it's like
you're wrong no matter what guys listen
I'm here for you guys I'm here for you
guys to get jobs man I don't care about
which one it's the fastest language I
don't care about which one has
concurrency what you could do most of
you guys the applications you guys are
gonna be working on they're not gonna
have nothing to do with concurrency
that's being honest all right that's
gonna be your maybe a 15% of you guys
all right and most of the companies that
you guys is gonna be working on you know
people are focusing on you know machine
learning I want to focus on machine
learning guys you're not gonna touch
machine learning or even anything with
Python that's meaningful on your first
year it's just not gonna happen
now is it wrong for me to just be honest
no you gotta say like people are
expecting to have this amazing world of
this amazing career of what developing
it's like now what developments just a
job guys it's just like every other job
the only difference is that it pays
decent it pays you how a human being
should get paid I think everybody should
get paid accordingly you know I was
talking to this or some sister-in-law
about this people get paid like $15 an
hour or whatever and I'm like you know
nobody should be getting paid
you know what I mean so it's like you
gonna say so yeah man we're in man but
yeah guys I actually got a go cuz I
gotta take a half an hour trip let me
see how long it's gonna take
they closed the dealership 5:30 so I
need to get there and you see us as
always we winning out here constant
subscribers I don't know why because you
know what I mean like people to people
they they're like yo you know so let me
see how long it's gonna take I'm gonna
figure it out let me check on my map
lower this don't want nobody knowing my
address cuz you know you know the widows
come around you know boy got that
ratchet you know people get tight men
know I don't have to ratchet right here
I just put in my my you know my little
permit for all of you guys are wondering
yes and Connecticut you can have you
your weapon right on you right on your
waist just like started with the bleakie
up okay I'm out of here we really gotta
go take 40 minutes so I'm out of here
before they close I'm gonna see you guys
later man again please let me know let
me know please
what is the etiquette if you guys say
hey put it on the suggestion on the
channel on the chat room go to my
website coding phase comm click on chat
and we'll invite you to our discord chat
room I'm gonna be live on my phone so
yeah I could literally put it into the
suggestions I want to know should we
just not put nobody's face on any of the
comments because it's like honor to me
personally if you leave a comment
it means it's a public message so
anything that's public that means
anybody that's here Caridi so at the
same time we want to give people a year
from now two years from now the
opportunity to see what was the comment
because you know how people are they're
like a little iffy iffy you know like
they leave a comment and then when they
wrong they delete it and disappear and
never come back
so it's like to me I rather just put
their name in their face but put the
comma in the original comment so people
could see it but if people don't want me
to put the comments I won't put it all
right
it's up to you guys man you know max
Prager loved you man
let me know what what's the etiquette
that's you're having here what should be
the rules don't show any messages
don't show any comments any faces let me
know put in the messages on coding face
comm go to the chat room all right I'll
see you guys later the chat doesn't end
right here when I leave from here the
chat continues on this Court we're doing
this live all right love you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
