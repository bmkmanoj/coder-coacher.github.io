Jia Yu already knows your boy jump back
at it again man Koda face.com alright
get your voice back I'm back out here
man you know what I do you know rainy
day you know you know how we call this
the lunch break you know lunch break
specials man
let's break Chronicles you know what
development lunch break chronicles yeah
man just checking up on you guys mine
let me know what's good you know first
of all I want to apologize for yesterday
we didn't get to do you know the
programming mentorship program to
experiment the series we didn't get to
do it yesterday you know a couple of
people called out it was fun because I
was like so slammed with like
work I have so much work yesterday I had
to stay to like seven o'clock you know
at work so I was like freaking beat and
definitely I had to get home called the
whole buncha and it was just a
little bit too much it was too damn
hectic yesterday so with that scene like
you know it was just too much going
on yesterday you know what I mean oh
yeah man so let's go with you guys let
me know what's poppin for today so
actually today is a good day I like days
where you gotta wear a little hoodie you
know get your little hoodie on come
through with the fitty like you know
there's the type of things I like the
summer is cool I like the summer too but
I enjoy the days that you gotta wear a
little hoodie you know it's just I feel
at home if you feel comfortable you know
what I mean
oh yeah so what's up let me see what's
poppin off everybody what's up 84
without what I would upset
working a frico camp cool man
yeah man make sure you you know if you
working with free cocaine man don't get
stuck just using free Co camp you know
because free coke campus it doesn't
teach you how to build websites or how
to build web applications they teach you
like one piece at a time in its night
then that's after that you have to
figure out somehow how to put everything
together you know so make sure you get
in the right resources man don't get
stuck on the free coke am I missing
starting to jQuery section of the web
dev coldsteel course took my son to
kindergarten orientation then family
breakfast is not working on beats a word
man I got a couple of fire joints man
not need some beats for man man I used
to make music like heavy man I'm about
to come back I'm about to really come
back on the load
i'ma just create another channel and
just like I order a couple of equipment
you know order no man Mike michael is a
Avalon compressor like I got a couple
equipment just for my you know my
personal studio like I love making music
I'm not looking to become famous
rich whatever it's always good to make
music man it's a way to you know
just be creative you know I love making
music so I can't let that go
hi cool man I got you man I need some
zombies you know what I mean like
something as long as it doesn't have
samples and you're completely like you
know not like giving it to me but at
least if you give me a beat it doesn't
have to be the best beat it just has to
be a beat that not everybody else is
gonna is gonna use because like I say
our artist comes in and buys the beat
from you right then he goes and he he
puts it through what is it Tom cor when
they put it through tone core then my my
chat on my video that I work hard on
gets flagged that's if I'm copying their
song or I'm taking their song so it's
like make sure if you send me a beat
it's a beat that it's like a throw away
some that you know you're not gonna
you're not gonna sell to nobody because
then I'm gonna be pretty much you
know then they take all whatever little
earnings that I get from my videos
because I use the beat that somebody
else used you know what I mean so
you know thanks Matt you already know me
I really appreciate it
yeah way if you guys like the channel
always make sure you give it a like man
cuz I know it's annoying because it's
like oh man I already know that who
likes my channel who subscribe who
always comes through
but then again YouTube is is retarded
right now and pretty much is if you got
likes and your videos are being shared
then more people get to find you you
know it's because like I told you guys I
don't want to be creating SEO titles I
don't want to have to create a video of
like hey guys now you know top ten
 I don't know top ten coolest
frameworks or top ten books to buy you
know like I want to create cool videos
 that I I know about that I
could relate to I don't want to have to
start making you know pretty shitty
content just because to get more
subscribers so if you guys could help me
out just share any other videos that you
guys like just share it on reddit share
it on Digg whatever it is Facebook
whatever you want to share it just so
other people could watch the channel you
know what you get out of this thing so
it'd be cool if we could get more people
to come here you know it'll be like
organic instead of doing how a lot of
people are doing on YouTube paying for
promotion or paying for Facebook Likes
like you know what I mean
you know 84 thanks bro you know like I
need some music it's it's like sometimes
I got a couple of beats that I made but
it's like couple of beats on me like two
three years ago having made beats in a
long time but yeah bro how do I donate
to you well go to coding phase calm you
got two ways you could do coding phase
calm and do a one time donation through
PayPal right which is just one time or
if you say hey I like the channel I'm
always going to come back and you really
want to support the channel then sign up
for patreon and you just say hey once a
month for a dollar I'm just gonna give
this guy a dollar once a month or you
can say fat out of ten dollars whatever
you want to give you know if you donate
that's a lot than two if whoever donates
$30 a month I'm gonna give them a hoodie
and then you know I'm supposed to create
a video about the patreon exactly how I
want it but pretty much it's something
simple like there's like you know if you
if you come here you do patreon for a
dollar then great if you do it for far
out it's great if you do it for like you
know ten dollars I'm gonna put you as
one of the contributors so coding
face.com
you're gonna be on the list of you know
a list of contributors that actually
make this possible now if you get
something like if you donate or
contribute something like twenty thirty
dollars I'm gonna you know make a hoodie
which they're coming right now
and then I'm gonna give it out to you
know the people who contribute $20 a
month you know you're gonna get a free
hoodie that's gonna sing coding face but
something cool it's not just gonna be
like a big-ass logo way coding fees here
it's gonna be something legit something
that you know it shows that you're a
developer you know what I mean so
something was swag to him because I'm
not gonna have some some crazy ass
champion type looking ass you
know hoodie I'm gonna give you something
legit you know
be a man if you guys want to donate
that's up to you guys I like I said I
had the patreon there for so long and
have you ever really mentioned in my
videos at all only reason I'm mentioning
now because now YouTube doesn't
want to support people and basically
every youtuber is basically making no
money out of YouTube as far as
advertising so you know what I mean but
ya got your boy can without without what
upset
yo dang what up
yes
I don't even know what the hell
brown-nosing yeah guys I mean that's
your boy Matt man like straight up
that's my boy like dudes been
super-supportive
since the beginning and not for nothing
like he's doing really good he's
not even like sucking up or or whatever
you guys want to call it he's doing his
thing he's out here networking he's out
here uh you know working on the projects
I think from everybody that is working
on on the mentorship I think he's the
most advanced developer there is because
he's putting a lot of hours into the
 this is not like he's just coming
here and like hey guys go check
out the Gator but he's really busting
his ass he's going to school and coming
coming in here showing love to you guys
and at the same time freakin doing so
much work and helping everybody else on
the mentorship program like the kid is
doing a lot man I really wish I was like
you know like Matt's age like what all
the that he's doing now I wish I
would have been able to do it back then
you know it was like 10 years ago but
you know he's busting his ass man like
you know he's really he's really doing
his thing he's taking advantage of what
the program is supposed to be doing you
know the experiments supposed to be
doing for him and you know he's doing
this thing man I can't be I can't be mad
at the kid you know I want you guys to I
want you guys to just do your thing man
like straight up like I come here
everybody here we're all friends man we
like a you know we're a community like
this is not just y'all come here to see
me like this people here who are super
cool in this community like you know
we're here
also friendship like whatever you need
the other person helps you out like I
see you all the time on a comment
somebody says something of like hey
we're you know like where do I do I
learn um angular which angular
course should I get and somebody went in
putting the the course from Anthony I
think Anthony I said the same guy who
created the weird parts of JavaScript he
basically they gave them the same answer
that I would've gave them you know what
I mean so it's like super cool because
it's like people will understand that
this instructors day they have some
legit courses so now let the do it this
person by the weird parts but he also
bought the angular course with Anthony
Garcia and it's like then now he's able
to help somebody else you know what I
mean like the next time I don't know in
the next few months you're gonna see
people who are here in this community
right now they're gonna create their own
channels and they're gonna be the hey
man go check out this courses and help
other people's you know that's what I
want I want people to just help
each other out you know what I mean so
yeah
yeah man I'm freaking I'm twenty nine
man I started at 25 man like I told you
guys I've played around we making little
 websites but it wasn't like I
was making websites I was pretty much
copy and pasting everything I didn't
understand what was going on you know
back into myspace days and you know
those early days but when I started like
taking courses online and doing this
stuff it was at 25 so basically I would
say I started at 25 so you know somebody
sent me a message like hey am I too old
I'm 27 I'm starting now I'm like bro I
started two years before you like you
know what I mean like it's not it's not
like frickin there's a big difference
there's really no age limit to this
thing it's just like hey do you want to
put in the work
okay Oh which one will you learn first
okay this is the thing if you have
knowledge of programming go ahead and
start learning you know the weird parts
of JavaScript understand we're parts
right now if you are started started
from zero you don't know nothing about
programming you don't know nothing about
HTML CSS start with the Colt Colts class
right
Colt or what developer program bootcamp
sorry and then now if you have some type
of knowledge of HTML CSS and JavaScript
then I will say start with the PHP
course because the PHP course is going
to teach you my sequel which is actually
like if you know my sequel you could get
hired in a bunch of companies without
even knowing how to make a website just
my sequel alone you will be able to get
hired because people need people to work
on on the database so you never 204
anything running no guy has mid twenties
who went back to school got his
bachelor's a Masum that became the IT
lead I would became the lead IT engineer
his company we don't let it discourage
oh that's from Freddy Martinez gallop
care
yeah Victor cocaine cocaine was good I
mean some people they say they like the
coins by Edwin Diaz but I'm not a huge
fan of it I'll be honest I'm not a huge
fan um I mean I don't know I'm gonna
look into it I'm gonna look into it and
I'm gonna create a list of my top PHP
courses cuz I gotta do some research
behind it like I want to give you the
most updated one because you're right
the first the one that's on my
description focuses more on my sequel in
the beginning but then later on it
starts building up to PHP and the reason
that is made like that is because people
get to start creating something in PHP
and it's like PHP is almost the same
thing as JavaScript and almost the same
thing as HTML so in reality it's more
better to understand my sequel first and
then jump to PHP that's why the guy
created the course like that you know so
if you know how to build a regular page
then the best thing to do is start with
my sequel you know definitely jump into
the PHP because the course teaches you
PHP
yeah I mean everybody's different
everybody you know there's things that
they like about Edwin Diaz me personally
it's hard for me to to take a course for
him because the problem with him is that
he does tutorials like I do tutorials on
YouTube meaning I do mistakes on my
tutorials and I might just leave it
there and then fix it at the end right
now when you're but it's free the
tutorials I do on YouTube are free which
means I'm not putting in that much time
now if I'm coming out of my pocket and
I'm paying for a course I don't want to
see no mistakes I don't want to see you
freaking you know fumble with your code
it's like have a plan you know and then
from there you earned the money that I'm
giving you
but what Edwin Diaz is like all his
courses is like that it's like he puts
no effort
he knows his his but he just
doesn't put an effort like if i if i
watch steven Grider right steven grinder
his courses are immaculate meaning every
video he already have a plan for it and
you could tell that he redo the video
multiple times until the video comes out
perfect as earlier doesn't do that as
one Diego's like oh I got typos I got
 mr. semicolon I missed this in
that and then it's like he's constantly
fixing his his errors so each video
comes out to my 15 20 minutes and to me
I'm like that's not worth the money you
know I could get that on YouTube when I
go to you to me is because I want to get
a professional video done that somebody
really put in time if not I do you know
I return it right back I'll bet I hate
it but let me get my refund
I'm 26 right now started web development
while back but wasted two years in
college and a few months ago started
creating website again but focusing all
my time on it now
yeah man that's the thing that's the way
to go man what you gotta do start
building projects and start you know
sending our recipes what is react for
react is for basically state management
right and also to render things on a
page like a component so like let's say
an example right let's say you have a
farm and whenever like let's say you you
switch something on the select box right
and you say okay I select a true right
when you click select true you want a
pop-up to show up right that's a perfect
example for react because then now
you're going to have the state
management which is like you know Redux
right to manage your whole state and
you're going to keep track of all the
actions that are happening throughout
the page so if the person switches to
select true or they filled out their
name and their name is too long or
whatever it is you want to keep track of
everything that's happening on the page
and then you want to be able to create
actions for it
meaning hey I want something to pop up
or hey I want a warning to show up or
like when they click enter I want it to
basically do a get request and get a map
from Google Maps whatever it is like
it's hard to explain especially you know
without showing you like a project or
showing you a page so you can understand
what react really is for but you know
just look online single page apps or
look online components
what's going on with the mentorship
videos where was the show yesterday I
might just do it tonight to be honest
with you guys I might just doing tonight
because thing is that yesterday I had to
do so much guys it's not even funny
like yesterday I got from work at seven
o'clock at night some happened in
my work that now we got to work extra
hours because it's like super
crunch time like we got to finish this
project that we're building and now we
don't have time we have like literally
like two weeks left and it's a huge
project it's a complete rebuild of our
company and then that's the issue man
and I've been working on it by myself
for the past few months and then now we
got other peoples from the team working
on it but it wasn't enough time they
should have been working from before
they should have started working on the
project exactly when I started but it's
not their fault it's not my fault it's
just that happens
you know so company does you
know now we gotta get them crunch time
and finish everything yeah man Victor
I'm telling you like you know I want you
guys to like whenever somebody like
leave some crazy comment like oh
why are you promoting this cause why
does course is shape I want you guys the
guys who are who are you really getting
something out of it just say like yo
this course is only Jake just cuz I'm
not gonna answer it people know more
people leave dumb comments like oh
you're your course this and that
and like bro
the point of the channel is to help each
other out so it's like if I know a good
course why wouldn't I share it
so for you guys that are actually taking
the courses that I told you and you know
you're getting something good out of it
leave a comment be like hey man I'm
taking this course this course is great
or I'm taking this course this course is
very clear I learned something good you
know what I mean and once you get a job
come back leave a comment but I go I got
a job because of all the that I
learned and also it so people could
actually know you know cuz it's like you
know how you look at you right you go
you go to Yelp right and then this five
hundred comments on one restaurant but
one comment give it one star and says
hey there was a hair on my meat
and now the the the restaurant
will lose business because of that one
comment and that one review so if nobody
leaves no good reviews or leaves a good
comment about it then you know
somebody's might come in here and look
at a comment but I oh man they didn't
like this course or whatever but as I
hate there's literally another 3,000
people who have been taking the course
that I know and they're enjoying
it they're really loving it you know get
the react like you cool and what people
don't know the react course already
teaches you a little bit of es6 then go
and def but
the next level good then you go and buy
the the es6 course yes
Kim Kim Stewart talking about refunds on
udemy you have to be very careful I got
one of my accounts banned
because I was buying a lot of courses
right because I was doing courses or
cursory basically I would once I looked
through it whatever I basically
summarized it then I was returning then
I got banned from you to me because I
was buying too many courses and
returning them right away so I will buy
like 4050 courses and then keep like
five courses five six courses I'm
telling you guys now every course on
udemy is good and just like everything
in the world now everything in there is
good but the courses that I give you is
if I put it is because I've already gone
through like dirty courses and I
know which one are good and which are
not you know so be very careful with
refunding courses don't overdo it
because then you're going to get banned
and you're going to be able to keep the
the courses that you already bought
because they're yours you own that
forever but then you can't buy no more
courses so then now you're gonna have to
do what I had to do I have two different
accounts I have my old account that got
banned and I had to create a new account
with a new email you know whoa
a joking your semi linkedin request yes
I'll accept it III barely go through
LinkedIn just by the way guys I don't
update my LinkedIn I don't put in my all
my information in there for personal
reasons um but yeah I will I will add
you to it
no 84 reactors oh it's a library right
it's a framework that helps you build
components on the page I don't know it's
hard it's hard to explain it I'm gonna
make a tutorial maybe today I'll make
one you know I'm supposed to start the
components on tutorial for the rockie
stack Oh 84 what type of a computer you
got you running a Windows are you
running a Mac and are you following the
the rocky stack man trust me you're
gonna get a lot of out of it because I
explain like real like dummy proof
man like got the rain out here now yes
man's definitely good to learn PHP guys
because what you gotta understand guys
PHP is going to be one of the easiest
language to learn right and one of these
is language to become productive in the
backend right once you understand what's
going on in PHP or any back-end language
you pretty much could jump to other
programs other frameworks and other
programming languages easily because now
you understand you know sessions cookies
now you understand our params
now you understand
routes now you understand how to render
things now you understand how to use
views how to use templates all of the
stuff you can learn through PHP in an
easy way and then be able to use it
somewhere else like JavaScript like
nodejs or use it in something like Ruby
on Rails or use it on something like the
crystal stack the rockie stack or
whatever you decide to use because like
once you learn one language you learn
all of them now all you have to do is
look at the syntax basically in the
syntax just means how is written but
besides that
all programming languages are the same
is it necessary to know waterfall model
nah don't worry about those things you
worry about that when if there's a
company that's hiring you and they want
to do you know the waterfall or how you
call it out of the shape JIRA whatever
the they want to use you know but
don't worry about that you don't need to
worry about that until the day they hire
you once they hire you then they'll
explain it to you
I just pulled the JavaScript don't we
importance $10 sale it's almost over
yeah guys remember I tell you guys that
they are about to cancel the $10
sales I told you guys so you guys have
to go in and try to buy a course like
now whatever course you might want try
to buy now get it out the way because I
got told you after this they're pretty
much just gonna give random prices like
you might be able to get in and say okay
somebody here might say $10 then the
next person that goes in is going to see
15 or 20 dollars or more so take
advantage I don't know
yeah I'm gonna this kid Andre he created
on a Windows tutorial I'm gonna add that
to my channel so a lot of you guys who
actually see it alright so like that you
guys could actually follow the tutorials
in the windows now you don't need a Mac
II specifically but it's so much easier
to follow if you have a Mac or Linux
yeah just grab trust me bro just go
ahead check on Craigslist literally you
don't need a brand new MacBook you can
literally get a MacBook Pro from I don't
know 2008 2009 2010 and that's a that's
all you need like you don't need this
thing to be like brand new
what I recommend Ruby on Rails Ruby on
Rails is going to give you all the
fundamentals
I do recommend Ruby on Rails if you want
to become a back-end developer to
understand what's going on in the
backend but at the same time there's a
lot of magic to it but it's good because
you're going to understand good
practices and how to build a crud how to
you know deal with databases how to deal
with a forum like active record so that
information that you're going to get
from Ruby on Rails you're going to be
able to take that to other languages
another programming languages you know
yeah me too I hate I hate PHP syntax too
I hate it but it works and
there's a lot of jobs for it you know
it's like right now I could literally if
something happens bad in my company I
could literally find a job in two weeks
so
yeah I would say be careful we're buying
a MacBook Air it's not really worth it
it's better to buy an older Mac Book Pro
than you're getting on a MacBook Air you
know Israel like crazy right now you're
gonna have to give me a second give me a
second man up doing a u-turn right here
Oh
go Bo
all right we back
let me just get my food
yes raining like crazy I'm gonna see you
guys later man I gotta get back to work
I got a eat a little food and then I
gotta work man
all right guys take care of it
see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
