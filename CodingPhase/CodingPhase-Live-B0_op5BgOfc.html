guys we just got a sauce it up we just
gotta put a little sauce you know I mean
where'd y'all let mr. Kevin JY recording
interview so rough well it depends where
you go to man you got to do research to
man you got to do research on the
company man you know this is what I do
when I want to apply to somewhere first
the warming right now I don't apply to
nowhere does it just being honest but if
I was to apply somewhere the first thing
that I would do is I would look through
a glass door I would look at people that
have actually been interviewed at that
company people that have been hired
people that are working there see what
they say about the company you know to
me even indeed indeed has a section
where people review the company and
their interviews so a lot of times some
companies you know you might bump into
the person who's just a whole let's just
be honest let's be real with it there's
people who had just a hose and you know
they're like they remember every
algorithm in the world and any freaking
you know like all they do is like study
little B s's and stuff like that I'm
sorry isn't something messed up but
these guys who pretty much have no life
out there right and they wanna like test
you right it's like right now it's like
somebody comes in and be like hey man
what's the square root of you know 1
million two thousand three hundred and
seventy four cents or some like
that you know what I mean like people
come out with questions that is just
ridiculous like you're not gonna use
that your job at the position that
you're going to do has nothing to do
with the question that they're asking
you and sometimes they're just idiots
right so you gotta find online places
where it's it's just decent people
people that go in there you go to
interviews and and it's people who who
love what they do
but at the same time they're not snobby
with it right you know I've bumped into
situations like this
you know I um I went to a company thank
God I was just like literally
freelancing at that time it was more
like me working there
is a pretty big company but like the
Michael is like the CTO was just like
this guy who graduated from MIT and he
just seemed like such a a-hole
right and I was like man thank God I'm
only working here for two months and I'm
out of here
right but I remember there was this girl
who left out of the like there's like a
meeting room somebody came in for an
interview
me personally I already was working for
this company co-creator circle right so
as an employee a quote unquote contract
work quote unquote
temp right I went in there for like you
know to work there for like two three
month contract right so my company
already vouch for me
right my how you call this uh my agency
already vouch for me like yo this dude
is good like you don't need to test them
you don't need to do anything to him
he's good he's proving he's got his
projects he's worked on XYZ company so
by that time I go to that company I'm
like I'm good I just show up I'm a
working man I do my job and get the hell
out of there so one day I'm like talking
to one of those guy and that sitting
next to me and I look at a room and some
girl came out crying and I'm like oh
shoot like what happened why why you
think she's crying tell the guy next to
me he's like oh no it's like you know I
think she was coming in for an interview
and you know CTOs a little bit harsh
sometimes and I'm like listen if you if
you have people leaving out of your
office crying like you're an a-hole you
get what I'm saying like you're out here
you know I understand and you know
companies that want to get the best of
the best right but sometimes some people
that take it too far right some people
take it too far they don't take into
account
hey what exactly is it that this person
is going to be doing right I feel like
sometimes when if your interviewer and
you're interviewing the person you
should ask them about the things that
they're going to be doing right if I
come in and say hey man we're hiring you
for you know four
react we need somebody to come in give
us an extra hand as a react developer
I'm not gonna going to put you in there
hey could you break down this this
algorithm could you sort this bubble
sort this bubble for me like I mean they
don't talk like that but um you know
it's like this has nothing to do with
react you get what I'm saying like this
has nothing to do with a job that you're
gonna be doing this has nothing to do
with the things that you're gonna be
working on but some people want to be
assholes you know I mean like some guys
think they you know they come with the
computer science degree and there's like
hey man it's like did you know they are
smart that once will good college the
ones who are you good University they've
done their work I'm not taking that part
out of them
but what I'm thinking is the part of
like hey man yeah you you went in and
did you know XYZ degree right so you you
know the whole full spectrum of computer
science right but what is the point of
you testing everybody with the same
things that you are testing yourself
with you know what I'm saying like if
this person is doing web development
this person don't need to be knowing
every single algorithm this person
doesn't need to come in and explain to
you every single thing under the Sun
like this person was just doing what
development right you know what I'm
saying if somebody comes in and be like
hey I'm coming in as a web designer
I'm not expect expecting when I was
designed to come in and give me every
single color they say hey what if we
mess up orange with green in a little
bit of yellow what color does that make
like you know what I say like some I
don't know if you guys understand the
analogy of that but it's like sometimes
these people they come in and they try
to test people for so much things that
they don't need hey you know what I mean
and then you miss out on people that are
actually really talented right there's a
list of websites of well companies and
they have it online because it's not
just me who believe in this companies
that
mr. dong goo whiteboard interviews I
must show you right now
it's a huge list okay so yeah all right
so I'm gonna say this the scroll with
you guys
so this DHH this is the creator of Ruby
on Rails right
he's a hello my name is David I will
fail to write a bubble bubble sort on a
wiper on a whiteboard sorry Spanish you
know I got a little accent so hello my
name is David I will fail to write a
bubble sort on white on a white board I
look code up on the internet all the
time and I don't do riddles like that's
just like a regular human being talking
about this and this is the guy that
created Ruby on Rails and this is the
guy that is super smart has made
millions this guy got a freakin a
freakin car in Formula One like come on
like this dude is a successful developer
this guy he's legit right so there's a
lot of places out there right all of
these are our company right at tech
media actually done some little work
with them but this law thousands of
companies out there that just don't do
whiteboarding right because at the end
of the day if you're now gonna be um it
depends on what type of job you're doing
man like whiteboarding and in creating
all this this environment for somebody
to come in and and then go through an
interview and have to go through hell
just to get higher it it just doesn't
work right you can say oh it wheats out
the the rest of the people is like no it
doesn't what it does it it basically it
just brings you in people that are good
testing that's a you get what I'm saying
like there's people are super smart
right like you guys are low back in the
days in school there's people are you
know super smart but for some reason
they could
never get off that 70 you know 65 75
sometimes 80s on test right but the kids
who used to get a hundred all the time
you ask them something logically and
they're dumb as hell
right now everybody is good with testing
and sometimes this companies that take
it to the extra level of like hey man
how can we make your life miserable to
get this job how can we have you come in
two to three times for the same freaking
position to basically go over some
that you're not even gonna be doing on
your day to day work right and that's
why I tell you guys focus on your
projects right if you come in and you
say I'm gonna just focus on algorithms
and isn't that guys you could do that if
you want to be one of those people you
could definitely do that
right you could definitely do that but I
will say hey man if you want it to be
one of those people doing it as a
self-taught developer is not the right
way you might as well just go to a
computer science degree
okay you're computer science degree go
through the whole four years and really
prepare yourself in in that world right
but if you're out here is itself to a
developer build your solid project so
you could be like hey man I ain't doing
no no whiteboarding you see my projects
you see the clients I work with you see
the people I've worked with if you want
me you want me if you don't want me good
for you you get what I'm saying
you could take that and put it right
back in there you know what I'm saying
so I need to stop doing this like this
doesn't seem right you get what I'm
saying when I do that it doesn't seem
right but yeah man a lot of people a lot
of companies they just try to test
people and stuff that's just kind of
ridiculous man so let me see what else
what else what else
I met is funny already his comment you
know so let me see what I was losing
here we got a couple of people brahim we
got Lucas Freddy Martinez let's see
who's in here what do you think of for
that framework I haven't heard of it to
be honest with you I'll look it up right
now
adapt framework a toolkit for creating
responsive single version html5
elearning courses that's what you're
talking about
but that learning never heard of you
better not work for those people making
me give my time and give my promotion to
those people for free now
what do you think about elixir elixir is
cool it's great for what it is um I
don't know it's not really for me I've
played around with it I've created a
couple of projects but it's just not for
me
yeah me it's up to you man it depends on
the company man you gotta figure it out
you know sometimes if your goal is to go
to like a Google or Facebook if that's
your goal right you're gonna have to
either be really popular online like
pretty really popular cuz that's how a
lot of people get hired over there they
either really popular they have like a
library that's popular on github they
either hire people who are well-known
and either in one feel like they're
experts at one thing that they do right
so that's how they get hired right or
you could just be like hey man I want to
Stanford University or hey I went to
freakin whatever MIT or Boston
University what else Georgia Tech like
there's a whole bunch of really good
schools out there but at the same time
if I'm 28 years old
right and I'm just getting into web
development and I'm just getting into
this this whole field to be thinking
like hey man my goal is to get to
Facebook it's like bro like it's gonna
be a long journey for you to be honest
with you because you gotta understand
there's kids out there who have been
going from you know from four-game
middle school junior high school high
school private schools then from there
they they ace out the SATs you know
little kids we just that's all they do
they worry about the SATs they do all
this stuff go to one of those large
universities definitely the go in there
do computer science they're either do or
mathematics that they do even business
right and then from there once you have
those accolades then you come in and but
I'm gonna apply to this this big
companies this XYZ company right
Facebook whatever company right but it's
like you're grown-ass men right now you
gotta say like you you like 30 years old
28 years old
Oh freaking 27 years old is like if you
really wanted to do that route
throughout your life like you need to do
that a long time ago
you're not saying like that that that's
one of those things where you say hey
that train has already shipped out you
know I'm saying like that train is
already gone okay
like that's just being honest right you
got a long road you know unless you like
a designer it seems like designers get
get higher into this big companies
easier than most people are but as a
developer is like hey man it's not gonna
be that easy man
you gotta come in with like hey I
already work for you know major
companies like if you say and for
example hey I work for Comcast I work
you know I was the developer of Comcast
I work for Verizon I work for AT&amp;amp;T I
work for XYZ company right one of the
big companies that are now like in the
top three tech world companies like
Google Facebook and Amazon they're from
the day you have a solid portfolio you
have a solid resume where you could say
hey I want to get to those companies and
now you could transition to those
companies but it is a plane you got it
that's like you know what I'm saying
that's like going to you know trying to
make it to L to freakin MIT like you now
that I go to MIT from your Community
College man like that's something that
you need to build from before like you
know from your junior high school extra
curriculum join the freakin the lacrosse
team in high school like do all this
extra that they put for you to
just even go to MIT right so it's the
same thing as Facebook Google and Amazon
it's like you gonna have to go through a
whole big process right even the guys
who are super smart have been denied to
work at those companies right because
it's like
the specific things that they are
looking for so it's like if you really
want to get to those top three companies
you need to prepare yourself have a plan
and be like hey man there's my five-year
plan too far I can make it to this thing
but that's when I come in and I tell you
like yo that's a
go write that to be honest that's a
really dumb goal for anybody to say hey
man as an adult I'm an adult right and
I'm a grown-ass man I got I got bills I
got a house appear I got a whole bunch
of things that I gotta do I don't got a
low a little pillow behind me where I
could say hey man I could just relax and
just focus on this things I have to
actually come in and make money right if
you're an adult right somebody who's out
here living in the real world
that's a dumb goal for you to be honest
with you because now you're just putting
yourself in a position where you're like
man nothing out there is gonna satisfy
you right for me my goals is different
my goals is man I couldn't care less
about any of this companies right like
I'm freaking I've gone through like the
most it's like Facebook right phone
interview and the whole thing then and
call me back right that's fine I was
like yo I'm not gonna be the price I'm
not gonna be sadder Oh Facebook didn't
warn me didn't call me back didn't help
me come into the interview yeah because
when I started looking at things I was
like wait I could make more money than
the people that's in there that's my
that's my trophies you get what I'm
saying that's where I come in I gave
myself a trophy up and I here you go Joe
here's your trophy you gotta send like
you have to give yourself give yourself
things where you say here's your trophy
Joe you work hard you bust your ass here
hey Facebook Google Amazon might not
want you because you're now you haven't
had or you know you haven't focused so
much or I'm trying to get to those
companies like that wasn't my goal I was
like okay I applied to I see what it is
therefore interview didn't call me back
everything's great that's it but from
there is I can't man my life just been
going up is like you know what I'm
saying so it's like it's up to you to
decide what are the things are really
important for you you get what I'm
saying so don't let other companies or
interviews or bad things come in and
just mess you up in like oh man I'm not
smarter I'm not dissing that because you
right now look I'm doing YouTube I'm
doing all this stuff and I've done
freakin invited to Facebook to Microsoft
events
I'm just so regular do you know what I'm
saying like I don't work there I have no
connections with them I've gotten
invited to events right the people
wanted me to go to f8 last year I don't
even want to go you gonna say like I'm
not you gotta understand I'm just like
hey man like the world works itself out
you get what I'm saying like at the end
of that you could come in and have a way
better career then you focusing just on
like oh man
Facebook didn't warn me like who cares
man you know so it's like just focus on
our own on working focus on on building
your projects focus on building real
services that's gonna change the world
man stop focusing on
oh man only to get hired by Facebook oh
man I need to be hired by XYZ company
listen you think you think Mark
Zuckerberg was India's like oh man I
want to get hired by Microsoft's
Microsoft didn't give me a call after
that man I'm building my own company I'm
doing my own thing you know what I'm
saying so yeah man let me see what else
what else what else what else what else
can we talk about yes about crystalling
I'm actually doing a video about
crystalline tomorrow
I'm releasing it I'm releasing it
tomorrow I'm recording it today it's
talking about how disappointed I am in
crystal Lang in the team right but I'm
not gonna go too deep into that because
if I tell you everything right now then
what's the point of you watching the
video tomorrow so yeah
why don't any one talk about
masters yeah thank good not really my
type of thing but they're good let me
see for my kill do I need to do I needed
to show my constant activity or is it
okay if I just upload finished product
whilst they are done and commit yeah you
could just commit as much as you can I
mean you don't have to commit every
single day if you want to impress
somebody and be like oh wow this person
commits every single date this person
does something and you know as far as
coding every single day that could
impress somebody be like oh this
person's dedicated but I don't even come
in everything I command like one like
every other day or something like that
let me see
let me see the only benefit I see for
Mac or Linux is the Adobe suite Mac is
definitely more appealing to look at
though listen max unfortunately guys to
be honest with you guys listen max are
way better than than Windows Oh max have
never had they have never crashed on me
never ever ever ever ever I was thinking
about buying a Mac Pro from 2008 and I'm
still thinking about doing that and have
that as my my main computer here number
one because I like the fact that it's
the big body big body computer right let
me see if I could share this with you
guys because some of you guys don't even
know some of you guys don't even know
that you could buy this computers for
dirt cheap like I'll be hearing people
like oh my god max are so expensive
bro like come here
I am Mac Pro man you can buy MacBook Pro
but if you want you can buy a Mac Pro
for 325 right is the for one what year
is this
let me see 2009 this is perfect it's all
gigabyte of RAM one terabyte hard drive
has a little BS Nvidia car which you
could upgrade at any moment so look at
this $300 all right some of you guys
might think oh man this is old mm all
right now man that's why max are that
good because even though 2009 is legit
all right for what you're doing you're
doing web development you're doing
programming like this is perfect for you
guys like yeah you could go crazy but oh
I'm gonna buy the little trash can you
know but you can't upgrade that you
can't do anything to it so I was
thinking about recording a video of me
buying a $300
MacBook Pro and making it my main
computer number one because that's gonna
get me mad Mavs use for some reason
people love to hear those stories right
they love hearing those stories I'm like
man this guy he got a vintage computer
from 10 years ago in just made it his
main computer and I was like bro is is a
Mac it's like supposed to do that like
it's not a Windows computer go ahead and
try to do that with a Dell go
ahead go ahead go find a down
outside of a public school you know
every single year freakin hundreds of
computers get thrown away by all-around
public schools like you could go in
there and take our hard drives take our
Dell computers take our ramp my friend
does that he sells those on on eBay
right he sells it by pieces you know I
was like each hard drives like 40 bucks
50 bucks he makes my money like that but
if go ahead and pick up a Dell computer
you know what I say like that
probably got just by picking it up you
caught something you know just by
picking it up you caught a virus on your
head like that's how that's how bad
those Windows computers are well you get
a 2009 2010 MacBook Pro like look at
this people selling it for 255 on ebay
Rainer I'm about to buy one like this
legit yeah what I'm saying
some of you guys might want a laptop but
listen man
those Mac Pro's man those were the best
I wish they brought back those are big
freakin computers because nowadays they
they have the little trash cans you came
and do anything with that we're a man so
let me see
who else is in here man I can't I gotta
read everybody's things man I don't know
what you're talking about tired of
bending and saying what the f I don't
even know what you're talking about
ah let me see live right next to
part goddamn kids walking around here
let me see
yo if I get an all site interview
company for entry job
should I ask them for help for my travel
expenses what that sounds crazy yeah you
gotta ask them for travel expenses nah
man you're bugging out bro they gotta
look at you like yo bro that's your
check you want it to work here we we
just telling you telling you about it
they're not gonna tell you hey come no
can you give me a little extra for my
traveling like now man it doesn't work
like that
you think people that work in
kinetochore New Jersey and they have to
work in in New York City they get like a
extra sometimes they give you for the
MTA they give you like a I have the
coiler stipend or something like that
where basically what they do is they
take the money from your bank account
before they charge the taxes right and
then they give you a Metro car you could
buy a Metro car I already paid for like
that's the most that they could do it
you actually save a little money because
they haven't charged taxes on it so
that's about it but you're not on again
I people's not gonna be like oh man
you know he works in New Jersey he gotta
come to New York can we pay can we pay
for his trip to go work nah man people
do this every day beep you know what I
mean listen man people commute every day

throughout my day you're like I sent
your email and you did a live video
right after that I'm a paying customer
from coding phase comm I'm actually to
subscribe to your website into your
YouTube and I'm subscribing because you
did not answer my email right away
if I have to just be like answering
every single email as soon as it comes
in as I know broke you could be a paying
customer the moment you are subscribe

scheme it for like two months
automatically the system cuts you off
right you know it's like people get cut
off every single month beat you know
what I'm saying so so when you say
you're gonna unsubscribe like oh I'm not
gonna paint them on coding face.com
that's great man like more power to you
literally five more people five ten more
people every time that somebody
unsubscribe for my website they leave
five to ten new people come in and like
you're not hurting me you're not doing

notifications and YouTube just doesn't
work for them like yeah god man
Joe do I need do I need to spend any
significant amount of time to learn CSS
frameworks I have been spending what I
feel like is a lot of time on bootstrap
should I just move onto onto javascript
yes why are you spending more than a day
or any framework like that's not
something that you need to remember like
it you don't need to remember our
frameworks like as far as CSS all you
have to do is just pretty much you use
it for what it is and you have the
documentation you have two examples that
they have and you use it like that but
I've seen people like buying udemy
courses on bootstrap use a union
recourse on bootstrap for here's a udemy
course on bootstrap 3 in foundation it's
like you know CSS like you don't need to
be paying nobody for that like you can
literally see that you got a sailor you
can literally see that be like yo I'm
not paying for this thing you gonna say
like yeah
I need I need to I'm trying to set it up
man I'm trying to set it up man because
there's definitely like a lot of reverb
in this room so I just gotta set it up
the proper way you know I just moved
here man
yeah I just got here I have a morphing
here guys give me a break
you know say like I just got here man
like don't worry I'm gonna get the nice
board I'm gonna make this thing like a
nice recording studio I wanted to set up
the basement the basement is legit but
the problem with the basement I don't
know it's like I'm catching like God not
a smoke but something that's like a
close-up my my chest so what I'm doing
is I'm getting a humidifier and getting
somebody coming in there removing the
rug they're cleaning everything up they
you know so they don't whole bunch of
stuff man so yeah man once that's done
probably in a month or two then we're
gonna be downstairs for now we in this
room I'm comfortable in this room too
you are not saying like I'm good I enjoy
I enjoy being up here you know catching
a breeze you know yo I want
interview I said I don't know but can
always go with the employers said they
they don't pay people to research after
that I was mentally checked out out of
the interview listen man somebody who
comes in and be like what was it that
they asked you though um yeah so what
was it that they Axia man I'm curious
John thing
about quitting my full-time job hitting
the coating hard I mean you can hit
coding hard right now you don't need to
quit your job cuz you don't want to quit
your job unless you got money saved
right if you don't have money saved like
you know six to six months to a year
like you don't want to be quitting your
job especially if you just had a kid
like that looks that's gonna look
irresponsible of you to do that because
unless you got wifey that got she got
money and she she gonna help you out you
but I don't baby you go to work ma I got
this I'll take care of baby and I study
at home you know what I mean like that's
that's sweet and if you got a sweet deal
like that mmm more power to you but most
people they you know why he is not
making money like that for you to you be
squint quitting your job you know just
give yourself some time just learn this
stuff at home you know fill your
portfolio and start applying start
applying online and then go to the
interviews you know save those sick days
instead of you taking a sick day to just
hang out at home and chill a wifey safe
those sick days for you to be actually
going to it job interviews and then once
you get the job offer then you say hey
guys peace
I got another job you know what I mean
but you know any company that comes in
and tells you hey man if if you don't
know something you better hey man listen
I can definitely find out the answer of
if you've never heard of like let's say
for example somebody comes in and they
tell you hey man have you ever used
let's say stencil Jes that's a new
framework right and for whatever reason
decided to start using that and then
they'll be like hey man I'm gonna come
in and I want you to basically work on
stand so Jes can you do it and you'll be
like hey I don't know it but I can
google and find out how to work with it
if they tell you hey we don't pay people
to do research here it's like bro
this place is not for me thank you
that sometimes you gotta give it you
gotta have some pride in yourself you
know you gotta be like yo thank you I
this is not the place for me I'm out of
here
just be honest with that yeah man
saved those sick days man that's why I
used to do I look I'm one of those
people I hate going to work it doesn't
matter even if it was the best company
in the world I hate going to work
because it's like you gotta leave your
house you gotta go over there you gotta
see people you got a clock in or you got
a swiping or you got a freaking bump
into people that you don't like I don't
I've never liked working right I mean
that's just not me right but at the same
time what I used to do is I always go to
work no matter what even if I'm tired if
I'm sick from whatever I just go to work
only way I don't go to work if I feel
like I'm dying
if I feel like I'm dying I'm calling out
right or is if it's like a snowy day
like a really bad snowy day like I'm not
waking up at 5 o'clock to take out my
car like that's the truth it's like nah
man I ain't waking up a 5 a.m. to take
off all this snow from this car I'm just
not going that's just that's just me so
then that really happens right so I
would probably miss like one day of the
of work like two throughout the whole
year so that's about it but Savior your
sick day so you could go to those job
interviews especially if you got a jet
if you got a job man which is more
easier to learn for back end PHP you
know to express to be honest I think PHP
because
node node and express has so many things
like so many things that you could
customize and so many different
libraries so many different stuff out
there that in reality is like I could
teach you no js' and Express and then
the next time people are gonna teach it
to totally different
and then you gotta go to a job interview
and they're gonna ask you about stuff
that you've never heard about right no
matter what because everybody uses it a
whole completely different way you know
what I sound like everybody even though
the project folders don't even look the
same way it's too much customization in
nodejs
so for you to start in nodejs as your
first backing language it's not good
because then you had your thing oh yeah
it's just JavaScript
yeah it's JavaScript but then you gotta
add a whole bunch of different libraries
and frameworks and stuff that is gonna
confuse you it's not it's not as easy as
just saying okay
PHP is the same way you do things to PHP
the same way since the beginning of time
all right you get a framework like
laravel like you use that framework
everybody uses the same style of coding
so it's like if you go to a company that
uses laravel you is like you're at home
because they used laravel the same way
that you use it is like nothing is
different all right but when you go to
an OG yes let's say a company that's
using nodejs either they using it for
just a PII so they're using it for
server rendering everybody does it
differently Carrie angry and what's your
opinion of Pluralsight please answer
because I'm considering a subscription
Kevin to be honest with you and now
because I have my own website I have my
own subscription to be honest with you
the problem with Pluralsight is that
there's no continuation right if you are
a professional right like let's say now
I consider myself a professional right
somebody was been working for years I
already know how to Co I already know
all the way how things work in the
industry something like Lauro site will
work for me right because I don't need
somebody to hold my hand I don't need
somebody to tell me ok there's other
things that you got to follow along
these are the curses that you got to
learn I don't need that I already know
what I have
right but if you are a beginner going to
Pluralsight it's the same thing as going
to let say udemy right you you could be
on udemy taking courses that are
different topics but they don't relate
to each other I don't know if you
understand that now you see like my
website everything is related to one
thing everything started with the HTML
CSS course and everything else started
popping up after that right so every
course either come in and it's related
to the previous one to whatever you
learned previously right so it's like a
ecosystem that just helps you in trains
you to learn this stuff as you go right
you go from one thing to another by the
time you get to the the last one you
already learned everything and
Pluralsight your painter i believe is
like $30 per month and then on top of
that you're basically you're expected to
already know all the basic stuff right
so for a beginner is not the right place
for a professional like let's say I'm a
c-sharp developer right and I say I've
been doing c-sharp for five years I want
to learn on ojs right Pluralsight might
be a good choice for me because I
already know what development I don't
need somebody to hold my hand I don't
need somebody to teach me anything I
just need somebody to teach me over or
whatever you know the syntax is and it
showed me a project Pluralsight will
work perfect for me but for somebody
who's a beginner it doesn't work so let
me see yo having I'm having issues with
your site doesn't seem to be compatible
with my iPad any suggestion um I don't
know I want to be able to help you on
that you know I don't know how the iPad
wouldn't work I've tried it on iOS and
it works but if you
that you're having issues I don't know
what's the issues that you have in you
you have to send me an email so I can
know and see maybe we could fix it or if
it's something we're teachable that's
like out of my hands
you know because technically you're
expected to be using or watching this on
a computer it's not really like a mobile
thing this is not like hey I would
recommend you guys to be watching my
courses or tutorials through to like a
mobile phone or iPhone or iPad I will
say hey man watch this on your computer
and that's how it's designed for the
computer is because you're gonna be
coding on your computer but you know
what I mean oh let me see you two means
better once you buy a course you only
employ a site you're paying subscription
so once that subscription ends no more
access yeah that's true
oh let me see a lot of people prefer my
website I think but I think it all
depends on what you're here for
and if you're coming let's say you I've
seen this a lot of times from guys who
they've done like computer science or
programming courses or they already been
doing this right I had somebody who was
a game developer so he's been doing a
lot of sharp so he already know how to
program he already instance object the
Orient of object-oriented programming he
already understands all those things
right he goes to Pluralsight and maybe
that could work for him right because he
already has the background well when you
need somebody to hold your hand and show
you hate this is what's what you got to
learn this is what you got to learn next
and this was you learn next
I don't think Pluralsight is is the
right place for all self-taught
developers Pluralsight is perfect for
like companies like let's say a company
comes in and say hey we have a team of
five members and we want to sign up to
Flora site so they could all come in and
learn um
react right they all angular developers
but they already say hey I want to learn
react we're gonna start learning react
Pluralsight has a membership for all the
members that are come
me that's what Pluralsight is for it's
not really for a self-taught developer
you have to also find like you gotta
narrow down things like you gotta see
what exactly is the service for is it
for companies who are trying to give
their employees like an extra extra
training
that's what Pluralsight lynda.com is for
udemy.com is good for people that say
hey I want to find something specific
that I want to buy and that's it I want
to buy it I want to take my time with it
right if you say hey I want to take my
time with it you to me it's perfect
cause you could go in there by a course
you take your time you could I seen
people take 3-4 months to finish the web
developer boot camp I don't know how but
they've taken three to four months to
finish it right so they finish it on
their own time they take one hour a day
right so they do one hour every you know
3-4 hours per week they finished it 3-4
months later right so you to me that
makes sense right if you feel like hey
you're here to really learn this stuff
and you were like hey man I want to
learn this as quick as possible
the cheapest way as possible personally
I would think my website is perfect
because if you come in you work hard and
you say you determined you wanted to
learn this stuff you come in and say hey
I'm gonna do like three four courses in
one month
right and you could do it so imagine
each course is like $20 $30 if you buy
it from like anywhere else but you pay
for one membership of $10 with the link
below so you basically got freaking all
four courses for two dollars and fifty
cents in that month you got what I'm
saying like it makes sense and that's
why I think for anybody who was like a
beginner who's trying to learn all of
these things from scratch my purse my
size is perfect for it right as you're
saving money you're not wasting all that
money in buying a whole bunch of
individual courses you're just coming in
you're learning everything that you need
to do in order
and at the same time who's gonna teach
you that better than somebody who's
self-taught everything that I tell you
guys about is because I've been through
it and I'm like yo I wish somebody would
have taught me this like this right when
I started focusing on angular and even
back pulling back then I didn't
understand JavaScript I just say oh they
hire for angular and I'm just gonna
start learning angular all right I
learned a little bit of angular because
angular can make it a little bit easy
for you and you'd say oh yeah cool I
could do a four for loop or whatever but
even know how to do a for each loop or a
for loop or for any loop like that I
know how to do none of that stuff right
but I was able to do it with angular
right so then when I had a problem so
debugging angular I didn't know what to
do because I didn't know JavaScript you
gonna say so it's like that's why I have
everything in order have everything be
like okay learn HTML CSS learn all
advanced CSS know you know do a project
in between come in do some arm do a
future-proof JavaScript which just
teaches you JavaScript the basics of it
how to work with the Dom how to
understand it and I just break it down
like a regular human being not just me
trying to tell you this is a smart way
to explain it not this is just me
telling you as a self to a developer how
to understand this concepts okay so yeah
man you already know simple job back at
it again we here we laughs we got 50 how
many people we got 15 are people up in
here man you know most people work at
this time we got people here somehow on
day lunch breaks or on their phones
watching us on there you know on one
window they I work right now with us
alone another window on a hidden tab let
me see
in two languages think JavaScript's the
same as the Oriental languages and I
don't think it's it's the same I think
some concepts are the same I mean
functions variables I mean it's the same
thing but the way how the way how things
work it's not it's not the same thing
because the Dom is different and it's
like you got to wrap yourself around
that first you understand that in my
people in school right now word now man
we here man we try to learn we trying to
teach we trying to just get everybody
elevated man you know we've been here
for how long I think it's like an hour
and a half already guys I think I don't
even know I'm a check right now we gotta
find out how long we've been here you're
gonna find out
yeah man cuz I'm hungry I'm thinking
about if you guys haven't checked this
out um I have another channel called
family phase right and you just like you
can't get enough of your boy Joe and
you're like oh man go subscribe to that
family face subscribe it is on my
channel there's a link to it you could
go check that out I'm adding freakin
cooking videos I'm adding our videos me
my son I'm adding a whole bunch of
videos there it's just like me hanging
out you know just me hanging out but
with the family and stuff like right now
I'm about to cook I'm about to write

ever heard it those Donuts you want to
know how to make it go check it out um
you know the family face I call it
family face the channel go check that
out
yeah man I'm about to head out of here
man I'm just creating a lot of content
man you never know
feel like you never know like when I'm
gonna go you gonna say like I could be
here one day after my sister passed away
I feel like any of us like we here one
moment and the next day we're not gonna
be here right it could just happen to
anybody so I want to create as much
content as much cool things as I can for
you guys online and yeah man it's
ridiculous so I'm looking at the the
likes and dislikes I don't understand
why people come to this channel and they
dislike videos I don't understand it's
like they subscribe to the channel and
they dislike the videos like bro
it's like unsubscribe like you don't
have to dislike the video if you don't
like it
cool but it's like I don't know why you
you come to this channel every single
time you know what I'm saying I got I
know a lot of people is blocked I got a
couple of people blocked you know what I
mean so even if they wanted to leave a
calming or or say something to us it's
like nope you're blocked you're watching
is and you're blocked you're not part of
the community

the likes is is for but I'm saying like
like we just hanging out you know I mean

when I was like when I was like you know
you're starting I wish I would have
found a channel like this you know
somebody who's real somebody was cools

sound interesting because let's be
honest coding is some nerdy like

of a computer but you know I'll make it
sound cool I'll make you sound like a
man is good I give you that motivation
