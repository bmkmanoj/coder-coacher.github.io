tuples okay so what I'm going to do is
I'm gonna declare a variable and I'm
gonna say something like cars and then
in here I'm gonna come and I'm gonna put
in parentheses and then I'm going to
pass in Benz
I'm gonna pass in BMW I'm going to also
pass and Honda and I'm going to pass in
what is a Nissan all right now
if we come here we print this out we say
cars we print it out it says Benz BMW
Honda Nissan okay if you want to get
access to any of this properties just
like a list you can literally come here
but in the brackets and say hey put the
number 0 and I want to get access to it
okay so show me the zero index all right
it automatically says Benz but something
that you're gonna notice how about
tuples that's pretty cool is that I can
come here and say something like this
cars and then try to do it how we did it
with lists where we say hey I want to
change the zero write the zero index
instead of Benz I wanted to say Joe now
let's see what happens it says most
recent cold last Python line tool tuple
object does not support item assignment
okay so pretty much when you set up a
tuple that to boy is immutable right
immutable means that you cannot change
it after the fact that it got the clear
okay unlike the list where I found how
to list here and I say okay there's a
list come back over the way to the other
side and I come here and I try to change
this you know automatically Benz becomes
Joe and when I print it out it shows me
Joe okay alright so that's the
difference between a list and a tuple
okay always remember whenever you want
to have a list of different items but
you don't want nobody to be able to
change it
always use a tool book because it's
immutable alright so I'm gonna see you
guys in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
