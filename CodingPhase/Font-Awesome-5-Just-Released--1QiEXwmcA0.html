five just released you guys this video
is brought to you by viewers like you
and people that support our website
coding phase comm go check it out over
20 courses in there that's gonna guide
you to become a developer from the
beginning to becoming a pro okay alright
guys so we're gonna talk about font
awesome for awesome was one of those
things that everybody has used in the
past and you know I believe I started
using font awesome I think a version two
or three one of those two all right
basically somewhere last year sometime
last year they came out with this idea
of like you know doing a Kickstarter and
basically saying hey guys we gotta come
out with font awesome five and we want
you guys to support ever saying you know
show some love and to be honest with you
guys I think I gave him like five
dollars or something like that something
you know something small but I donated
something right I think they made like a
million plus or even more than that let
me see what was the exact number font
awesome Kickstarter let's see like they
even got a professional you know film
crew to record the commercial like they
really went out out there wait alright
so let's see how much they got okay so
they pledged 35,000 people paid and
basically they made a million dollars
that's not bad that's actually not bad
you know when you think about it it's
really not bad like they really did
their thing I mean everybody uses this
thing is great especially for the people
that started with bootstrap like you
know font awesome like even bootstrap
use font awesome you know all over their
their website you know for icons so even
at that like millions of websites you
their icons every single day so at the
end of the day they finally got paid
they finally made some money out of this
you know that that goes to show you guys
like sometimes you come up with a
project that could be that simple you're
like oh it's just some icons all right
hey we put in a CDN and it's out there
right and then you're like oh how can we
make money
oh don't worry your body and we'll think
about that later on and that's exactly
what they did is like they got the
service out I became very popular all
right and then now it's like it's all
over the place right so now let's go to
the website so font awesome calm I think
it is great what they did they have two
versions they have the version that is
with CSS they also have a new version
wave I believe it's JavaScript and SVG's
which is pretty cool because if you you
have SVG so you could control the whole
icon by itself like you could animate
the whole icon so that's pretty cool
let me see what else can you do to this
thing I mean there's a lot of stuff all
right but of course now I don't know I'm
a little bit torn by this because and
that's coming from somebody who's a
content creator all right I'm also a fan
and I'm also somebody who who uses a lot
of services I'm kind of torn about it
the fact that you got a GoPro to get
like the light feature it's like okay
like let's say this like the icon right
what they did let me see if they they
have I'm gonna show you one that maybe
it's a little bit different let's search
for the TV icon right so you could
actually know that's exactly what they
did so there's a TV icon all right and
down here you can see how the original
looked all right maybe because zoom in a
little bit less yeah
oops okay so the distal original one now
the one that they're using for the
latest one is a little bit thicker okay
this one's a little bit more square this
one's a little bit more rounded at the
bottom like it they did a couple of
little changes you see like this is a
little bit shortened at the bottom this
is a little bit bigger at the bottom
there's less space between the TV and
the stand on the new one
so you could actually tell like the
differences that they did okay but the
thing where I'm torn about is the fact
that it's like hey man you could use the
solid one which is the normal one right
then you have the regular one and then
you have to light one so the light one
is the one that everybody would love to
use because when you have light icons it
just looks more cleaner right it's the
same thing as fonts if you look at let's
say Roboto and you put and I think a
font way of 100 or front way of 300 the
lightness of it just makes it looks very
nice and clean and very modern right
but now so even get the pro license like
you got to pay $60 like to me for icons
I'll be honest like that's a little bit
too much I'm being honest you know
standard license seats 5 seats 100 like
$1200 per year for our 5 seats
$60 per year so I don't know about this
you know what I mean like and that's
coming from me I'm a creator I have my
own website I create courses I create
tutorials whatever you want to call it
right I just started doing this a few
months ago
hey I bring a developer for over you
know five six years right professionally
I started and when I was 14 but
professionally I could say hey man I you
know started in 2012 my first job okay
so from 2012 to now we're in 2018 you do
the math
so that's coming from me for a license
$60 a year especially after you you
already got so many people pledging and
giving money to you like a million
dollars there's a lot of money you know
what I'm saying like like the community
gave you a million dollars but now
you're like you know what we're gonna
make this something that used to be free
we're gonna make it a pro version so
it's like we fund it that's what it's
like I'm a little bit torn it's like
yeah I only paid for out of CA somebody
else donated you know whatever right
a hundred dollars there's companies out
there that you know they they added what
they pledged to like mana fact was the
minimum pledge I think so yeah so okay
found also pro okay so I placed $20 all
right that was like the minimum that
they had I don't remember I know it was
the minimum I remember it was five or
twenty or ten I know I paid the minimum
but you know there's people out here who
pledged $2,000 $3,000 like you got a
couple of things in there like five TTX
t-shirts whatever like I just don't know
like I just don't know I feel like you
know it's like I funder your your
campaign because I'm thinking in my head
I didn't read everything and sometimes
it's crazy because sometimes we we sign
up to things and we don't read what
exactly we signing up to but yeah like I
pledged into this thing thinking oh cool
they're gonna come up with a couple of
new features and everybody in the
community is going to be able to you
know have you know it's like I wasn't
pledging for hey man I'm gonna pledge to
upgrade your your website and put some
money in your pocket just for the hell
of it it was more like hey man I'm
pledging to this cuz you guys helped out
the community and if you guys are gonna
continue that same help in
in that service that you guys were
giving to everybody in the community and
with a couple of upgrades think cool go
ahead take my money in it's like I'm
paying for myself and I'm paying for
everybody else who can't pay for it you
know I'm really big on that you know you
guys know me on my website do the same
thing the same you know a lot of people
pay for it some people that come from
third world countries and you know
countries that they don't have anything
guys who are younger than 17 years old
you know
just in high school or junior high
school and they want to become
developers I give them free access to my
website right everybody knows that okay
and that's why I supported this campaign
to pretty much just like okay help it
promote it at the same time and just get
it out there and and just people get to
use it brain it's like we paying for it
because we are a little bit more
privileged than others who can't come in
and pay for it right so that's what I
thought we was doing I did not know that
we was as a hey man you're the only one
that's gonna get fun awesome Pro and
pretty much like font awesome Pro is
what people want like that's I don't
know I feel like that's what I pay for I
paid for you know for people to be able
to have access to this thing because it
was free before and now I don't know I
don't know man I hope you guys
understand what I'm coming from it's
like to me I'm like wait for us to use
if I tell like one of my students I hey
man go check this out and I want you
guys to go and go and use whatever the
light one right now they can't use the
light one you get what I'm saying like I
don't know man like that's the only
thing that I'm I'm a little bit torn
about you know it's like people got to
pay for a font awesome five Pro like I
just don't know man I feel like I got
bamboozled
bamboozled into this thing but hey made
more power to them but yeah a font
awesome is it's currently released the
new websites up it looks beautiful
whoever did this website I love their
design I love the fact that they they
came in and there's something legit it
wasn't like you know a half-assed
website I mean you got a million dollar
so you got to do something decent you
get what I'm saying
like let somebody throw a million
dollars at me you see what I do with
that you know what I mean
like and you probably think like man
million dollars is not that much but
listen man is a lot it's a lot and I
don't even think they're their team is
that big so pretty much there was a very
good pocket change for everybody that
was involved in this project so I don't
know it is cool
I just wish that the you know the GoPro
at least would be more cheaper than that
like this is icons you know you know
what I mean like I don't see this like
as a major major service like for $60
all right to be honest for $60 if I'm
gonna pay $60 I rather go to fiverr.com
and pay a designer to create the the
icons for me to be honest with you if
I'm gonna pay $50 or $60 to go pro right
I already have it I'm pretty sure I have
it cuz that's what they say
on other thing if you pledge you get you
get the pro already personal business
license already alright so I probably
got I just gotta log in so I'm good I'm
talking about the people who are not you
know who didn't pledge and and didn't
have any money at the moment or whatever
or didn't even know about this whole
Kickstarter right like they missing out
on a lot so it's like if I was one of
those people I'm like man pay $60 for
some icons like I kind of would rather
just pay a designer to build custom
icons for me you get what I'm saying
like
but that's just me anyways guys it's
your boy Joe back at it again coding
face.com your boys back and I didn't did
it again guys go to my website coding
face.com go check it out man
go give it a chance if you've been you
know jumping from company to company
website to website trying to figure out
how to become a web developer listen I
have a whole bunch of courses there man
over 20 I think we up to like 25 courses
yeah it's only 5 courses right now and
there's more coming this week so it's
like there's like a never-ending thing
is like you get constant courses
constant content like all day every day
is like listen and you can just
literally subscribe get the.oh access
pass let's say a preview has locked out
user coming here if you go and use the
coupon code from YouTube it basically
gives you automatically 50% off on
everything on my website this 20 becomes
10 this 150 becomes 75 this one-time
purchase becomes 150 so pretty much for
what you could pay for a yearly you
could get it for one-time purchase you
say hey I'm buying this one time that's
it and then forever you're getting
unlimited courses it's up to you man at
the same time like you guys know we come
here whatever we earn from this we help
other developers ok who can't afford the
courses so it's like I don't know if we
could call it a communism more like
what's that I forgot that the thing that
they have like you know Norway in
certain ways I hate you you have this
much and that we redistribute it to
everybody else who can't get anything
right so anyways that's what I do we in
here while we're not doing this to
become millionaires we're here to pretty
much help the community and just pretty
much pay the lights that's it nothing
crazy I don't need you know I don't need
a million dollars in my bank account all
I need is just to survive that's it
that's that's my train of thought
you know what I mean
that's the type of person I am so yeah
man we here go support the website and
listen guys we've got a brand new site
coming out for you guys
pretty soon coding phase comm getting a
revamp a super edgy website legit like
oh man I don't even know what to tell
you guys it has is gonna have so many
things man it already has a lot of cool
things like all the courses that you
guys already love but we adding so many
other features man like this is gonna be
your one-stop shop if you are a
developer alright guys so it's your boy
