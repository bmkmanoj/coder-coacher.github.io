again man : face calm your boy is
backing out and did it again
I'm just getting ready to go to work
some new day kids and yeah just fit it
on enjoy this day of work yeah man so
right now the topic is should you be
using JSX alright a lot of people's
gonna be like oh man
we hate using javascript with HTML
inside of it but I'll be honest with you
guys and makes life easier
it's not that hard it's not a big deal
it doesn't really make your coat
ugly it doesn't do all this stuff that
people talk about let's say be like oh
man I don't like JSX because it's just
it makes the coke the coach look too
dirty too much stuff in one page or a
file to me whenever I think of
components it makes my life easier so
have everything in one page and not only
that that is just I don't know it makes
everything you know in perspective of
like what I'm working on
and the fact that you know if I'm
working with a string I'm working with
object or whatever right for whatever
reason
it could be I enjoy using GA JSX pretty
much is a it's a good way to do
components man it's a good way to work
with JavaScript you know especially when
you're used to doing it you know vanilla
JavaScript but now you have something
else that it's making your life easier
instead of you creating an element every
single time you like okay I just put our
HTML tag here and everything will be
fine you know what I mean so that's one
of those things that I just enjoy and I
think if you guys give it a chance
y'all will definitely enjoy it too it's
all about just just doing it man stop
worrying about oh man I wanted to you
know have my template separated from my
large egging all this stuff like yeah
you have your template separated from
the logic and JSX
it's not like you have to put in a whole
bunch of logic inside of the HTML you
keep everything separated if you know
how to basically create functioning
organize your code like me I try to have
as little as possible javascript in the
HTML when I'm doing JSX what I do is
I'll return like a function if I want to
like loop through a couple of different
elements or whatever I'll create a
function for it and then that function
will return back each element so that's
how I like to do it but yeah man you
guys should definitely try it out
check out my hyper app tutorial which is
free you know a lot of people have been
asking me when you're gonna do react I
was thinking about I'm like I might
start this week
I've been saying this for a while like I
want to finish like the bait store
tutorial with laravel and that's also
going to coding phase comm for those of
you guys are subscribed to it you know
and I got a couple of other little
things that I'm working on that's gonna
be free for the free users you know just
puttin up content that you won't see
here on YouTube we have it right there
on coding phase com you know also I
wonder like do you guys prefer me boy
like five minute videos which is very
precise and very straight to the point
well do you like the 10-15 minute videos
where you know oh my
I might just extend a topic or make it a
little bit longer than what it should be
I don't know yeah let me know anyways
guys I'll see you guys around
like I said try JSX man don't be scared
this idea that people have that they
want to have everything separated they
want the HTML one page they want Java
Script in another page and they want the
CSS on another page I don't know I don't
know if that works in 2017 and beyond
you know I mean look at look at
languages like L right L has everything
in JavaScript all right and to me that's
pretty complicated the way how they did
it but with JSX is so easy man is it's
just having you know just having HTML in
your JavaScript man
like you know how easy that is you don't
have to go in and be like oh you know
create an element or you know whatever
right or even like adding a class like
all you have to say is class name that's
it and for me for Hyper app luckily you
don't even have to say class name or you
have to say it's class and it creates
the class for you so in the attribute so
yeah it's pretty cool man
check it out give it a chance I'll see
you guys later all right take care
