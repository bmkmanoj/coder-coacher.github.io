know the boy genius
aka young son Paulo congrats man do that
swag to celebrate a DAB hidden woody
you're thinking about there iam not
really I don't know you use cold Bemba
Bravo merci pour assembly they vote
tonight revived I don't know what that
means but it sounds cool
who's up one okay he says can't stand
this ish enough to do it as a job I got
a no question it's no basically just the
pug Jas portion or am I missing
something what do you mean about that
I got an old question it snowed
basically just a pug Jas portion or am I
missing something
now this more 2-node know that what I
saw in close to your course but he used
expressed with it yeah exactly
look I think the one that you date was
the pug Jas course all right the puck
Jas course is separately that's just the
template engine right you could use that
with any back-end language you could
think of
like literally pug could be changing to
any of those language by the course
itself known to yes it has a lot of
stuff and it has MongoDB has creating a
blog creating a project and going back
to that which is something that I was
gonna nouns later on but since we're
talking about Noah I'm planning on
putting node.js on hold the course I
might be taking it out the website you
know I might be taking it out the
website for a simple reason that I'm
seeing a lot of people are having too
many issues with the nodejs course all
right
and it's really more of like different
systems everybody's on a different
computer everybody's using on different
windows and now I'm starting to
understand why a lot of people like
Steven
Grider and cold steel gets people to
sign on to cloud nine because when you
sign up to cloud nine everybody is on
the same system everything they could
follow along and do everything and
everything works for them but when
you're dealing with having people
install it you know there's like a
barrier there right like people don't
know how to install node people have
windows and they don't know how to do
basketball to win and all this stuff
they're not technical savvy so I'm
thinking about putting a hold on
the nodejs course I might do it again
through c9 because it just it's too much
of a headache you know like look I've
been wanted to finish the course of the
know GS but I've been literally emailing
and helping people out how to just
install nodejs how to deal with the web
developer starter kit doing all this
stuff like you guys don't know how
difficult this is on my life like you
guys don't know especially because it's
just me so I'm concentrating the counter
for you too and also answering
everybody's emails and it's like
backlogs or backlogs of emails and
comments of people that are getting
stuck on nodejs or stuck on the web
developer starter kit and it's like to
me is simple but for a lot of people
they're like man I got this errors in
and it seems like people don't
understand that errors when you got an
error
you're supposed to Google that like when
you're going to find that this whole
career that you're getting into
everything is an error right everything
that you're going to be dealing with in
web development programming in general
is about errors right at all times
you're going to be getting errors so
when you get an error you have to go
into the documentation of no GS or go
into the documentation of just search on
Google literally you get an error the
last few lines you google that right you
just copy that and paste it in and
that's it but it seems like so many
people just don't know how to do that
and is it's kind of driving me crazy
so every other thing out there is not
I'm not having no issues with it like
the HTML CSS everybody goes through that
course perfectly the future pros Java
scary thing goes perfectly sass the CSS
grade every single course that I have on
the website everybody goes through it
perfectly for whatever reason you know
even the react
some people have some issues in the
beginning but the comments already that
of like people that already found the
answers like helps them out and like
they continue on the course and they be
good but for some reason the nodejs I
keep getting emails and comments about
nodejs hey this doesn't work on this my
server says this and people are just not
understanding that hey you got to look
at the terminal the terminal will tell
you hey if there's an error here you got
to look at that and find out what's the
error I cannot do everything for you
because you gotta understand every
computer is different every system is
different you might be on node 4 you
might be on or 6 you might be a node 9
you might be a node 8 like like
literally sky's the limit of like the
possibilities that you could have with
nodejs and the things that can go wrong
with nodejs now this is personally
exactly why I'm not a huge fan of nodejs
because the problem with nodejs is every
like every single library every single
or version of no GS like this always
something that messes up either somebody
like let's say you go in and you put NPM
or was up day or I don't know if it's
NPM update your NPM upgrade and now you
upgraded all your versions of your
packages right now some packages are not
gonna work good with other packages so
now you have to go on the internet and
this has happened to me this is why I
tell people like man this is a headache
for you guys I understand it that's why
it's called nodejs you're going to have
to deal with this BS you have to go in
there and figure out oh what's the error
find out what version you're using then
somebody you will post it like on github
put in a pull request not a pull request
on a request for like there's a problem
issue request and then somebody will
come in and give you the answers but at
all it's because you're using a version
4.5 and you're your body parser is a 6.2
or something like that right and just
because of that your whole application
doesn't work guys you you guys don't
understand the world of hurt that you
get yourself into when you deal with
nodejs and that's one of the reasons why
I'm thinking about putting it on hold
because I'm going to probably create a
different course with doing it with
cloud 9 for one simple reason that it
just saves you the time of the headaches
you know if everybody is on the same
computer same environment then it works
perfectly for everybody so instead of me
worrying about debugging and helping
people how to debug things for their
personal computers we could focus on the
technology itself all right you know
when I created the web developer starter
kit the reason why I created that it
wasn't because to say hey guys don't
worry about how to do this with cope how
to do this with web pack no it's because
those things are a headache if I'm a
developer right and somebody tells me
hey you're gonna have to spend a day or
two learning gulping learning how to set
everything up and learning how to deal
with web pack and deal with all the
errors I'll be like by the time I get to
code JavaScript I don't even want to do
anything cuz you the whole time it's
gonna be like debugging things and
fixing it now some people love that like
me I love doing that because it's like
it's like my call is it's like a puzzle
when you get an error you got to figure
it out it's like you're finding a piece
that works I love that this has been
times I spend six hours
debugging something and then once I find
it it's like my brain is you know full
of dopamine like I'm height I'm excited
but some people if you're a junior
developer if you're somebody who just
started and you don't know none of this
stuff and you fall into a trap of six
seven hours of errors
you're like man this thing is not for me
so I don't want people to get
discouraged all right so that's why I'm
thinking about putting a stop to the
nodejs course and I'm going to rebuild
it
doing cloud nine so everybody else can
be on the same level now once you learn
nodejs it's on you to learn all the
other things like you know how to you
know dealing with the debugging your
orders different versions and all this
crazy stuff because I just want you to
worry about the code itself I don't want
you to worry about all the BS behind it
the BS you can learn that once you learn
the technology itself you know what I
mean like once you know how to code fine
then you can understand how to debug
something how to find it but if you're
trying to just get to code and you can't
even coding everything that you write
doesn't work then it's gonna discourage
you right so yeah man so to answer your
question eighty-four music sorry for
this long rant and this long
announcement that I'm pretty much going
to take off the nodejs course it's not
I'm taking it off I'm I'm putting it how
can I say I'm putting it on hold until I
do it through cloud nine
where every single person is using the
same version right so that's the issue
what do you think about kramer thinking
Bitcoin will be deaf over futures let's
see let's see how it goes just landed a
job as a PHP developer even though I
don't know PHP thank you exactly it
happens all the time
PHP is easy you can learn that on the
job so it's like literally like Congrats
if I already have an Instagram account
for my art should I make another
Instagram account for coding despite
might learn status I don't know I think
you could keep both of them if you're
looking to have like
you want to match both of them together
you know what I mean
let me see eighty-four years is like
yeah let me see leave for those who can
get it and let those who need help find
it online
others in the class service as a
resource yeah I could let - why are you
thoughts on learning Salesforce
Salesforce is good because if you're
looking to get into more corporate type
of jobs like it seems pretty
it seems pretty pretty good because I
see you all the time and like in jobs
like Oh big plus if you know Salesforce
so it means it's very popular right now
yeah man David Vieira
hi from Brazil all my people from Brazil
you ain't no I'm harbors iliyan - so you
know that's why I get the sauce you know
what I mean like a Chuck get that
chicken
damn I forgot my ring on that is it I
gotta get my rhythm back damn I lost my
sauce then your boy just lost the sauce
somebody took my mojo who took my mojo
now he's honest no Jes talk just suck me
dry real quick like I like nodejs when
it works you know that's what I can see
but that's why I tell you something I
think one of the main issues with nodejs
is learning nodejs with something like
Express learning no GES without a
framework a lot of company I want to
return back you know if as a REST API
I want to return back this data that's a
that's why most companies use nodejs for
they don't really use it for server-side
rendering like how some people oh you
could use freaking nodejs and react and
angular the means tag and guys most of
the companies that I know they don't use
it for server-side rendering they use it
for or REST API that's what no GS is
really good at right like I've seen is
done in multiple places where they have
or Ruby on Rails and then they use
nodejs to send when they need to send
big data to other devices like iOS and
and stuff like that now or they do it
with the use python and then they'll use
nodejs for the rest api or like let's
say you have a single page app then you
will use nodejs
but to do everything with nodejs is is a
headache man my boy right now
he works in a major company like a major
company and he literally telling me
right now I was like yo we are going
through hell right now every single day
we got a hire new contractors to come
work on this no GES application that was
built a year two years ago and every
time there's something else that breaks
something new no js' is not all you need
is the basics right but that's why if
you really want to do like web
development with no GS you gotta use a
framework you can't go in there blindly
trying to use something like Express
because it becomes a headache you want
to use something like Adonis Jas which
is another thing to where I kind of feel
like I want to do the I want to redo the
nodejs course and keep it just rest API
bare-bones right and different day I
want to do it with a framework like
Adonis GS where there's more structure
and people could follow along and have
everything work more better but doing it
everything was expressing it's just a
headache man because this all those
packages they get updated and things get
messed up and yeah
yeah you definitely you could get used
to it but it's just like it's you know I
mean like if you if you use something
else like you know if you use another
programming like a package a real
back-end programming language like a
server-side language then you and you
use no GS you will realize all the BS
that no Jes has and you'll be like man
you don't deal with this with Ruby on
Rails you don't deal with this with PHP
you don't deal with this even with a
Python you don't they they work the BS
that you I mean pythons almost on a
similar thing because you got to deal
with a lot of libraries but let's say
something like Dar net those guys why do
you think that people use that net so
much right like those major companies
used our net because it just works like
it's not pretty it's not cute it's not
like super fast it just works
you know sometimes you rather have
something that just works instead of you
spending time debugging and figuring it
out hey call back hello hey freaking a
sink a sinking wait like you know what I
mean like there's so much BS in
JavaScript yeah you could definitely
make it any API like your five lines
yeah definitely does a thing it's a big
difference when you're doing it you're
installing nodejs on your computer and
you're installing everything on your own
server and maintaining yourself now when
you do it with cloud 9 it's totally
different cloud 9 everything's in the
same versions everything is everything
works because you're not dealing with a
Windows computer like on my Mac
everything works perfectly on a Linux
I've tried every tutorial that I've done
everything works but you know now do I
tell people I hey man you gotta install
Linux in your computer and it's like now
is another process of getting them to
install a whole operating system that
they're not used to you know saying like
it's better to have it on a virtual
space like cloud 9 where it's like hey
all I have to worry about is the
technology itself not debugging your
Windows computer like what I'm saying so
let me see took me a minute to figure
out Windows you definitely need to do
some research I also noticed I had to
run npm I saw a few times on Windows to
get it to run yep yeah yeah Casey no you
probably there's nothing to like you
people have different architectures of
the computer like you know some people
have like let's say a version of Windows
that they haven't updated or they might
have downloaded a version of nodejs that
you might not have like you might be
running no GS 6 point 4.2 and it runs
perfectly now tomorrow they update it
and they say oh this works now every
developer out there people are not
worrying about Windows I'm letting you
guys know ahead of time when people come
in and create a library they upgrade
their their systems they update their
their libraries nobody's giving a damn
about the Windows user they just like
hey man they gotta figure it out right
90% of the developers that are creating
stuff are using Mac's or they're using
Linux so when they use those systems
they're like oh it works for us now for
Windows user comes in as a way man
Sixpoint dot you know 6.4 dot - doesn't
work it used to work on 6.4 dot one and
it's like hey man it works on our Linda
or our Linux in our max it's like good
luck figuring that shit out you know
what I mean it could be somebody sent me
a message that to run their nodejs to
run the the what the value of what
developer starter key they needed to
install Python 2 and I'm like what up
you get what I'm saying like WTM like
what like you need Python 2 to run the
no SAS on your computer like that sounds
crazy but it's Windows man I'm a window
thing it's time to gonna make yes I'm
telling you guys it's just for
development purposes even a Linux Linux
is good Linux if you have look if you
have like the same example 500 gigabyte
hard drive right on on your laptop take
a partition of it and make it to Linux
just 100 or gigabytes and use that just
for development right whenever you're
gonna code you use that and then
whenever you need to use your other
applications to use your Windows that's
the best way for any developer out there
now trying to use stuff and experimental
things like nodejs like in reality
node.js is experimental because they
constantly updating - changes that it
just doesn't go for windows user it's
not perfect for them now if you use
something like PHP PHP is it works
perfectly or on Windows Python works
perfectly on Windows but no js' is
there's always going to be an issue you
know even the MP
or even using any of the stuff like npm
install or even yarn i heard people have
issues with yarn running yarn and the
windows and it's like it's kind of
ridiculous
basically my question came from wanted
to build site with most of what I've
learned database back in front-end etc
yeah you could definitely do it with no
js' if you want to sequel
ok so john g fischer says you know
what's the database what database is
best to start learning CEO or MongoDB I
will say sequel because sequel your if
you know sequel it opens the door for
more jobs now if you use you say hey I
know MongoDB it's gonna open the doors
for you for places where they use a lot
of nodejs alright but they compared to
every other programming language out
there no js' and javascript is just one
section right like let's think about it
like this if this a hundred jobs and you
say okay I know MongoDB okay that gives
you the opportunity to get 20 jobs right
now if you say I know my sequel then
that opens up the door to 80 jobs so you
have more opportunities to get a job you
know what I'm saying okay you should do
a course where we're all the merge tag
is put together mean immense tags put
together yeah that's what I want to do
with the cloud 9 like I think I'm like
the nodejs course that I have up right
now I'm gonna finish it
cuz some people are going to be able to
finish it and some people are just not
going to because they have different
windows computer I can't be buck
everybody's computer so what I'm gonna
do is I might just make it completely
free you know I might just make it
completely free and be like hey guys
there's a freak freaking ojs course
that's it you know for the ones that can
finish it yeah I can finish him then the
ones that just having issues debugging
and all this stuff then you know it's
free guys I'm not gonna be debugging
everybody's computer so then the next
one I'm gonna do it to cloud 9
which is just focusing on on development
and that's it now you have to figure out
your own way to debug things you know
what I mean I mean see the machine when
I was what else who says he who else is
in here sorry I'm behind I'm reading
everybody's messages ok webpack is
definite opinion yeah it can be for sure
yeah I'm not a huge fan of web packed
that's why I enjoy golf man go p-- is
just easy like you know the reason why
out of all of this frameworks and all of
these tools come up is to make our lives
easier you should not be focusing on or
you know the stack this is why I say all
the time don't focus so much on the
stack don't focus so much on on how
things kind of scale in a year two years
from now why because if you don't have a
product if you haven't built anything
who cares how it's gonna stack up a year
from now you got what I'm saying like
sometimes people be like man we got to
create the infrastructure that gotta be
amazing from now they spend all week two
weeks I'm just you know freaking
designing the architecture of the
project and everything and there's like
okay you just wasted two weeks right now
you don't even have a project yet you
don't even know if that project is gonna
work you don't even know if what you
want to finish at the end I'd rather
just come in start building something
and things like web pack make it a
little bit harder because it's like now
you gotta go in there and waste time and
and set up a whole system like that's
why react had to create the create react
create a react app CLI because people
were not learning react because just to
get into react you have to go through
help you know somebody who comes in
let's say I'm a developer I work at a
company and I've been doing jQuery for
the past ten years and that's why UJS is
also very attractive for a lot of people
because to do react or to do angular you
have to go through the hell of setting
up NPM all right there are NPM packages
dealing way from with gulp dealing with
grunt or wet packing they're from
they're dealing with Babel dealing with
typescript dealing with setting up
settings for typescript like there's so
much stuff you can literally spend a
whole week just setting up a built you
know
sorry guys I'm saying setting up a
starter kit you could spend a whole week
just on that before you even start
coding so when something like jQuery
like View Jes is attractive to people
because then I can't man what I want to
do is just start coding I don't want to
come here and spend two days of just
setup you know what I'm saying so that's
what I create umm react created to
create react app CLI that's why ember
has the CLI that's why angular now has a
CLI because they built it for you you
don't have you you don't have to spend
time hours of just setting up it's just
like hey man I got a product to do I got
a a page that I gotta set up I gotta set
up some forms I don't want to spend two
days on just setting up before I even
start coding like I got other stuff to
do so you know it could get very very
scary for some people you know it's
discouraging because if you're a brand
new developer it's harder for you guys
to just come in and be like have to deal
with all of that you know what I mean
it's like I want to learn how to build
things I don't want to learn how to set
up a starter cake like you know what I
mean so yeah man
let me see what it sounds like
manager majority of people are windows f
those developers yeah but that's how it
is it's just easier
let me see let me see let me see good to
know how long kids let me find out stay
right there don't nobody leave I gotta
be right back
you
yo we got a new member of coding face
calm he just got his first first course
let's see let's see let's see let's see

want the hoody something that we could
really wear something that when you
outside people wouldn't be like lash
Allah corny you know
one thing that people don't even know
that it's about Cody you get what I'm
saying like it'll be like something
legit but at the same time it's like us
who are part of the community know what
the t-shirt or the hoodie is about
what's up my coding phase I have 700
gigs free should I partition 200
gigabytes to Linux yeah
how are ya is gonna make your your life
a little bit easier look it up do some
research on YouTube how to party
partition your hard drive for Linux
I will what's the name multi boot or
forgot the name of it big ankle break
big big angle brackets on on the logo
put a note everybody your Joe I recently
just got my first freelance job I don't
know what to charge let's see it's just
a static website if it's just a static
website charge by the hour you know what
I mean if it's like super simple charge
how long it took you you know and do it
something reasonable so the person could
come back to you and it still gives you
more business later on don't be like hey
man this is gonna cost you $2000 they're
gonna look at you like yo you're buggin
out like this is a simple website you
know what I'm saying
we're probably class Kody face throws
exception no no sauce yeah that's fine
if it's a simple sight 250 $300 that's
fine that's money to your pocket man you
know sometimes people want to charge
more money than than what the websites
are really worth you don't have any like
there's something super easy that they
could do on on let's say what's the name
of that company Wix or something like
that
and they came to you then you might as
well give them you know take care of
them and charge them something simple
you
exactly ya can but the thing is how long
does it take you know what I mean like
somebody comes to me I'll be honest if
somebody comes to me and bill I hate a
landing page that's super simple super
static site they come and ask me
Hey Joe can you just build me a landing
page and I can do that in three four
hours
i'ma charging like two hundred two
hundred dollars right because it's only
gonna take me two three hours you know
what I'm saying like how much is that
fifty dollars an hour like that's saying
if you go in and you charging people and
you charging people like it also - it
depends on whom and sometimes there's
the thing if it's somebody like you know
somebody who you know whatever if it's
like a business thing yeah you could
charge more but if it's like let's say
you your frickin friend comes up to you
by hey man I want to create a landing
page for for my little restaurant now
I'm starting up you're gonna come and
charge your friend to two thousand
dollars like you know what I'm saying
like four to two to three hours of work
like you gotta be uh you gotta be an
a-hole you know what I mean like you
can't charge people crazy amount of
money because that's how people you know
they don't come back to you
now if it's a business be like hey man
that's like 500 bucks or more you know
it all depends have I been coding in Goa
land at all recently um not really
I've been doing a lot of react lately
and videos actually gonna be released
today at 12 walk tomorrow twelve o'clock
in the morning which is like later on
today it's all o'clock in the morning
you guys gonna see this in your video
that I made for you guys and it's all
about react and that's something that
I'm I'm thinking
about doing for my website people were
telling me this that what I should do is
focus more on a specific niche like I am
still going to do a lot of different
libraries and a lot of different
frameworks but focus more on a niche
right
and I was thinking you know what I'm
really really really really really
really really really really really good
with react so I should do more react
projects for you guys right so that's
what I'm planning on doing the next
project that I'm doing which is a series
called how to make independent money as
a web developer with your own skills
basically how to make independent money
with your web development skills all
right that's gonna be the next series so
the series is the whole process of
creating the the project is gonna be on
my website right now the process of
planning and explaining the business
model and everything I'm gonna put it
here on YouTube for everybody to see cuz
you can use it at any moment for any
type of project but the process of
actually creating the the project is
going to be on my website and it's
actually gonna be all react
ya know that happens all the time you
gotta understand that happens all the
time like let's say a company could come
in and do something that takes a few
hours of work in charge $20,000 right
but it's completely different then when
you're doing it like let's say somebody
find you on Craigslist somebody finds
you on Craigslist is like hey man hey
you want to build my website and you
know the website is super simple you
can't come up in but I here I'm gonna
charge you $20,000 because that's not
the type of companies you know what I
mean
now let's say for example you you work
with the sign agency right they have
designers they have UX designers they
have the people that's gonna write the
the content for for this company
the copywriters like they have to pay
everybody right so it's really like a
team of five two to six people that's
gonna be working on this project so they
gotta pay at least from two thousand
dollars and not per project and I know
companies that charge how you set fifty
thousand eighty thousand dollars per
project and like let's say Nike comes up
to them and says hey we want to launch a
new product can you guys build us the
landing page and they charge you like
fifty thousand dollars that's just how
it is but you gotta have a company
behind you and you gotta have to write
sales representatives that's going to be
able to swindle their way in into a
contract with one of those companies
thank you you just don't get those type
of contracts you know to get those type
of contracts it's like connections with
connections and you know you gotta be an
award-winning digital agency like you're
gonna say like it takes a lot it's not
just oh yeah it's just Johnny
on the internet trying to charge you
know fifty thousand dollars
yeah that's one of the things that my
friend Joel was telling me he's like man
he he was thinking like we should open
up our own agency in and try to get like
big big big companies cuz he has a lot
of connection with that in the city I
don't know it could be in the future
that could be like an option
you know like I'm telling you like once
I have my office I have the studio down
building then everything is gonna come
in into place like there's gonna be
other parts of the business that we're
going to get into it
oh shoot your boy Matt it's in here
what up Matt what I would I would I
would up it's been a minute man I feel
like I haven't seen Matt in a long time
man once Matt guy with a girlfriend once
my god they gave him a little taste he's
God we haven't seen him in a while
that's it
I caught a taste of that and I said it
was a wrap we haven't seen him since my
boy Matt man where I'm at we did it man
one of the first people in here man I
really appreciate man man I hope one day

a lot of time man's like dude I had a
girlfriend for like two years already

guys let go you guys don't know what the
fuck you don't know what you guys are
doing it over in England if you let your
boy Matt a hard-working kid a kid who
was freaking nice who's he knows how to
code he freaking does all his work like
whoever did that it's just like uh you
know I was like it's one of those comes
like you know whoever did that matter of
fact you know they not scum they're like
you know that piece of gum that you find

developers just focus on on here like
are you talking about who doesn't have a
personal life who doesn't create
personal projects who doesn't do stuff
on their own time you got on say like
some of these companies there's people
they do and say things that is just like
retarded like who wants to work with
this type of people and it's like those
people that they make you come into an
interview they tell you hey man we gotta
give you the job and then later on then
they call you up and tonight you know
what man you know what we're not gonna
give you the job we're going to have to
do something else it's like why are you
