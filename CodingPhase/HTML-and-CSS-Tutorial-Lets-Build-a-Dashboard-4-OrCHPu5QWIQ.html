basically set up the HTML okay now what
we're going to do is style this up and
make a look exactly how it is on the
image which is I'm gonna tell you right
now how long it's my desktop
okay which is this one - water right so
we want to look half this thing look
like this right and then make the tables
look like that alright so let's start
from the top right so start on this
section okay so let's come to public
okay I just want to see what we did in
the HTML we got a classical heading and
then we have a h1 and a P tag
alright so let's come here to the main
let me see content area alright and
constant area we're gonna say heading
alright heading and then we're gonna say
h1 but now let's just put in purple and
then on this which is a P tag we're
going to say color grey dark
okay now let's save that make sure this
thing is running we got a dual MPM run
watch okay cool so I was running there
now let me see boss the size of this how
much you want this let's see see a
twenty font size or we could you say
something like 1.4 M
and then font size let's say front size
now we already got the concise font
weight we want it to be 300 here it's a
little bit better it's probably a little
bit more than that I made 500 and now
it's a little bit too thick 405 yeah all
right excuse me
okay so this color as you can see it's
too light let me see something if we do
something like this and see how great
light looks like relates a little bit to
like alright put great dark it's a
little bit still a little bit too too
late so for now we're gonna come back
and put in the right colors let's just
put 1 B 1 B okay now we're gonna make
this font a little bit smaller so it's a
font size point 8 gram okay now what we
want to do is to this a charm we want to
say margin-bottom and let's give this a
margin-bottom let's say 20 pixels love
it some say it's a little bit too big
yeah that's a little better okay and for
this one we're gonna say something like
this we're going to come to the next one
say margin bottom 10 pixels too
all right now the next thing we want to
do is work on this area here so this
we're gonna come here to the HTML look
at the things that we have so we have a
difficult cards and then inside of it we
have a card so this whole area is called
cards and then the side of it each box
is called card so close this so what
we're gonna do now is we're gonna create
another class under here I'm gonna say
cards and then we're gonna put in card
sink it all right and then we say
background FFF which is white okay we're
gonna say the side of it gonna put it
for the radius 5 pixels okay whatever it
is 5 pixels we're going to say for now
let me see
should we use some type of maybe we
should so on the card we're going to put
in call MD for call and before and
basically because it's it's three
columns right so what we want to do is
we want to say something like this where
we want to divide 100% divided by three
which is 33 point 33 right so what we're
gonna do here is we'll say with so come
here
I'm gonna actually just put it outside
for now we're just gonna say call md4
alright call them before and we're gonna
say wave equals 2 3 3 divided by 100
divided by 3 sorry 100 divided by 3 plus
pixel gotta make sure this thing says
card here whiff is 33% now try to figure
out why this thing oops that's why
that's what it is sorry it's not pixels
supposed to be percent sorry guys
so you regular human mistake okay all
right so we got that right
now what we want to do is we want to say
something like this we want to come in
and say padding 15 pixels 0 top and
bottom but it's a left to right okay so
you got that pad in there cool
now we're good for now and we're not
gonna create a full grid of this thing
but that's just for me to you know I'm
so used to bootstrap that I just like
naming them by those columns names ok so
anyways let's continue with this let's
look at this and we got ok we got this
image
which is called user image so card come
in and say user image and then for that
user image we're going to copy what we
had before which is this here I'm gonna
copy everything for the background top
you come back to constant area and for
now let's just put this we gotta see
another EP that's fine I'm gonna say
wave let's say your hundred pixels hike
400 pixels and then border-radius
50% save that and there we go we've got
the image right now another thing that
we want to do is we want to make this a
little bit bigger so you can see that's
a little bit bigger in there it's a
little bit too big so let's put it to
dirty still too big it's running once
money think maybe 150 okay
yeah what fitting seems right okay now
what we're going to do is inside of this
card we're going to give this a space so
we're gonna come here and put some
padding okay so let's say the padding is
20 pixels all right now this user image
what we want to do is let's say
something like this is to margin:0 auto
okay so that centers the image all right
now we got this which is let's look at
the HTML which is username and use a
title so let's do that let's come here
let's put in those classes user name and
si phone size on Ram and then we're
gonna put in color purple all right
we're gonna say this is this is
display:block so we want this to be
display:block so you could take a whole
line and then we're gonna do the same
thing to the other word which is user
title okay font size is smaller so let's
say point a trim
okay now for both of these we're gonna
text-align:center
so basically realigning the the text to
be centered so you can see here alright
and then what we're going to do is we're
gonna give these basically margins so
we're gonna say margin say 10 pixels
zero left or right okay same two for the
user title alright now let me see what
else we got to do so now we got this
area here we got a little something
similar to what we did before where we
just create a class for it so let's say
this is say there's 25% of 25% of of
that space right or even maybe more than
that so there's like let's say let's
break that down right so give us a call
MD and then instead of four we're going
to say I'm gonna put it by three so what
we gonna come here we're gonna copy this
I'm gonna say with 100 divided by four
which is 25% okay now let's come down
here where we have this so we're gonna
say column oops
column 3 column D 3 and then this one
we're going to say column D 9 all right
so let's say something like this I say
blow up this pipe 9 yeah so calmly 3/4
all right that's fine so let me see
we'll see how that looks was the work on
this
now we also want to put these things to
be displayed in my block because we want
everything to flow next next to each
other
all right we're gonna actually do a
little something to this tool so we're
going to come here and we're gonna ask
something else so that HTML so we're
gonna remove the caller call him the and
we're gonna put it inside so we're going
to create a class and say class call MV
for all right take this out from there
we're gonna do the same thing here on
the other one and now there you go all
right cool
all right let's make our life easier
right so what we're gonna do is we're
just gonna say the number of of columns
that we want right so for this one we
want 3 times 100 divided by 12 because
we want to of columns all right now this
is just like a quick fix I'm gonna do a
grid later on because just to make our
lives easier you know but for now we
just basically prototyping okay so we
got three it's on so 100 divided by 12
we're gonna copy this the same thing
here and matter fact yeah three divided
over 12
this one's gonna be for them divide a
400 divided by 12 stop okay let me see I
think that's fine let me look at our
card
since something on this card want this
to be sorry it's the opposite way so
this is supposed to be for this is
supposed to be three so the next thing
we want to do is just say
display:inline-block display:inline
block right now we just prototyping kids
all right
I know people constantly be pissed on it
this ain't the right way is like it's
prototyping saying what what tells you
like hey they code everything perfect on
the first try it's completely lying
because right now you just prototyping
and then at the end you come in you
clean it up all right I mean that's hard
to it alright so anyways so we got this
right we got this area previous
application okay they use a title come
on use our image user still inside of
card so card starts right there okay so
here we're gonna say application I'm
gonna say front size 0.8 room and then
what else point eight room on the other
one here we're gonna do the same thing
so that Carm deification got schools
copy this
okay
all right so we want this to be
display:inline-block hold on Missy
CarMD nine so let's just create that
collar for the hell of it
call em D 9 foot 9 dear save that
ok what's the issue ok expect the
expression without a CSS let me see I
think I left something
but our semicolon somewhere copied is 9
9 was the issue let me see this place
back the expression all
display:inline-block on line 55 okay oh
that's why you see if that everything
should go fine all right
now let me see what's the issue on this
thing
don't think so we want to say float:left
float:left float:left are cool that's
fine
now what we want to do to the card we
wants to say on the card overflow:auto
and then things should be fine okay cool
now this is fine for now let's look at
the image what we got okay
you got that let me see should make this
a little bit like so
education color gray light gray dark now
okay what else we've got to come to this
area now so let's do the other one now
first of all on cards cards cards if we
want to say overflow:auto okay we want
to say margin 30 pixels on the bottom
sorry
margin bottom 30 pixels all right now
for this we want to say interview
schedule so let's look at the HTML of
that so you got this card
okay interview schedule so let's say
over here h6 I'm gonna say font size for
seven room say eight gram okay we've got
a trim then we have the date which is
date and what we want to do is font size
1.3 room okay
you're gonna say this play black its
play black we want to also come here say
border okay hello order left let's say
five pixels solid then we say green neon
all right so we got a green neon let's
see we're going to basically do
something with this we can say
position:relative and we want to say
left negative 15 pixels
negative 20 pixels all right and then
we're going to say padding 15 pixels but
we only want it on left and right on the
top you are five pixels you want five
pixels yeah that's fine and then we're
going to do margin let's say 10 pixels
top and bottom right zero okay let's
make this a little bit more because it's
definitely more more margin than that
let's say 34 now yeah it's a little bit
too much see it's funny yeah that seems
right so okay now the next thing that we
want to do is we'll come here and
manufactures that's more there's
actually like 40 pixels so let's say
something like this let's say padding 40
pixels all right now every other other
thing here we want to have a padding of
40 pixels so so you know what instead of
doing it through there what we're gonna
do is we're going to do it through now
you know what that is right 40 pixels
here
and then on this area here what we want
to do is we got a look at the HTML so
see how we structured that okay column D
let me see how about the list for now
let me just focus on on getting this
elements done first and then we we make
exactly the same sizes as the image for
now let's just put in the elements so
let's say job type we're going to say
say 50 pixels height 50 pixels okay I'm
working on this little thing here
alright so that's what we want to do
that we want to come here and say font
size
okay color white padding 10 pixels see
look at the HTML so we got this now this
we want this to be display:inline-block
display:inline block let's make this
tool ten pixels it's a little bit too
small 20 pixels all right now we're
gonna say border-radius
five pixels all right let me see it's
actually 50% not five pixels 50% to make
a circle alright and then what we're
going to do is for now we're gonna leave
it like that we we just gonna say
text-align:center vertical-align:middle
alright just for now okay now the next
thing that we want to do is until this
area's here so we have location call
that location in this position okay so
let's come here and say
location possession so I'm gonna say
phone sighs boy eight gram font weight
300 now let's do the same thing for the
was the position it was in position
shouldn't be oh yeah this position
okay so position we're gonna say is 0.8
Ram weight of 500 okay now both of these
supposed to be this plea block okay now
what we're going to do here is I'm gonna
look at this we're gonna say I'm gonna
add those those two columns so let's go
back to our CSS let's see column
returned
taste here just put in order call em the
tool here all right all right there you
go
cool now what else we want to do to this
you got the time
yes okay so look at the HTML span class
time let's add that to the CSS so after
position we're gonna save time and we're
going to say copy the same thing that's
here on the difference I'm gonna say
font size font size is fine
fart way should be 300 and color should
be gray Dart
all right let me see so after that we're
gonna say for each one we'll put a
margin bottom going five room
okay now I want to get this covers
before we leave this for now I want to
come here and actually get this color so
let's go to color that Adobe okay let's
take the image now let's get all the Fox
let's just focus on the fog
okay that's one font saying though that
we could keep green with the definitely
keep no green we change let's get to see
where is it
okay we're all right that's the purple
all right what's the other one that we
need
okay
alright save daddy's oh my god forgot to
sign in I'm gonna have to do it again
okay I guess we don't have to do it
again - poor home fonts okay
click on edit let's go to variables now
what we're gonna do is we're going to do
a little change so we're gonna change
this so where we would say gray light
we're gonna do a global search and
replace it so we're gonna say command F
find gray light and replace it with I'm
gonna say light background right
find or search everywhere okay find or
replace all okay now for this other one
you're gonna search for great dark I'm
gonna replace it with great dark
background find or replace all
all right cool so that should be fine
now what you wanna do is we're gonna do
something like this gonna say dollar
sign gris-gris dark font we're gonna
take this copy it I'm gonna paste it
there do the same thing for this one
we're gonna say gray dark gray light
font sorry I missed that
that : okay and then I'm gonna say like

in orange and we're going to say put
this color alright and we're going to
take this dollar sign

I'm gonna say gray like font - and save
that and there you go so now the last
thing that we want well we've been here
for 40 minutes guys
it's been a long process okay so now the
next thing that we want to do is come
here to lower CSS and change a couple of
things so I says gray light okay grey
