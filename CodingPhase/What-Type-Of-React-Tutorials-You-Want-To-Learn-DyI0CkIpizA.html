went up is your boy jump back at it
again man coning face calm listen your
boys back alright so today I'm going to
start my new series which is going to be
react over crystal camel and yard which
is the rocky step right so some of you
guys is going to be like oh my god I
don't want to learn crystal I don't want
to learn this and that you don't have to
learn crystal if you don't want that's
the beauty of it right so basically what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna start making
some react tutorials right and in that
way you're gonna learn the rocky stack
which is just pretty much react with a
back end of crystal right but for you
guys that don't want to learn crystal is
fine because all you have to do is just
now watch the end of the series which is
going to be like honor 8 10 videos down
the road so the reactor tori is done i'm
gonna make your pretty much you could do
it do it in any back-end you could do a
PHP you connected to psv connected to
know Jas connected to Crystal connected
to a go connected to python connected to
whatever you want right i'm gonna make
it in a way where you're pretty much
gonna be good no matter what stack
somebody has for you you know so just so
you guys could hit the ground running
when it comes to react because it's very
important right now to know at least a
framework you know there's a lot of jobs
for angular and there's a lot of jobs
for react so those two are the ones that
i would recommend but i will say hey
learn react because i react is such a
better system and better framework than
angular so you know what i mean so i
just wanted to ask you guys what type of
tutorials you guys wanted to to learn so
i could actually make it for you guys
and
and we could chat and basically find out
what do you guys want to learn do you
guys want to learn how to do like let's
say an example sliding menu or do you
want to learn how to filter through data
with react like I say do like a search
or what exactly we like to alert you
know well guys when you hear jsx jsx
think about jsx is just JavaScript all
right it's just HTML and then just
JavaScript that's like if you know
JavaScript you know how to do it if
steaming you know how to do a loop then
you already know jsx you know it's not
that difficult it's not something out of
this world like something like angular
is more difficult because you have to
learn the way how angular dusting so you
gotta learn how to do was a bind
whatever i forgot having use angular in
like three four years but yeah so you
got to learn a lot of from for
angular but when it comes to react all
you need to know is just JavaScript plus
it it actually makes you a way better
JavaScript developer do i use go yeah i
use go every day you know a lot of
people are jumping into the bandwagon of
web pack 2 and web pack 2 was good but
man gulp is just simple you know
especially for you guys when you
starting out all you really need is gulp
you don't really need anything else
besides that all right yeah so what else
what else you guys want to learn man why
exactly okay so Mateo says are you gonna
cover Redux as well I'm gonna say yes
I'm gonna cover redux for sure because
Redux is like a big part of JavaScript
so if you gonna learn Oh Nigel scary big
pot of Redux sorry big pot her react
sorry guys I'm like
can sleep deprived right now I got only
like three hours of sleep last night cuz
I got that new MacBook and then I
started installing everything that I
needed to get get it up and running so
you know how it is man you know how when
you get a brand-new computer you get
hype and you start adding everything
that you want it for a computer so
that's what happened last night I went
to sleep like at three o'clock four
o'clock in the morning so but yeah so
I'll definitely gonna teach you redux
it's a big part of reaction you have to
know that at least i'll react router
yakety to react router this it's not
that hard i mean we have to learn react
router because if not that how we gonna
you know we're going to basically do
like the rowing like we definitely need
react router i'm gonna teach you two
ways of doing react components because a
lot of people think you are for me
that's how i use react right a lot of
people think that you have to use react
router for everything but that's only if
you're going to use it as a single page
app right most of the time especially
now people are walking away from single
page apps right now they're pretty much
you know everybody is noticing that it
just comes with too much baggage too
much problems so what people are using
react now for is just using it for the
components so like let's say an example
you have your page which is server-side
rendered but then you have a search
input for you right where you want to
search a page like let's say you want to
search a product right you searching for
sneakers and you type in jordans right
and then you want in that search box to
drop have a drop down that has all the
Jordans right you will use that just as
that component that's when you use react
right before people will create the
whole page of react and it's like if
it's not a single page app and you don't
need a single page app you don't need
react route
right so I'm gonna teach you both ways
both ways of actually working with
reacting and yeah let me see what else
you guys want to learn yeah I mean it's
gonna be uh definitely it's gonna be a
project that I'm gonna do for you guys
like I said I'm gonna be using my own
stack which is the rocky stack something
that I'm promoting out here and uh yeah
but pretty much guys it's like I keep
repeating this all the time once you
learn one stack you know every single
other stack out there because no matter
what language you're gonna go use right
you're still gonna have to do the same
things meaning you're still gonna have
to have a server-side rendering which
means just a regular page that's gonna
be like your HTML page right then from
day you're gonna have you're basically
your CSS on top your header you're gonna
have your navigation then from day
you're gonna have to use something
that's called template engine it doesn't
matter which template engine you use it
they're all the same different day
you're going to have your JavaScript at
the bottom and that's it so it doesn't
matter what stack you use it could be
the lamp stack it could be the mean
stack they're all the same so the way
how I'm gonna teach this is going to be
in the the rocky stack but this can be
implemented to anything anything out
there because that's the point why I
made it it's just like hey I feel like
it's super easy to learn the way for
crystal syntax as far as like the back
end and then it's just gonna be mostly
JavaScript so you guys already know
JavaScript you already know like the
beginning of it so yeah
how dangerous is it to skip jquery and
go to react no that's not true you
definitely need jquery so he said learn
code Academy said you don't need to
learn jQuery anymore it's not mandatory
but you should know it because
especially when you're brand new
developer you're not gonna be working on
the latest and greatest things they're
gonna put you working on or like legacy
code you know I mean so you want to go
to accompany say yeah I know how to use
Rio I know how to use jQuery it's not
that hard people knowing jquery and
literally i think 10 minutes it's not
that hard
yeah i'm thinking about creating like a
a project-based right so i don't know i
was thinking about creating like maybe
like I don't know like a player like
Spotify like a Spotify player or maybe
creating a blog or maybe creating
something cool I don't know something
that's going to get you guys interested
in doing the project and that's the
thing guys like I'm taking my time to do
this man like do the projects guys
like you guys keep asking me like Joe
what is it that I have to learn what is
it that I have to do guys I'll keep
uploading to tori's are keep uploading
projects and it's obvious that most of
you guys don't do them right there's a
very few that of you guys that come to
my channels because of the tutorials and
you get to learn from here right but a
lot of you guys come here and it's just
like hey I just wanna I wanna come see
Joe I wouldn't come hang out with Joe
and come talk with him and it's
cool but at the same time you're not
learning you know what I mean like if I
come in here and I create a tutorial for
you guys I have four thousand
subscribers out of those four thousand
subscribers at least 2,000 of you guys
should be taking the tutorials and
making them and even if you don't
understand everything that's happening
just pretty much follow what I'm showing
you guys on the video because at one
point on the tutorial you're gonna get
everything you're gonna understand what
everything is happening because a lot of
people take a tutorial that I oh man I
don't know JavaScript and this is going
to be javascript in here so maybe I
shouldn't do the tutorial it's like no
man just take it just watch the whole
tutorial watch the whole series take the
project and then from there you're gonna
learn from it that's how I used to do
you know how many I used to build
that I didn't understand
but then on the second third project
that I built like that I understood
everything I was at own soon so that's
why we did this like three videos back
or whatever you know guys stop being
lazy I know yeah oh here not because of
me you're not here because he I just
want to see my face you know what I mean
like you're here because you want to
change it I view here because you want
to build stuff you here because you want
to get a good job if you want to do that
then man listen to me man follow what
I'm telling you guys if I tell you guys
hey I'm gonna create a tutorial and you
know in the rocky stack there's a reason
why I'm sending it making it there you
know I could go and make a mean stack I
could go and make it in the lamp stack
but there's a reason why I'm doing this
because the way you guys is going to
learn this from me you're gonna learn it
in a way where you're going to be able
to implement this to every single
language I'm not doing something that's
specific like you go to tutorials most
of the time in your youtube and people
make tutorials that ok it's only for the
mean stack and they make a project that
could only work on the mean stack I'm
making a project that you could
literally take the JavaScript and put
into the mean stack put into x into
 PHP put into java put into
whatever back and you want but you're
gonna get to learn everything you know
what i mean so but stop being lazy guys
like that's the same thing like you get
doesn't like them too I did the project
for you know the guys done being their
mentor for for this month and you a lot
of you guys are not doing the project
soon like the project is there why don't
you guys do it too at the same time like
stop being lazy you're not gonna get
nowhere if you're being lazy
what's good Little John what's popping
what do you think about password is
password is is good it's just another
user authentication library London
Dominic without what I would up yeah
exactly yeah yeah that's what i'm gonna
do laundry like I'm definitely gonna do
a tutorial not like hey of course I'm
the first thing I'm gonna do is do the
hello world but it's not gonna be a
 five minute long tutorial to
basically say hey okay guys you just
went through five minutes of
and then now are we gonna display is
hello world or a bull to do app
like you know I gotta give you real life
examples
yeah I'm definitely going to show you
how to grab data from an API for sure
that's definitely gonna be in their
motivation talk real talk for real
now that's good it's good if you're here
just to get the motivation and keep
pushing forward you know more power to
you you know but I just like everybody
else is here and it's like okay I keep
hearing also to people they're like oh I
can't afford them to buy ten dollar a
ten-dollar course you know and I'm like
man if you can't afford the ten-dollar
courses or fifteen dollar courses or
twenty dollar courses from you to me
that's fine so take advantage of you
know the tutorials i give you here for
free take advantage come here and do it
for free and what's cool about crystal
Ling is like also to you guys now you
guys are able to do it in windows for
you guys are our windows user now you
get to be able to do it on windows too
so yeah
listen man i'll be honest i'm against to
the torrent because people put in time
and like i'll be pissed off i'll be
honest i'll be pissed off if i go and i
spent you know is it takes so many hours
guys to create just a tutorial
just a regular tutorial now imagine that
guy Stephen writer who is the person
that I learned react from right imagine
if I would've just went over there and
just got that from from torrance
calm or whatever turns to you now that
guy put in so many hours I know
for a fact because I've been talking to
him and through emails and stuff and
like just how long it takes me to make
tutorials just imagine planning out a
whole course you know from start to
finish which is usually like 10 hours
think about it like this to make a video
that's 10 minutes it usually takes half
an hour to an hour now calculate that to
you know 10 hours of content
you know that's why i don't use torrents
in what action because people are
putting in time when to the and i
was like what is ten dollars manly I'll
be honest if here if you live in
a is in bad way or a Nigeria or
something like that and you literally
don't have ten dollars or you you will
 you a little kid from from the
Philippines who who lives in the
province I understand you don't have to
knock but if you live in America and you
don't have ten dollars I'll be honest
you would doing something wrong with
your life and that's the truth there's
no way that nobody are you got ten
dollars for course
like that's just being honest like you
have to invest into your own you
can't expect everything to be free guys
especially to the hands man like you
know send us analysis going to
mcdonough's that's ten dollars like you
guys gotta invest into your own thing
right and yeah you can get there's a lot
of good courses here on YouTube that is
free but you have to understand it's
free on YouTube that's free is not
the same quality of somebody that's in
their house for three months creating a
course for you editing videos making
sure there's no mistakes making sure
that there's no typos except
arrow this guy as when Diaz was
the words he's literally the
worst instructor on yoona me
that guy he'll have a whole bunch of
mistakes and then he'll be like oh I'm
sorry guys let's go back and fix it
after 10 minutes of him giving you
 mistakes he goes back and fixes
the mistakes like what the hell like if
I'm paying money and I don't want no
 mistakes in my shake you know
just teach me the course but you know
you get what you pay for you know you
paying ten dollars you're gonna find a
lot of courses but there's good
ones like there's a big difference when
somebody comes and shows you how to code
but when he breaks it down in a dummy
way like me I like people to just break
it down for me like I'm stupid I don't
wanna I don't need to be out here acting
like I'm smart teach it to me in a way
where you will teach it to a 3 euro if
you could teach it to a three year old
cool you're the best you know you're the
best instructor you the best
teacher that's my philosophy on
especially when I'm doing tutorials it's
like hey how can I explain this thing to
a little kid because it's like just
because we adults and like that
like it doesn't mean that we're gonna be
special big words around and you
start
it's about syntax that people don't
understand they're like I don't come
from look okay get a science background
you know what if I'm Joe Schmoe the
mechanic you know am I gonna understand
all this big ass words that come
with development no most likely not but
you gotta be done
yeah yeah all right guys but um yeah man
I'm definitely gonna build this
tutorials today I'm gonna start today
and yeah Yello I mean it's the same
thing for me like if I'm over here I
started watching a tutorial or I struct
her and he's not breaking down I'm
like okay you lost me I'm out of here
you gotta break it down like the person
doesn't know because most of the
people is like this if it is like this
if I'm a computer science graduate I
have a bachelors i have a masters i
don't think i'll be honest i don't think
me as a computer science graduate i'm
not gonna go to you to me or YouTube to
search how to build you know a certain
app or how to learn something most
likely what I would do is I would learn
through the documentation right so most
people that go through you to me and go
through YouTube are not computer science
majors our regular people who
are trying to learn something so why is
you gonna give them some big-ass words
some big-ass concepts that most people
is not going to understand like teach it
to them in an easier way and then that
same yeah joe wheeler or we got to be
able to sign up for conan face card
that's another thing i'm trying to
finish it as soon as possible but as you
can see i also got to maintain this
website so i gotta this beautiful
chatter so i gotta come here it's like I
only have two days of the week where I
work on the Kona face calm then the
restaurant
for you or I got a doula now gotta do
the internship or yeah how many source
it's hard that's why
Oh
link nope now give you access to the
project and Yahoo actually you know we
have this open source so you guys
can help out you know everything is
already done user authentication is done
now all I need to do is just create the
different stacks and create connect the
users to every icon is every channel
that you create nothing after that
everything's gonna be good it should be
done but just give me some more time
guys it's hard doing full time job doing
YouTube boy mentorship doing a whole
bunch of guys like you know I wish
I could just get it done right away all
right I'll see you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
