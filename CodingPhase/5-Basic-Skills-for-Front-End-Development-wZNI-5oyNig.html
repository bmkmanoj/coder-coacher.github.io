face.com
listen your boys back and I done did it
again
alright so guys this all so stupid but
it's so simple that you know even a
caveman can do it the front-end work is
the easiest thing that you can find out
there and for people who are trying to
get into this industry I think is it's a
no-brainer to try to get into front end
right because in reality you don't have
to do that much it's only HTML and CSS
write some JavaScript once in a blue
moon
but yeah so I saw the same and hacker
new rule it's one of my favorite sites
what they do is they basically find a
whole bunch of articles from medium and
put them together on this website so it
gives you a whole bunch of different
news every single day always something
new a new article somebody wrote or
something that they shared and I wanted
to actually show this to you guys so
there's are the five basic skills for
front-end development right I want to
give the props to - Poquette for
actually creating this which is
something that I've been repeating a
million times this is not math and
science is like simple alright so what
he put in is first is HTML CSS of course
the most basic building blocks of what
coding right just every page needs HTML
CSS alright then from there you have
JavaScript and I'm not talking about
advanced JavaScript I'm not talking
about knowing object-oriented JavaScript
I'm not talking about none other stuff
like we're just talking about
understanding the Dom understanding how
to do a if statement and how to do a
loop those little things that's what we
are talking about all right so that's
super simple okay and then from there we
have jQuery
everybody will be like guys don't learn
carry a jQuery jQuery all jQuery is from
1998 not things like 2005 something like
that 2006 but jQuery is like as
important as knowing JavaScript because
every single website uses jQuery at some
point every single person has to use
jQuery at some given point doesn't
matter if it's just to add a class to a
element or they want to use a void Ajax
like everybody has used jQuery and they
still do so if you're going to get hired
you need to know this trick little
things they're not that hard trust me
we're not telling you become an expert
in JavaScript that's one of the things
that people don't understand you become
expert in JavaScript over their years it
doesn't mean that you have to become an
expert in JavaScript before you get
hired before you get a job in the
industry before you start working on
small projects or or anything all you
need to know is the if statements
variables operators like the simple
things the syntax of JavaScript then
from there jump to jQuery jQuery is fun
is easy it's going to save you a lot of
time instead of you writing it directly
in JavaScript but you need to know
JavaScript to basically understand
jQuery jQuery is just like bootstrap
it's like a way for you to write code
faster and/or get something done simpler
in a few lines but you need to know
what's under the hood and under the hood
is JavaScript alright then the fourth
one that they put in is a JavaScript
framework and like I'm gonna repeat this
again you don't have to be a expert in
any framework all you need to know is
understand what the framework is doing
understand the syntax of the frame stand
the boilerplate of the framework and
when I say the boilerplate I'm meaning
just the code that you always have to
you know create like for react for me I
always have to create a class
you know I always have to create a class
extending a component or I have to
import with the react from nodejs like
little things like that that might seem
trivial and dumb like that's a
boilerplate the things that you have to
do every single time like the same thing
for angular you have to come in and say
ng app through every single app like you
don't have to become a expert just know
certain things about it right and then
of course this is the most important to
me everything that we just talked about
are great but they mean nothing if you
cannot debug if you do not understand
what debugging means or you don't know
how to do this where you right-click
expect and then you come here and you
look at a element and you come here and
be like oh there is a class but what if
I wanted to change it to body class or
whatever or if I wanted to change let's
say the background of this section go
like this we double-click this into this
and we say hey background right alright
if you don't know how to do this like
you need to go back to like you know you
know this is the beginning because you
need this you need to learn how to debug
you need to learn how to look at the
constant logon and fine if this error
something broke if you came in and say
name and nothing came up and you know it
wasn't declared so you got a command and
say hello far name equals you know Joe
and it's undefined but when you come
here and you say name and prints it out
like if you don't understand what's
going on here you need to go back to the
beginning because you need to understand
how to debug things whenever you have a
problem and you see something like Oh
variables undefined or varial variable
is no or it's a you know like Leslie you
have the string of five but you doing
double equals and you're saying is equal
to the number five and it's giving you
true but you're like wait they're not
the same type how do i D bug that how do
I find out and you don't know how to do
a triple equals to check if they're both
the same number or and the same type
like you know what I mean like if you
don't how to do those little things then
you need to go back to the beginning
right you need to understand how to
debug and I think it's a very simple
list it's like nothing crazy you don't
have to be a genius to do this thing but
yeah I think it was a pretty cool post
to just keep it simple
you know something simpler just a
infographic and that's a it's like here
you go guys but yeah you know shut up to
the meet reboot code for writing this
and I hope you guys like this video
