back at it again man make sure you
subscribe and make sure you hit the
notifications down there the little bell
you dig
anyways we're gonna start with who's the
number-one enemy of every developer in
the world right now you might say why is
this guy anyway right why is this guy
Wow he's supposed to be hated why I see
labeled the number one basically enemy
from every single developer well his
name is Joe else Polsky right this
 creep all right I'm sorry but
anybody like this guy this guy's a
complete creep
he pretty much he's the CEO of Stack
Overflow pretty much in Psych he owns it
right
he co-founder of Trello which is another
big company and he wrote this article
which is like a blog right of him saying
that if you work for him you have to
sign an agreement that basically says
hey all your side projects I only
because I don't know if you're getting
your inspiration from my company which
sounds ridiculous because pretty
much almost nobody will be able to
create anything new because now if you
work for somebody you pretty much gave
away all your rights to your ideas or
your future ideas right so I understand
this a difference if okay you work for a
company and then like let's say your
Google right and then you say hey we
have a search engine and then you quit
your job after six months of working
there and now you come up with your all
basically search engine that's better
than Google I understand that because
then you could get sued because you're
like okay ah you know I copy
Google and I saw what they had and then
I made it better and then I knew that I
could go
and you know creating by myself whatever
and then make you actually better but
just the idea that if you work
for a company and they make you
sign a contract and tell you hey as soon
as you start working here or your future
ideas we own it you know what I mean
like this idea that a lot of CEOs and
you know owners or companies they think
that they own you like they
swore just because they pay your
 salary you're the one creating
99% of this for them but they think
that they were on you they think
that you gotta work for them
24/7
your brain is theirs because
they paid you a 60 70
80 $100,000 a year and they think they
own you for a whole year and now
with a contract they wanna
basically own you for life you know so I
don't know man
so he's like talking and saying all this
companies is gonna say hey we love side
projects we don't really like side
projects we love side projects and we
are kind of indifferent so pretty much
is like okay if if they don't care that
you make some money go ahead and make
some money right just I don't know I
don't know if you guys not understanding
this you guys got to go to this
blog and read this and understand the
idea that if you work for any company
and they make you sign a
contract that says hey we all all of
your ideas from here on because we don't
know what from our company you're
actually taking or what influenced you
or like let's say if you come up with an
algorithm or you learned a new
programming language they don't know if
you got those ideas from that company so
pretty much you're signing into a
contract that basically says hey you
can't create your own side
projects forever like now it doesn't
matter if you have a great idea you want
to come up with a new a new company
whatever that's saying you can't do it
because this asshole Joe well
Spolsky pretty much made you sign a
 contract and trust me right now
this companies don't have this right but
I'm pretty sure they give it a few more
years and thanks to this ass
article they gonna somehow
 they're gonna streamline this
 you know they're gonna make
this like a industry
standard and that's why we gotta put a
stop to the ship now you know what I
mean like this is like the
number-one enemy right now this
jerk right now it's like no you cannot
 on my if I created
something I created this not you so
why the do you want my ideas right
like explain that to me I could work for
you but you don't own me that is that
simple this is my brain I'll do
whatever the I want to do with this
 brain I got your little 9 to 5 I
five o'clock I clock out I don't know
you if I see you in the Street I
don't in to say hi to you
because me and you are not friends me
and you we just work together or I work
for you we don't need to be friends and
that's something that every developer
needs to get this idea in their head
because the CEOs this owners they don't
give a about you you know they
might pay you high wages because a lot
of people won't you tell me but doesn't
mean that they care about you
they don't give a about you because
then something that's going on in
America like they make you know
billions and billions of dollars if you
could go ahead and pay off
or your employees with 8% of all your
profit and keep the rest for yourself
why wouldn't you and that's what they're
doing every company
you know if they pain if they
spending ten million dollars in in the
talent to come in and to work for a
company how much you think that they
really making they gotta be making at
least a billion you know to pay forty
million dollars so they gotta make at
least five hundred to a billion dollars
four hundred million to a billion
dollars so this people are just
 straight assholes and I don't
know I'm making this guy the
number one enemy for every developer out
there look out the article is called
Missy developer side projects I can't
 believe that this
asshole will come up with an idea of try
to stop every developer from creating
side projects because they could be
influenced by the company that they're
working on like yes that could happen
but how the are you the
owner CEO a Stack Overflow a
company that's basically it's just a
 forum for developers to
post their things how dare you come up
with some like this when you're
supposed to your core is your
core audience and the people that go to
your website is
developers how dare you come up
with some that basically is this
making developers gonna be
slaves to company how dare you
come up with some like that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
