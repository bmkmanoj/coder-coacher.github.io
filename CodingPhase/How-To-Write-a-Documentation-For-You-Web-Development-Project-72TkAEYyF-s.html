jump back at it again man Cody face calm
sorry I apologize something happen I
don't know what the hell happened but
pretty much my mouse died everything
died a lot of the electronics here in
the house kind of died out I don't know
what the hell happened but oh yes so
let's get back to this so I'm gonna
bring up my screen real quick what I'm
doing today is basically I'm going over
the you know the rocky stack and at the
same time you guys can probably learn
how to write a documentation or how to
basically publish a documentation of on
get books using github alright so I
think this is gonna be pretty useful for
you guys that that want to create your
libraries and so you who are actually
understand what's going on right
but at the same time you get to learn
about the rocky stack a little bit more
because you're actually looking at the
documentation well yeah so let me share
my screen they see oh shoot infinity
yeah okay so this one we had basically
if you want to check out get books you
search skip books right or the kimbugs
documentation made easy you basically
sign up which a github account you can
create what a gmail or at the Facebook
too but most likely just created widget
gave up so everything could be connected
especially to the one that's a project
that's that you're actually writing the
documentation work so yeah so I created
this test room but that's just more
reason as we work on this one rocky
stack so what happened was I had this
other one which is co-opting slate it's
like a generator for documentation
and I was having issues with it and I
was getting already pretty tired and you
know what it looks nice is pretty you
know this and that but let's just keep
this thing simple so if I'm gonna edit
this page I have to run a generator and
it takes forever to build so what I'm
doing is I rather just host it with Gil
and that's why we grow it with this
right so I'm basically transferring
everything from the other website the
other generator to this one and at the
same time teaching you guys how to do it
so yeah anyways man so yeah so I really
do like an introduction which is the
first overview just a information or why
I created this the getting started you
know telling you hey download the
project from them I'm showing you guys
on how to do it for Mac then how to do
it for Linux so yeah let me do this real
quick I gotta edit this thing now let's
do this it should be sure to this
looking started but after so yeah so I
got the insulation getting started which
is download the project and installation
for Mac OS X Linux whatever the person
has here I'm going to put dependencies
and then drag this to here cool alright
so this how it comes out get crystal
dependencies ok yarn dependencies get
going
so installed gold I should put this in
the installation okay take this
Oh goal what else that was for the Linux
one - yeah let me separate this is this
different is actually okay so basically
what you're seeing here it's called
markdown text so let's say the language
that this is supposed to be used on its
supposed to be JavaScript then here you
will say Jes and then we'll show you
syntax as if it was for Jasmine right
but since this is actually going on the
terminal what we're going to put in this
shell cool alright so let me put in
you're on cold wells take me half that's
pretty good steaks a little smaller cool
all right now from their dependencies
have that okay I'm sorry so here you're
going to split this up and say okay
we're going on one server cool all right
so we got that part done anyways let me
check with you guys is up to learn the
chatroom see what out with you guys at
the same time even though I'm doing this
at the same time I want to also chat
with you guys
okay who's in the chatroom
missiles in here okay want to do a
project if I want to do a project where
do I go what do you mean by that
who do you mean what if I want to do a
project where the rifle okay that boy
Gerry's in here what's good bro Oh
obviously it was in here only 13 people
in here
I understand today's it's often it's hot
outside everybody wants to chill outside
yeah so let's get back to this any
questions you guys might have let me
know I'm here I'll answer it cool all
right
so what else I got I got left to do
okay I gotta see a dozen introductions
installation folder structure I'm
supposed to do it later me see who else
I got HTTP okay for this look away okay
so come to the minutes basically now
let's start transferring the stuff over
so we have HTTP routing okay cool
so we're going to do the routing ray and
cool I think up to this far
article prolly okay
paste this in here simple motto Rasta
clear that's fine rest combs cool what
else we got static files static files
some candles get in this sometimes on
sometimes okay so I'm gonna make this
like this put this under here
see I'll fix this up
probably like oh my god it is boring
well no one comes guess for it
you can't denial about it like you just
have to do like that so see what else
see what you guys are saying in the chat
let's go your project the two projects
of the mentorship students there on the
description okay
okay so this basically just deal with
the static files right now let's see
what else is left here we are routed
with that error handling okay okay I
think
okay okay so about that now what else
what else I got left in this thing uh
RRM it's not done yet what security it's
not done yet
the views okay okay so views let's
create a little part I want to preview
this thing let me publish it see how it
comes out okay cool all right
looks good cool everything's looking
good it's easy to follow so it should be
good
okay this oops okay so let's continue
this create the views create article
here and let's see what else we got to
put okay render views
okay what else another one I'm writing
this thing super easy so like anybody
that wants to do this they could come in
here and do it right away
this is actually one gonna be teaching
today fuller to Toria render views has
variables control tower high-pass
variable to the real okay cool on the
route into the row well that's fine
make this go on top of this
now what else cool layups supposed to be
a article sorry to lay out okay
promote that okay this is the arrows
well I'm going to organize this thing
because I'm reading it it doesn't make
sense to me so in the layouts of the
view okay yeah
okay okay that makes sense
SSI as in the layer on the route instead
of the rap okay cool that's fine then on
the view use hello play here goes waste
a well on the layout put in the content
we'll see I'm trying to read this and
make sure that if anybody else is
reading this it makes sense to them
so you're saying okay on the layouts
okay so layouts are the great way to
keep your code your code dry okay that
makes sense but I don't ever okay let me
put this into law
okay view layout' okay alright if you
guys see any typos anything crazy let me
know I'm not a writer you know I don't
specialize in writing documentation and
 but you know if you find anything
that should fix let me know listen why
is it called Iraqis - it's basically
react over crystal camera yard so what
language you used to create that table
it's called markdown it's gonna mark
down on markdown language what I'm doing
here is called a markdown language so uh
if you go to github you'll seeing
everybody's project re-meet page is
basically written on or markdown let you
see this thing here everybody makes it
this is actually made in markdown that
MD if you wanted to edit it that's how
it looks super simple is not crazy maybe
I'll do a tutorial about it later on in
the future right now I'm just knocking
out this documentation it's print the
color you want to show up for that real
okay let's see the point you want to
show if I really just put to call you on
the show I feel there's a repeat where's
the repeating here shouldn't repeat and
we'll see why okay she's actually right
now sound like a delay of something
and we want to show forever you okay use
the tag to display the page content from
the layout okay what else and a little
bit different console you
let's get I back a slower case alright I
saw us organized this cool
okay in the layout add the yield okay
welcome please isn't making sense
constant title to now this area is
different this includes
take a clue any viewing any you can clue
any view any parts I should do list to
include any partial okay let's go to
this up top this an older cool so we got
that I think that's my same it's pretty
much it that's all I got for the
documentation but you know what I gotta
add one more thing which is how should I
call this fine
all that follow but they don't that
support at apart a main point things a
lie around so specific name to
documentation when they call it front
end what compiling assets okay okay cool
this animal facts it is a deep this okay
let me see really that's fine there's
good wanna see that article sides put
this on top
Oh slowly saying they want to compile
they want to compile CSS
how should I do this okay it was a go
trial or assets as well
missing what happens if I go and create
multiple different status clocks go
bitch oh wait this isn't it okay so
let's see what happens if i want to run
multiple CSS I don't know if I if I
added that because I usually just use
one CSS and then I import anything to
that one so let me see yeah run run run
watch okay why don't know that I go to
it's for the same guys mistakes yo
 it okay
yawn you're on watch so what happens
this right here is supposed to be
serviced there might be a error on the
gulp
so that's good okay cool now let me see
then it compile okay cool so it does do
it cool okay now let's see if I want to
change this to red okay cool that's
something new that I added to little
today which is CSS basically you know
live reload on the page whenever you go
change so it's gonna be easier for you
guys you guys will have to keep pressing
refreshing the whole thing is gonna
compile for you okay what else so let me
add that just to the book okay to the
sass okay code file
where's that folder assets state assets
sex
okay assets inside of a clock see sacks
missing markdown folder structure let's
see how that looks looks like still
looks like
your choice
still kind of looks like alright I
will stay more for now he's gonna keep
how was
still the JavaScript copy this to the
JavaScript I know you guys are like what
the hell she's so boring well you know
that's just how it is guys like
sometimes it takes a little time you
know to build things
because what this is doing is saving
somebody's time you know like whoever is
going to use this this stack is going to
be able to know what the hell's going on
to the stack you know it's like for you
guys you guys don't want to learn this
thing if you guys gonna use it you're
gonna get lost at some point so at least
if you have a clear documentation that
tells you what to do then everything
should be fine listen we fix this up
okay
put it inside okay cool okay
okay I'm gonna split this up
just go from a tagine
let's see anybody on the chat seventeen
watching uh without what everybody was

in here vend or the vendor
well so we got the vendors is something
else on this
okay let's go to the view
static snap this one source huge pages
on page all right I think I'll say yes
all we need from now let me see
okay we use go for managing multiple
tasks if you want to import
okay
c9 in there laughs riddle
do I have enough yarn watch and you want
us okay gotta build a list
okay yeah giggles what else we got more
down run down step
yes should be fine
all right let's see what else what else
we got to do it's a lot of shake man
maintaining our libraries it's about a
 to nameless
watch that's good

I'll end it right to this thing I see
well sectors like alright then we get
into this ha ha ha ha
your boy is back sorry guys the
took forever man but now you got an idea
of what's going on with the rocky stack
and at the same time you get to see how
to work with get in on the GIMP books
now let's see how actually came out ok
pull and start it Mac OS X Linux
dependencies run server of SAS
JavaScript ok let's see watch routing

views as variables to views layouts the
content I will see how to put bad little
