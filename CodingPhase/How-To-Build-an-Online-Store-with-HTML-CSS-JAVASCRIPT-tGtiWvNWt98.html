choked back out in the game man : sitcom
live from the crib you did all right
guys listen I got a super cool project
for you guys man
all right I don't know if you guys have
ever heard of bait yeah we heard an ice
cream you haven't heard an eagle you
ever heard Pharrell well basically we're
gonna create a store right online store
and this is going to be super cool
because it's gonna be you know done in
HTML CSS JavaScript and then we're gonna
sprinkle a little sign called PHP and
laravel you know you know what I mean
you did it all right listen guys you
gotta understand I'm doing a lot of new
changes a lot of cool things for you
guys I want to give you the best that I
can give you same time
this project is massive you must
understand this is going to be one video
a day right
I'm going to give you the tutorials I'm
going to give you the files I'm going to
give you everything that you need to
basically succeed and learn this project
right guys now all I want you guys to do
is basically follow instructions about
to go live on my computer for you guys
but just follow instructions in yeah you
will succeed you will be good and back
at it again your boy enjoy your day dad
all right guys so let's start by
analyzing this right so this timaya this
is basically the prototype this
basically the idea that we're going to
build for this webpage is going to be
high end you know super clean you know
simple but this is going to give you all
the basics between HTML CSX alright guys
so this how we gonna do it right we're
gonna dissect this whole design and
we're basically going to lay it out the
way how we are going to break it down
with HTML I don't know if that makes
sense but
you will see what I mean okay so pretty
much we're gonna say this man start
making this in two different layers all
right cool so this the header of course
all right so the head is there let's
make this into a color that's
see-through okay we have the header
right there right and then inside of the
header we have a level then we have a
manual section and then we have this
that's going to be I don't know how to
make your head or maybe remove it or
maybe just keep it for mobile only um
we'll figure it out later
but this right here is a whole complete
section so let's make this on another
color let's make this my favorite color
in the world which is purple right now
we have that and then from there we have
the main content area right so this red
box that's on top of it
this is basically for the person to
choose either the front the side the
back so if they scroll up or down is
going to switch is gonna say front is
gonna say back bottle if I'm gonna do
that yet right
we just breaking down the layout exactly
how we're going to build it so for now
forget this red area right so this makes
this another color this make this know
what let's make it oops let's make it
red let's make this purple again and
let's create another layer right so
we're gonna say all of this here is the
content area
we're going to make that into ready
sorry
cool okay let's bring down the opacity
so we can see what's going on all right
now as you can see try to avoid and try
to ignore this red area this red thing
that's on top of the image right we're
going to divide this into different
sections so we gotta say half of the
screen is going to be the image and then
the other half is going to be there's a
little black the other screen is going
to be you know description title the
whole shebang
so as you can see let's say we make this
into an h1 let's say we make this into a
paragraph and then this is gonna be an
unordered list and then this is just
going to be regular Alex right so let me
divide for you guys so for you guys to
see what's going on this is like the
category right make this little flack
okay so category there's our h1 there's
a paragraph this here we're going to
make into a span all right this is going
to be an unordered list unordered list
and inside of it there's going to be
allies each little circle here is going
to be an ally or is going to be a anchor
link right depends on what we decide to
do later on
now this here each one of these are
going to be buttons so still this now
cool remember let's see where is it
remember this whole area is going to be
the image so let's just cover it up now
whole area is going to be taken by the
image all right so that's how you break
down the paint you know if you have any
questions leave a comment I will answer
and pretty much this is the beginning
right now he's got an idea a little
preview of how this project is going to
be and the next video is we're gonna
start with HTML and CSS all right guys
