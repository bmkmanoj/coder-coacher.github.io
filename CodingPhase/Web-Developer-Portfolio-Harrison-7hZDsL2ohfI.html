jump back at it again coding fees.com
your boys back and I done did it again
guys I got your favorite this what you
guys love you love seeing the reviews so
here you go man he's a new portfolio
review shit boy Joe hey guys this video
is brought to you by viewers like you
and people that support our website
coding face.com
go check it out over 20 courses in there
that's gonna guide you to become a
developer from the beginning to become
analyzer
today we have a pretty cool portfolio
man it's pretty nice and clean the fonts
are nice everything is nice even the
colors alright so basically this
portfolio is from Harrison I poke be me
I don't know how to say his full name
man but Harrison is the man
I like his portfolio and this is cool
man this for my people in South Africa I
have a lot of people in South Africa
guys you guys know I love you guys man I
need to go to South Africa man I need
some love out there man when I'm out
there man show me where the hood at you
know what I mean I'll see you guys there
man but so we got Harry this is pretty
legit as you guys Cocina me put this
down as you scroll down it becomes white
nice and low animation pretty legit
everything was very smooth I'll tell you
that like it's a very polished portfolio
like I'll be honest okay he got a couple
of different projects you know things
that he can show for which I really like
basically let's see we're gonna go to
about me about me is a modal so let's
see a couple of things that he has is a
social media phone number you're
basically LinkedIn I'm guessing this the
medium yeah you got html5 css3
javascript jquery bootstrap wordpress my
sequel PHP
pretty full-stack okay now this is cool
cuz he tells you exactly what he
actually did here so he got technologies
are HTML CSS JavaScript jQuery so let's
open this up this is nice I like it I
like how it looks okay Mac OS I for
quick access to WCAG color contrast so
this is cool
pretty legit oh nice little animation
the design is pretty nice like I really
like it okay
let's legit me see get the app okay so
this is more of a landing page so this
is cool cuz it shows him he could come
in and if a design team gives him any
type of design he can build it as you
guys can see there's definitely a lot of
placing in positioning which makes it
pretty legit everything is animated see
like there's like a website that you
could come in and you could show show it
off to people but okay cool I built this
you know now you got DJ outlet it's an
e-commerce store Open Cart this is
always important if you have like any
type of e-commerce website it always
makes you look good because any type of
business will be like okay this person
could hit the ground running if we need
him to start building some stuff or to
maintain our current store you know it's
not huge but at least it shows like hey
I know how to use different frameworks
when it comes to e-commerce you know any
type of CMS so let me close this let me
see that I close it yeah I close all
right so let me open that up again nice
animation which is legit - I like that
you know
BAM from there open this up
so he actually built this website web
soft system okay I like it
pretty legit it's like a digital agency
so I'm guessing he works remotely that
was built with WordPress let's see what
else
you got track it get updated global
natural events
let's see earthquakes subscriber Lydia
no matter landslides floods I mean I'm
not really seeing anything happening but
this could be like a tricky happen
occasion because there's like if nothing
happened it's like you don't see any
changes but that's cool let's see what
else he got in here he got food and
beverages web application you see my
father says three JavaScript okay
see Melville select full pizza doesn't
matter search also you have to select
one you should have like a thing with
like by default it should be like one of
these
you shouldn't have to choose one by d4
should have like choosing the first one
but that's fine so you know you stand
early Victoria Pisa yes that's pretty
cool so it finds the pizzeria for you
food and bear are was a food and brewery
so that's a cool app let's see so he
worked on this website mission goals our
courses business
except once at 3:00
seems pretty legit it's like a business
I guess I got online school or something
I hope University camp is pretty cool oh
let's see what else Padre
okay everything works see like that's
nothing to like everything works that's
very important kids sometimes you come
in and you do like little projects that
are like halfway done and you add it to
your portfolio like that's never good
you only add the best of the best
whatever you have that you feel like hey
man this is completed this is our real
projects those are the things that you
want to share so I'm guessing this is
like a local business that he built
their website so that's pretty cool
Johannesburg let me see what else that's
about it I mean the portfolio is pretty
simple pretty clean you know coming in
here you got a picture of him not too
much you know it's not nothing crazy
it's not like he's out there you know
hanging out whatever is a professional
photo of him just chilling you know guys
email his phone number I got his address
I hope that's not your real address
Harry and also not your phone number try
to use something like Google phone
services or something like that because
recruiters will be hounding you like
sometimes you don't want to be dealing
with that like they'll pretty much like
make your phone useless because they'll
start sending out emails and text to
your email into your phone that you
don't even want to deal with in the war
but as far as the projects they seem
pretty legit my only thing that I was
saying is try to get some react in their
reactive angular you have a lot of
jQuery projects and jQuery is not bad is
good you know you can choose whatever
you want but you also want to show a
little bit of you know different
different frameworks just to show that
hey man I can come in and and play with
the best of them you know what I mean so
that's the only thing I will say
as far as the presentation for the
portfolio is very legit all the
animations work everything looks nice
the projects were pretty cool and yeah I
mean of course you know this excuse me
this might be your first portfolio or
your second or third you know as you
continue to build better projects make
sure you add them to your portfolio
sometimes when you're lazy you know we
probably have way better projects now
than what it is on here so you want to
actually like keep it updated try to add
like the latest clients that you worked
on or the coolest things that you worked
on that can show that you're very
current you know what I mean but as far
as the website it looks legit it looks
nice and clean there's really nothing
that I could say that is wrong here it's
also responsive pretty sure you use a
bootstrap for this so it's like
automatic responsive so that's good yeah
if we open it up and we come here and
let's say do I gather galaxy or iPhone 7
yeah so everything works legit man nice
work man and yeah any other questions or
anything you want me to go over if you
update in the future let me know send me
an email and yeah you're it in a super
job back at it again coding face.com
this portfolio was pretty legit guys
I'll be honest there wasn't that much
stuff that I could come in and critique
it everything was pretty legit besides
the fact that I would say try to add
some more of like the latest frameworks
like react or angular besides that
everything was pretty legit ok there's
not much I can say about this portfolio
the fonts and everything was aligned
properly the animations were nice and
smooth so yeah
see you guys later see a boy joke back
at it again coding face.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
