chit chit see a boy Joe back at it again
coding phase dot-com yeah your boys back
listen guys I'm sick right now I feel
horrible Reina
but we needed to talk about this well
good old coinbase crashed let me see if
it's if it's working now
nope he just brings you right back
so this kind of sucks I'll be honest
with you guys this definitely sucks
right now because for a lot of reasons
number one I have a lot of money inside
of coinbase right and I want to sell
like now right I want to sell now
because this thing is about to crash now
what's the problem with this thing it's
like hey so many people are trying to do
transactions so many people trying to go
in there by himself and pretty much is
it's just horrible
welcome to the crypto world world
welcome to to Bitcoin madness the
craziness of Bitcoin like it's crazy
right now
like I'm trying to sell right now ASAP
like it's gonna go up maybe a little bit
more I was trying to sell where it was
at 18,000 right now it went back down so
pretty much I lost a lot of money that
could have freaking put in my pocket I
don't know what this this charts
they say this on coinbase it got up to
18,000 I don't know why this thing
let me see charts coinbase charts yeah I
don't know why maybe I think they got
like inflated sign and they put a stop
to it not look and one day there you go
that's what I'm talking about it got up
to 18,000 right and then I'm like man I
need to get rid of this thing this
morning and then I'm like oh no it did a
major drop so then now we we coming back
up slowly but surely but the thing about
this is that I get a feeling like this
thing is about to crash hard like this
thing is about to go from 16000 down to
like 7,000 I got a feeling right it's
either going to do that or it's just
gonna continue going to the top right
and I feel bad for who I was trying to
buy bitcoins right now at this moment
you know I keep hearing that in Korea a
lot of people are buying a whole bunch
of bitcoins because they trying to get
in the game
they're like I don't know the specifics
but they basically said the government
stops something I forgot I gotta look it
up but basically the government stop
sighs so people are trying to buy as
soon as possible they're just like you
know what let's just buy as much as we
can now on good old coinbase
it got super high today it got up to
18,000 and then everybody was trying to
sell literally like I try to do a cell
and it just kept saying hey man
cells are temporarily being stopped
whatever it really said it's something
like that temporarily unavailable and
then it just freakin dropped man my
heart dropped when that thing said what
I said oh my heart drop I said no we
going down right now like you started
going down right I say Oh
this is gonna be bad and then once it
touchdown I said oh no was it touched 15
I say no we going down right now I mean
luckily came back up and slowly but
surely and I still try to sell at 17,000
but it just it's not letting nobody sell
nothing which really sucks because it's
like the main reason why I put my money
inside of coin basis because and you
know supposedly it's the most legit
company out there but I don't know man I
guess I guess it's not that legit I
thought they would be able to handle it
I don't know how they're gonna be if
they can't handle it when bitcoins are
18,000 I don't know how they're gonna
handle it when this thing goes to 50,000
a hundred thousand like it's gotta be
kind of ridiculous you know what I mean
and it's crazy man I'm really pissed off
man I had the opportunity to buy like
four or five different bitcoins in
January and I was telling my my boss at
the time also oh you should buy Bitcoin
in and he went in he bought I think two
of them hey I had the opportunity to at
that moment had to cash and I had you
know just extra money that could throw
away I was like man should I do it
should I not do it and then I was like
yeah this thing is I don't know if this
thing is like it's gonna stay here
forever or whatever but yo this would
have been nice this is what I bring a
nice little check hurry now man
I mean I still got some money in it you
know not that much like right now if I
was to to pull out all my money I
probably earn about like nine thousand
dollars in profit there's not that much
compared to if I were they just went in
and say hey man I'm buying like four or
five different bitcoins man and right
now my fear is if this thing goes down
right and then now we're stuck with this
bitcoins and we can't even get rid of
them because
good old coinbase is acting up you know
what I mean yeah man so let me see who's
in the chat right now who in the chat
right now let me see you think is gonna
hit a hundred thousand Joe Jason he is
like yo what do you think I'm like I
don't know man I you know I thought it
was gonna hey like ten thousand by June
but now the way how things are I don't
even know I think this thing just might
go to the sky and might just be like hey
man you know like it's gonna drop but
people are so hype about it they're like
man it touch twenty thousand and like
you know in like a month you know so
people is gonna be like you know what
hmm I'm gonna buy soon as this thing
drops people are gonna buy like crazy
and I don't think that there's gonna be
that many bitcoins left after a while
let me see let's see if I could look it
up how many bitcoins are left
okay let me see
so there's 16 million bitcoins currently
in circulation and this was in October
third
so probably maybe it's like 17 million
circulation so there's still like
another three thousand four thousand
left to be mined right now when this
thing just be like yo this thing goes to
a hundred thousand is a rat man what's
crazy though is how many millionaires
are they gonna be like what is that
going to do to the economy you get what
I'm saying like if everybody let's say
in an example if everybody in the world
has a million dollars right what does
that do to the economy that's just an
example if everybody has has a million
dollars in the economy right what does
that do to the economy because now a
million dollars is now really worth
anything cuz we all have it you get what
I'm saying like what's gonna happen at
that moment cuz there's definitely a lot
of people who are brand new millionaires
out there you know what I'm saying so
it's crazy
let me see let me see who are here who
in here we got Louise Martinez we got
Jason E ear Mont nope nope dab Andre
rough while Jesus Vera FinTech Gulabo
who else is in here who else who else
Kiana we see Missy and Missy Neos strike
neo scribe Remy world who was in here
Camp Perry gives soft man we got pay
little sleep Sarita kick greatness
who else who else is in here Michael
bang yeah man it's kind of crazy it's
definitely crazy right now
Lissie so we got big coins up everything
else is down except big connect which so
beyond this guy's big connect man is a
scam man look what does this mean the
they look scams by coin and big connect
scams like they just letting people know
like y'all these things are definitely
scams don't get into it
I see another youtuber talking about big
canal like hey guys sign up to big
Canaan
this doesn't I'm like bro like I
understand you're trying to make money
out here you know and people is like
trying to get that affiliate money but
it's like man like you don't do stuff
that's gonna mess up people's money you
get what I'm saying like everything that
I tell you guys to get here and stuff
that is gonna make you money because
you're gonna put it in use for your
career right as a web developer or
programmer whatever you want to call
yourself but the moment you start going
into this sneaky world of like hey man
I'm just trying to make money off
affiliates like hey you know big Kinect
is paying off a lot of money for people
that sign up and put money in there
that's like a Ponzi scheme man you would
never see me tell people like connect my
boy my boy Andrew he just hit me up just
the other day he's like they almost got
him right cuz he started looking into
Bitcoin he started looking into all this
stuff and they almost got him here on
YouTube some dude I guess he follows was
telling them I owe ya big Kinect saying
you know you put money you lend it out
and you learned all your bitcoins and
this isn't that and it's like this is a
freaking scheme man like don't let
yourself get into this thing man so yeah
man it's crazy right now
let me see
yeah I don't know I don't know if I
wanna sell I don't know if I want to
keep it the problem with this thing is
like I wanna I want to sell it once it
touches like 18 again because things
that is gonna drop guys we like it and I
was gonna drop like look right here it
went up it did a major dip and then now
it's back up if I were to being able to
sell right here then whatever I would
have sold would have been profit and
then I could have bought it here for
cheaper and then you know what I mean
like come right back in it
but you know it's crazy because it's
like when I was down here at the 9,000
like last week
it sounds like forever but last week I
was like man this thing is gonna come
back down and I didn't buy a lot because
I said oh it's gonna go down to like
6,000 oh sorry
it hasn't gone down it kind of bothers
me that it hasn't gone down I'll be
honest because it's like I'm waiting for
that drop when it drops then I'm gonna
buy a whole bunch of money you know put
a whole bunch of money into this thing
there's a whole Bitcoin but it's not
going down so what do I do
do I just buy now when it's still man
expensive to me I think $16,000 that's
my expensive like that's crazy
like if I say hey I want to buy you know
20% of a Bitcoin right now that's gonna
be ridiculous for especially because I
started thinking about why I could've
bought you know in the beginning of the
year like it's kind of ridiculous that
now we have to pay this much for a
Bitcoin yeah and it's just not dropping
you know what I mean
yeah man
let me see let me see let me see let me
see who's in here good I was like yo I
bought mines I'm not touching it
I believed in it
by an altcoin I don't even know which
all Collingwood I by IMing 1/2 litecoin
I have like going for sure but I like
what was the iota
I like iota cuz I haven't done the
research on it but from what I've heard
is there's no there's no fees with iota
so that makes more sense because if
there's no fees then you could do
transactions you get what I mean like
the problem with bitcoins is Bitcoin was
supposed to be like a currency but the
problem is that nobody wants to use it
everybody wants to hold everybody wants
to be like a the fees are too high let's
just keep it and use it as as gold you
know as something valuable but I don't
know man like iota I like a yura like
you know from what I've heard if there's
no fees then I could see a future in it
know what I mean so look this thing I
order in November 24 was 75 cents then I
went up to 4 56 it's crazy yeah man
what sucks too is like you gotta pay
taxes on this things man that sucks
Oh God
coin base you freakin idiots
word oh by the way for those of you guys
that haven't checked this out man on my
website I released you know I've an CSS
with CSS grids those of you guys that
want to learn how to do and how to work
with CSS grids go check it out
literally when you go through my link
you get 50% off you go buy it for $12
things like $12.50 or you can just sign
up for the subscription-based guys and
you get all of my courses and everything
that I do with just ten dollars it's up
to you guys but definitely it's pretty
legit he says grid says you know I
wasn't a strong believer I'll be honest
I wasn't a strong believer on CSS grids
until my friend yesterday now yesterday
like so three days ago showed me
everything inside CSS grids and how to
how to properly use it how to do
everything and I was like girl I got it
like that and now that's why I was like
girl I just gotta show it to you guys
man cuz you know from all the times that
I've seen it in blogs and and people
showing examples they make it more
difficult than what it is you know like
my friend broke it down to me is that
yeah this thing is retarded is so simple
think of it like this and then I was
like okay cool then after that I thought
about it I was like okay so how can I
explain it to people in a way that
they're gonna be able to learn it super
easy right so the approach that I took
was explaining it as if you was using
bootstrap right and explain it to people
like at first I gave you all the
different examples in different
properties that you can use right and
every day I come in and create a little
website layout and then we take the
approach of using responsive design with
css3 media queries so well I showed it
in a way as if if it was
with bootstrap right so anybody who's
used bootstrap before or any framework
from before can understand this like
this that simple so yeah man it's pretty
legit I like it I mean I'm about to
start coding on my stuff with CSS grids
for sure you know at first I was like
skeptical because I'm the type of person
like I like to have stuff that any
browser can use and I felt when I heard
of CSS grids like a year - almost two
years ago basically not every browser
was supporting it and then I my job we
couldn't use it because it's like you
you're not supposed to use something
that's so new because you never know if
most of your your audience or your your
customers who are coming into your
website they they don't have the brand
new latest you know Chrome or the
brand-new latest Internet Explorer so
that's one of the main reasons why I
never really got into it but it is
pretty easy
now I'm also doing the Flex boxes and I
think like as soon as I stopped this
whole stream I'm adding all the strip on
the Flex boxes I did it last night all I
have to do is just upload them but yeah
I just wanted to come out out here hang
out with you guys talk about this
Bitcoin craziness and see what you guys
think man but definitely gonna drop
another video
I got a portfolio that I'm reviewing -
which I'm gonna release the video at
5:00 p.m. it's all really scheduled so
we got we got content today kids today
is gonna be a fun day for you guys man I
hope you guys enjoy it and yeah have fun
man
okay people who mined for it don't even
know bike don't even know that by
getting there faster they're making it
harder it's a JavaScript framework we
doing the same same things like Joe said
so every week it gets harder harder yep
I'm not gonna give my opinion about
other youtubers no more imma save myself
the time I got other important things to
do you know what I mean like I'm not
gonna I'm not gonna talk about other
youtubers you know I'm past that I'm
with my grown man stage now I'm 30 years
old my that's my new thing I'm 30 years
old I don't need to be on this little
kid stuff man yeah so let me see them
and see what else any question guys
what'd you guys think yeah man I read
everybody's comments you leave a calming
I'm a reading any questions leave it
yeah he and a five is like yell rules
for rebels explain the bigger net well
don't do it yeah
they can it's a scam man anybody who
tells you about big connect like you got
a look at them on a certain way you
gotta be like bro
link you could tell people who are
schemers by if somebody comes in and
tells you hey man you should definitely
sign up to big connect here's my link
you know damn well that person it's not
looking out for you that person is out
there just looking for the out for
themselves and trying to make that money
because yeah you can make money on
bigger net but it's if you start
bringing people in right if you have a
platform right now I have a platform
right but I'm not a dirtbag right
everything that I do is for a reason I
do it in in a classy way like things
that's gonna give people value right I
come in here and even if you guys see me
from YouTube when I first my first seven
eight months I wasn't telling nobody
like hey man check out my courses or
anything like that I just started doing
this thing because I quit my job and I
wanted to do this full-time for you guys
the moment I go back to work I'm not
gonna tell you guys hey so I never do do
this and that or or whatever it's just
there's the extra income for me to be
able to create content for you guys
the moment that the people be like oh
Joe we don't care about your content I'm
gonna be like cool don't worry you don't
have to you know buying any courses or
do anything you do it if you want to all
right but at the same time like when
that moment comes it's like let's say I
just go out there start the other things
that I'm blue right now like I'm
starting other businesses then I'm
trying to do right now well my boy Drew
and a couple of other people that I
talking to you know I have my other boy
Joe who who's also thinking about for us
to create our own agency all right and
basically start creating websites for
clients and just create our own company
right so I might be doing that in a few
months like once again my studio once I
get my office okay
Michael Banks says coding phase real
quick in hyper app populating an object
on the global state with data from an
API request can you show me something
real quick what do you mean you want to
use you want to use a hyper app so you
want to use hyper have the framework
right but what you want to do is do a
get request to an API and then be able
to bring that data back to back to the I
call it to the global State let me see
let me see if I open this up see if I
could explain it real quick I mean it
was my hyper app starter kick
you
go into assets JavaScript hyper close so
old tabs okay
well the way that you got to do it is
create an action alright so let me see
where is it creating action and when you
create that action in there you
basically you do your your request okay
let me see if I could share this yes
continue fuel if you finished learning
the basics of JavaScript I will say
continue with the jQuery and then do the
react
yeah man I got side hustles on side
hustles man I got stacks on stacks on
stacks man that's what I'm trying to do
man I mean you know I love coding I love
creating tutorials and courses for you
guys but the moment that the people tell
me like Joe we just we don't want to see
the courses okay cool
that's fine it's not a big deal to me
personally
it'll be like okay cool I still create
the courses but I just won't tell you
guys about it you know what I mean like
you guys are my YouTube audience think I
have different audience from different
places or I have people from Facebook
people from Instagram people from all
different different places that don't
know me right so if the moment like
let's say from here from you to you guys
be like man we don't want to see my
courses cool I really I don't want to
put it out for you guys on YouTube cuz
yeah like my main audience man yeah yeah
I like my peoples man
can you join my company as a business
development / sales guy yeah I mean once
I get everything up to a certain point
where I could say hey I'm gonna be able
to pay people then yeah I'm gonna acts
you know I'm gonna reach out to all of
you guys to see who wants to be part of
this you know cuz I still gonna need
other like developers I'm not gonna be
able to do everything that I buy myself
like I have to go and meet clients I
have to be able to you know do other
stuff do this you to do this courses so
I'm not gonna be able to create all the
websites so at some point I'm gonna
reach out to see who here wants to be
part of it you know and then from there
we'll pay you exactly
depending on the project yeah you could
Michael you could do it an on-click or
there's this thing have you downloaded
the the hyper restaurant have you used
download that you get to do that the
whole course Michael if you look on the
index that Jes there's there's events
there's make sense
there's route there's view there's
actions now inside of the events you can
do like let's say if you wanted to do an
API call soon as the app loads you can
use inside of events you can use a
property called load which is a a
function and then in there what you
would do is you put in your you put in
your API call to to to the server and
then from there what you do is you
return back a change to the state and
then now you basically have all the data
that came in you have it now on your on
your freaking app
you can also check out the documentation
of a hyper app like they have like some
examples that's very similar to that
what do you what to start a blog or
YouTube listen I think a blog is good
like on something like medium right if
you use medium as your blog then you're
gonna be good if you use YouTube you
gotta understand look take me for
example
like all I do here is come here share my
opinions and things and all like all I
do is get a whole bunch of hate like you
know what I mean I get hate all the time
I come in here to share my opinions so
you gotta understand this type of
industry this type of career everybody
thinks they're smarter than you
everybody thinks they're better than you
so you might have an opinion how to do
something like let's say hey and how to
do a API call with jQuery right
somebody's gonna come in and give you a
long ass hating comment like hey nobody
uses jQuery no more you gotta use
vanilla JavaScript but you gotta use
reactor you gotta use angular you gotta
use view so if you if you can handle it
then create a YouTube if you can't
handle it then just create a blog like a
medium you know what I mean so that's
the thing me personally I came in I came
in handily
I'm really just not looking I'm really
just not looking into I got it's like
like the comments like that I'm just not
you know when people send me emails I
answer them but I'm just not really
looking into that the comments that much
because if the hate be too much it's
like I could be having a great day like
today I feel sick alright so if I go
into my comments I know somebody's gonna
drop some hating comment on it so it's
like if I go in there it's gonna ruin my
day even worse than what it is you know
what I'm saying even though I get like a
hundred comments to our good of people
saying Oh Joe we love you Joe we we
appreciate everything that you do
at the same time what happens is that
one person can just ruin your whole day
so if you don't want to be dealing with
that on YouTube then I would suggest on
don't join YouTube at all yeah man so
let me see any questions man any other
questions Tanner says where do you buy
Iota that's a good question I don't even
know because this like this company
called BitFenix or something like that
and I was gonna buy it there but then
they sent me an email like oh if you're
from the US we're no longer taking
people from the US and I was like wait
this sounds like a scheme like this is
the problem with a lot of this there's
different websites with crypto
currencies and one of the only reasons
why I stay on coinbase is because people
are scheming out here man you know what
I'm saying like people are here trying
to steal your money you know you go into
an IC o---- you your vest money and then
the next day they fuckin they delete the
whole the whole site they delete the
whole site and then they don't even have
a Twitter account that I have an email
so now you just lost your money you know
what I'm saying so it's crazy like that
now do I think it's gonna go to a
hundred thousand I think so I definitely
think so I think it could get to that
point could get to like 80,000 80,000 a
hundred thousand that's why I'm iffy
about selling my my bitcoins look but
look this thing is already dropped now
is that fifteen thousand it was just
it was just a 18-thousand like that's
what I'm saying like this is annoying
it's like it it goes up then drops
just crazy
miss if I could do this
look at that I got a soul that right
there but coinbase was acting up I still
can't sell so I just lost $2,000 right
there and I could've sold right there
it's crazy man that's all coinbase
thinkers it's like coinbase supposed to
be legit you know what I'm saying that
common base is supposed to be if
anything is a legit coinbase should be
the one that's legit
look this down 7% in the past hour but
for the days up 22% in one 30% up today
like it's crazy man
Rainmaker if you short Bitcoin you will
get rekt what do you think Remy cool do
you think should I keep it I don't know
I don't know if I should keep it man
let me see Bitcoin predictions there's a
website that has
let me see
you
you
you
I know my love is gonna go down like
that I can't find where's the long
forecast is at this website
yeah I think there's the website yeah
there has it has some pretty almost
accurate because they kind of told it
kind of said that like a few months ago
it said that I was gonna be around you
know 15,000 16,000 at this point so
there's the predictions according to
this so if it keeps going the way that
is going by the end of next year is
gonna be seventy one thousand yeah so
there you go so this the predictions by
the end of December 2017 could be a
twenty three thousand so it's telling
you it can be from nine thousand to
twenty five thousand closing at twenty
three thousand so they're from there by
the end of next year could be a
seventy-one thousand dollars by 2019
could be at a hundred and twenty two
thousand that's a lot of money that
means whoever boy whoever bought like
let's say ten bitcoins right they're
gonna have a million dollars in two
years like that's crazy when you think
about it and it makes me pissed off cuz
I'm like man I should have bought big
coin when it was like five hundred
dollars when I saw it I five hundred
dollars I was thinking about buying it
now I was crazy
I need to get them off to exchanges yeah
now I need to get them out of coinbase
because it's ridiculous it's kind of
ridiculous that whatever I own about 1.5
Bitcoin it's not that much it's not
nothing crazy but at the same time it's
like you know say god don't own it
because it's like right now I have it
but I can't even log into coinbase
parasu read as I go keep it like a baby
man watch it grow will be a beautiful
it'll be beautiful
that's another thing
why didn't you download the block chain
instead Joe how people trade Bitcoin for
real money real money why not buy some
bitcoins now now hell no I ain't buying
no bitcoins now only way I'm buying
bitcoins again it's gotta be if Bitcoin
inside under $10,000 I'm not buying
whatever bitcoins are half already
that's what I have you gonna say like
I'm not gonna go in there and buy
bitcoins at $20,000
like that's ridiculous cuz at some point
that thing is gonna go down and I don't
want to be getting stuck with it and
catch up a $20,000 loss I'm not with it
yeah the price is gonna tink that's what
I'm trying to I'm trying to sell at
least the profits like if I sell right
now and big-horned let me I'll sell the
profits that I mean and then I'll keep
whatever is not profit
because the thing is that is gonna go
down you know I mean it's gonna go down
and it's not gonna go down like it's
weird man this thing is not you can't
predict this thing like like a regular
you know stock you can't you gotta
predict it wild it's like it's just like
how people say like hey man you just
gotta keep it in there and leave it
there if 10 years from now you have you
know a million dollars in there cool you
cash out if you have only $5 in there
and you put in five thousand then that's
the risk that you took but me personally
I just don't feel comfortable take it I
don't like taking losses you know what I
mean like I'm gonna be tight if let's
say right now everything is going up
let's say this thing goes to 25,000 and
then I keep it there but oh yeah it's
gonna go to a hundred thousand and then
the next thing that you know all the big
guys start selling if the big guys start
selling then you're gonna see everybody
else selling so now coinbase is pretty
much not letting yourself at 16,000
what's gonna happen when it's like at
twenty thirty fifty thousand dollars are
they just gonna hold everybody you know
hold them back at me like now you can't
sell like that's kind of ridiculous you
know what I'm saying
because then people gotta lose a lot of
money
you
yeah that's true how much were million
u.s. dollars B at that point a million
dollars would be like a hundred thousand
by that time I feel like the the money
the US dollars gonna go down like we're
gonna be going to the store to buy a
soda for $35 like like when I go to the
ER you know how much you you gotta pay
for a 2-liter soda you gotta pee like a
hundred know it's like it's about $100
$100 100 pesos like that's kind of
ridiculous you know what I say Mike you
go you go in there like hey man or like
in Venezuela Venezuela their money does
not work for anything now people go into
places with stacks of money like they
going to a strip club just to buy like a
car in a milk
yeah that's true Ricky definitely closed
the gap but the thing is that who out
here let's be honest who out here things
like the the people that are poor even
know about Bitcoin he ever saying like
the people that are poor they wasn't
investing into Bitcoin the people who
are coming from the bottom didn't buy no
bitcoins who bought it guys who are more
educated guys who have a bigger you know
background of like how the economy works
those are the guys that really bought
Bitcoin now the people who are coming in
now this is the poor people come in it
there's the poor people trying to get
you know a point zero zero ten of a
Bitcoin right those are the people with
our buying bitcoins now so those people
didn't gain buying a Bitcoin that's not
going to change their lives at all so in
reality the people that are gonna be
millionaires are the people that were
already well-off you got what I'm saying
all the people that I know you know
nobody's talking about Bitcoin I mean
the only people I know that I'm talking
about bitcoins are people who already
have careers and have money in their
pocket nobody else is talking about
bitcoins the people that I know that's
still in the hood the people are not
getting money like that I know people
that don't even have a bank account they
have like a hundred thousand cash but
don't even have a bank account so how
are they gonna buy Bitcoin
Adam Royer says do you also Loki feel a
bit bore Wow not having a nine-to-five
are you looking forward to getting back
to a structure life and starting another
corporate job I'm not looking to work
for a company I'm looking to open my own
company I do miss having the structure
right I want to have another place like
once I moved back to Queens currently
I'm in Long Island I'm moving back to
Queens next month
right we're looking for the apartment
the place where we're gonna move to once
I do that
definitely I gotta find the office so
I'm gonna open up my own office my own
love my own studio and then every day at
9 o'clock 8 o'clock in the morning I'm
gonna go into my office and do the same
thing that I'm doing here with you guys
but in my office you know where it's
gonna be a little bit quieter it's gonna
be less interruptions I'm gonna be able
to do more work you know but at the same
time there's gonna be cool because it's
minds you get what I'm saying
like I'm not looking to be working for
another company the only reason I will
work for another company will be like I
don't know maybe if I was to get sick
and I needed you know like really good
life insurance or I need a really good
health insurance then I would go back to
a company for something like that just
for the security of you know
to take care myself what take care of my
family that's it but besides that now
I'm not looking to be in an office doing
HTML emails or freaking adding new
products to the website I'm not looking
forward to that I'll be honest I'm not
and I look right now
I'm looking forward to doing this course
for you guys or flex boxes like that's
fun I mean that's easy to do that's fun
that's creating things that I want to do
I'm currently doing freakin a react
native course which is gonna take me a
little while
react native is making a very intensive
so I'm doing that I'm looking forward to
that because as I teach it to you guys I
get to practice it more you know like
when you work at a company you get
pigeonholed into one position one thing
to do and that's it like right now if if
I go to work for a company right they
don't want me to be either the
JavaScript guy so all the time I'm gonna
be doing reacting debugging javascript
constantly debugging other people's
shitty code that they did five ten years
ago or I'm gonna be doing like back and
work like doing laravel you know adding
little features here and there making
sure the databases work making sure I
call up AWS or GoDaddy or whoever the
hell they they use right am I looking
forward to that
no you know for you guys those are the
jobs that you guys gonna get but I
already passed that you're gonna say
like I'm already on another level like I
already did all of those things I want
to challenge myself you get what I'm
saying like I want to challenge myself
and be able to see even if I fail I
didn't fail because at the same time
it's like I'm I'm doing what I want to
do you get what I'm saying
and as long as I got a roof over my head
and I'll take care my family I'm good
like I don't need to become a
millionaire like that's not the goal for
me you know like one people the whole
thing with this other kid whatever the
title bits of web development you know
like the whole thing with him is just
like man like I know I know people
trying to make money because you can
make money out of this thing I could
literally be like hey man I must sell my
courses my subscription is $50 a month
there's people that's gonna pay not as
much as not as many people as they are
paying now which is from $10 to $20
I have a lot of people that pay the
subscription but if I was to be like hey
I'm doing $50 I'm actually gonna earn
more money but less people are gonna be
able to afford it and less people are
gonna be able to come to the website I
like going to my website and seeing hey
this 67 people you know using my website
currently I like seeing people coming in
and I like seeing people coming in and I
drop our email and tell them hey like
last night I told them hey I got the CSS
grids you know how many people went to
the website about 92 people went to the
website and started doing the course and
that was like at 1 o'clock 2 o'clock in
the morning I sent that email out and 1
o'clock in the morning people came in
and started doing the course you know
like me getting five people and charging
five people $1,000 each it's not gonna
make me happy you know what I'm saying
you know sometimes I think about them
like man I could I could be making way
more money I could be doing this this
and that but it's a slow grind you get
what I'm saying like it took me a year
to get to where I'm at it's taking guys
who have been on YouTube for god knows
how long they haven't been able to
disconnect from their jobs they still
working and they can't afford to live on
their own I did it in less than a year
right now what's cool about YouTube is
that more people get to know you more
people get to see you with time and
there's gotta be people that is gonna
come in and they're gonna need this next
year there's gonna be a whole bunch of
new people coming in that need to learn
about coding this courses that are
making this question that I'm making
right now they're gonna be here for
literally for the next five to ten years
all the work that I'm doing is just
accumulates on top of each other you get
what I'm saying like yeah right now I
could be making like three four thousand
dollars per month but by the end of
January is gonna be a five thousand you
gonna say bye
the end of freaking June is gonna be a
8,000 by the end of next year is gonna
be a 15,000 per month you know what I'm
saying like it's just it's a slow grind
but it grows they accumulates on on its
own because this is something that
everybody's gonna be able to use and the
way I teach all my courses I break it
down in a way where it's easier for
people sometimes people just don't want
to be hearing somebody talk to them like
you know also scientific terms like hey
I'm here to learn I'm not here to for
you to look smart and try to throw big
words over my head and like teach me how
to do this you know what I mean
sorry guys sick so it's just it's a slow
grind and it takes time and I know that
already that's why I don't have all my
my eggs in this basket like this is my
hangout this hard calling this is my
hangout YouTube is my hangout this is
where I chill my baskets are in other
places because there's like you have to
have multiple incomes if I was to say
hey all I have is YouTube I wouldn't be
able to quit my job and pay for
everything that I paid for you know what
I'm saying
like I have to have multiple incomes at
some point YouTube is gonna be able to
pay off everything that I own you know
all my bills and everything currently it
doesn't pay everything it's just a
percentage of it but what's cool about
it it gives me the opportunity to hang
out with you guys and create cool things
and you know learn new technologies and
and share it with you guys you get what
I'm saying so definitely it's definitely
cool what I'm doing so I don't I don't
regret it I don't be bored you know I do
hate when I'm sick I like today cuz like
today I'm sick and I'm like I want to
actually create more videos and do a
whole bunch of stuff like today I wanted
to do a couple of videos outside
answering questions with with everyone
but I haven't been able to do it because
I don't feel good you know what I'm
saying like it's like I don't have the
energy in my throat hurts yeah
now I'm looking look if I get if I get
2,000 people my website has about on my
website alone now we're up to like three
thousand people all right
now paying customers is about like seven
hundred something right so three
thousand people so one third of the
people are on my website they come in
every day our paying customers
two-thirds are people who are taken in
the free courses and they enjoying it
and then what's interesting to take the
free courses they enjoy indefinitely
they buy into the description most
people stay on it for like two three
months
some of them cancel some of them stay
but it offsets itself because when
somebody leaves usually the people that
leave which is kind of hilarious is that
people are paying $5 you get what I say
like people come in remember when I did
the five dollar special the very first
month a lot of people came in they
signed up and then the people that
usually canceled are the people that are
paying five dollars so then people that
come in from Google Adsense and Google
AdWords they paid ten twenty dollars so
that completely offsets whoever leaves
for five bucks is like that's actually
helping me you know the last people that
I have to pay five dollars is actually
better for me because I when I did the
father special I didn't think that
anybody was gonna sign up and most of
the people signed up so what happened
with that then I'm only getting five
hours and after you know after
everything else as literally as I was
like I think is like I get like
375 because there's like a fee so I'm
getting 375 from those five hours right
so what's interesting is and this is why
I tell people don't leave just leaving
you ping for hours like this is less
than freaking high call is less than the
Netflix all right you paying way less
than Netflix so people leave right
then I okay cool I learned everything
and then they cancel it and then they
come back a month later and then I hold
hey Joe remember me I used to have a $5
I want to sign up again and as I broke
like that was a promotion like that's
not really what the website cost like
you got it
you you actually got a come-up you get
what I'm saying like you got this for a
major come up I five bucks man I wish
somebody would tell me hey man you know
everything is five bucks just keep it at
five dollars
like if somebody comes in and tells me
that man I'm I'm keeping it
because at the same times like you guys
know I'm gonna continue creating courses
and creat tenure creating content that
you guys is really gonna enjoy so
yeah man definitely it's definitely like
a mental thing man it's definitely a
mental thing I wanted to I wanted to try
saying out at some point so that maybe
like two years from now I'm gonna try
something out I'm gonna put it for like
a whole week really like a decent amount
of money like you know like everything
is 25 bucks just to see how the people
react to it all right
and of course if you're already a member
you're good but the people who are new
and people who are I'm paying for
advertising you know yeah man now I
really appreciate I appreciate the
people that are signed up for for $5.00
I really do appreciate it you know now
those are the people that signed up in
the beginning those are the people that
really believed in in the website and
really believes on everything that I'm
doing so I I really appreciate it from
you guys but at the same time it's like
you know when people come in and they
cancel and then they come back and then
I came back can I get a five you know a
lot of times I give it to them but it's
like man that was a promotion man you
can't be like hey I cancelled in the
first month and then four months later
it's like hey you remember me I signed
up for months ago for five hours can you
give me that same price I want to take
your new courses that took you a
freaking 27 hours to build I want to
take it for five dollars like that's
like that sounds crazy yeah but I
definitely I love my my subscribers man
and the new website man new website that
I'm building for you guys it's cool cuz
we're gonna have same way how we have
the chat here live 24/7
we gotta have the live chat on the
website 24/7 so that's gonna be dope you
know because a lot of people they don't
want they like the discord and I like
this cord but I just I rather have it
somewhere where I could just go in there
on the on a browser and I have to deal
with like downloading an app and setting
this up you know what I mean so
yeah man
you guys are crazy yeah guys so anyways
man go check out the website coding
phase comm if you're looking to learn
web development programming in general
go check it out man we have like a whole
bunch of courses man you guys have even
checked out the the learn PHP seven
laravel master course like this thing is
is huge guys
like no lie this course you're gonna get
everything that you need to build any
type of website like you learn every
different scratch and what's cool is
that I'm not focusing on doing stuff
through the front end with like
JavaScript or anything so you basically
learning PHP from the ground up and
learning how to change things in the
view and the you know in the controllers
all through PHP so we don't use react we
don't use JavaScript at all on this
website so every type of functionality
that you could think of is being done
through the back end so it just then the
reason why I did that is because if you
go in and you try to do things through
with JavaScript and reality javascript
is gonna make it easier and it's gonna
make it faster for you to like you know
do some changes to the views and and
it's all dynamic but at the same time
you're not practicing PHP so the whole
course is really more about PHP 7 it's
not really about you know how to connect
back-end with you know with a web
application like react or anything it's
more about getting you to be good with
PHP and getting you to be good with
database like my sequel now later on I'm
probably gonna connect either this
project with the react course or maybe I
just create a new a new project for the
react course currently I don't know
which one I should do what type of
project I want to do another react video
another course not
but another project for this react
course cuz this I want to do more more
projects for react so if you guys have
any type of you know suggestions let me
know let me know in the mail coding
phase at gmail.com or here on over here
just let me know
on the chat
you guys let me know what type of
application you guys would like to see
and react so I could do it
yeah got any suggestions let me know let
your boy know become job ready course
but I think look to be job ready the
moment if you look at the timeline right
let's say right here look the moment you
date okay Adam text editor terminal for
developers learn HTML CSS build
responsive app sass like a pro park
template engine future proof JavaScript
jQuery the moment you do this you're
ready one two one two eight you're ready
order to get a job okay now when you
continue and you start going in and
you're like okay I'm gonna learn es6 and
you learn hyper wrapping you learn
building a restaurant web app learning
react once you get to this point you're
ready to start going in for major jobs
meaning like hey you can start applying
for positions as a you know front-end
developer you know any different one to
eight that's like just junior developer
you could get an entry job which was
just that literally I'm telling you
because I see it all the time long
indeed I see it all the time on
Craigslist there's jobs out there that
all you need is this alright now when
you get from nine to two twelve
that means you're ready to start working
in major companies now it's about hey
you know the frameworks in know
JavaScript now it's about building
different projects right like you could
use to build a restaurant web app you
could use the react really stay app you
could use those for your portfolio then
you can also use what you learn in those
two applications and create other
applications you know you just gotta use
your brain like different things that
you could use like literally you could
use something that connects to coinbase
and shows a chart right so you could
create an application where people come
in and save for like you know whatever
cryptocurrency they bought for the day
and keep track of their profits
literally that's a that's a web app
right there like and you could do that
with you know from one to twelve the
knowledge of having those twelve courses
then if you want to jump into the back
end and you want to say hey I want to
create something with data that's gonna
persist meaning like hey I want to be
able to save data safe for users
username password their information then
with learn PHP seven you can do that
with the nodejs course you can have your
portfolio and yeah like this one taking
it out Larry by like a protists this is
the same thing yes learn PHP seven
master course and that's about it man
and of course if you watch this course
that I have here I still got to do a
couple of more videos maybe I'll do that
tonight it's a good idea to finish this
I've been wanted to finish this one for
a while it's just like explaining to
people you know how to find a job where
it's a way to apply let me see where is
it life after learning to code you know
five projects everybody every developer
must have portfolio github social media
choosing your path of being a freelancer
working for a company and then I'm
supposed to do more videos to this
hopefully I'll do this today I could
actually knock this out because it
shouldn't be that hard to do a couple of
videos on indeed on Craigslist and how
to get jobs how to get freelancing jobs
it's not that hard movie I finished that
tonight but yeah
I think that's all I'm saying you know
what I mean let me see if this coin be
still working
you
all right guys so I'm gonna see you guys
later all right I'm about to start
heading out so yeah I decided to just
like sell the profit from Bitcoin this
thing is already going down so much just
sell it it's fine
so yeah I saw the profits and then I
kept I kept all all the things that that
was already there
let me see live dashboard and this is
like what yeah man this thing is going
down and even if it doesn't go down I
just I don't feel comfortable at the
price range that it's at right now I
don't feel comfortable throughout the
day is gonna go up and down so what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna buy it once it
comes back down to like 14,000 then I'll
buy again you know make some profit of
that
all right guys so I'm out of here
love you guys
Michael bangs I yell how's the family I
was eating wifey everybody good they
chilli they hanging out they got a good
thank you for asking
yeah we definitely go lower I believe so
and that's why I sold it I should if
this freaking coinbase wouldn't let me
sell at 18,000 it would have been a nice
profit but it's fine it's okay I got my
profits out and then once it comes back
down I'm gonna buy like crazy all right
guys I'll see you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
