again man coding face.com listen guys
make sure you subscribe to your kid make
sure you visit my website man a whole
bunch of tutorials a bunch of courses
for free and also some premium ones that
you guys can definitely learn a lot now
let's talk about the subject from this
video man god this is very frustrating
you know so I've seen this done multiple
times basically people come into jobs
coming to positions they get hired and
basically when a company hires you
they're giving you a chance they like
okay this person comes in and you have
certain skills even though he doesn't
know about our stack in general right or
it could be any situation right so let's
say right now you're a brand new
employee and you know the stack of this
company is Python MongoDB and nginx but
you've never messed with Python ever in
your life right so what is your duty
your duty as a developer is basically
decide to take on your own time and
start learning Python right so I've
noticed this plenty of times from people
you know not gonna mention our names but
they come in they're brand new and
they're like you tell them hey can you
work on something and they're like mmm
nah I'm not gonna do any work on it
exactly on business hours meaning on my
nine-to-five guys that does not
look good man I don't think people
understand that I don't think that that
shows commitment that shows that you're
not passionate about this it shows that
you don't want to be a developer it
shows that you do this for a paycheck if
I tell you hey you have to learn Python
over the weekend try to learn it look
through it
the ideas are you gonna be like man I'm
just not
to do it I'm just not going to spend any
hours outside of business hours learning
anything grow people get fired because
of that like people don't understand
that people really do not understand
that like when you go to a company and
you tell them hang now I'm only gonna
watch you know Rails cast Larry
cast you to me or or you-tube here at
the office to learn a certain technology
or a certain framework or a certain
programming language like that
looks really bad on you you have to
actually put in from your part as a
developer your job is to learn these
things and you're always going to be
learning you can't expect my oh no I'm
only gonna learn this at the job because
you know what they want me to learn this
I'm gonna learn it on their hours no bro
because on our hours you supposed to be
 coding and helping out or doing
something not just like standing around
you know what I mean
so this happens all the time guys
man yeah I don't even know and then
people wonder why they get fired or
people wonder whether they get let go
it's like bro you didn't put from your
part you know a while back man we had
another developer who like we told them
like hey man check out you know check
out all our cats right this developer
freaking the whole time is like mad I'm
not gonna check it out because I know
PHP right yes you know PHP but you don't
know the framework so this person
instead of using the framework what this
person will do is will come in and
basically code raw PHP unlike the views
or you know even when the controllers
would do a whole bunch of mistakes and
like yes it worked but it was really
ugly code right really really ugly messy
code and people don't understand that
all you have to do is just put a low
effort and you stay around if you don't
put effort nobody's going to keep you
you have to put in from your parts when
somebody hires you they specifically
tell you like hey can you learn new
technologies a most of the time if the
person says no hmm now you'll get let go
so what people do is they be like yes we
I could learn any technologies give me
time but some people what they do is
they skim the game they're like okay I'm
gonna learn this at the job
I'm gonna watch youtube videos I'm gonna
watch you to me at the job no bro no
room girl do that sharing your own time
because on business hours it's supposed
to be for coding we're supposed to be
doing productive things for the company
it's not about you sitting down and now
you're gonna learn it you have a week
you have a weekend you have two weeks
you know sometimes people give people
two weeks to learn something but doesn't
mean that you're gonna do that on
business hours you're like oh I'm just
gonna do it on business hours no man
like come on man like you guys really
need to to like I don't know man I don't
even know what to say I'm a poet right
now I'm like like I don't want to say
how how people think that they're gonna
keep jobs you know what I mean
like back in the days when I was a
Frenchman you know in this thing a
junior developer I will come in and just
be like yo a company will tell me hey we
working on WordPress
I will go online pay for course bear
barely got any sleep learn all the
basics of WordPress come back the deck
in the next day and amaze people going
to only shame like I'll tell you they
know WordPress yeah I busted my
ass last night learning it all right
sometimes people tell me hey we working
on backbone that's our money no backbone
what did I do
I looked online see who had it oh there
was this website called coast cool calm
who was teaching
but I was like you know what I'm gonna
learn this right one and a weekend
I learned it came back on Monday here
here's a backbone application right
people need to start doing this
because it looks good people want to
keep you around people want to say this
person is valuable when you come in and
you're like now do you learn in the
weekend mmm do you put any effort yeah
when are you gonna learn it I'm gonna
start now what what are you talking
about and I mean I'm a polder in there
I'm like I'm trying to catch my and my
brother cuz it pisses me off because I'm
like you guys from you guys know I'm
really passionate about this right
I'm really passionate about coding a
really passionate about web development
and in general right so when I see
people just come in and they're like ooh
now I'm just I'm just gonna game the
system
it pisses me off because there's a lot
of people out there who are very
passionate and they haven't gotten the
opportunity to get a job but then this
person comes in you get the opportunity
and then at the end when you get the
opportunity you don't put in the work
