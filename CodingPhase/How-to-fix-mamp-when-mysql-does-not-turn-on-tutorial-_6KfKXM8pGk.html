Conan face.com I just wanted to put out
this little quick fix for people just in
case you get any issues with map let's
say for example you're using map right
and your computer shuts down because
your battery right now you're in a
laptop etc right anything could happen
well what happens is the database gets
corrupted and sometimes is because you
haven't really killed the process so
there's a quick fix there's probably
even a better way but because this is
local data and nobody really cares about
the local data what you could do is
pretty much if it gets stuck and you're
like at this this point where you're
like trying to start the server but
Apache shows up but my sequel doesn't
turn on the easiest way that I found to
deal with this is to pretty much come
into your map folder right open up your
application of map open inside of that
that that folder right open it up go to
DB go to my sequel 56 find your IB log
and pretty much delete all three of
these okay
when you delete that what's gonna happen
this is gonna force my map to actually
create a brand new one and then there
you go
now you go you have map and everything
running up again I mean this isn't the
best fix cuz you are losing data but in
reality it's an easier way than having
to go in and and try to recover the data
and order other stuff that you need to
do I mean local data who cares like this
your local environment right most of
this data usually you already have
migrations for them this is just for you
to just try it out and you're most
likely already have this in code so soon
as you run your code automatically it's
gonna populate the database anyways
alright and then if you want you could
check it again with sequel pro
can I connect one thing that I notice is
it still says game API and it might give
you some errors you see this might tell
you that and my fries are your sequel
but once again what you should do is
come here move this to the trash and
then stop server start it up again go to
sequel okay you can do this with sequel
Pro or whatever you like to use some
people like to use workbench and as you
can see is no longer there
alright so yeah that's pretty much a
pretty quick tutorial I mean hopefully
somebody out there I've seen this like
people asked this a million times and
I've noticed that there's no answers for
this online like there's really no
answers for it on how to fix this
so pretty much this is like the easiest
way that I found to just basically
delete it manually and then start your
server again alright guys I'll see you
guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
