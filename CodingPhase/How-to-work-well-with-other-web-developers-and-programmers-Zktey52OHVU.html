it again man I didn't did it again yeah
all right guys listen so somebody sent
me a comment they want to know how to
work well with mothers right it's very
simple I'm gonna say like this you gotta
have to have a certain style
like a JavaScript style or
of Python styles something that
basically says dictates how the code is
supposed to look like that's number one
you know because you can't have code
that look completely different I hate
when I work on a project where you could
actually tell there were different
developers that means there was no
communication between each other like a
coal should look almost identical to
each other it shouldn't be like oh
somebody came in and putting their own
little flavor
you know how they called know everything
should be in a pretty identical way of
like the Kona Coast look alright so if
we're working with taps for indentation
right each tab is four spaces don't make
it to two spaces like if you both have
out of make sure ya both using the same
slip
the same es lunes settings don't be
using something completely different
don't be like oh yeah I'm using Airbnb s
es link and then the other person is
using this other library cool standard
right because standard is completely
different from the es Lim from Airbnb
so stay on the same page that's number
one number two make sure you use get
alright so yeah both are using git and
github also these are those things like
big bucket of mercury or thing doesn't
name how how you say yeah those are
different different ways of game right
just to just a project manager your your
project right just to keep things in
order
if I'm working on a file and then you're
working on a file if we were to use it
how people used to use it back in the
days where they just upload the file to
FTP then what will happen would be it
just shake it overwritten and then now I
lost my code because you overrode my
 file right
 like that used to happen to people
all the time but now since we have gay
there's a reason why every single
company uses kit especially when you
work in a hit large teams right alright
now let's go into behavior alright
alright if you're a developer right
and pretty much you have an issue where
another developer make sure you have
good communication to each other just
talk it out
don't let it boil up until the point
where yeah I want to fight each other
don't let it boil up until the point
yeah I want to say nasty things to each
other because you still have to see each
other's faces yeah both are in you know
in a working environment like no matter
what and at the end of the day's like
why would you want to lose your job
because he lost control of like your
temper or whatever now your job just you
know be be freaking to be open to just
talk to the person but I hate this man I
know we don't like each other I know
we've been having a lot of issues is at
the same time I don't hate you
I don't know if you hate me but I'm at
work right now and I just really just
want to keep it professional in that
safe safe you know we we talk about work
that says
more than that
that's it that's how I do it all the
time I don't like somebody I just be
honest with them I just be like listen
man this is not personal
I'm not trying to be your best friend
and that's fine you don't need to be my
best friend either we just here for work
we had to get paid we're here to do a
job
we're here to finish this project that's
somebody all right another thing too for
guys right because like I saw a girl the
other day I forgot name is Samantha cars
or something like that I think her name
is like that
I'm not Alessi is kind of deal whatever
right but you have to understand nice
just because the girl is cute doesn't
mean that you have to be out here
looking like a thirst bucket right so if
a girl comes it rain and she's looking
for a job don't say something like oh
it's like oh you come in it for a
front-end position like all the cute
girls is going to Python like what the
 like keep it professional
man I understand as human beings people
forget that we're still animals like
people be forgetting that we're just
animals like that's the reality of
things like like it or not we're human
beings were we're animals we
just happen to walk into a freak and be
able to use tools but it's not that much
different between us and a monkey a us
and a dog hey that's the reality of
things right so just try to keep a
professional
and just be like you know what man this
girl's kind of cute whatever but this is
not the place for me to be tryna holla
and I had a girl here right just be a
freaking good human being man don't make
that girl feel uncomfortable don't make
her feel like oh my god I'm a piece of
meat be kind of grateful that there are
girls in in this field who want to
become developers because I think that's
super cool you know what I mean so I
feel like right now I don't I don't want
to be like a white knight trying to
 you know
protect every girl out here but
I think we have to be you know
protective in the sense of like hey you
want girls to be able to say hey we had
a good experience becoming a developer
you know we don't want this thing to
become something light like the other
the other day I read something online
where it was a CEO from like a high tech
company
it was like oh that this man
sexism and a whole bunch of going
on in the tech industry like that
looks bad because there's barely any
girls in here so it's like how the
are we up so bad and there's
like only 7% of girls in the industry so
it's like come on guys stop being
assholes all right another thing all
right it's just pretty much well I
probably said it already communication
just be honest with me
oh yeah I know that nothing sorry I'm
driving I'm like trying to keep up on my
thoughts together but another thing is
if if like for example don't be a snake
just because you're a good developer
doesn't mean that because somebody else
doesn't know the same things that you
that you know it doesn't mean that that
person is done
right it just means that person haven't
had the time to learn it yet well hasn't
put in the time as much as you so learn
of a certain subject you know my company
now everybody knows we have but do I
think they're done no because they're
super smart and everything else you know
what I mean like they know so much way
more stuff than me then a lot of
subjects and um you know you gotta stay
humble guys but you cannot be thinking
like you gotta be an asshole to people
or talk behind their back and like
 is not gonna come back it's gonna
come back because this karma man you
know this people out here who are it
just sneaks so like let's say an example
I remember there was this kid who used
to come in late to work right and then
there was another developer who will
always be like oh this person's always
late this first thing is this and that
mind you this kid used to live
like an hour and a half away from work
right like you have you have to have
some type of consideration you can't
just be a piece of and be
like oh this person's late all the time
but have some consideration man like
it's fine man if the person stays a
little bit longer like why are you
worried about it you know like you know
a lot of people do like that just
to bring themselves up and go oh
I get here 15 minutes early and this
person gets here 20 minutes late who
gives a man mind your
business you know don't be a snake
because when you're a snake people know
that other developers know that like
let's say if I'm talking sharebar
developer to another developer basically
he knows that when he's not there I'm
talking about him too so that's how
people know you know what I mean so
those are the tips that I was saying to
pretty much learn how to work with
people just don't be a snake have
communication use get a use or a certain
style guy to pretty much say how how the
code is supposed to look like
also to prepare everything as far as it
as a plan don't just start coding just
to start coding and yeah you already
knows it would joke back at it again
I don't did it again yeah I'm trying to
get out of here Oh bout to have an
accident
 New York City man that's why I
moved out of here man anyways man is
your bull joke back at it again Cody
face.com make sure you subscribe make
sure you like this video man and by the
way if you still haven't bought a course
by a course when you get a chance they
write down my description those are the
courses that made me into a developer
this is not courses that I'm
selling these are courses that somebody
else is selling but I'm basically saying
hey you want to become a developer those
lot of courses you got to learn it's
that simple
alright you don't really know Superboy
joke back at it again about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
