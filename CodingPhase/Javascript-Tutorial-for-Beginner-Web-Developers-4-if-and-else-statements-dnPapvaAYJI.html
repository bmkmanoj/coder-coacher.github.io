man make sure you subscribe we've got to
teach it right now some conditionals
right we're going to start with the F
else and else if all right so we want to
start simple so let's say you're let's
say a person right person age all right
so let's say this person is 14 years old
right so if this person is 14 years old
we want to say hey you're under 18 you
cannot smoke so pretty much we will say
hey if person aged less than 18 let's
say console.log you are to be on you
can't smoke so let's say you are too
young you can't smoke right so that's
what's gonna run now oops all right now
the same else oh sorry else console.log
you could smoke right so right now
because the age is 14 the if statement
is going to run first because then run
this if the persons under 18 else if
it's over 18 if it's on 18 / right it's
gonna run this so let's see person
becomes 18 says you could smoke
right now let's say if we wanted to
break this down even better the same
example we wanted to say hey when this
person becomes 18 say something else so
let's say elsif alright so let's say was
the problem okay else if there's the
problem huh there's always like you know
there's part of development there's
gonna be always an issue with something
syntax on the Spokane else oh yeah we
didn't put anything in there so let's
say personal age equals 18 is gonna say
while you legal not to smoke alright so
let's an example is break this down like
that and what if I cannot it's fine just
fine like that you just hear me some
space so it could be more readable
alright so let's say an example ok so if
person's age is under 18 the person's 12
is going to say you are too young you
can't smoke now the person turns 18 says
wow you legal not to smoke right and
then else so anything above 18 is gonna
say you could smoke alright so let's put
this with 21 you could smoke you know
something simple so that's how you do if
statement so
you who you know reuse the same thing
for any different occasion so let's say
let's say name equals Jane let's say
name whose chain just say something like
this Jing steel or if you say Stephanie
let's say person's name is Stephanie
then you will say name equals Stephanie
I don't see right place and i'll see you
sorry for the mistakes but sometimes
typing is annoying okay and then if it
doesn't match any of these then let's
say no hey buddy no you all right so
pretty much we using strings now see so
basically the name is junior all right
so because it says junior and it's not
none of these two names the code that's
kind of run-in still one that's at the
bottom else see hey buddy I don't know
you or joe hey buddy I don't know you
because it's not none of this tool but
if we was to put Jane dings not defined
what does the same chain is not define
all this is weird oh because I didn't
define it here but it should be going oh
yeah it supposed to say name okay so say
hi Jane I missed you now this stephanie
spend a little time I don't see you
Stephanie you know what I mean it's
pretty simple so that's how you do if in
your statements all right guys make sure
you subscribe make sure you give me a
thumbs up give me something and even I
hate comment
I'm gonna appreciate it because at least
I know that somebody came here and got
to see these videos and you know I just
want to share my knowledge what I know
about this you know okay guys I'll see
