Joe back at it again man we're gonna
take the mask off for the
bootcamps man all this bootcamps
man be just lying to people man
like I'm not even gonna play with you
guys I'm gonna just be honest like yeah
I curse yeah I do this and that but I'm
gonna just be honest with you guys
doesn't matter what boot camp it is you
got understand they there to make money
they're not there to make you the best
developer they're not there to to say
hey you know we try to teach these
people that's not the reality of things
all right because they have to pay the
bills and you know a lot of this in the
instructors day they're making like a
hundred grand you know just to to teach
you you know HTML CSS some JavaScript
someplace in the teacher Ruby and it's
like really beginning courses stuff that
you could have gotten online for free
right because it's not like you're
you're getting a MIT or you know
professor teaching you you got you know
the hipster Joe Schmo from the block you
know from Williamsburg teaching you how
to you know how to code you know it's
not really a a great developer it's just
some dude that they found online and
it's like hey he applied for it he has
five years of development and now he's
teaching you and now you're gonna come
out of your pocket and pick $20,000 or
$12,000 $40,000 whatever it is right so
plus a lotta you know youtubers here is
you know promoting hey come to whatever
you know whatever Mel you know whatever
Academy or whatever this and that guys
I'm telling you like it's all
trust me man now the question is can you
become a developer in three months
the reality thinks no that's the reality
of things people take a long time to
become a developer it's not they teach
you how to become a programmer this is a
difference between learning to become a
program
to learn how to become a programmer you
could do it on your own you don't need
to pay somebody to do that like it's not
science this is pretty much just putting
in the work in your own house even I
could tell you what projects you need to
do and that's it
I could be if anybody hits me up right
now sends me a message like hey give me
five projects and I'll go over them for
free I'll give you five projects and
I'll go over it for free and after you
finish them
that's all they gonna teach you and you
know this coding boot camps and whatever
like they're not gonna teach you
anything so don't go out of your way and
spend you know twelve thousand twenty
thousand dollars in a you know
app Academy or something like that or
whatever you know Flatiron school or
learn code Academy especially when you
have you know you have other things that
online like you know coach cool calm
even a team treehouse or who else um
free code camp comm like those guys like
that's free you can learn how to become
a programmer to become a web developer
software engineer to become you know uh
applications developer I've become an
iOS developer Android developer that
takes time that's not something that
you're gonna you know you this is not
something that you just pick up in one
day and say hey I have one week of HTML
CSS now I know HTML CSS it doesn't work
like that you need to put in the time
you need to create the websites you need
to create the applications it's gonna
take you time just like you know even
for myself when I was working when I
first got into this um I couldn't
consider myself a developer until I did
like two three years of like real work
like real professional work I was a
programmer that's a big difference you
become a programmer by yourself you
don't need to pay somebody to give you
that title hey programmer you could do
that by yourself so it gets me pissed
off when people come and tell you hey
you're in three months you could become
a web developer or you could come
and become a software engineer this
isn't that no you can that's the reality
of things and the people that do become
like let's say a web developer like a
really good web developer out of a boot
camp what they don't tell you is this
people have already been programming for
years I had somebody that worked with me
right this guy had the audacity
who actually worked with me before and
he went to full stack I was it was a
 Academy full-stack Academy right
he wants a full-stack Academy and mind
you at that time I only had like what
like a year a year two years of like you
know web development mind you this kid
has been making programs in Java for
like since junior high school right and
then he comes to me he tells me oh yeah
I've only been coding for you know for
only like three months I went to a boot
camp and you know I graduated and you
know now I have a job here and I'm like
you know what let me do some research I
google the kid uh ended up that he was
like getting awards in you know his high
school for programming right I'm not
gonna say his name hopefully one day
he'll see this video cuz he's just
 um yeah he's like oh
yeah I'm uh I just did three months and
I became a web developer and isn't that
my new this person's been programming
for years you can't even compare like
let's say Joe Schmo who who's a mechanic
and says hey I want to switch up my
careers and now I want to become a web
developer and I'm gonna do this in three
months buddy
I'm sorry but you're not gonna become a
developer in three months it is that
serious it's that simple and that
serious like you can't become a
developer in three months this boot
camps there bullshitting you they're
gonna teach you how to become a
programmer a program where you could do
that yourself by yourself you don't need
somebody to tell you how how to do F and
L statement you don't need
somebody to tell you what a variable is
you don't need somebody to tell you what
rest is you don't need somebody to tell
you what Ajax is you could do that on
your own
you know what I mean so it just really
pisses me off how you know a lot of
people's like oh my god you could do
this in three months you could do this
in six months you're not even a
developer yet like at three months you
know you can consider yourself a
developer like just because you know how
to create a variable doesn't make you a
developer you need to have two projects
you need to have the the you know the
experience because at the same time it
degrades and also too it degrades
everybody else who has actually put in
work to this you know what I mean to
earn those titles you can't just be like
hey I did three months in and this and I
like you know at this bootcamp epic adda
me and now I'm a developer and now I
should get $90,000 a year or a hundred
thousand dollars a year it doesn't work
like that buddy you gotta put in the
work you got to start from the bottom
and like the people that do get those
jobs those guys were not actually brand
new developers those guys have been
doing it for years
have you noticed like you know the prep
work like a lot of people came in past
the prep work right so like let's say
you're a Joe Schmo the mechanic and
you're trying to get into one of this uh
app Academy and this and that which they
say 99% are you know they get jobs and
this and that yeah they get jobs but
doesn't mean that you're guaranteed a
hundred thousand dollars or ninety
thousand dollars or whatever but that's
what they advertise I know a lot of
people who went to boot camps and ended
up in like super junior developer
positions getting thirty five thousand
dollars a year and they're like oh this
is not what I expected I thought they
were giving out handing out a hundred
thousand dollars uh everywhere nobody
you like you gotta put in that work so
don't let nobody tell you hey sign up
for this sign up for this other
sign up for this sign up for this other
Boise so this other like No
like I have nothing against these people
but don't don't tell people like
hey you could do this in three months
man stop doing that man
because you're not a developer yet until
you actually have the experience and you
could actually come in and I give you
any project and you could build it if I
come in and I'll tell you hey let's say
you are a front-end developer I'll give
you all a design and definitely I say
hey make this design into from HTML CSS
and JavaScript make it interactive make
this thing you know I doesn't have to be
a single page app but make it look nice
make it look exactly how the designers
make it responsive then from there you
can call yourself a front-end right you
can't call yourself a web developer
until you do the whole back-end
- so then you're talking about dealing
with databases then you're talking about
dealing with a back-end language like
there's a lot of pieces to this that you
know you're only gonna get that with
experience the idea that yeah you could
come in and learn how to program but
you're not a developer yet and like it
just pisses me off that people is out
here like selling people dreams like
come on man let's be honest here like
you know a lot of people putting a lot
of work to get to where they at and the
idea to think about like hey I'm gonna
sell people dreams and say hey you could
do this in three months it's not fair
and not not fair uh to us who bust our
ass and basically you know we earned
this title and I fear for you guys that
it's like now talking about the guys
that could do it I'm not talking about
the guys that could you know who-who
been programming since like high school
and just they were a lawyer and then
decided to be like oh you know what I'm
gonna switch it up and I'm gonna go back
to coding cuz I did that too I was an IT
but I already been programming for years
already so for me to tell you guys be
like hey you know like go ahead and
tricking you know sign up for this boot
camp because in three months you're
gonna be a great developer and you're
finer hungry dozen down a job no because
they got a freaking axe you a whole
bunch of questions you know in
interviews they gotta be like hey do you
even know what prototypical inheritance
is do you even know how to create you
know classes do you know es6 do you know
angular do you know react
do you know view do you know there's a
whole bunch of that people ask you
for jobs and then you're when you're not
ready all you're doing is embarrassing
yourself and embarrassing you know the
people that that that's interviewing you
they're like oh god like we actually
brought this guy in and this is not to
discourage nobody this is just to let
you know there's like a reality check
and I'm doing this for you guys because
like I wish like when I was like
starting I wish somebody would gave me a
little wake-up call because when I
started I was like hey I'm gonna make
$100,000 a year and a reality I started
with like 35,000 and is I know it's not
all about money but it's like a reality
check it's like hey you're expecting
this but the reality of things is you're
gonna get this as a start why because
you you just doing this you know in
three months there's a lot of companies
who don't even you know don't even hire
people from boot camps and you know
another thing too is let's say AB
Academy I think they do like Ruby right
Ruby on Rails let's say an example
damn right you coming from Tennessee
right you come from Tennessee and you
move to San Francisco to go to app
Academy right you go to app Academy
you're they're studying you do your
little three months after you
do your three months you
realize like hey I'm gonna go back to
Tennessee but when you go back to
Tennessee what they do is over there is
a c-sharp let's say dotnet order the
companies over there is
our net right or let's say they only
doing nodejs
but you only focus on Ruby on Rails and
they only show you a little bit of
basics and you know and whatever but you
don't have enough enough experience to
you know to be able to get those jobs so
now you're home and you're like man
I'm in Tennessee I can't even find a job
I spent twenty thousand dollars for no
reason and then now you got to go back
to your you know become being a mechanic
back again because somebody sold you a
dream when you could have done that
you couldn't learn how to program in
your own house spend that whole year of
learning you know learning how to become
a programmer and you know learning all
the skills that you needed to do just
give yourself a year don't give yourself
three months because three months is not
enough time for you to become a a decent
web developer or even somebody
experienced a iOS whatever like yet this
is going to be the exception but you can
never think hey I'm the exception if
you're the exception that happens to you
naturally now for uh you know us rather
than people you know it happens like
with hard work you're not gonna become
this you know Mark Zuckerberg
from one day to another just because you
went to a boot camp just because you did
three months especially getting yourself
in debt like $20,000 I don't know so you
guys but it's a lot of money to be
throwing it out like that
and I'm just saying like as a developer
who actually been doing this for years
now I'm going on my fifth year now right
and I mean professionally I used to do
this when I was like 14 but
professionally I have five years doing
this stuff but I'm just being honest
with you guys man I wanna I wanna be you
know the wake-up call where I'm telling
you guys like hey lower your
expectations and don't give this guys no
money man this guy's this
I this guy definetly this guy's they
don't deserve your money man you could
do that on your own
give yourself trust yourself trust me
trust yourself and go ahead and just you
know invest in your own time to learn
how to code here on YouTube on you to me
on you know Cole school comm on team
treehouse I'm not even getting paid from
this guy's and I I'm promoting them
because that worked for me you know and
it's just not worth it man I'm seeing a
lot of people like today somebody came
in uh talking about he's from the boot
camp and this and that he graduated from
full-stack to another person graduated
for full stack but wasn't even ready for
for the interview like he wasn't ready
at all and on top of that doesn't even
have a gay hug doesn't have a portfolio
doesn't have no projects just with uh
just saying hey I graduated from this
boot camp hire me and what happened soon
as he left everybody was laughing and
inside of me I felt bad I was like damn
man they put the battery on his
back and told him hey you're ready in
three months when he wasn't anyways man
