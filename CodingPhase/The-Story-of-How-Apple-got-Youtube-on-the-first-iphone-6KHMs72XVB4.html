again man coding face.com listen your
boys back and I done did it again
alright so we looking at this article
how you two ended up on the first iPhone
Wow right I think this a pretty cool
story so this guy he actually worked for
Google from my thing 2003 to 2013 and at
YouTube from 2007 to 2013 as you guys
remember YouTube was their own company
at one point and then Google came and
swooped in saw an opportunity and say
you know what the future of the web is
going to be in video everybody's going
to be doing videos I think now YouTube
is like getting like a billion
views a minute or something like that I
don't know exactly the exact numbers by
something similar to that right so this
guy he was going over a couple of tweets
that he did on how you two became an
official app was the first iPhone and it
was very interesting because I didn't
know this story right I told that
YouTube was you know they just decided
that hey let's get on the on the first
iPhone and it seems like it wasn't like
that was more Apple reached out to
Google well let's go a little bit that
Google bought YouTube and then after
that what happened was basically Apple
say you know what how can we get people
to start buying this how can we get
people to start buying this iPhone
because people had the iPods and like
why they need an iPhone 4 we have our
little Nokia's we have our little other
phones that we have you know like back
in the day like with a Palm Pilot you
know which pretty funny to think about
it
like nowadays like some old-ass phones
you know like I remember I had this
phone this phone was very dear to my
heart because this phone you had to put
in the ringtones you actually had to go
and take your time find the MIDI online
and actually putting the music yourself
not download it not freaking getting it
from anywhere else or a text message no
you have to go in there and put in the
numbers that equal to whatever note it
is and you'll be like oh yeah cool I
gotta put in this ringtone I remember we
used to have what was it Ja Rule's and
was this other girl Ashanti's ringtone
or you know the clips album way over
like on
was it the what happened to that boy
don't you do that whatever you guys get
the point right so so basically they
came and installed YouTube on the first
iPhone so it's like a crazy story how
they did this like the first iPhone
goddammit YouTube so yeah sorry god that
should be faster than this alright so
this old-ass phone right now to think
about it and I owe this is great but
look how all the old you to that used to
look like
but basically Apple actually created the
app for them they created an app that
connected to an API that connected to
Google's servers and back then YouTube
was still its own sort of company but
they were owned by Google right so it
just connected directly to an API but I
believe where was I thinking like 2012
yeah iOS 6 came out and Google was like
um you know what guys we're not
renew our contract that we had where you
guys were able to have an app called
YouTube on your applications right
application the app store and you guys
basically own that app we're taking it
back we're gonna make our own advil
we're gonna make it our own way and it's
gonna connect directly to us right
without a middleman of Apple going in
there and it was pretty shitty guys but
listening to this guy while reading his
story right
reading his story about behind it is
kind of crazy so they basically remove
to the YouTube app from the phone and
then from there they put it in an app
store and one thing that people don't
know about this
when they did that they removed YouTube
from the iPhone YouTube wasn't even
showing on the top and on top 10 top 100
apps of the iPhone because Apple
actually put it right under it like
super to the back is like Bates 20 or
something right they try to basically
hide YouTube but everybody wanted
YouTube it was already too late
everybody loved having music everybody
loves watching music videos everybody
loves searching their you know their
makeup and whatever so it was already
too late
many of the people were already used to
having YouTube on their phone and a lot
of people remember this a lot of people
were really pissed off when they
download it well when they bought their
iPhone they're like what the hell I got
a download this that she used to
come with the iPhone I thought this was
part of the iPhone that's how people
used to be talking that's the part of
the iPhone but it's not part of the
iPhone it's actually a completely
different company but Apple scheme be
right and we're in 2017 now it's just a
little back story that was interesting
to me I was like oh man it was funny

one of the guys that worked
there from the beginning and yeah oh you
