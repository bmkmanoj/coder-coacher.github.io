moments that we have right now you know

like right now even right now we only
have 27 people in here right now there's
like you know any of you guys can ask me
questions and this is more personal this
is like one-to-one we both can talk
right here live you know once this
channel goes like above 50,000 then
that's a whole different ballgame you
know you know what I mean like then it's
not you kind of lose that touch because
there's so many people that it's hard
for you to like remember the name so
many people to remember their little
icons and you're like man you know
people start hanging you up you're like
oh man like even now that happens to me
a lot of times people come in and I'll

I was like oh same thing here what I
would have my and then she goes like you
know I'm not new I've been here since
the beginning
I just never say anything which is like
to me is my employer is like why do
people come and just watch right I think
the best part of the live streams is the
fact that we can talk direct we can come
here and start leaving comments we can
start asking questions like the best
part and I look at everybody's messages
I'm like man the best part of this whole
live stream is seeing other people talk
to each other seeing people answer into
things that I'm talking about and like
you know you know vice versa you know
what I mean and I read what you guys see
and then I'll just come in and everybody
whatever you guys are talking about

what are you from in I'm from Trinidad
man oh yeah I was talking about
accountable okay okay no that's what's
up man I need to go over there man
well you say you using no Flatbush in
Flatbush you should you should turn off
the flat must for the carnival the NYC
carnivals oh yeah yeah but it's yes to
ratchet it gets to ratchet for me it
gets too crazy every time I look at the
news somebody got got bodied freakin
cops is Dancing with Saudis
well night down down here in Trinidad it
hasn't stuff but if you're a tourist
you're pretty okay don't say I mean
that's the difference like you go to the
island it's kind of different because
it's like you know the people this
welcoming people want to chill with you
is okay cool these tourists is here
spend some money let's treat them good
wait have you come to Trinidad and keep
you not in the bad place they keep you
in a safer place
yeah I mean that's the same thing in
Dominican Republic like you know I know
people that be like oh I watched the
Milliken Republican
they're like dominican republic it's a
block away from the hotel like that's it
yes I went to Dominican Republic I went
to the corner store I came right back
like that's the Dominican Republic I was
there and they do I got a train with
Katie got it done it's under ADA yeah if
he business is going on there
so right now you in Trinidad yeah me
right now I am studying to be a coder or
programmer nice and I'm I'm going I said
I'll go and doing it like with the Blitz
Eric okay
what what's up let Sara give me ask so
what is the love it's it's a it's a
tempo for
when Germany in the Second World War
would attack they would blitz something
I'm focus on the coding and I love it
and it's it's great fun yeah man that's
why is that man people gotta get
programming sound man that's that's the
best part it's like problem solvers like
you have a puzzle and you just gotta
figure it out yeah so but what I like
like about you is that you get the
business done when you start something
make sure again it's finish so it's it's
good yeah man
now that's what we hear man that's why I
tell people all the time is like you
know it's not really about memorizing
everything is about can you get
something done
you know what I mean yeah some people
they might think like oh I gotta be a
master at this is like nah man all you
really have to do is be able to know how
to look for the answers you don't have
to be a master like let's say JavaScript
JavaScript API is huge if you go into
the documentation or you try to
understand every single thing
in the DOM is like you don't need to
understand everything there's certain
concepts that you need to understand in
certain places on where to find the
answers and how to look in documentation
and that's it you know III agree to a
point I think the mental state of a
person is important in terms of they
must understand a framework and by a
framework I don't mean a computer
framework
I mean how to interpret information and
then you are open to the opportunities
so you you open your mind to the
sensitivity of yet of outer noon agree I
agree with you definitely agree I mean
it's a state of mind
oh you gotta get on a state of mind you
know depending on damn you don't got no
headphones Wayne the ico honey
it's driving me crazy Rayna yeah that's
good connect that in me put that in then
people probably so in oh man right now
can we
himmat tutorial how to connect a
headphone on a computer or laptop
it just has a connection for the speaker
exactly disconnect the speaker and
collect the hair falls in there okay IT
101 disconnect a half disconnect the
speakers to connect your headphones yeah
here you go start somewhere it's one of
those things yeah we you know we just
have a phone man so I mean what you
follow me well hell you found me yet
um I just was looking up tutorials and
wanted to learn about coding because
right now there there's a very bad
recession in the country not the job
situation isn't great here and I said
you know what I have a couple options
what I do what I want to do I can lay
down and die like keep on fighting um I
figured well I'll keep on fighting the
coding right thing which I love to do
nah drawing and odd so that's what I do
I say listen you know what and that's
what I believe I believe people should
should never let a circumstance
determine who they are ya think
they can be all individuals are open to
the opportunity to be great and for me
be the person whoever they are whatever
race creed color race whatever you have
a responsibility to yourself to be the
best you can be and try the best you can
yeah I agree with you I like you I like
you because
you go for it you say listen I was I may
not have been in it but I decided to
fight it and I fought it as best as I
can and at least you can say you what
yeah exactly yeah no that's that's what
I tell people all the time man I hear
stories you know you don't even know I
hear stories from people that hit me up
they're like yo I'm freakin doing bad I
lost my job I'm doing this and that and
I'm like man what the hell do you do I
mean to you just go from the you find
the closest bridge and just jump off or
you just say you know what this happens
okay next week is gonna be different if
I come and I I decide to change my
situation and change in a positive way
you're going to be good you know what I
mean like it just happens hard work
Trump's all of that you know there's a
guy can I ask a question where are your
eyes my eyes oh I'm looking I got two
screens so let me tell you where your
eyes are your eyes are in the front of
your face yeah it meant to look forward
you're not meant to look back okay and
you forget what's back there what's
about girls dead so you go ahead so you
may have you're starting your business
I'm an accountant by profession by the
way mm-hmm but so I've met a lot of
people who started a business for
different reasons many of them um but
you go ahead you try your best at least
you can say listen I went and I didn't I
didn't quit and I knew where I went yeah
exactly
the only thing I ask is that you
traction it out in Rocky a proper one

rocky from Trinidad oh yeah I gotta try

his difference like you know I was like
it's not like here in the US was like
okay you working you start seeing
progress right but over there some some
people if you have like a dead-end job
it means a dead-end job like that's it
so he he he was all working in a store
selling shoes and I'll never forget this
I was like in Dr I was like 19 years old
he goes like Joe I just got paid and
he's like I just got paid it was like ah
I think like 15 pesos which was like I
don't know maybe $300 for like the whole
month and he was like yo I just got paid
and here's the other half and he came
and he gave me that half of his 15 pesos
and I was like yo I'm like yo this this
is gonna take you two weeks for you to
hack and he's like don't worry about it
we only live once and if he's gonna take
me two weeks to earn it again we earn it
again we're not gonna die for this you
know what I mean like we're just gonna
have fun today and enjoy and a lot of
times I noticed that from people like
they don't need a lot a lot of things
like here in the US we we have this
thing I'm like oh we gotta have the
biggest house we gotta get the the best
car we gotta get the best clothes we
gotta go to the best restaurants do this
and this and that but then this
something that you're missing here like
you know the happiness happiness of like
okay I'm just
gonna have fun in my life I'm gonna
enjoy my life cuz here everybody's after
something everybody's like oh I just
gotta make as much money as I can but
you forget how to be happy in the
islands people asking people just on the
street just selling off coconut candies
and pretty much you see them with a
smile every day like did you know what I
mean like you could still make your life
better like you don't need all all the
things that sometimes society tells you
like oh you need all of this stuff it's
like not really you know what I mean
like but then you're living other
people's lives
exactly you if you watch yourself what
makes you happy in this life
brilliant truly if you ask yourself what
can you lose today that will really
wreck you and then you ask yourself what
do you have that you can get out that
you don't need it's gonna come down to
your family mm-hmm it's gonna come down
to what you've achieved and where you
struggle Curitiba and in fact some sense
of accomplishment and it's probably
gonna come down to your friends as well
so you know if you know you you got you
you may have a million dollars two
million dollars and you may be chasing
some of the most beautiful women know
what I mean III I love women can go
wrong can't go wrong listen I will look
at you funny if you said something else
just I'm on the cha I have nothing
against anyone you know I have nothing
respectful you know whatever you know
I'm not against anyone so don't bloody
crash me up what you studying now I mean
you you getting into programming I mean
you are you JavaScript about doing
JavaScript okay could Java JavaScript
under course
you recommend it I started on those nice
however I wanted to start Java but I'm
having problems with the Eclipse so I
figured you know I'll struggle with
JavaScript strip now to December and
then hopefully by then I'll gain enough
knowledge to start on Java you know
that's what I keep telling people man
you push it definitely like you should
check out web man you know focus on
JavaScript first get that done you know
because it's so much easier to get set
up it's like if you want to do
JavaScript you could do on the console
lock you know what I mean
you can browse err you don't have to go
through a whole thing of like hey man we
got to compile this to show what just
happened in my code is like no it's like
just doing on the browser it's pretty
much programming programming you're
gonna learn it it doesn't matter what
language it is that could be Ruby could
be JavaScript could be Python it could
be whatever but programming so long as
you learn how to program every other
language is easy it's all about syntax
it's just about like different letters
that say but they're all saying the same
thing they all have four loops they all
have variables they all have you know
it's the same thing you know I'm out
here looking at the the chatroom more
people coming in that's what I like to
see you know what I mean really here
what up say what up
we got your people out here from Santana
properly I'll say what going on making
it coming here Jamaican go on my youth
like yo you know man I don't think me
had a UC Republic give me if you want to
go sharpen the lingo we can do that but
then no one would understand us
yeah yo it's crazy man when I find out
drink your own yeah it does it was the
thing he let me see we got skeletons in
here we got caught in here let me see
this clay Murtagh
let me see man you know yeah I'll be
telling people yo people like we got let
me see what is in here
I got Martinez we got mo was it I'm on
New York's just in the deaf yo what up

one of the best things about my channel
I feel like we could just be ourselves
you know what I mean like I'm not here
trying to be nobody else I'm not here
trying to act like nobody else we ain't
here like I'm hanging out with my
friends you know what I mean like I was
I got this message from from I forgot
her name but she was sending me about to
go this week I think today to show up to
do like a meeting and just you know do
like a little talk for the kids who are
learning how to code in this program in
the Bronx and I was thinking in my hand
man I'm like you know I don't even have
nothing planned like I want to go but I
feel like I want to have something
planned to show up there and then I was
like thinking I'm like yo I should just
go in there and be like yo what up what
up son is your boy job back at it again
that you know we hear it's a cold kid
and just you know hit him with it you
know but but if I go in there I mean
what they gonna think you know what I
mean so I was like just thinking in my
head like yo I should stop worrying
about what other people think because
you know it's like sometimes okay like I
said when I made this channel I made it
for myself and just be like yo I'm just
gonna talk here what like I'm I'm
hanging out with my friends all right
so I'm like yo what if I just start just

gonna tell you right now what be because
I'm gonna do a live with you guys to let
me see where is it we're going to
Spotify let me look at my my calendar
okay we go into Spotify on October 11th
right from 6:30 to 8:30 right and I was
just thinking in my head I'm like yo man
I should just go in there and just be
like just be myself and be like yo I'm
not even around developers like you know
what I mean like this be myself now try
to act like a developer just you know
just be like yo without we in here
coding face.com we running Spotify what
up you know but if I go in there
people's gonna be looking at me arrange
hey Sean
hula-hula who let this guy in you know
what I mean so say we can't go 100% us
you know I just wish sometimes I'll be
like man I wish I could just go into the
spots man just feel comfortable you know
I'm just going there man you know
without people just be like hey Sean
hula hula hula babies baby stepdad who
that baby step that up in here yo so you
you basically so you're saying that you
do accounting right Jimmy I'm gonna a
chartered accountant by profession for
myself all right but uh it
it's here's a the Caribbean and operates
differently with regard to the laws and
ethics like man we gotta pay taxes I'm
like if people know careers like taxes
are taxes like then nobody knows what
taxes are like we we don't have we don't
say we don't say those words big words
are out here we keep down to hush-hush
well it's there if you know anything
about Trinidad but up maybe ten years
there's been a lot of issues of
corruption and stuff like that they have
a nice you know with running out of oil
so they produce oil in the country and
natural gas and right now this is at an
all-time low
so bottom there's there's huge amounts
of corruption yeah there's one percent
of the country which is five thousand
people that basic controls 1.4 million
people in the country
that's how about it is the power they
have it's it's amazing they start a
business they stop you alone all kind of
stuff like that I know a guy he started
a tobacco is pretty dark right now and
he was competing against certain people
and they came you got a you come there
after the people brought in the goods
etc and they said listen you can't have
this business you gotta close down
otherwise you know it was similar his
family
it's rough it's it's not like it's not
like the state's where you can you can
be an ordinary person and just say you
know what I want to start a business
it's it's it's rough it's this up now
that's that's how it is I mean even here
in the US women I mean I feel like the
whole world right now is hard you know I
was like you have more opportunities he
for sure like it's just like you know
someplace this is like you just don't
have the chance it's like okay you're
you're a little kid who who shines
shines boots in the street is very hard
for you to move up the class right but
here in the u.s. like you could be a kid
from the project who you know your mom
was a crack addict and you know and you
don't even know who your dad is and you
could still be successful you go to
school and go to school graduate go to
work and that's a it could get really
bad if you don't follow the right things
but everybody has the opportunity you
know you could be a little freaking
Michael Perez who just came here from
across the border and and still with no
papers still on a business you know what
I mean like I think this from people
where they come here and they make
something out of nothing like you know I
remember there was this kid who I know
his mom she had I got a taco spot right
she she was doing like selling tacos in
the street for like years and then
probably I don't know like five years
later she owned like three taco trucks
like now she's just making mad money and
I'm like yo how the hell she did it it's
just like okay hard work
she she just went hard for five years
saved her money took on some Long's
banks you know she kept her credit clean
the banks came in it's okay this person
pays everything on time let's give her a
loan after you get the first log then
you taken out another loan on your next
ride yeah you just keep on going next
thing you know is like now you're good
you know America is built on on credit
you know what I mean like nobody here
nobody even the most millionaire person
here they nobody owns anything because
you know like I don't know if in
Trinidad like that like in Dominican
Republic you buy a house that's your
house that's it in the United States you
buy a house you're paying thirty
thousand dollars
every year no matter what for the rest
of your life so that means you don't own
that house you know what I mean and if
you don't pay those taxes for that house
at that moment they come in and swoop
take it right back so you could be let's
say an example you could be you know 20
years to buy a house that costs you a
million dollars right an example right
took you 20 30 years to pay it off that
house now you got to pay 40 thousand 50
thousand dollars a year but when you
retire you don't make 30 $40,000 a year
so what happens now you have to actually
sell your house and buy something
smaller because your house you can't pay
the taxes that you gotta pay the
government at the end of the year so
reality you don't own that house it's
like you're paying for something that's
not yours in your pain to live exactly
your pain to live so it's like here
you're part of the system that's why I
was like you know selling my mom today I
was like killed I'm thinking about
moving to from here from New York I'm
thinking about moving to another state I
want to move to another place because
here in New York I feel like you know
like even when I was working full time I
was like we're spending like $7,000
$8,000 a month and I'm like you know why
my friends that I know they live off
$2,000 and they live good chillin
why me getting seven eight thousand nine
thousand dollars a month I feel like I
still feel like this like I got so many
bills and so much things that I have to
pay I'm like there has to be something
else like an exit plan you know because
then if you continue in the cycle then
now you're not even living your life all
you're doing is you're working to be
able to maintain what all right laughs
I'm like yo I don't need all this
so so I'm gonna give you some little
advice if you listen I learned this from
people who came from war zones and they
were very poor
I would have multimillion it so they
taught me um they were very good people
so um they said if you are spending
money you spend you take your money and
you divided into three parts one is what
you spend in the month one is what you
keep and one is what you you use for
business so one-third is business one
third personal on one thirty safety yes
so ya don't want it that is business you
split that you say how much capital do I
need to run the business okay
6040 thirty seventy whatever right and
you put in your mind in one year's time
how much is your limit for the capital
so you don't drown yourself with the
capital spending bubble in your mind
listen in one year's time or six months
or however long you put in your mind
this thing needs to start making money
yes
yeah take that that that one - it is got
good money then when I but you're
gambling on yourself yes yeah no exactly
I'm the one to that safety when it comes
to it okay they could you know you use
that and if something happens you know
medical or whatever you know the one
thing would let you throw it out of your
mind now sometimes people divided into
1/4 or 1/5 because they can live on this
it depends different people you know
different yeah I know I feel it's not
rocket science you know I know that but
what I'm saying is like here in like you
know like here New York is different
it's like it's a lot it's a lot I lived
in LA it's like I lived in London people
its money they they want the newest
gadgets something what do you really
need in your life it tell you something
you if you write a book on your coding
or something like that
that will give you more sense of
Pearlman than spending $10,000 on 400
you know we do did it no that's the same
that's why I producer is a different
mindset than a consumer yeah now that's
why I was like y'all I pretty much you
know some some people but I kill a joke
you crazy man you you working full time
you got benefits you got money that I'm
like y'all I'm not happy doing that you
know what I mean like I'm not already my
happiness is is helping other people out
my happiness is you know living on just
being sustainable and being able to just
you know help other people I'm not even
trying to become a millionaire I'm not
trying to become rich at some point I'll
be honest at some point I had those
aspirations where I was like man I just
want to have a big-ass house I want to
have a crazy-ass car and then I got to
those points where I'm like yo I could
have a big-ass house I could have a
crazy-ass car but is that giving me
fulfillment know so it's like me
sacrificing myself to maintain those
things that's not gonna bring me
happiness you know what I mean what
brings me happiness is doing this
hanging out with people on YouTube
helping them out creating the courses
you know and even like that like I've
set myself up in a way where even you
know I'm good for the next year right
that's my math my math is already good
right so from now to the first three
months I feel like yo there's not gonna
be a profit that's how it is that's how
the world works but after that then from
there is it's pretty much I'm just um
you know everything's gonna be good cuz
every time that I set my mind to
something you know I was like freaking
working at the mall I was working in the
parking lot you know what I mean like
you know it's crazy life so crazy that I
used to working our money exchange right
you know - yeah yeah the clothes I got
fired from my money exchange and I was
going to my Community College I was like
man how am I gonna be able to survive
now it's so
crazy in the same law that I was working
on in our money exchange in the store
the guy from the parking lot was like yo
we need somebody to work here if you
want to work I could hook you up and I'm
thinking in my head man I'm like yo this
is embarrassing
I'm gonna go from inside the store to
working in a parking lot you know what I
mean like this is bad you know and I was
like thinking to myself man I gotta do
something with myself I gotta do
something with my life I gotta get out I
got a really work hard and I did it it's
like you know every every year how to
use a new goal my first year I was
making my 50 grand I was like you know
next thing I want to get to 70 then the
next day I was like girl I just want to
make it to 80 then I just kept going
kept going I got in a lot of big numbers
and I'm like yeah once I got to there I
was like there's really there's no
happiness beyond that so now I gotta
find my happiness in the sense of what
are the things that are like I love
music I love film I love everything
that's artistic I love to draw I love to
create right I'd love to help other
people so how can I blend all all of
those things together - you know I used
to do drawing just regular graphite ear
you know and I like to do a lot of you
know architecture - but I haven't done
in a long time you know so it's like now
I'm starting to get back to the things
that I love and at the same time just
being more happy like I've been here for
like what like a week two weeks already
since I quit my job and I've been more
happier now cuz I get to see my son gets
to hang out with my son you know like
it's crazy my girl axe me today like Oh
like you know it's like you remember the
first month and I was like thinking in
my head I'm like I don't remember the
first month of when the baby was born
because at that whole time I was so
stressed out with this job like there
was so much things going on in that job
like the whole company was a show
and then I'm like yo I've never been in
a situation like this where everything
is messed up completely mad
stop and then people are looking up to
us to fix everything and all mosquitoes
yeah Island so yeah so I'm like yo
wait it's crazy I'm over here doing all
the stuff and I don't even remember what
the whole first month of my son so I was
like you know now you know what I'm on
I'm on take my time work hard but I
gotta work hard in a way where I can
give time to my family because nobody
else is gonna be there you know what I
mean like if I if I miss out those
moments nobody's gonna give me that back
I could go and work look somebody hit me
up from LA Mercedes Benz they wanted me
to go work at a freakin at their weapon
Department for 127,000 and then I get
129,000 but you have to you know come
back work in the city I don't like yo I
don't want that you know what I mean
it's like yo but like you I am I gonna
be happy you know what I mean so you are
discovering something that and you have
the opportunity to do it which is very
good at 29 I think you're 29 or 30 I'm
happy 30 December third kids we
celebrating out here with papi Carnival
is in February yeah
60 to 70 percent of the population is
born in November and December because oh
yeah yeah hey everybody
everybody's like a carnivals coming up
ma what up I'm putting them out too
quick February 9 months after so you
know they're just just kids they run out
of condoms on contraceptives
I am born in November so that's telling
you but um yo if you have 29 yo you are
the best time because you can spend this
time investing in yourself in your
business so that when you take mid
thirties to forties you've got a
business going on you got
an income stream going on there that
you're settled into and you build up a
brand for that so it's it's perfect
timing
yeah that's how I look at him like
you're like I know what I'm doing yeah
you know what I mean like I didn't
nobody goes nobody takes you gotta be
stupid to take risk without knowing the
consequences and knowing what you're
doing you know I really work hard and
you know reality even this is what I
tell you don't know if even if things
were to go bad if tomorrow I'm like yo
everybody unsubscribes everybody deletes
their account

I'm trying to support people man you

need you know your boys out here we in
here now man but that's what's up man I
bet that was man fun you know I've
been a couple of music videos man I'm
not gonna put it out there like that for
this you know people find me in the cut
with the ratchet let me see
coating grunt I'm trying to find your
your channel coding grunt
I'm gonna make a video about that man AJ
I got you let me go video about it
because people keep talking about like
yo it's getting oversaturating man
people need to shut the hell up
that's what people need to do I'm being
honest
cuz you know why because there's the
thing I don't like this idea of what
some people have they be like oh I'm a
great developer I'm a senior developer
I'm doing this in that and I've been
doing this because I love in this and
that people want to talk about all it's
getting oversaturating but what does
that mean oversaturated you know what I
mean like what it means is a lot of
people don't want other people to come
in it's like hey guys there's like the
Golden Age let's keep it for us and it's
like nah f you guys man like we I'm
bringing everybody in you know what I
mean like that's my goal like I want to
make it into something different instead
of having like the same people the same
type of people in the industry like you
know guys who think they're super smart
and this and that like man exactly like
the whole Bodega thing like people be
acting like you know other people don't
need to come in like what we want to
come in like you know I even heard
people say yo now somebody making a joke
now girls want a cold like yeah girl
should be coding let them code like who
cares like why are you feel threatened
by it because now you're gonna have
competition now it's not about the nerdy
kids who sit by themselves in the
lunchroom you know what I mean like now
everybody could code and everybody could
go in there and you know now everybody's
gonna make it
but at the same time it's like why
wouldn't you want more people to call
like that's where the industry is going
to like more people need to be calling
now everybody's gonna be out here
especially once the robots come through
like everything get automated what do
you think is gonna happen somebody has
to be controlling those robots and they
people need to be more involved with
technology you know so you know it's not
how you know Skellington say it's not a
secret society people acting like kill
only certain people need to be coding or
certain people need to be an industry
like nah man f that
like whoever wants to code code and it
should be able to get a job and should
be able to be good this whole idea that
people be like oh there's way too many
people getting hired like new people
getting higher what there might be true
in some sense of like K there's a lot of
new people coming in that are not ready
to be in primetime meaning like mid
levels or or senior level positions but
people get hired for those things and
they're junior developers right but what
happens why are they there because
there's not enough people who are senior
developers period so somebody at some
point they have to somebody gotta come
in and work those those jobs so they
have to let those people come in you
know what I mean like our company is
gonna invest in them and say okay you
guys gonna come in for one year two
years get all your skills and then
you're gonna become a senior developer
here at the company but I keep hearing
from people from YouTube and other
people like oh it's getting
oversaturated getting this in there I'm
like nah man it's just that you don't
want people to come in there's a big
difference like is it saturated known
there's nine of people like if there was
enough people they wouldn't be hiring
people from other countries trust me
trust me there's America like you there
was there wasn't
of people here they will not be hiring
people from other countries right like
that's the truth and also to the fact
that you know these people that are
working for cheaper from other countries
they come here with h-1b visas they put
them on our on a slave I call it a new
slave trade and they put them in you
know and get them working and now they
slave to that company earning you know
they come up with super a whole bunch of
skills and then they're like you're
gonna get paid fifty thousand dollars
that's it you got a visa let's say be
happy with that when those guys should
be getting paid more cuz their skills is
higher but at the same time it's like
you know it's like there's not enough
people to fill out those jobs people
keep talking about all there's not jobs
this and that and saying no this was
gonna happen guys every company that
sells things probably 70% other people
are gonna go out of jobs all right all
the stores Macy's uh JCPenney you know
all those things are going out of out of
work right all those people are gonna go
out of work there's not gonna be there's
gonna be very very few stores that you
can walk into right so those people that
are gonna be working there physically
that's not gonna exist but there's gonna
be a whole bunch of jobs with technology
this could be a guy who comes in and
fixes the scanners right let's say an
example you get high you don't have to
be a developer you could just literally
have one single job your job is to go
around every store and you fix the
scanners right that's it that's your job
right that's part of technology you
could come in and say you work for our
energy company you fix a freaking high
college some panels whatever that's part
it's a
all of those things are in the same
bubble web development program all of
that stuff is in the same bubble no
matter what you know what I mean so it's
like at some point program is gonna be
as much as people's lives as talking in
English and that's the truth
people's gonna have to learn it even the
basics because you're gonna know you're
gonna have to need to know things like
you know it's like back in the days you
remember back in these people used to
have type riding class right that's how
program is gonna be like people have
type type writing class then they became
computer classes then now computer
classes like okay everybody knows how to
use a computer what else do they gotta
learn they gotta learn the basics of
programming am I gonna say hey
everybody's gonna be programming no but
people are going to be able to know the
basics it's like you know how you know
how people be like hey I took four years
of high school Spanish and all they know
how to say is Ola your kid or poyo like
that's all they know that's the same
thing that's gonna happen with
programming now everybody's gonna know
programming but it's gonna be in
everybody's face so the idea that
saturator is like nah we're not Golden
Age right now people should be jumping
into this thing now if you listen to
people who come in all things not
oversaturated it's like find out why
they saying that first you know what I
mean yeah
I think there's a lot of people who
don't fit in the whole hipster scene
sometimes I feel like I don't fit in
I mean I'm I'll be honest like wherever
I go on everybody loves me like that's
the truth
everybody loves me but I kind of wish
there was more of my peoples meaning
like you know it's like I like granny
now I know I'm putting a video of like
Gucci Mane in this video and I know
somebody's gonna be like who is Gucci
like you know what I mean they're gonna
be like that but people from my culture
they're gonna know they're gonna like oh
your boy Joel isn't into that good to me
he knows about Gucci you know what I
mean like there can be like you know
meetings with other developers that are
cool like that you know I was like
there's not many of us out here man
there's definitely a bunch bunch of
squares man and not only even meaning in
a bad way but there's definitely a bunch
of squares and doors in here man now I
wish you know sometimes like man I just
wish my peoples were in here man just
cause it's more live man trust me man
it'll be more poppin it'll be better
more better it'd be more fun you know
nobody plays it's okay it's the case 90%
quit just from a basic JavaScript course
that's so true
almost everybody quits man I'm telling
you guys I'm looking at the analytics
I'm like yo I want everybody to do it
man King everybody do it I don't know
because now everybody wants to do real
work nobody wants to put in the work
we're kids yeah I'm about to be out of
here man one o'clock in the morning I'm
