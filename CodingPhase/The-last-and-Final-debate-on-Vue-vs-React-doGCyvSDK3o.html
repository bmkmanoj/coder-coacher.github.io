again man coding face.com I done did it
again all right guys listen your voice
back and I done did it again like always
but this is a very important topic this
is like one of the most important topics
of 2017 the biggest debate in the whole
community view Jay s versus react to yes
the last debate right there's my last
time that I'm going to bring this up and
this the last time that I'm going to
talk about this because there's really
no point I've already said my my points
on this but I want to bring it up just
because we have to go over this article
there's a very good article because it
shows me how people think all right so
let's give credit to prevail Mallos all
right
and let's talk about sex it's good to
start it all right so ram-leela hang
somebody that loves vgs basically says I
prefer view Jas or react UJS is the new
kid in the JavaScript town what so you
basically like for you because it's new
that's the problem with the whole
community of JavaScript like period
everybody's looking for whatever is new
now whatever is the best there's a big
difference between something is the best
and when something just came out the
first job is just to bring it back
the first Jonas were the best niggas
that ever came out but this constantly
new sneakers that come out every year
and people say oh these are the best
ones Nana this are the newest ones but
the best ones were the Jordans number
one that was the original alright that's
the one that changed the game that was
the one that created everything
star followed alright but going back
into code so this is one of the reasons
that everybody says oh this is the best
one it's the newest one it's pretty much
you know if angular and JavaScript and
you know freaking react had a threesome
if they had a threesome and they
basically came in and just you know went
crazy then real came out it was like a
bad baby that nobody wanted that was too
late to basically have an abortion for
so I'm sorry I'm sorry I'd to get over
too far but that was a funny line but
yet so people just love it because it's
new there's really no other reason about
it and people is like oh yeah but you
know view is like this one this let's
highlight this yeah this I like this
thing is like hey you know freaking UJS
is moving to the native native
apps just like react native way and what
a leave I was using to create weeks
which I've tried and it works like
like nobody's talking about this thing
right nobody's talking about the fact
that this thing works like that's
just my opinion
all right and that's a pretty honest
opinion
alright so react is idea for almost any
platform which is true you can even do
virtual reality would react like there's
so much that you could do now
there's the thing that people think
they're like oh react has a steep
learning curve it takes a long time to
learn it well it's a brand new system of
course I'm gonna take a little while
right you're most people got to learn
you know how to use bundlers how to use
something like what pack either gulp or
grunt or they have to also you know
learn about you know JSX
which people really hate JSX
if we
back down here somewhere let me see
where is it the first thing this person
says is I hate JSX with a passion so you
hate JSX if you guys read through this
whole thing for one main reason number
one they change class to class name they
change style to be basically that you
gotta put in um ie colas and object
your salary you're working with
JavaScript you should be thankful that
there's something like JSX because the
most annoying thing is when you're
having to coding and something like in
JavaScript and then now you have to go
jump into the view with say hey where's
my angular templates did I V bind it
with something do you understand how
retarded that is and that's just
that's just my opinion because I
actually know JavaScript which is
another thing is like if you're a brand
new developer I understand why you will
want to use view if you only been around
I don't know for six months I understand
why you want to learn with you yes I
understand is the same reason I tell
people hey learn with jQuery it's super
easy for somebody that doesn't know
JavaScript and you could go in there and
create something but not knowing
JavaScript right you can go and create
 something amazing with huge ax
we're not knowing JavaScript which
brings in a lot of problems because
later on you realize hey I can create
this the right way hey we didn't use the
best practices hey Oh somebody help we
don't know what to do because we created
this and in view Jas where there's
barely any documentation I mean there's
good documentation from them but there's
barely any you know compared to react
when you search online all the questions
that you could ever imagine have already
been answered
alright so I don't know
that's my opinion right now let's see
let's keep looking man this another
thing that people don't like about it
it's like it uses a lot of intermediate
advanced JavaScript concepts right so
it's like if you don't understand
objects react is not for you if you
don't understand how this keyword works
it's not ready for you if you don't
understand how functional programming is
not really for you it's more I will say
for it's an intermediate to advanced
developers developers will have been
around in a long time working as you
know JavaScript developers web
developers or even people who are coming
for other languages they love react
because if you know how to programming
you're an experienced developer you're
going to be doing great
if you're a brand new developer yeah
it's time for you to learn it's time for
you to go and bust your ass learn all
these things that are here go to having
my description this of course that's
named understanding the weird parts of
JavaScript right javascript in the weird
parts something like that it's on my
description right so for you guys that
don't understand those concepts my
advice is guys learn JavaScript stop
trying to learn a framework that's gonna
make your life easier just to say hey I
could rebind this to rebind that and
there could compute this to compute that
know learn JavaScript learn how you know
functional programming works learn
object-oriented programming learn es6
just learn the language itself in
general right stop trying to find all
this you know this frameworks that put
like a extra layer in front of
JavaScript like for a long time people
were doing that with jQuery and there's
so many developers I'm not even lying to
you guys I keep bumping into people who
who do like you know WordPress themes or
or they come in and do like
little website for different clients and
their JavaScript looked horrible because
they don't know JavaScript what they
know is take query and then you say oh
yeah I could do this three jQuery I
could search online how to you know put
a slider plug-in into my page and that's
it I got a slider known learn how to
code it yourself that's my problem with
vgs plus the fact of UGS is pretty much
a copy a really bad copy of react that's
my problem you know and I just keep
saying this to you guys like do you
support the original do you support the
one that basically changed the game
right or do you support the other the
knockoff does the one that you find in
you know right next to the you know
Louie Vuitton fake bags outside of the
street which one do you support do you
support the low return back that's in
the store or do you support the one that
cost $50 at the corner which one do you
want it's easier to go and get that
little $50 bag and say oh I love it on
but what about the original one the one
that took you know hundreds of hours to
you know perfect that that stitching on
that bag and it's coming you know coming
to you live from you know Italy in
smells brand-new or do you want the $50
one from the corner you know what I mean
like if I'm gonna developer I wouldn't
be trying to find shortcuts and that's
what view is a lot of people are loving
view because it's such a shortcut it's
such a basically it's like such a
framework that's so easy to get into
just like jQuery and yes that's great
but how about you learn JavaScript how
about you put in those extra hours right
how about you go in and start learning
JavaScript instead of trying to find a
shortcut to thing
now let's read this this is from
somebody who basically he likes
JavaScript he likes react he basically
said even if react eventually becomes
outdated I'm not going to have any
regrets about learning it because I
walked away knowing way more than I knew
about JavaScript when I started and
that's the truth if it wasn't for react
I wouldn't have been this good in
JavaScript like I'm really really good
guys I'm really good like and
this is over almost two years almost
three years of just working with react
from the beginning like beta
I've been around since like beta you
know like way before they even released
it so I would say it's like I will say
guys like you I don't know man like
people are jumping on this thing and I
just don't understand it I don't
understand it
because it's like man stop looking for a
shortcut learn JavaScript
if you jes is not going to solve all
your problems right and I have no
problem with giving you what is the
evening you even yo I don't knows how
you see is his name how you pronounce it
but another thing that brings me in like
it X my blood because I'm a long time
laravel user and one thing that laravel
did what people I don't know if they
notice or realize this they basically
forced of UJS on people so I remember
when Jeffrey Wade I think this is named
different way from narrowcast
started basically putting out tutorials
on view on the first view and I'm like
wait this thing is exactly like angular
why is this being promoted or lair
right why is this thing being promoted
on laravel and at first it was fine
because it was like an extra extra
tutorial that they had on Larry cast
like nobody care nobody watched it um
somehow I can imagine like he skimmed it
he basically got everybody from Lera
to jump on in like all guys you know
what um basically we have high colors we
have react we have angular we can make
our name even bigger than what it is
because now whatever you name VJ s you
got a name laravel so laravel is getting
so much promotion out of this too
everywhere you go is like hey VJ s
laravel right so they basically schemed
it and forced all other users to have to
use basically view Jay s it comes with
the framework now there's no other
framework that's using you know a
specific front-end framework that I know
of that I know if I don't see any other
framework that does that but laravel
which is a PHP back back in framework
decided to say hey we're going to add
PJs right and you guys gonna have to eat
it so yeah so that's one of the problems
that I have with this and it's just like
when there is like so much BS behind the
scenes of this that people need to be
honest with themselves there's so much
promotion on this and it's not because
it's the best it's because of the idea
that hey there's this guy and it's this
Chinese guy who used to work at Google
and somehow you know he copied the first
one view one was a copy of angular ain't
nobody say anything and then somehow
he's good now and you know view Jas is a
level
PJs on Alibaba and there's a whole bunch
of Chinese companies using it which we
don't know that we don't see anywhere
where there's major companies using it
then nobody's using vue.js right now
there's a thing where I said let me see
because I forgot to highlight it okay I
like this real quick let's see how I
like this sorry guys we just got a
highlight it damn it
the JavaScript is not working that good
they need react okay so um basically
says react is very popular it's been
around longer it's likely more
businesses have used react keep that in
mind if you're in the market for a new
job right now right that's one thing
that nobody tells you nobody tells you
that for a new developer there's really
no jobs for pjs UJS is like something
that everybody's talking around the
internet is it's like cool it's become
like a meme UJS is like a meme to
angular and react it's like the mean
that everybody keeps passing around you
know it's like when Drake released that
that video of him dancing and everybody
started putting pokeballs and a whole
bunch of on it that's what View has
become for angular and react it's a mean
you know everything like is a mean on
the internet everybody talks about it
but nobody's using it on any major
company alright people who's going to
drive would get laughs paint skate
laravel I don't know who here is
thinking that get laughs it's a huge
company who here is thinking like
laravel is accused company I don't know
yeah tell me yeah tell me when we start
seeing Nike or
let's see when you start seeing
something like let's see another company
that I could respect um I don't know
because like auto major companies like
Google Facebook all of them are using
react and angular like yes they own it
but every other company that's at that
level that's what they use it nobody is
using VJ s now if you're a brand new
developer and you're gonna get hired in
a in the shop in the digital agency
nobody cares you could use whatever
technology you want so you can go in
there and use view J s because nobody
cares right but when you go to a major
company ain't nobody using view GS on
their website and that's something that
you gotta keep in mind so just how the
line says keep that in mind if you're in
the market for a new job Raider because
if you're looking for a job and you
don't know react or angular and you're
gonna come in with hey guys let me me
Josh yeah I stay already I stay on you
know what's the other one
the hacker hacker noon and not hacking
isn't on hacker and list or whatever I
stay on there and you know all I do all
day is upvote view J as videos and news
and but I don't know react or angular
can you hire me you're not gonna get
that job it's that simple right you're
just not gonna get it because there's so
many other people that know angular and
react that now that's actually a
disability for you that's a handicap for
you you know what I mean like knowing
few GS and not knowing are angular or
react is like you hurting yourself kick
alright so don't believe the hype there
is a lot of hype behind
thing it's not that great guys and it's
not that bad I will say it's not that
great and it's not that bad if that
makes sense but we have to be honest
with ourselves if a company is going to
basically invest time into a framework
and say hey what framework we're going
to support for the next five years you
know we're going to have on our website
most likely they're gonna choose react
or angular alright and they're not going
to choose for UJ s UJ s is like
something that's on the internet if UJ s
is a meme on the Internet
all right guys so choose wisely don't go
over whatever you see online and think
that hey this is the best thing for me
it's easy it's very easy I don't even
know JavaScript where I can do something
crate on V buying this and B buying that
alright kids I'll see you later
Wow I just want to say thank you for
