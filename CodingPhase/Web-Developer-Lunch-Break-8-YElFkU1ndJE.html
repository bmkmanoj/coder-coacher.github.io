back at it again : face.com you dig we
in here in a rainy ass day you know it's
supposed to be summer but I don't know
close to summer or something like that
but it's just cold and raining let's see
what skill everybody how are you guys
without Matt what up crime is what up
crusader what's good man
how's everything your boy kicked
greatness was good
Neil what up you guys know my web
developer lunch breaks head I'll look
what up not interrupting a rocky stack
iron supper of the Iraqi stack you
actually doing it let me find out I
think a lot we will be like y'all I'm
doing this right now they're probably
just playing some video games Chris Tran
what up
Santee Reisman she is from Uruguay
camasta me hermano D got me boy bye yeah
bye solo pronto
Lea dead oh let's see Jerome what I what
I what up you eating your dinner at this
time what time is it over is like
probably like six seven o'clock yeah man
and tonight is another video coming out
it's called a refactor so it's the code
that we was working on um the beef store
but a guy refactored all right which was
what I was gonna do in the beginning if
people let me do it yeah so I wanted to
show you guys how to basically refactor
your code just to go back in there and
start working on it and then tomorrow
you should be receiving other tutorials
and definitely I'm gonna create all the
other pages 'im on this tutorial from
today I believe I created the gallery
page which is the lookbook
so that should be up tonight and then
tomorrow it should be the man and women
pages for the paint for the store pages
right and then from there I don't know
if I should just jump right away and to
react or jump right away into Lara bells
so I'll let you guys know for sure I'm
gonna figure it out today
I mean three videos at once
it's ioss with hard to learn what's your
opinion I think to me the programming
languages are not hard like swift swift
is easy the problem is to think like app
developer like I don't know like for me
the process of creating an app is so
much different than you know doing web
development and it's like really
annoying to me like I tried a I've given
it a try a couple of times already and
every time I tried it I'm just like man
I'm not interesting you know even game
development I try to do game development
I try to learn unity and I'm like oh I
don't like unity I tried learning on
most other Unreal Engine um I didn't
like it either
what else and then now I'm trying to
learn this thing called fazer GS which
is JavaScript on game engine and I'm
gonna say I'm not like I'm not thrilled
about it you know it's like I like web
development you know I like creating
pages like I like creating pages and by
creating features for users so you know
I guess I'm just a web developer
so I like the Reuben sandwich mmm not
really
it's only a certain type of sandwich
that I like you know I like everything
it's just not everything that I eat is
gonna be good for me you know so I try
to eat stuff that's gonna be good for me
yeah game development is pretty annoying
I think if I was to just do I don't know
like game development it's not that bad
it's just there's so much pieces to it
yeah some of your email check out your
portfolio send me an email coding face
at gmail.com I will tell you what it is
I'll tell you how if it's good if it's
nothing something that needs to get
fixed I'll let you know oh you know I
don't even want to get up today today it
was like one of those days where you
just cuddled up I always just cuddled up
with my girlfriend it was like rubbing
my stomach feeling the baby move around
like that saying that's what I wanted to
do today what do you think about
programmers with depression I think we
all have that we all have some type of
depression or some type of anxiety like
me I get anxiety um I'm not like
depressed you know I didn't get the
press like that you know like my sister
passed away I was a little bit depressed
in the beginning of the year but then
from there I realized I'm like yo I have
a lot of good things happening you know
God knows what he's doing it's out of my
hands you know I couldn't save my sister
I couldn't do anything about it so I was
gonna get the press for it I was upset
but I just try to keep myself busy and
then I kept on doing YouTube so pretty
much I moved on past but I do get
anxiety I do get anxiety of like if I
have a lot of going on at the same
time I can't deal with it you know I
can't deal with with having too much a
responsibility at one shot like one
thing at a time my god I like to spread
things out I don't like to do everything
in one day
because then I'll get anxiety you know
so what happened to my sister my sister
um she had died diabetes I guess nobody
knows something happened with her
pancreas wait I forgot the name of it
it's not like it's like pancreatitis or
some like that but it just happened
out of nowhere like yes we know and our
family people have from our father's
side have diabetes but you know you
never think people die off this thing
like you think all yeah somebody might
have diabetes whatever we never really
pay attention to it and then in December
4 on Christmas Day my sister got sick
and she just basically got really sick
her stomach hurt a lot and then we took
her to the hospital and then when we got
to the hospital there like go all her
organs are shutting down I'm like what
the hell like she was just good and
they're like yeah she's she heard was it
her sugar levels are very very high like
extremely high I think I was like your
regular levels are supposed to be under
120 her levels was at 1400 and nobody
knew about it and she was like feeling
weak on the day before Christmas they
had taken her to the hospital in the
hospital said oh you're fine they never
even checked her blood pressure or not
no pressure her blood levels and then on
Sunday for Christmas Christmas Day then
she was just like you're long gone
saying it was too late you know and
that's what happened I wasn't there I
was I had moved out from my house
already so it was just her my mom's my
mom and her friend that were home you
know so pres my since I could imagine my
sister even though she was probably
feeling sick she didn't tell nobody like
oh I'm feeling sick you know to not
worry anybody me up call me or
whatever you want to call me I get a
little pain I'm like oh my god I'm dying
help me like that's how I am when it
comes to that I don't play no games
I'm a drama queen like I'll go to the
hospital like I'm dying help
like I don't care have no shame in it
but my sister she was the type of person
that she was like very strong she even
though she might be feeling the sake
whatever she's not gonna act like she's
sick she's just gonna be like okay
whatever I'm I'm here maybe I'm sick
maybe I'm not you know
yeah so that's what happened to my
sister you know I love diagram that was
my little sister but yeah go into any
positive and something else something
positive right you ever think about
getting into artificial intelligence yes
but the thing about it is that AI you
gotta there's too much into it it's not
just like you know it's not produce
programming it's like you gotta be
really good at math you gotta do a whole
bunch of tests like there's so much
behind AI that for me it doesn't catch
my interest you know
can you do a video breaking down your
career like I know you were when you
went to college but to what level when
you got to the IT job how long were you
there before starting a development um
yeah I could make a video about that you
know what I've been wanting to do ever
wanted to do drove my lifetime video I'm
trying to find somebody who could do it
somebody who who actually drove my life
for me like they'll be hot
I gotta find I gotta see maybe on Fiverr
or I could find somebody who could draw
it for me
you know do you think is possible to get
jobs as a teenager yes there's a whole
bunch of jobs if you check on Craigslist
there's a whole bunch of people that put
gigs so they'll be like oh I need
somebody to come fix my page or I will
need somebody to do this and that you
know apply to those or send them emails
I'm gonna hang I could edit your page I
could build your page you know whatever
the gig says do it you know because you
already know how to build a page so you
might as well get those little freelance
gigs until you're ready you know until
you're like 18 then you start applying
for jobs you know
how about Big Data yeah Big Data school
I was trying to get into Hadoop at one
time do spark but as I I don't have time
for that I don't have time to you know
there's so many cool things going on out
there that I just don't have time for
you know like Steven grata just created
a course for electron right he liked to
run GIS and I've been trying to make or
play around with electron and learn it
but I don't have the time I bought the
course I have it there one of these days
I'm gonna start it but for now I can't
because I don't have time you know what
part of New York Long Island man Long
Island I'm in Long Island kick is your
programming journey gonna end I worked
there for summer or you gotta branch out
to something else I don't know I think I
feel I've already hit the top of of like
as far as my career like where would I
go next I think is owning my own
business like right now everything that
I'm doing right now is saving money to
buy a new house and then from there
after I buy this new house is all the
money that I'm putting in is to open up
my own business
yep if you do a gig for somebody or
freelance or freelance or oDesk or
Craigslist make sure you get paid for
half of your money upfront you know and
then the other half they pay you after
because some people they tell you oh
yeah could you build me this could you
build me that and then you start
building it in like a week later you
don't here for them and you're like wait
I just put in 1015 hours into
your website whatta hell you at and then
they won't pick up your phone sometimes
 like that happens you know so at
least if that situation happens you're
like it I got paid you half you
know
is it possible to make a whole web
application just no js' and MongoDB yeah
of course what do you think about moving
countries moving countries for what the
what what what does that mean what do
what do you think about moving countries
for a web development do you mean moving
to another country for a web development
job I think that's great you know I
always tell people they think like only
here in the United States they're gonna
have opportunities like it's not that's
not true like you know there's a whole
bunch of other countries in the world
countries in Latin America countries in
in Europe countries in Asia that need
programmers developers and you can find
jobs out there you know so if you can't
get a visa to come to the u.s. apply to
Europe if you can get a visa to apply to
Latin America
you know there's Mexico this Brazil this
Colombia
there's Argentina there's what else
that's the Dominican Republic you can
apply to you know it's not going to be
the same type of money that you get here
but you could have even a better
lifestyle in those countries than here
because here like you know for you to
live like let's say like a king meaning
like live really really good you need to
have at least three hundred four hundred
thousand dollars a year you know those
people that earn that much money they
live like kings they they live
in the big houses they live you know
they get to own the really expensive
cars they get to go on vacation whenever
they want those people are really good
you know a hundred thousand what I'm
earning right now is good it's above
average that's what I call it I call it
above average you know
I mean like you know you go have a
little Mercedes you could have money in
your bank you don't have to worry about
oh I gotta pay rent that's you know
that's the type of lifestyle I live
right now I'm comfortable but I'm not
rich I'm not you know living the rich
life now there's people who live in
Argentina people who live in Colombia
people who live in Spain you know they
pretty much they don't need that much
money like here like you could if you
earned in those countries if you earn
$50,000 a year you live like a king
because the average is like twenty
thousand thirty thousand dollars a year
so if you earn it 50,000 60,000 you're
living way above average you know you
know so that's the thing you got to
start looking at the big picture not
just here in the US you think that
you're gonna find the best jobs like I
think matter of fact yeah I'm wrong
about that here you might find the best
jobs like you know the best companies
and top companies in the world when it
comes to tech but in other countries you
could live a better lifestyle than here
in the US I'm not a fan of flex boxes
why because flex boxes don't working
every browser right in the companies
that I've worked for you still gotta
take care of Internet Explorer if you
still got to take care of Internet
Explorer then you know that flex boxes
are not good for it because a lot of
times this glitch is this that
 up right so that's why I haven't
really been using it for the past few
years
flex boxes have become something that's
popular online and everybody wants to be
like oh yeah use flex boxes for this dis
in this but in real life people don't
use flex boxes
in companies they don't use flex boxes
Google don't use flex boxes Facebook
don't use flexbox because they have to
target a wider audience like it's not
just the people with the latest chrome
you know the latest chrome version or
the latest laptop you know when you have
to work for a company that has to take
care for a whole bunch of different
users then you can't use flex boxes now
what I probably use in the future you
know get more comfortable with it yeah
but at the moment right now
I just don't use it because in my
companies you you're not supposed to use
it so I haven't become very comfortable
with it
yes try to learn those try to learn with
Colt look cold steel's course is great
because it teaches you HTML CSS
JavaScript gives you a little taste of
bootstrap and Efrain it shows you know
GS and JavaScript right that's great
it teaches you that now when you're
ready to say okay I already know the
front-end I want to jump to the backend
I want to be able to learn our databases
and you gotta jump to PHP in my sequel
like I'm being honest don't let nobody
tell you like Oh PHP is that this isn't
that listen people hate on it because
they've been developing for years
you guys are brand new developers you
guys y'all don't have an option to
choose like hey I want to join us do or
you know I want to just do a Java all I
want to do is Python no you don't have
that option because you need to get a
first job before you even start thinking
like oh I'm a great developer and I
could choose whatever company I
want no you don't you got to think about
it like this and also bring you guys
down but this hot dog when I was coming
up I was like girl I ain't I'm
nothing I'm nobody
nobody knows me I'm a brand new
developer I'm teaching myself all this
stuff I'm learning in my house why would
anybody hire me that's how you gotta
think about it
right so when you think like that you
don't have this grandiose a thing over
your hand there's no chip on your
shoulder
how a lot of people have that they think
like oh I just learned how to become a
web developer and now you know our
co-star applying to Google
no you idiot you're not gonna
even get a scepter not even your emails
gonna be automatically blocked because
you don't even have enough experience
you know what I mean so for you guys
just learn PHP you're gonna be great
you're gonna be able to get a job right
away either for WordPress either for
drupal either for
just maintaining somebody's website
that's all you care about you care about
being able to get money in your pocket
while you continue to learn and that's
what P is peaking all for you right
you're not going to get hired as a Ruby
or rails developer if you have no
experience if you have not least if you
don't have at least a year and a half
you're not gonna get hired and also make
sure you don't PHP
us I work in New York man what stadium
seeing Conan face rocky stickers and
vinyl yeah now I was thinking about
doing that I'm gonna do that
at some point I'm okay um I'm gonna get
some hoodies done for sure what do you
think about the and re CSS great layer I
don't know what that means
what do you think about bootstrap for
bootstrap for is good it's cool it's the
same as bootstrap now only
differences use some flex boxes that's
it you know
I'm snapping now I'm just saying like I
like guys you see like Khurana says
screw PHP no notice better that's the
problem the problem is I I want crown is
crowning
do you have a job as a web developer
Rena can you answer us that question
we're going to wait for Cronus I want to
know if he's working as a developer Rena
cron is we're waiting on you man do you
work as a developer we're waiting on you
cron is cronniss I'm waiting on you do
you wait do you work as a developer okay
we're gonna safely say that he don't
right so if he doesn't work as a
developer and he hasn't been hired yes
you can learn no GS yes you can learn
the basics once you know JavaScript you
understand no GS because it's written in
JavaScript you can learn that at any
moment right now for him to go for an
interview and try to get hired as an OG
as developer and I'm not talking about
junior developer because people again
this completely wrong you get hired into
a company as a junior developer and then
just because they're using nodejs in
their stack doesn't means that your are
no js' developer an OG is developers -
person who's creating the stack creating
the rest API the one dealing with the
database creating a or you know
user authentication with
Passport
dealing with MongoDB that's the
you know the nodejs developer you're
just a junior developer if you're just
there working on little pages and then
somehow they're stacking Singh nodejs
that does not make you a no js'
developer right now for you take it
higher so no js' developer you gotta
have more than a year and a half and
most of the time they want somebody with
more than three years who does Java
Script you're not going to get hired
right away
that's it sometimes you you might see
situations where people get get hired
and then I oh here oh this person got
hired as a junior developer right away
in a nodejs and this and that know
sometimes companies they they are in
such a need of developers that they
might hire you but that might just be a
luck that's some from luck you know
what I mean like we all have a little
chip that's called luck
on top of us you might have a little bit
of extra luck than other people when you
get higher into a situation like that
but I don't deal with luck I deal with
I'll make my life how I want it so if I
want to say I want to get hired tomorrow
as a developer I'm gonna learn PHP so I
could get hired tomorrow you know like
III I swear I gotta make a video about
this because I just talked about this
yesterday in my life video I'm like we
have to create two different situations
there's two different situation
where's like hey number one there's a
dream job that we all have we all want
that dream job
meaning hey we love Python hey we love
Ruby on Rails hey we love our goal and
hey we love Krystal lang whatever it is
that's our dream job well are we gonna
get that dream job most likely
not
that's the reality of things life that's
how life is you guys have to be
realistic and that's what I'm here for
you guys I'm here to just be real
because everybody here is going to come
to you and give you all you guys should
learn this you guys should learn that
they're not being honest with you
they're not telling you that hey you
might live in Minnesota where no
company uses nodejs you might live in
Wyoming you might live in um in
Kansas you might live in what's
the another city you might live in
Cincinnati you might live in
Springfield Massachusetts where nobody
uses nodejs right so what
happens if you put in all your
eggs into that basket and you're like
all I want to do is to learn nodejs
what happens there then you become a
 sad story on the internet of
like oh my god I went to this boot camp
and we study nodejs
and it's like you dumb there's
nobody hiring in your area for no js'
you know what I mean and then people
come in here and be like
oh no J yes this isn't that and it's
like your area don't even hire
 junior developers for no genius
so why are you even worried about nodejs
you know what I mean like no js' is good
to half under the wing and say okay I
have that under my wing but when you say
hey I want to get hired tomorrow you got
a you better be studying PHP or
c-sharp I'm being honest like that's
where you're going to find jobs right
away I just want you guys to be
realistic with things man we have to be
honest with each other and just be like
yo you know what
life is a bitch right so if you know
life is a bitch right and she's not a
nice bitch you know it's not a nice
place that gives you some good top this
it's like a messed-up bitch that just
 every time you want to do
something she's gonna bite you in
your neck that's that's how life
is right so if you know that then why
wouldn't you try to put yourself in a
situation where you know you're gonna
win no matter what PHP is a win no
matter what for junior developers now
once you have over a year of experience
in a company not freelancing not doing
this and that in a company then you have
the option to say you know what I'm a
study nodejs you know what i'ma do
Python you know what I'm gonna do go
because you're gonna get in right away
but if you have no years of experience
you just like some random dude
you're Joe Schmo the truck
driver and you're like you know what
today I've decided to take a course on
udemy and I just wanna you know become a
web developer and somehow I'm gonna get
hired what a shitty portfolio with not
doing enough projects real life projects
and you think you're gonna get hired
people don't hire people like that
randomly I'm being honest because then
you come up online and you're like oh my
god
this is there's no jobs for web
developers out here and it's not that
it's that you gotta have a lower
expectation of things you gotta be able
to say hey what are the easiest way for
me to get into the industry once you're
in the industry you could do whatever
the hell you want the biggest barrier is
getting hired that first time then after
that you're going to be good after that
you could do whatever the hell you want
so if the easiest way to get into the
industry is PHP why wouldn't you want to
do it because somebody on the internet
say oh this is wack because a developer
who's been developing for you know ten
years who could get any job out there
tells you on YouTube hey go learn Python
go learn or golang go learn
 nodejs those guys they're not
being honest with you guys because the
same way how they do tutorials where
they expect you to know things is the
same way what they're giving you advice
they're giving advice to people who are
already in the industry and you as a
brand new developer like oh man
I don't know John Smith whatever he said
 that nodejs is the best and PHP
is and then when you go start
applying to jobs and nobody keeps
calling you you're like what the I
thought that nodejs is what I needed to
do but then there's no jobs for it it's
like hey dummy
you should've just study PHP you
should have just got hired for six
months and then after you got hired for
six months apply to a no js' job then
it's like come on man you gotta use your
brain guys I'm trying to help you guys
but if you don't put part of your of you
to like you know like you gotta use your
brain too
no Matt you got a man you got a freaking
you got a learn PHP man PHP is easy once
you know JavaScript PHP is the same
this variable says if stair instance
loops it's the same okay your crowd
is your Java developer so you work as a
Java developer do you work at a company
right and how long because you have to
tell people your background into this
because you got to understand a lot of
these people here they're not developers
that been around for a long time so you
have to give your your background so
they could also understand that hey cron
is when Crowder says hey PHP is and
nodejs is the best is because he's
already been a developer for awhile and
you know you could go and jump to
another job and start applying for
nodejs jobs right away and get hired
right but for these guys here on this
chat room a lot of them they've never
even gone to our interview so when you
tell them hey all I know is no js' and
oh all you need is no js' then you're
doing a disservice to them I know you
don't mean in a bad way but it's not
helping them you know like that's why I
created this channel because I want to
just be real with people I don't want to
 sell them a dream and tell them
I hey just do this this and that
well yeah man guys I gotta go I gotta
 eat I just used up my half my
whole lunch break what you guys
now I gotta eat right away like
in two seconds raining out here
I gotta come out with a little briella
you see that's whining I need myself a
 uh I need a rolls-royce phantom
man cuz you come out with your little
umbrella ready all right guys listen
cronniss good seeing you again but just
make sure whenever you leave a comment
like that give people a background on
you so they could know like hey he's
talking from a experienced developer you
know it's like me I could say PHP is
 because I'm already in the industry
I could come in and say this is
PHP is alright and it's boring
alright I can say that because I've
already been doing this for years now
right but for brand new junior
developers PHP is a blessing because
it's gonna get you in the industry you
dig you know that's what I have to say
kids I'll see you guys later
you already knows your boy Joe make sure
whenever you see anybody cloning my
cloning my formats cloning my swag
cloning my the way how I do things on
their channel coding my own call them
out and be like yo stop cloning Joe Joe
said stop cloning him alright you leave
yeah yeah I want you guys to have it
whenever you see anything that anybody's
doing the same that I'm doing the
same type of life videos that I'm doing
whenever you see anybody is trying to
 promotion I do it do that I
