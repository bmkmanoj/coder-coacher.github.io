back at it again man coding phase calm
listen boys back I didn't get it again
alright yeah we in here man
we gotta wait until a couple of the
viewers start coming in you know
answering questions and talking back
with the community but I just want to
say man we're back by popular demand
right I've been gone for what like two
days or something like that
I actually pre-recorded a couple of
videos whatever videos you guys have
been watching for the past two three
days
those are pre-recorded videos I haven't
done no live shows or or anything you
know I think since I thirsty your watch
Saturday so I was like two days of not
doing anything and if you miss you guys
well I miss my viewers I mean my my
squad I mean like people all right so I
miss you nice man and I had to come back
but I've been super busy with Conan
face.com
we're pumping out content man constantly
man you know new videos for courses I
just finished right now the HTML course
right now I started on the new jQuery
and JavaScript course that I'm creating
oh yeah that's what we got right now man
we're doing the JavaScript and jQuery
and just building coaching right
building cool shit and you know by
probably the man people asking me Joe
hey you know we you know it's kind of
messed up that the other day you only
did the 50% off for for everybody all
right for everybody that was there on
July 4 for it you know it was like from
July 1st to July 5th so there was a lot
of people who I left out I missed out on
the opportunity so I actually just
created a link specific for my YouTube
audience where
I decided you know what I'm going to
give you guys 50% off of everything that
I don't no matter what if you come from
that Lake that means if you come from my
description videos or if you come from
my description videos and you click on
my website automatically you're gonna
get 50% off um the people are finding
from you to mean the people that find me
and Skillshare the people that find me
in Pluralsight there is no 50% off for
them because they're not part of this
community of developers here on YouTube
right so in the long run I probably lose
money what who cares
you know what I mean like who cares you
know what's important is that we get
people on it and get people on actually
watching the tutorials and basically
learning from the courses that's what's
really important to me so you know if
you find me from YouTube that's like my
gift to you guys the code that I'm
putting is it's basically whenever you
want to register my website you put him
from YouTube that's the code right so
I'm putting on the chatroom
and that's what we have to do from
YouTube I mean and I hate your coming
from youtube so here you go that's it
that's the link to it for everybody that
wants to come and ya know cuz there's no
point of me not giving you guys you know
because sometimes people come in and
they they watch my channel and they
watch it like once every 2 days or once
every 3 days and sometimes they you know
it kind of messes up it kind of messes
up right for them so they're like man I
missed something
three days ago right there was a sale
three days ago there was like a special
three days ago and I missed it or like I
created a new project and people don't
know what it files that and I'm talking
about it here with you guys because they
missed it right so I'm like let's just
make it easier for people it's like King
if you go to my website
you register through it all you have to
put in as the code is from YouTube right
so you found it from YouTube that's it
alright it's only make it easy for you
guys and yeah man I'd better talk
that'll God ask me are you from New York
yes I am up from Queens New York a
little town called Richwood yes a little
town called Richard right next to
Bushwick right next to Glendale and
right next to Maspeth right that's where
I'm from in New York City do I live
there now no I don't I haven't lived
there in like 3 years 3 4 years or even
more maybe since 2000 and some 2011 that
was the last time I lived in Richard but
that's where I grew up at so if you want
to know where I'm from that's where from
yeah man
where it's my Tim's word yeah man so
let's go with everybody man how's
everybody doing what you guys are up to
you know they got I want to know how how
are the viewers read how are you guys
doing I don't have you guys been working
on any any courses anybody found some
cool courses on udemy or or anywhere
else or like what's going on with the
community right I want to know I
actually want to know what exactly you
guys are up to
you know so let me see Quentin's store
said your Joe your logo looks like
SitePoint
let me check side point
take point I mean you got the brackets
it doesn't look anything like all we'd
have his brackets alright that's what we
really have besides that there's really
nothing on it that looks like white
money right no one even the colors are
completely different it's a whole
different swag man Jerome Smith is at
the MongoDB section of cold steel nice
yeah no story I know cooking I know you
got me it's fine it's fine don't worry
about it let me see
NIF what's this guy's name names dass
sie das anna says hi was about to sleep
or so so this right that's what's up man
stay up man way from nymph oh you wanna
say your name I'm sorry lived a sock
were you from I gotta say API part on
coast course nice a drift DM says I
disagree with you regarding your take on
the Indian computer science student and
then he did the right thing and I think
he probably did the right thing for that
situation you know I was like he wants
to go to college if he wants to go to
college study something that that
matters I agree with you with that right
but at the same time if he knew that he
wanted to get in some front-end
development why waste four years when in
reality all he needed to do was just
like start looking into web development
right if you like front-end and you like
creating UI and also designing things
why waste your time four years is a long
time
if you waste four years look look what
I'm at right
look where I got into and for five years
you know what I mean
so if I would have been like Oh instead
of me actually wanted to go apply to
work or decided to learn on my own what
if I would is gonna you know what I'm
gonna study computer science now like
you know what I'm really like that
sounds crazy that's a waste of time he
could have learned on his own
I'm sorry got about freaking a bunch of
text messages don't see one else hey
wifey hey me up you yeah man just got
lost in PJs recommended
could I recommend the YouTube you guess
man come on you gotta listen guys start
working with react men if you working
with UJS man I'm telling you right now
ahead of ahead of time like there is no
jobs for vue.js guys no companies
looking for somebody to do huge a s I'm
being honest that's like something
that's cool on the internet is cool for
personal projects but no company no
major company is gonna put their stamp
behind UJ s because UJ s it's not
angular and it's not react they don't
have Google and they don't have facebook
you know when a a company decides to put
you know all their the eggs in one
basket they want to make sure that
basket comes from somewhere and it's not
some some shit coming up from somebody's
basement you know what I mean they want
to know like hey are they gonna be
supporting this for the next five to ten
years because sometimes you create a
program or a web app right in general
right you create a web app and that web
that it's like you got a fucking
maintainer for the next five to ten
years nobody's going to add a new
technology to it
so if they're going to do that they're
going to stick to whatever is the most
safe word which is either angular or
react right so yeah can't wait to finish
a move to JavaScript where parts yeah
man now screw the where parts is very
very intense very intense I'll tell you
that much
okay so I don't know what you trying to
say he's ain't not looking for it just
for a job overgrowth Joe like you what
worry talking about this respective boy
I'm not broke if I was to show you my
bank account
you'd be like oh he's doing good you
know I'm not broke a um why if you're
not doing it for a job and you're not
doing it for money I don't know what the
fuck you're doing it for because I don't
know what the hell you doing with you
like me I don't do anything if I'm not
pink getting paid for it you know what I
mean but that's you anyways man let me
see your own Smith : face are we going
to finish this store yes we are gonna
finish the store that's going to be part
of laravel right so pretty much
everybody who has been watching the bait
store the big store the tutorial or how
to create the HTML CSS I mean it's
complete right now I give you a little
bit of taste of the reaction right but
I'm going to do that I'm gonna take that
same HTML I'm going to create the
laravel tutorial out of that so out of
that if we can lay out the whole design
that's what's gonna beat the laravel
tutorial but I wrote to Tory elizabe
Oconee faced comments kind of be on
udemy is going to be on Skillshare is
going to be on Pluralsight so you got
for it websites where you could get it
right if you're a subscriber from my
channel you could get it for five
dollars on my on my website right you
could go to you to me and get it when
they do specials for ten dollars you
could go to Skillshare and sign up and I
think is 20 dollars or something like
that fifteen twenty dollars a month
and you basically is like Netflix right
so you got a whole bunch of courses
there now you got Pluralsight which is
like 30 something dollars or $39 I don't
know per month and you basically get of
course all right now I would tell
everybody that is either of your minds
either get it from my website gonna face
comm for $4 or buy it from you to me
when you see it on special for $10
that's what I'm gonna you know cuz I
understand also to apologize Jerome you
know it's not that over here I want to
be like money hungry but it's like I'm
doing tutorials that is gonna take a
long time to create and only like a few
people actually take the tutorials here
the ones that are free even people that
signed up for my website they registered
to the website and I could see I can
track them I can track how long they
watch how long do they you know continue
watching and what time do they stop and
the reality of things is most of the
people that that come from here from you
too don't do the tutorials people run a
half or easy route right like you I know
you've been doing the tutorials or
you've been busting your ass but a lot
of people they like oh you know they
want to become what developers but then
they don't do it right so for me to put
it here on YouTube for only five people
to watch it it doesn't make sense now if
I put it on udemy or Pluralsight or
Skillshare people that go there they pay
for it what they do the tutorials on my
payment is not really the father out of
ten dollars that's not even the painting
that I'm getting my paint minions if I
bust my ass creating this tutorials I
want to be able to see that people are
actually doing in completing the
tutorials not just like oh they watch
one video and then I oh I'm gonna go
back to it two weeks later and they
never get back to it cuz then it's like
I'm basically creating tutorials that
are complicating take me a long time
for no reason for only five six people
you know it doesn't make sense
I'd rather create it in a platform where
thousands of people are going to take it
and you know I was like I feel like you
know discourses and it's like I don't
know it's a fucking work that you put in
you know I imagine fucking Picasso or
whoever whatever artist
you fucking fill in the blank right
create something that's amazing
and then only three people know that is
amazing right he's gonna get discouraged
he's gonna back I'm not putting this
shit here you know but if he puts it in
a fucking major in a major art gallery
where everybody's gonna fucking see it
and people are gonna be like they gonna
appreciate it
then that's why that person is going to
do it that's what I'm doing right now
I'm basically just puttin tutorials that
take me a long time um
places where you know people are gonna
do the tutorials I can follow you to
where only five people watch it you know
it doesn't make us any sense any sense
sorry ya know I'm putting it in I'm
putting in like I said yes Jerome I'm
tryna like I said I have to sorry I have
to basically this thing takes time so I
just I needed to do the intro to HTML
CSS right I have to knock that out
because there's a lot of people who
signed up and they just don't know the
basics so I had to do that I can't jump
you know for three or four users who are
more advanced and more intermediate
level just jump directly to narrable I
have to it's a process I have to knock
out all the easy things for everybody to
learn then from there
javascript knocked that out and then
from there
PHP Meribah PHP narrable might come up
next month what's Thursday missing today
we're at the 8th PHP in our mouth should
be here by from my calculations on the
4th the 4th of August you know
yeah man I think it's like I said man
I'm knocking shit out you know courses
my courses and doing shit and even like
that a lot of people haven't really you
know you don't have to continue
supporting will destroy your reviews
yeah that's fine man I know how people
is definitely gonna love what I'm doing
cuz I get it I get a lot a lot of
messages in you know a lot of thank yous
and people who appreciate it
so yeah we're web Gnostics you say that
that that's all I'm talking about money
money money money money money money
getting in jobs getting in jobs yeah my
channel is about getting money in
getting jobs if you're looking for I
don't know some something else something
this is not the channel for you you know
what I mean this is definitely not the
channel for you you know cuz this is for
the people that they wanna fuckin get a
job right my channel is for people who
want to get into the industry if you're
just some dude that and you feel like
hey you don't need money and you live
comfortable where you at and you want to
code for yourself that's great this is
not the channel for you you know you
should have noticed that from the
beginning I don't know what you're doing
here
if you if you really if you really feel
like hey this channel is about getting
jobs which is exactly what this channel
is about you know I only talk about
fucking helping people out to get jobs
right so if you're here about for the
love of coding
and now get paid this is not the place
for you you know so and that's what I'm
say Thank You Henry thank you thank you
you know what's funny man I kind of want
to show it I don't know can I say that
when people get mad if I was to show
that just to show the people who
actually matter of fact yeah I think I'm
gonna do that I think I'm gonna I'm
gonna do like Awards like monthly awards
to the people who are the most basically
the ones that create that finish the
most courses and in pass the quizzes on
coda face.com I'm going to be giving out
awards or something all right just to
keep you guys more motivated to keep on
doing it because I'm looking here and
there's only a few people that actually
dedicate time I'm gonna see it I don't
think right now give me a second I'm
gonna tell you the top three users the
leaderboards okay cool I will share this
with you guys this is the top ten this
is the top ten people that you know they
cried when they came into this thing
they came in and they came in to do they
work and they came in to learn right I'm
gonna show you right now let me share
this there's the leaderboard right now
this is from the reports there's the
people that came in so Luther came in
Kyle Smith Chris Connor you're
Smith I apologize the room I see you
you're dating Henry
Park Colin Nathan good fellow original
hari Camp Perry boy cam who else
and Joseph Paris right those are the 10
people out of I think it we're up to I
think 520 people I believe is 520 people
who signed up for a website set a
subscription out of 520 people those are
the top ten people that have basically
finished it right which tells me that
people come in the videos each video I
think there's about 27 videos right now
and that tells me that people come in do
a video 5 minutes a day which is kind of
crazy to me if I like I see a course I'm
gonna knock that shit out
right I'm gonna come in and do four or
five videos in one day four or five
videos is like you know 20 30 minutes
you telling me that people don't want to
put in 20 30 minutes for something that
can change their lives
I'm just saying you know and I love you
guys everybody who actually signed up
and and basically it's and did their
work you know I want you guys to
understand that you know yeah yeah I'm
really grinding right now you're really
grinding out here to to do the work and
that's you know we need to work that's
what pays off man you know I watching
videos cuz your developer personality
nah nah all calm which is true and I
appreciate out I don't want to stay here
I don't want you to stay here but I also
want you to understand like my channel
is for the people that we're gonna find
a job and wanna get money like you know
that's what I wanna do for people you
know
this there is no other channel out there
talking about this there is no channel
you know some people so much fucking
youtubers don't even tell people how
much they earn they don't even tell
people how much they started getting
when they got into the industry or how
much they got a mid-level or how much
they got a senior-level like people are
very hush-hush with their money right
but if you start adding up their
subscribers you start adding their
sponsorship then you start adding what
companies they work for they've made a
lot of money right like me I'm just a
small fish that somehow I'm eating up
the market you know what I mean so I'm
doing something good I'm here to promote
you know promote something that could
change people's lives you know cuz
there's these people out there who who
are just they don't know what the hell
they want to do with themselves alright
they like man I don't know what should I
get into should I get into fuckin you
know coding I had some kid asked me
should I get into Android development
should I get it iOS development should I
get into what does anime and I'm like
wait how do you try to look for you know
the requirements for somebody to dust
Android development
right now do you have those things
already there do you have you know two
to four years to wait on it go for
Android development right now if you
don't have that time and you're just
like man I need to start working it'll
put money in my pocket then what
development is for you you can't really
make a change make a difference in a
year the opportunities are there you
know what I mean so that's what I'm here
to come on you know this is something
that there's a lot of people that they
don't come from the places that we come
from right ninety percent of them they
don't come from the places that we come
from right they don't come from places
where it's like you know the average
person's makeup my photograph if they're
lucky right now once you touch eighty a
hundred grand
you know 120 grand home with 30 grand
like Carol you pretty much really above
everybody else but for them this is
normal for a lot of people you know this
is normal for people like me it is not
normal it's not normal to see somebody
make that much money so I rather
somebody tell me hey you know you
fucking me go you don't even have to own
your own business for now or earn a lot
of money you don't have to be a fucking
doctor a lawyer to earn a lot of money
because you could be doing this you know
what I mean you don't have to go to
school for years for six years sometimes
even eight years for some people to earn
the money that I'm already burning right
that's my motivation that's what I'd
like to do that's why I like to come in
you know and just tell people hey this
is how life is there's people who don't
even know what vocation time is there's
people that don't even know about salary
people come in and they work for hours
you come in late you lost an hour right
that's say you didn't get paid for that
some people do you know to them that's
too long they think that the world works
like that for a lot of people here the
world doesn't work like that so that's
what I'm here to show them my hangman
there's other good things that you could
do with yourself is you know apply
yourself for some summonses and become a
developer which is what I feel a lot of
youtubers and all the channels don't
have and even you know professional
developers guys that you see in
conferences and this and that like they
don't tell you that because they're
fucking they come from from places where
it's like they got their mom and dad and
their mom is like a fucking you know
it's like high college she works for
marketing agency their dad is a fucking
engineer that that is a fucking lawyer
so it's like money-wise money's not no
issue you know what I mean so it's like
for them is like a hundred K that's why
everybody should be making but the
people that come from the bottom they
come from here they don't see that and
they never gonna see that they're never
gonna get there they never want to get
there
unless they they have something that
takes them out of it and I feel web
development that's the rap for a lot of
people and nobody has ever talked about
this besides me you know I mean Frank
that's what my channels about dad you
know hit him with it I have to hit him
with it hey don't put it you know I'm
just get smaller it man
you know that's what we in here man so
when should we switch to something like
SAS or SPSS or something like bone
materialised our CSS I mean bulma a
materialised our CSS it's a framework
right it's just a fucking framework you
don't need to worry about that that's
like if the same thing is bootstrap you
start using bootstrap once you know CSS
if you don't see a sensing you know how
to do all of those things that bootstrap
does for you if you know how to do it or
you buy it yourself then use booster
because the reason why bootstrap is good
is to save you that time from coding all
of this shit all over again right so
it's the same thing as uma and
materialized right now for something
like SAS when are you ready to start
using SAS you can start using SAS right
now if you know CSS selectors if you
know how do you know how CSS properties
work how to create a rule you're ready
to do this now Henry you've been
watching my mind to toriel's and you
already watch the course right pretty
much you could start doing it now like
I'll be honest which like people start
doing it now you just start checking it
out but yeah ii mean i love SAS because
it makes my life easier I could just
nest everything inside of I'm like a
selector code okay I'm talking about the
header so that I will say inside of the
header half ul so instead of the UL
have an ally so I will put the Li inside
of the UL in SAS so it just makes your
life easier now for somebody who don't
understand what the hell is going on I
would not recommend it
I'll be like nah man you got a first
don't CSS it was like Missy but a
cokehead il real quick let me see a
little sign in you let's see make this
SCSS alright so you should not share a
little bit of something in the screen so
I'm gonna share it right now with you
guys just why I love SAS so much right
cool so let's say you here and we say we
got a div class and then we have you
while you are we have a lie and then we
say car and we have by plane then we
have a little list item all right so
let's say if I wanted to do this to see
a sense if I want to change the
background of top I don't have to say
that I'll tell you background
ready right now okay cool
let's put a patio let's cut it took the
pixels and they're all right now if I
wanted to change the UL I'll have to do
something like this top you well and
then come in here create a whole
complete different rule there's a whole
different rule right here
one two right so we'll have to say
background the other Hey just change the
background on this and then if I wanted
to change that I will say top ul Li then
I will say let's say list style look
alright so remove that and I'll say
padding back oh sorry that's my fault I
wanted to do padding:0 background
no let's say padding:0 let's say cutting
ten pixels
okay that's a color and if I wanted to
do this I would have to write all of
this shit right now if I want to do this
with sass will have to do is just coming
here right think to see well can't be
this it's
it's out of it all right and then take
this and paste it inside of this so let
me see do you have this this you can see
this is more readable to me okay because
I know that the top is a parent dip
right and then the side of it is a ul
which is here and the LR is in there so
me that makes more sense to actually use
it like that instead of having to do it
with CSS we see a sense it's like you
have to go in and create a rule for
every single thing with this at least
you've been okay
I just nested inside of it what I was
inside of another day if I know top is
the parent
I put Thomas first more crazier I can
come in and just say bread and apple say
live right coming here and I'm gonna say
n top so what does this thing is put
this rules inside of everything that has
the class top music you could actually
go in there and go and select things
even I don't know more easier more
readable like I could come in in and
create this and anybody could pick it up
you know I don't know I love SAS that's
my sheep well a lot of you guys already
know that you guys probably like Angel
we already nodded to little sass but you
know some people don't let me see
that's how you do it man
Alexis that's how you do it that's how
you you gotta go in hard you know you
gotta take the weekends to really go
hard you gotta do eight to ten hours
that's what I was doing when I was
trying to learn even cold steel's course
I went in and learn that shit and like
to I think was like two three to three
weeks
you know doing like eight hours on the
weekends and doing like an hour to
throughout the week so it's like you
just gotta take the weekends and just
really boss your ass exactly yeah that's
how I feel I know too well what it's
like to only afford two dollar menu
McDowell's
yeah that's how it is who took of pecan
to become a developer and yeah that was
me man my first job I wasn't making shit
I was making $13 an hour like my first
development job I don't even consider it
a development job because it was like
posting eBay shit right but they let me
create things you know like HTML CSS for
you know selling things online for a
company it was like you know my first
break cuz nobody was gonna give me a
break you know what that tiresome
it's expected to memorize HTML tags and
CSS stuff in an interview no you're not
supposed to memorize things right you're
supposed to know it and what does that
mean in me you can just memorize
something right but what does it mean to
actually know something that's like if I
come to you in Excel you hey how do you
select every ID on a page right now this
or every class how do you select every
class know every div that has the class
menu right you were saying ahead I will
use the classes like don't say that menu
and then put in my room and then someone
will say yeah that's fine that's exactly
what I would do right now if somebody
comes in and tells you I'm gonna create
a menu how will you create it somebody
might come in and say hey then we use
the UL tag for the list items right or
somebody might come in and say I will
use the nav tag and use the anchor links
so in reality is so many ways to do it
or somebody might just say hey I would
just use the div tag and putting anchor
links in Saturday there's a million ways
to do it right but the point of it is
just to know how to do things I don't
think anybody's going to test him but I
hate memorize every CSS property they're
not because I don't know anybody who
does you know everybody Google's
everybody searches through you know
either Mozilla or w3 schools like
whenever you don't know something by
heart you have to figure it out you have
to say hey how do you change
border-radius
all right and it's like right now if I
come in and be like oh how do I change
the border radius on the bottom left do
you guys think I've noticed it by heart
no I will say CSS
generator and I will say water radius
three schools well because I know that
this has it I will say hey how to change
the bottom right I will come in here and
I will say five and then that will tell
me so as you can see I will say hey
there on this cuz there on that and is
there on that do you tell every single
person who remembers this whole fucking
line no nobody remembers they shame
people look it up the point is not to
remember things is to figure out the
answer can you figure out the answer all
right if I tell you hey I want you to
create a design come to driven right and
I say hey can you come here and let's
say this all right something like that
I'm sure enough oh good example this
catch what I see okay if I come to you
and I tell you hey can you make this
design into a real page and you tell me
no I can't do it then that's a problem
now if I'll tell you just created
anybody who knows HTML CSS can build
this homepage forget about the colors
from it about the backgrounds and all
this extra shit that's here the icons
nobody cares about that because the
design is supposed to give you the
background for it the design is supposed
to give you well you know any special
things that are not created with CSS
he's supposed to give him that but can
you come in and basically say okay I
create this menu right I could create
this menu I can put an icon here I can
come here for a search and then when I
click on this this sir
pops up with our input field comes up
out of here I could come here and create
this and say hey DISA around the corners
and I could look at this that's okay I
could do this with border-radius the
same thing is here I would say cool I
look at this and just more of radius on
that right like this book already is to
a faint background they could use on
this box shadows that it has right
there's like so many little things that
you if you look at a design and you're a
developer you look at it you say how can
I mean how can I build this ohhara how
to building thing we're fine
you can build anything you know because
most websites are gonna be like fucking
Facebook we go to facebook.com for
companies there they're fucking design
teams it's like this super simple super
simple you see like how simple it is
you're telling me you can't build
something like this put a little water
radius on this put a little border
that's a little dark gray create this a
little responsive like anybody can do
this right it's not that hard at all and
this is the type of shit that most
companies do now when you work for a
digital agency it's different
it's you're gonna cretians you you're
gonna create websites that are going to
challenge you well I'm telling you right
now 99% of you guys you guys are never
that I'm working with one of these
companies or one of this agencies
because this is not for everybody this
is not for every single person
so say hey I want to work at a you know
digital agency who makes websites for
coca-cola or Nike now everybody's going
to work for those companies
most of the time and most of you guys
are gonna work for regular companies you
know a company that sells sneakers or
let's say you know I don't know coming
to sell sneaker the company sells
t-shirts a company that that sells that
you know they have a app online you know
like most of the times you guys are not
gonna be working on this type of website
share animations how much animations
that you have to use you know like this
shape
parallax the most most of the people are
not going to be working on websites like
this I don't know or create designs like
this that's the reality things you guys
are going to be working on simple sites
and that's what I tell people like don't
think that you got to remember so much
and you got to know every single thing
because that takes time it takes years
and takes specialties some of you guys
might say hey I'm gonna get into
animations if you get into animations
you could work from one of these
companies but that has to be your
specialty all right you have to put in
the time to learn all that HTML and CSS
animations that you can think of this
stuff is easy and stuff this isn't even
hard I'm trying to find like I'm trying
to find something that I could say it's
challenging
so like this site people planes that
world
like this this is channel using Express
VJ yes fill it right just put it back in
all of this stuff is done with all this
stuff is done with like 3GS you know
most of you guys are not going to be
working on those second websites so if
you try to remember everything in CSS
it's like you're wasting your time
because that's not what you're going to
be working on versus flat now there's a
criminal agency there's another bonus
that's pretty famous out there flat
versus realistic and also I'm missing me
everybody's gonna have different
specialties so don't worry about it I'm
going to memorize every single day
connexes just worry about the basics if
you know the basics you're gonna be good
as you become or you know it's fuckin
developer that's been you for 5-10 years
you gotta realize which way is it that
you want to go
if you're gonna go to the back end if
you down what's on the front a there are
you gonna be a MongoDB specialist are
you gonna be on my sequel especially as
I get everybody has their their fucking
role in this thing you know
Sonny said yeah your boy your boy you're
getting skinny out here dad
now I'm trying I'm trying to eat healthy
man I'm trying to get back my shit I'm
trying to get back my shit before the
end of the summer is fine the summer's
gone from there's no way I could get
back in shape by the state under the
summer but after the summer it was
getting back on it you know what I mean
he had little weights you can get in
that shoulder up like a know what I mean
what we in here okay let me see let me
see what I was everywhere
yes sequel is end men everywhere yeah
I I can't say that their losses people I
go to the army but I do agree that when
you go to the army 100 percent of people
there they don't know what they want to
do with their life and a a big chunk of
people that become cops are people who
want to be something them they couldn't
do it that I oh you know what I joined
something that you have benefits and you
you're good you know but that's just how
life is
oh man Henry Vasquez says I just started
the Lera Bell chorus by Ellen Diaz
have you heard of that course man I
support as well Diaz right because he
Spanish II I think he's Dominican I'm
almost sure that he's Dominican and I
support him but you can't compare cold
steel's course or Stephen riders course
or even my courses to fuck other India's
and the LEAs goes in there and be like
oh here's a boo-boo
I did a boob look guys or he would be
like hey man sorry guys I gotta get my
coffee like there's so much mistakes in
his fucking course it's not even funny
and I know creating courses is hard man
and sometimes you I've noticed this cuz
I do my research before I started
getting into this thing of great amount
course whatever I did my research of
everybody that's out there and there's
like this rush and you demean other
fucking like channels that basically
somebody has to create the first course
as soon as possible right so when Vijay
just came out somebody needs a fucking
create a course as soon as possible and
I think the guy's name is Maximus or
Maximilian or something like that
he did a course for laravel to do a
thing is the best course I don't know
you know I took the course from VG s I
learned it I learned what the fuck is
going on with you but was it the best
course not really do I understand what
happened with it yes the guy needed to
create the course as soon as possible
and he just released it right and it's
the same thing as Edwin Diaz as India's
course
pretty much mostly his courses seemed
rust like he just wakes up one day he's
like man I got it I gotta do this course
as soon as possible before people
fucking find us somewhere else and
that's the day I don't like his courses
I don't like his Eragon course and it
was pretty bad to me right for some of
the people have been at all he's he's
very enough right now for me it's like
he don't put in enough time to edit the
videos you know put in enough time to
actually plan the courses it's more like
he freestyles and if I'm gonna watch
something freestyle
I'm gonna watch traversing media I'm not
gonna fucking and that's for free on
YouTube right so if I'm gonna pay for
something I wanna see something that's
you know really up to you know up to par
with like top shape if I'm gonna pay
five $10 $20 sometimes I've paid $30 for
course I'm gonna pay that much it has to
be something that I'm gonna look at me
I'm gonna bullshit good job you know
yeah also you could do variables with
sass that's one of the cool things about
it so you don't have to re write
everything in every single night you
like a you just say okay main color and
the main color is blue and then later on
if you say oh I want to create main
color as yellow you just change it one
time and it changes throughout every
single part of the website what
extension that I use to find out
it's called appetizer W a PP al yze our
lap eliezer talking about that it's all
about extensions cuz people keep asking
me that I'm gonna make a video mother
let me write it down cuz sometimes i
mean i don't know i forget what type of
topics i should talk about and I just
remember this right now create a video
about top 5 the best all extensions for
developers and watch somebody come in
that's watching my channel right now
create that video before me and then say
oh I was gonna do this anyways man come
on give me my fucking credit like people
should get royalties like I see people
stealing my ideas I feel like man I wish
they would just fucking give me
royalties like you could do it it'll
copy but give me some royalties man no
the coal i oh let me see him no her to
me no the co entirely what presidents
the master what development what
this shit makes no sense empowering
wordpress developers to master web
development what
so they teach WordPress but you telling
me that you're a wordpress developer who
doesn't understand math who doesn't
understand what development do anybody
here on understand me what the fuck are
you Serena hey you're a wordpress
developer who uses HTML CSS in
JavaScript and PHP in my sequel but yet
you need a fucking course to master web
development like that'll make no fucking
sense you already know what developing I
don't know what wrote that somebody sent
him a message right that shit makes no
sense
you should have quite like masterwork
price or sundar that say empowering new
to WordPress developers to master the
technology or something master the
framework what massive web development
you already fucking doing what
development if you're already doing
WordPress all right
let me see what else I'm sorry guys
crazy shit but a to the Bay Area a
head-on with the Bay Area man doesn't
want people think that you did you
because we do code doesn't mean you
gotta be squares man you could actually
have a little border radius in your life
you know have a little style put a
little sauce on it and hit it with a
little dab a little dabble sauce
hit a little look dabba Sasuke you know
you don't have to be a square there's a
enough squares over here in this
industry you know I mean since Jo was
frozen yep I'm frozen right now yeah I
can't see me yes sir you cannot see me
yes that's the only thing there only
promote women that's one of the problems
man like now I'm all for women in the
industry but I don't think like there
should be like a group where it's just
like hey we only let women in like I
find us it's so fucking weird you know
what I mean that's like a fucking group
of like developer so like I'm sorry we
only have black people in Spanish people
in sorry white guys that just sounds
crazy you know what I mean it's the same
shit that fucking all this girl's cold
like I find I find them she's like
fuckin ridiculous like just fucking say
we fuckin code group or something out
you know it's just like you can alienate
other people from you know the other
gender for joining you guys or or being
part of you guys cuz then like now is
just like some it seems like some
feminist group type shit you know I'm
all for women but not for separation I
like when I say okay girls
boys and everybody gets to interact
that's what I'm for you know or people
with different skin colors people from
different backgrounds different
religions mess together that's what I'm
up for I'm not up for hey let's separate
us and be like we're fucking two girls
and we're girls that code and we only
call them with girls it's just sounds
fucking ridiculous because that's not
how the world works
and it's like then you go to a job
interview what a bunch of guys and you
don't even know how to interact you know
what I mean you don't know how to
fucking be yourself because all you've
been doing is coding with girls
oh you're that fucking code what
everybody men you don't join none of
this fucking groups that they only keep
you you know it was like the same
shaysing minorities who code no man I
don't show up to number of verses I show
up to fuckin shit where is everybody's
in there because then it's not
integrating nobody you know but that's
