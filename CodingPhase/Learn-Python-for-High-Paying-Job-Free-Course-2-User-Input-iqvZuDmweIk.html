how to get the data that the user gives
us and put it inside of a variable ok so
let's say we wanted to get the user's
name so we're gonna come here and
basically declare a variable we're gonna
say name equals to input and then we say
what is your name
alright now the next thing that we're
going to do is we want to get the age so
we're gonna say H equals to input all
right and we're gonna say how old are
you all right so now what we're going to
do is we're gonna say I want to print
all right we're gonna say print the name
and then after that we're gonna come in
and we're gonna say print the age okay
all right now we click run we come back
here we say Jo how old are you let's say
30 ok and as you can see now those
variables they get set with the
information that the user gave us okay
so you have name you have 8 so that's
how you actually come in and you get the
user's input and from there on you could
continue with your code whatever it is
that you wanted to create down here like
you could actually print out hey the
user's name is Jo his age is 30 like you
could mix it up alright so I'll see you
guys in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
