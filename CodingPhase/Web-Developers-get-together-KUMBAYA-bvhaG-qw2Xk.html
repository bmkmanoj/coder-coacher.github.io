about your boy Joe when you're done with
that holla - boy man I got some good
good shit I just finished doing nine
videos right now for JavaScript now we
can finally start jumping into the
projects you know cuz we got through the
the basic syntax you know functions
objects and all that little BS right
which is the easiest things but let's
jump into the projects man that's where
I'm excited to just start doing I'm like
damn man I can't wait to start doing the
projects like think about it like this
that's like you know for me when I
create the syntax tutorials or the
videos right it's like me teaching the
ABCs you know and that's like super easy
right to me right so meaning is like I'm
teaching ABCs to people but I can't wait
until we start getting to the projects
and then we build something cool you
know so that's what we at man find you
for Christian Christians Channel yeah
man that's my boy I just finished
calling him I just finished calling him
I said I told him I was like y'all Chris
Shaw what up man oh he's in Bible study
right now heading up Chris Shawn
although I'm telling to hit me up when
he comes out all right yeah I just saw I
was like yo Chris Shawn come on man
I know I know Midori got you in the
Batcave but you gotta come up man trying
to bring him back man you know he's
doing his thing
I was watching his videos man he was
going through some stuff and like you
know what man I'm like let me hit him up
see if everything's okay and what I can
do you know just to make them smile and
just make them fucking height you know
splash that sauce on them real quick oh
man but yeah man I bought you a few J s
shirt yeah English a funny note that I
make a video I'm just saying though I'm
just saying though you know what I mean
like I'm doing my thing I don't bother
nobody I don't say shit about nobody but
I make a video about a few GS and I got
the creator of UJ s like pretty much
hitting me up and like whatever we just
had a little conversation me and him
which to me is hilarious because I'm
like yo I'm not hating on your channel
now your channel your um your fucking
framework and everything it's not hate
it's just I personally I went from
learning backbone all right I learned
back one jump to ember from amber I jump
to angular for angular I jump to react
and then I'm like now everybody's
talking about VG is what I'm supposed to
jump to view GS now because everybody
said oh you should check this out you
should do this I'm like no so I made a
you know
my opinion on it you know what I mean so
he took it to the heart and it's like
grown and it's just funny to me because
I'm like man I'm just like some channels
some random channel sauce and it out
here but you know I don't know I have
some type of influence you know it's a
small channel but people talk about me
you know what I mean like people talk
about being good people talk about me
and bad people tell me like it
the industry is small right the industry
is small and people realize things like
my channel is not like you know some
other channels that's out there where
they don't stand out my channel stands
out people be like who the hell is this
game why is he saying this about this
framework why is he talking about my
framework oh my god right so that's how
they feel but I'm not gonna freaking
tell people when I came don't use of UJS
if you want to use it use it my point of
view is I'll wait for the next one you
know what I mean there's gonna be a next
one in six months it's gonna be the
either the framework from fucking Harry
Potter or it a Teletubby framework one
of those two so I'm just waiting on
those I'm not jumping on this one I
don't need the views I don't need the
subscribers right like I'm not gonna
create content for view GS just because
this it's hot at the moment you know
it's like you know what I mean that's
the problem it's like there was no jobs
for it and I wanted to like I wanted to
just be like bro man you live in a
bubble I like the guy even you man but
he's like a San Francisco dude I think
he's from New Jersey isn't you know been
living in San Francisco for too long and
you know people are still in this bubble
they really think like the world is
surrounded by you know and controlled by
fucking Silicon Valley it's not I'm
sorry
like what
pop it over there is popping over there
but it's not in the world you know I'm
sorry buddy but it's good because you
know at the same time it gets to the
street talking I guess you know you know
the freaking against the community
talking you know it's like the same
thing what I did a video about elixir I
didn't I didn't like elixir in the
beginning and I still I'm in the edge of
it it's something of like I use elixir
if I want to have fun I want to create
something for my owners but there's no
jobs for it there's really nobody's
looking for it only you know only
developers are working on shit on their
own house or they you know they risking
it you know but most companies they're
not gonna risk it with a brand new
language or our framework that hasn't
been like you know super popular or
backed by a major company no one is
gonna jump on it you know it's like we
all care about that that ban that's all
alternative and it's like yeah man you
know I love this band because this band
is you know like they've been on the
same bar for ten years man and every
year they get two more fans man every
year they get two more fans I love that
band but nobody's gonna go pay money for
that band right now you come and say The
Killers are in town everybody goes to
that concert now if you say fuckin
Johnny Schmo fuckin his band you know
it's gonna be four or five people who
are like loyal fans and somebody like
yeah we got Johnny small on the fuckin
on the bar man you know I was like
that's how I look at it you know that's
how companies look at it's not even to
me I'm just giving that's the thing
I give opinions and people like it the
the regular people like it
the people who are like extremely
uptight and they're like so attached to
a framework so attached to a language so
attached to
whatever right they like oh man
we fuckin hate this guy buddy you can
hate me but I'm just giving out an
opinion man and opinion that everybody
talks about you know opinion that
everybody says behind closed doors the
only difference is that most people
wouldn't want to give an opinion and put
their face on it people would give an
opinion and go like already with a
fucking African name of like Oh Johnny
banks 24 you know what I mean like me
I'm using my face I'm using my name I'm
using my channel using my website I
don't care
look it up man look look up that song
from rich turkey I don't care man send
me that email so we could jump in have a
couple of people in here man to em yo so
that's crazy
so I want to say thank you to everybody
here I just looked at my email now and
basically from that last video that I
created which in reality is not like
promo it's just that's the video that
I'm gonna put on the the introduction
where neither introduction the front
page of my website and I just had to
upload it somewhere it's not like I
wanted to do promotion but I guess
people fuckin like the video sorry cuz
200 people just signed up and out of it

those 300 people that watched it let me
see the statistics let's see let's bring
out the numbers 313 people watch the
video let me let me help you get to the
next level as a web developer right out
of those 313 people
202 people signed up for a website

what I mean like that's what motivates
me because I know my peoples is here
they know what I'm trying to

definitely definitely
you could everyone else right a week ago
if you want cuz I talk I tell people
send me your your portfolio so we could
actually come here and look at it and
actually you know give our opinions on
what I you know what I thinking and what
other people's think you know where
everyone frame yeah and so I like I
liked it I'm about to put it live let me
see I'm about to shit it's already right
now don't worry you good you actually
did a good job okay yeah man now it
looks like you you know you click here
you got the bow got coal samples you
know I like how this looks
what are you use for this it was like
four and code samples there it's pretty
dope I like it
let me see yeah those cool got a little
pig dice game that's cool
got quote generator got a week you were
app yeah don't get it don't okay
not that doesn't they're not working
bombing they look rubbish to me so yeah
I mean that's how it is it's always like
that you know sometimes we we create
something in the beginning and you're
like I'm so much better now you know
what I mean like it always happens that
way
that's one of the things that there was
like this running joke about it about
designers and developers that every time
they create a portfolio like a portfolio
might take you a while to build it right
like the exact website that you want
everything how you want it but by the
time you finish it it's already old to
you because you already have so many
other cool shit that you already built
you know what I mean so many like that's
probably like my third portfolio website
I've done since I started coding yeah I
mean that's how it is that's how you
gotta do it man I like this I like was
this Ruby you mess up a ruby yeah in
food for the food board I'm nice you
know that was part of her pop which we
recorded a pre-programmed for some blue
camel with our big camp I was gonna
switch you know a pre caused him to
learn Ruby but you know what you know
one finger
I'll call his son have you needed
yourself
oh yeah negative yeah I think that's we
don't I turn the volume up Monica you
know Connie I come can you hear him no I
can't hear me maybe we come a few gorgeo
like developin no I'm working on it I
guess I got a retail job right now I'm
like I said I'm working on my first site
right now so I saw your sign I was like
I was pretty impressed I think man my
side I'm we're gonna nothing compared to
that
oh come on you know that's how I
everyone feel in the beginning I've seen
tons of sites a they all look better
than mine you know you're always gonna
feel amateurish that's why I feel that
right but I'll bet even Joe sometimes he
feels like he's he's not really a
hundred percent yeah that's true like I
said I'm just trying to give me a job by
the end of year or what about me Joe
that's my goal
say men hopefully earlier than that I
really don't want to go back to
construction and that shit like before
that just makes me want to cry yeah sure
here it's like a hundred degrees right
now I can do constructs I'll be seeing
people you know you know yeah work
they'll be doing that on my na na it's
not for me Kohi bro Kohi
so now let me jump up and jump back
you're not gonna wear this is
they had those audios messing up
can y'all hear me all right
you
gifts can okay he can you hear I thought
I thought I heard him for a second but
may have to take over for a second if
he's not I don't know working again
whereabouts in the state you from
Oklahoma okay yeah Midwestern things now
it's like the Southwest closet every
yeah Camilla Camilla know where like
most people hear about the home I think
we got like cows and chickens and stuff
see that's pretty much well for when you
sit yeah you know all of you watch
basketball you watch the NBA at all
you do yeah okay yeah like people that
be watching the game is everything that
there's no black box in Oklahoma
everything if there's at least one right
yeah at least one so I don't even called
in for it I've been working on it for
about six months now yeah yeah you know
yeah we were holding over the podcast he
got back that's what's up man you know
what the hell I try to disconnect it for
a second so I go move closer to the
Wi-Fi bite this frickin thing the audio
I don't know wasn't coming back oh yeah
man oh yeah yeah in regards to this
every new finger yeah go ahead
I think one thing that he needs to
realize is it wasn't a hair of him it
was it was a comment or an opinion about
something he created now I know what
creative people are like hey wouldn't it
create in science their baby yeah if you
want to say something about it they take
it personally in it so it's listen I
hope he remembers that effect any those
you know hey jumping the gun a bit you
know he's a bit quick to draw like an M
comment still yeah no I know
I mean I think I think he didn't mean in
a really bad way I think it's just more
like he also took it the wrong way where
I'm like I'm not talking bad about the
framework the framework is fine it's a
good framework it's just you know for
somebody who already knows angular who
already knows react why would you jump
to something that what it does is just
takes from both of them and puts it into
work and I mean for me I'm like if I
already know this why am I gonna go try
to learn something new that it's not
really nothing new it's just something
it's like a a remix you know what I mean
hey guys like go listen to the remix you
know like I'm not I'm not really in the
mood for that cuz I already putting a
lot of hours in everything else I'm like
yo I'll wait for the next one the next
one that comes up with something cool
that could be like oh great you know
there's something brand new you know I
think a lot of people who are not
front-end developers experienced
front-end developers they like it
because it's easy it's like jQuery like
even caveman can do it anybody can do it
right it's easy to get into it but even
if you want to do something more
advanced with it you still have to do
almost everything that you used to do
with react so here the people who are
running away from react because they're
like oh this is too advanced this is you
know there's too many new concepts that
we got to learn but it's really not new
concepts it's just learning more
JavaScript learning how to do proper
JavaScript and learning object oriented
programming you know most people don't
want to do that like let's say if you're
a junior developer you try to stay away
from the advanced stuff for like a year
two years all you worry about is jQuery
you know add a class to this remove a
class to that you know that's what
happens to people and they get
comfortable there but some point you're
gonna have to
that of using frameworks you have to
build your own framework or from scratch
from scratch you know what I mean
because even at any framework that you
use it's still bloated you know I mean
like if you could do it with regular
JavaScript why would you use a framework
right right that's that's my totally you
know and yeah I just think like every
like every six months there's a new
framework there's something new every
six months and it's like people tired of
that when it comes to this dojo
me what makes a fragment popular in the
industry is it because a bunch of
developers have decided to learn it was
it because a bunch of companies have
decided to invest in that framework that
exactly is is the framework like what
the companies that invest into the
framework like UJS wasn't popular at all
until laravel came in and they released
5.4 and what they did was something to
me I feel like it's very sneaky
they added huge as2 to the framework so
you're looking for back-end framework
right and let's say your angular
developer or your react developer or
your ember developer you're just looking
for the backend framework that's it and
then you already have your own options
so what they did they created 5.4
something called mix which are removed
something else that's called elixir
which was like a a way to connect cope
with you know a whole bunch of different
things right my god yeah easy to connect
like so really know this shit is like
you gotta know so many things it's not
just like one little thing you start at
the bottom just write about HTML CSS and
JavaScript and the more you go deeper
the more years you're into this you find
yourself learning more more and more and
more stuff right now one of the main
problems with so many frameworks is that
now not only do you have to constantly
keep on learning because of technology
but also to every time somebody comes up
if I have a free a free fucking weekend
I'll be like hey I'm gonna create the
fucking Harry Potter framework and now I
created the having Potter framework
instead of me focusing on like the best
frameworks out there or contributing to
those frameworks I'm going create my own
so now there's 27 different frameworks
that people are using right you know
what I mean so it's like well if we all
do
front-end work we should focus on on a
high Coliseum a standardized where we
say hey this is the standards of web
components and that's it then from there
let's focus on building things and now
focus on hey man you gotta spend four
months on learning UJS or you got spent
four months learning react on another
four months learning and you know for
like you know these Doc Tiffany you're
don't fit exactly right and therefore
like brand new developers like you guys
you guys might come into the the
ecosystem in you like way which was the
one I'm supposed to learn so now you're
stuck without building things and now
you just mostly focus on looking through
blogs looking through videos and fucking
reading shit and then you're like but
which one is the one that I'm supposed
to learn which one's the world is gonna
get me hired you know what I mean like
the one is supposed to learn yeah is
whatever they're hiring for in your air
yeah exactly
Joe I think smart coder is trying to
join a chat did they send me a email
think they sent an email yeah let me see
okay yeah so what makes a framework
popular is who's backing it you know
what I mean like in my company they
wasn't gonna choose UJS because why
would you choose for UJS when you have
for angular and Facebook for react and
we see what reaction do react and do
front-end work it can do phone
applications it can even do he are games
right so monster that one did use the
lamp spec recorder yeah yeah yeah that's
what we used in my company white lamb
cell we have a cheaper icicle PHP a
laravel and they react for the front Lee
is that because it's cheaper uh no I
think it was the reason why they chose
it was because Michael is in the area
where we're no Karia there's barely any
developers right so if there's barely
any developers because even though I
live in New York where I live is that
the suburbs right is fucking is you know
outside houses and shit like that right
so for people to come here and to work
here most people is gonna be like why
would I come here when I have New York
City right there you know what I mean
time for jobs terms of jobs exactly so
for to make a future-proof
when we decided to switch so they used
to have Perl
but then I basically you know told them
I hey we should do Larry Moe because
anybody can come here and edit our code
like you know if tomorrow I quit or my
partner quits and leave the company it's
gonna be extremely hard to find a Ruby
on Rails developer in this area right or
bringing a Python developer in this area
so for a company is smarter to say hey
let's pick a stack that we can find
developers no matter what like anybody
can can come in and pick up PHP it's not
that hard at all yeah so it makes sense
you know what I mean like somewhere in
in how you code is in like San Francisco
they you know
they got everybody from the country
going over there trying to get jobs for
Python or machine learning fucking
nodejs like there's a bunch of jobs for
that but they're in that hub that's you
know San Francisco the area but outside
of that it's like hey man it's like for
me to tell you guys to focus on Python
and you live in fucking Kansas it
doesn't meet no fucking sentence or
Oklahoma where I met Oklahoma yeah you
know what I mean
it doesn't make no sense because most
likely in your area there's the people
that are gonna hire you are gonna be
either for Java or Java C sorry or PHP
guaranteed there's gonna be companies
for those three languages no doesn't
matter where you went
you could be in fuckin Zimbabwe right
now and fuckin there's gonna be somebody
hiring for fuckin PHP Book of Eli right
there like a computer guy got your boy
Eli out here man
you just finished doing some push-ups
good sign I know I know you've been
trying to get in this way for meaning
but every time that you get to send me a
message is already too late
yeah so were you from Vila
I'm from Lebanon but I live in New York
can hear you say it again I'm from
Lebanon but I live in New York okay
gamma people's but upstate upstate oh
there you go
goddamn Albany yo they gave me a ticket
a speeding ticket
and I'm still going to court for it man
but it's my fault man I got hike I got
hype that's when I had this boy both my
car and I was like you know when I
bought my car I was like I don't even
know that this shit was the sports
fucking version I don't even know how
you call that the sports whatever right
so I made my car l said oh shit this is
smaller right so I'm going I'm going I'm
okay cool
we passed 60 we passed them in the oven
I know it's just no the hell right this
shit is fun so I keep going and then
occurrence of button I'm principal in
that sense sport your dishes started
zooming next thing I know I'm up a hill
when I'm coming down the hill and cops
is down there I couldn't even stop I was
going to I think like 110 miles per hour
and then I slowed down and they caught
me and I Wow I would look if they would
have caught me a 95 I would have fucking
lost my license I didn't even know that
you could lose your license for fucking
speeding hello who's that
what's your name what's your name state
your name silver car you have any
connection is I get him we gotta get him
off horizon man I got their Verizon is
everywhere they trying to fucking
sabotage the channel man yeah yeah but
the chat though they love us some Eli
though you Casey Julia what's the
breakdown filet you
audience like where are your audience
fun my percentage rates where synergize
okay let's look it up let's look at the
analytics right now I'll tell you right
now the United States and India probably
well the top three are United States 58%
of my audiences from the United States
6% is from the United Kingdom 4% are
from India 3% from Canada and then
Romania and my people from the
Netherlands yeah that's it so that's the
that's what we got
that's like the top 5 United States
United Kingdom India Canada Romania and
Australia oops
yeah that's six functions yeah I don't
look this is where it's gonna get fun
javascript is born I think to me is
boring the beginning parts well you know
oh man I don't know what a fair mm-hmm
that's Joe again I think that's what
it's fun as that's when you start really
programming No gotcha voiceover car man
you can't hear us man but Michael did
you tell people were part of London you
were from me or from Toddlers baby look
a football team not split I've been here
my whole life and I want to leave man I
wanna I want somewhere in the
countryside somewhere quiet by Oklahoma
if I had to move somewhere will be
definitely England that's one of the
places I want to visit pretty since the
place to visit but you don't want to
live here fun yeah it's bad is bad is
bad out there man it's not but it's just
boring but you need a fillet huh yeah a
bit more open a full leg open-minded in
a the US like the US and oh yeah I think
really stuck in our ways like you don't
know it's not that we don't know just
like things they they like things the
way you like it and they keep it that
way they don't change it yeah yeah what
do you think my edges you I think you
like 18 19 years old 18 there you go oh
I bet you about to say something like I
bet you about to say like four years on
me
yeah it looks like he's 18 I like man I
think it what you're having is 18 18 19
years old man started young that's good
though anyone else go to a phone yo word
let's go back to the portfolio's right
so what I wanted to talk about right and
good thing you brought it up so the
portfolio is good like me coming here I
would say isn't a J everything
design-wise is pretty good because
everything spaced out properly this
hierarchy between the the fonts you know
everything looks good I like this I like
having the code snippets the only thing
that I wish you had was more like real
life web
vacations you know like this is cool
this was show like okay I can I can
build something you know everything but
if you want to show to somebody like hey
hire me you want to show them real
businesses like it doesn't matter if
it's made up you can make up a website
for coca-cola or you can make up a
website for you know a facebook create
Facebook but better I mean I hate I
created this version of Facebook what I
think will look better or how it will
work better and then you show them the
features right because here is a quote
generator this stuff what it shows is
that oh yeah he knows how to program you
know but what you want to show people is
like hey I've been working for years
even though it's not true you want to
show them like oh I've been lot fucking
developers for years you know what I
mean
yeah that's what that's the thing that I
tell everybody but besides that
everything is legit like I like this the
code snippets only thing like I said
just have like have five projects man in
five five projects that I tell everybody
have a real estate website have a
restaurant website have an e-commerce
website and then have digital agency
website and the missing what was the
other one I mean you could choose
whatever you want on the fifth one but
those four websites at first you know
five websites that you create you put
them up it doesn't have to be like very
deep it doesn't have to be each website
having like 20 pages like each website
could have two pages that's it
well an easy show them like what you can
do in the diversity of the websites does
they have to have like special some
special font led to prove I can do
certain things it depends on what you're
trying to go for like if you're going
for the back end then yeah you gotta
have a full back-end like let's say you
got a register
register user and then after registering
a user you gotta have like a admin page
where you could edit through the back
like I don't know if you create like a
blog for example you will have an area
where users can register to leave
comments and you have another user which
is you the admin where you could go in
and approve the comments or delete the
comments yeah you know what I mean
yes oh yeah are you yeah
so it all depends on what you really
want to do if you're leaning more to the
front end you wanna focus on having
clean web sites so like let's say an
example I come here I go to dribble
right I'm to dribble calm and I told you
hey check out a real estate website so
you come here search real estate a whole
bunch of designs are just beautiful like
you know you can come here and get
inspiration from so I know up and on
there and be ha yeah this one's pretty
legit like you could create just this
page alone and then with JavaScript make
this like filterable
like let's say you can make this to sort
by price or sort by location or sort by
how many rooms are there and well yeah
you already show them like hey I can
build a very nice website very nice
looking website make it responsive of
course and then from there you can show
them like hey I know JavaScript with
that anybody that sees it they're like
oh we'll hire him cuz you gotta think
about it like this when you go to a job
interview there's two people is gonna
interview you or people that are gonna
look at your portfolio one person
doesn't know what the hell code is right
yeah
usually that person is the one that has
the power right now then there's gonna
be a developer who's going to ask you
questions the developer and that's if
there's no like let's say some companies
if you go to a start-up sometimes they
don't
even have a developer so it's just the
owners or the people who want you to
build the website right even in that
situation that's the best situation
because then they're not gonna actually
know technical questions cuz they don't
know shit right all they care about is
can you build a website now when you go
to a company where you're gonna have to
HR person go through this the whole
process let me just go back real quick
the whole process is gonna be like this
if it's a major company you're gonna
send your email when you send your email
most likely is gonna be a recruiter the
recruiter is gonna talk to you and tell
you hey I like what we see you know
because you have nice websites and this
and that they're gonna throw a whole
bunch of keywords at you they're gonna
Brad oh do you know about bootstrapping
you'll be like yes I know bootstrap oh
do you know angular and you like yes I
know angular if you if you know angular
or if you don't know angular you could
be like no I don't know angular but I've
worked with react or I work with
whatever are the framework and you tell
them but I can pick up angular right
away because I've worked with front-end
frameworks they pretty much the same
thing and then you tell them hey I could
look at the documentation and I could
pick up you know pick up programming
languages pretty quick that's it that's
all you have to say then you're golden
then from there after the interview
they're gonna have a real-life interview
that's when you go to the company when
you go to the company you're most likely
going to talk to HR person the HP HR
person is gonna tell you oh we're
looking at your website can you tell me
about your website so they're gonna go
to your portfolio and then when you go
to your portfolio you're gonna come and
show them each page so let me say an
example you come here and you have this
page and you're gonna oh you have the
menu here you gotta hover
as you can see you hover then you come
here and you go over the thing you click
on the search and then right then you
search you can search the roles you know
the roles the name of this apartment and
we like you have the feature to be able
to filter by
I the search you can sort by how many
rooms you can sort by how many bathrooms
it has whatever by the price now you
could come here also sort by what type
of house it is or what if it's an
apartment townhouse a house you know so
you give them those little explanations
then from there you're golden
now most likely after that they're gonna
bring in the developer which is that's
the scary part right so when you when
you come in and you deal with other
developers number one don't act like you
know everything right number two go in
there say something that's gonna make
them that automatically like it doesn't
matter what it is it's just something to
make them laugh to break the ice
cuz everybody's like all most developers
don't want to go to the fucking
interview they might oh man we gotta
fucking talk to this junior developer
right now you know so that's how people
are right so you're gonna say something
that they can relate to
you're gonna be like yeah you know I've
been playing around with bootstrap but I
like bull mile better you know something
like that and then that's just tomato
gonna make a laugh right and they'll be
like oh wow so this guy he you know he
he's up to speed with the you know with
the fucking community he knows he knows
about fucking bull my own which is it's
you know it's not that popular but
whatever right so it just breaks the ice
it makes people more comfortable and
they'll be like you know what I could
see myself working with that guy because
the developer is the one that's gonna
say do I like this guy to be here in the
office right so the developers maybe
checking to see if I can code the check
and to see if I can work with him that's
one of the things yeah because you're a
junior developer nobody's expecting you
to go in there and be a master if
they're looking for you to be a master
like in in JavaScript HTML CSS and
everything then they better be paying
you over a hundred thousand
now if you go to a company and they they
basically telling you hey we're looking
to hire somebody for a hundred thousand
dollars
now you gotta know what the hell you
getting yourself into
because that means they're gonna ask you
a bunch of technical questions they
might bring out a fucking whiteboard
they might say hey can you do some
algorithms can you do this and that
because the reason why they do that is
to make it difficult for people to
become in it just weeks out the people
who are you know less experienced right
but what I tell people is don't go for
those jobs right away give yourself some
time give yourself a year give yourself
two years before you go to those apps go
to the small businesses take you know
take a year of going to a digital agency
take a year to go to um you know a
ecommerce website that's close to your
neighborhood you know something like
that so when you get to a certain point
where you really comfortable were like
JavaScript or programming in general
then you could go to those big companies
you know I wouldn't tell somebody apply
right away so fucking you know like goo
goo and shit like don't do it you're not
you know what I mean like you're gonna
number one you're not gonna get all past
the phone runs round yeah yeah you're
not gonna get past the front and fourth
interview and you're gonna feel like
shit you're gonna be like oh man I can't
do this this and that because that's
what happens to people people go they go
to such a high thing and like that
happened to me too
like I have one too like fucking tumblr
when I first um you know wanted to learn
what I wanted to learn how to become a
developer I started applying for jobs
like I got called in because you know if
I talk to somebody on the phone they
could feel the sauce like a date I have
something I don't know what it is I'm
not the smart person in the world I just
have something that people gravitate to
me that I all caracal fuck with this
game I like them you know what I mean so
they'll always give me the opportunity
there so from the beginning they gave me
the opportunity to go in but then when I
was in the interview there was so much
technical shit that I didn't know
because I had just been like six months
coding
you know what I mean and then I failed
and they didn't fucking call me back and
I was like oh man I fucking suck I
should have never even fucking went to
this interview I'm not gonna get hired
I'm not gonna listen that and you start
getting into the zone and I see it from
a lot of people from their comments they
get into the soul of like okay fucking
up again up higher at that job you gotta
be like a fucking prodigy you know what
I mean like and the reality of things is
not everybody is a prodigy now everybody
is you know this fucking Mark Zuckerberg
you know what I mean whatever way you
were after that that six month period
six months I will say I was able to
basically get a job as a junior
developer I was to the point where I
couldn't I couldn't fucking guy and hire
anywhere well it depends on what type
that what type of interview I would get
like if somebody asks me hey show me
your websites then we'll see amazing
websites that I built right but if they
would have told me hey we're gonna have
a whiteboard we want you to explain a
specificity we want you to fucking come
in and do some algorithms I wasn't ready
for that because that's not what I
prepare myself for when I prepare myself
was to build sites
I wasn't preparing myself to be a
programmer you know what I mean like
there's two different things people
there's people that that they prepare
themselves to much like I I see people
going through how you code is fucking
free coke camps JavaScript algorithms
right to get your first job you don't
even need half of the shit that is there
and people spend six months learning all
that shit and your reality you don't
even fucking eat it people go in and
yeah nothing for you but people go in
there fucking
every algorithm people try to go in and
in fucking you know learn every fucking
little cold snippets that people show
online and try to do that and that's
because what they got they don't know
what's their goal if your goal is to get
a job as a web developer what you need
to do is start building pages start
building a bunch of pages and different
types of pages so you could get
comfortable with laying out things on
the page once you're comfortable with
that you're hired
like there's so many jobs for people
right now this yeah like even go ahead
for example says you know like youtubers
or people's they say that they got a job
in three months and in two months and I
didn't even know JavaScript like how
does that happen I just think I just
can't believe them like how did I get a
job in two months three months and they
just don't each Channel and CSS like how
does that happen
I'm not showing right now I'm about to
indeed back huh i'ma show you right now
how does that happen
no emails just oh yeah exactly that's
right
like for example if you watch Christian
always talk that he became in developer
in three months Yakko like like and you
and I know that
JavaScript and jQuery how'd you get did
you get a job without learning
JavaScript like I just I just I just
don't know how and I go on did indeed
comes I always say you know have to know
PHP but yeah you know people people per
hour we I think it's people per hour to
come have you heard of it before people
per hour
alas all desk
you can basically you can like bid for
like you know them html/css type jobs
they're all up on there obviously you
won't get big money for it but it's
practicing it and sign on your CV as
well but if you're looking for that type
of work just to like yeah I'm gonna show
you guys this like right now this is
what everybody who is a brand new
developer somebody who has no experience
no job experience this is what you guys
should be looking for right people
search for front-end developer don't
search for front-end developer because
that's not where you're gonna end up
back right it's gonna be sometimes
you're gonna get it but if you're just
gonna be there waiting for it you gotta
fuckin wait you know what I mean like
what you wanna do is just start working
doesn't matter what led to such HTML
yeah but you see right here you search
HTML email HTML email is like the
easiest way to get in you know it's
annoying you but it's like it's just
HTML tables you know like and these are
a lot of jump start girl you know like
45,000 50,000 just to start you off
you're not gonna die there
you're only gonna start there you know
what I mean like people have to know
what to search for and what to study you
know cuz if you want to become like
machine learning that you know developer
you're gonna fuckin have a lot of
competition of guys that there are
fuckin learning from MIT from four-year
schools like you know really big schools
that you can't compete with them no
fucking Udacity is not gonna teach you
that you know I'll take four years of
just learning like real deep fucking
computer science and four really good
professors you can't compete with those
guys right so you have to know what are
your goals you could get to that point
but it's a
process because you're doing it
self-taught so you have to do it in a
way where you're like okay you climbing
up the ladder you go one step at a time
you say okay I start as an HTML in HTML
email developer then from there I jump
to work for junior front-end developer
then from there I jump into a front-end
developer then from there I jump into
you know a back-end developer then from
there jump to a full stack developer you
know whatever you just keep going up the
ladder you give yourself that time and
just say hey this is just how it is it's
just like every other other job of every
other career is they just teach you you
know the design of HTML emails no I'm
just searching gay but I'm not finding
anything well like I said team treehouse
is like the worst place to to be trying
to learn anything I'm telling you guys
because that's where I started not
everybody's gonna be as lucky as Chris
Shawn yeah like you know I will say
check out udemy sign up for my fucking
website sounds shitty but it's true fuck
I fucking basically I go over all the
bullshit of like HTML CSS everything
that you need because another thing too
which is if you guys whoever's been on
my website has been hearing this I
always say or when certain top is I
always say you don't have to learn
everything because people get stuck on
this thing where they're like they try
to memorize fucking over a hundred
different CSS properties like you can't
remember that by head by your head like
is it possible maybe some losers out
there in fuck hands like that I know
every
Oh CSS property and I should get a crown
you know what I mean like there's gonna
be one of those guys but for the regular
people you just dare try to get a job
right so what you want to do is be able
to see something look at a page and say
okay this thing got a little curve at
the corner so I know if there's a curve
there that must be more the radius so I
got a search for the radius right you're
not gonna be able to remember all sides
of the fucking border radius so you
google border radius generator and
there's a generator for it so you don't
have to remember that nobody's gonna
come in to you and give you a tester
saying how do you do more the radius on
the bottom left nobody's gonna come to
you with that if they do you do not want
to be in that company because they're
just assholes trust me you're gonna be
miserable that's not the place that what
you want to work at what what I'm saying
is you don't have to learn everything in
JavaScript is another thing too if you
look into fucking the windows and you
look into every every method inside of
JavaScript this like Douw million
thousands of fucking methods in there
and in objects in there if you try to go
and try to remember every single one
you're gonna go crazy you only learn
what you need I'll just take the before
for example before I move like to jQuery
and JavaScript like I just have to know
like some variables the variable is a
function and the for loop and the while
loop this is fine for basics what you
learn you gotta know once you jump to
jQuery
you gotta know the basics of JavaScript
and the basics of JavaScript everything
I have a right here because I'm looking
at my curriculum of the things so you
have the numbers you got the syntax of
how to write JavaScript you got strings
you got raised you got
you got functions you got control flow
which is F and L statement in the switch
statement then you have loops and then
loops this a bunch of loops there's the
for loop while loop do wire loop this
for in loop for of loop loops there's
another one I forgot the name of it for
each now you know do you have to
remember every single one no you could
do everything with just a for loop right
so as you get more experience
you're going to learn two other words
but that's with time so as a brand new
developer don't be like oh man I'm
trying to read the whole fucking book of
JavaScript and learn this whole thing
and buy a 500 fucking pages book of like
JavaScript for dummies or some shit and
you don't need that thing what you need
is to just be able to start building
things
all right like nobody cares if you know
every single method in JavaScript nobody
cares about that like for you to get
higher is can you add a class to a div
can you make something disappear can you
create CSS animations like that's it
like it's so simple when you look at it
cuz like one of the things too that I
tell everybody also it's like you know
when you even on team treehouse you get
overwhelmed if you look at the fucking
team treehouse front-end stack fucking
how they call it the trail or the data
for the chart the track right if you
look at that fucking thing that thing is
fucking humongous and you're like man
how long how many hours do I have to put
in to learn over this chain and in
reality a reality you only need about a
good 10 hours to learn HTML CSS so there
everything that you need you know what I
got and then from there from JavaScript
to learn the basics is about five
that's it and there from there is just
about building projects the best thing
to do for people is to build real
projects like you know you create like I
said a real estate you know you go to
the real estate and you say how do I
filter this this items and then you
figure it out with JavaScript and then
you show it to the user on the screen
and then from there once you understand
that you know I don't see how understand
what's going on
jump to jQuery jQuery instead of you
having to write all that JavaScript down
you do it where like three lines of
jQuery you know and and clear house all
what we practice in in JavaScript is
just doing yeah it's very boring
exactly you lose you lose interest I was
at one point I was doing the free code
camp and I like the guy who create a
freak okay I'm super smart and I have
him on my emails because he sends out
emails of like ooh articles and shit
like that
so I like his his freaking campaign but

shit is so boring you're just there just
like you're fucking half of your brain
is frozen and the other half is like
half asleep and you're just going you
know exercise by exercise HTML CSS
JavaScript jQuery fucking algorithms
doing this and that a fucking a bullshit
um I forgot some bullshit I haven't even
been to that website in a while because
I just I felt like I wasn't learning
anything it's the same thing as I was a
coke Adam II so okay here ya go
dichotomy I just read code Academy at
the first and that didn't teach me
anything at least about media queries
and I created like a portfolio website
and it wasn't mobile devices but now
with
with fear house I'm creating my own
blood and it's responsive but I'm just
having some trouble make it like
responsive on white very white screen
like an iMac mobile it's very responsive
he's got a look into containers man put
it put into a container
I give that the page is too big you get
you just gotta say hey there's a
container here the maximum width of this
container is gonna be 1400 or 1200 you
know and then everything just stay
centered and then you have to white
space that's it what all I said you

subscribe to go German what happened to
the Jack I'm gonna mess up all right you
know you know what happened with me when
I first went to Google's messing us up
Magna programming class and then I
wanted to be plus plus morning just take
it step by step
you better go to coding phase calm and
you see on the description there's like
a 50% off coupon code for five hours man
yeah get that get that core especially
the JavaScript one that's the truth I've
been are going over that JavaScript
today or the es6 one no Java JavaScript
course Omar but what would you say I
hear you don't always cut it no some
reason I was saying that people need to
check out your JavaScript chorus cuz I'm
it's been the truth like I've been going
over it today man this sucks
hello why they should
not hear me yeah we can hear you
yeah yeah yeah yeah I hear me now yeah
we hear you yeah
all right so I'm coming coming to the
spot right here should be good we should
get better Wi-Fi oh Jesus
where'd man no thanks for that I'm tip
for searching on indeed I haven't
actually tried that search time so yeah
chicken indeed man yep and freaking arm
what else
indeed Elance Craigslist on our people
be sleeping on Craigslist but
they recruited to also firemen yeah five
of the good one anyone the pro LinkedIn
is like it's not really good quality of
jobs than their it's like a whole bunch
of recruiters and I don't know it's not
really that there's a lot I'm not gonna
make me feel like the jobs are recycled
in there sometimes yeah I just don't
like LinkedIn in general and I just
always felt like if just too much you
know what there's like you you make like
a profile whatever sound like Facebook
or Twitter where it's easy to make this
better
I just don't really like it like I tried
I have a profile but I'll never use it
yo chameleon where're you from um
freaking how you called a shame Hawaii
you talking about now I'm looking at the
chat room right now I don't know what
I'm gonna chat
what do you think about vacations
development like this certification I
don't know I think I mean if you go on a
college right now yeah so if you go to
college just take computer science man
and I taught computer science and
through programming and they want me to
learn C++ but I just didn't get anything
from C++ I find it really like
complicated yeah I know what you mean
I'm working on my a weather app here the
whole week so it's caught you off here
but it's just on the topic of HTML and
CSS and I came across
basically the way I had the layout for
the page it required like a grid I know
you see that by at least three different
ways I know of at least that you can
stop a grid like bootstrap CSS squared
or flips book forever yeah but I've
never actually done it and made it work
on the site before how about it took me
five days right from 8:00 to like five
early evening we'll figure it out and do
one page with like a flexbox grid five
days letters were thin and because I was
going to take it up next time that's one
of the things like I tell people to
because everybody said oh we want to
jump on flexbox in the CSS grades and
all this good stuff right but I finally
that there's more work to do in flexbox
then when just plain we're gonna CSS
when you say hey here's a div here's the
whiff he is a fucking
2% way for 50% whatever right like it's
easier to just build a site like that
right away when you do it with Flex
boxes you're constantly fucking playing
around and finding out which one works
you know like you know a lot of you out
there the easier to make it responsive
that way as well yeah you use media
queries you use media queries and you
use your classes and then usually say
hey I mean look at bootstrap look how
bootstrap did
media queries and that's a great example
of how easy you could do it you know
everybody's makers anyway so yeah
everybody wants to jump on flexbox isn't
and this and that and even see it says
grid and I think it's great I think it's
great that they coming out with new
things but it's like if you already know
how to do it with something else is like
nobody's got like in a company nobody's
gonna come to you and be like oh my god
he's doing it to pee or CSS he should
know flex boxes no no but well people
care about can you build a website
that's it
trust me especially the owners and
project managers what they care about is
getting shit done as soon as possible so
if you're there in a job and you're
fucking doing trial and error with CSS
fucking flex boxes then I look at you
like yo you could have done this shit
fucking four hours ago you know what I
mean
but I guess I'm like here is it finished
yeah exactly it's like I guess I'm a
realist you know what I mean like that's
why people be like Oh Joe shadow he's
just fucking real with it
it's just I'm a realist I don't like
wasting time if this mark rules number
one if I already know how to do it
something like some weight I'm just
gonna do it that way right I'm not gonna
spend a day two days trying to learn
something else because I need to be
productive
people are looking for me to get shit
done I can't spend time on you know
testing shit out let's say if I go in
I'll put in CSX flex boxes on my website
right for the company dealer I go and
put that there and then somebody
customer service calls up and be like
hey no this person is in ie fucking
eight or some shit like that
it doesn't their website is for that
phone yeah now I gotta do it you know
what I mean
I got a deal with people telling me
customer service I owe everybody in ie8
and ie9 they can't fucking see the
website you'd be surprised how many
people still using it is all about
awesome a lot of people any business
that that has been around for a long
time their customer service or service
they primary customers the ones that
come back and always buy for them they
still using old browsers or even if they
use in Chrome they haven't even updated
Chrome or Mozilla like they're using
fucking old computers yeah because a lot
of people gotta still got XP computers
and stuff yeah
that's just how it is man also it's hard
sometimes you want to play with the
latest technology and it's different
when you're doing it for yourself in
your house and for your portfolio
because nobody the people that is gonna
watch it are developers people who have
the latest computers the latest chrome
and it's gonna look great but you know a
company that that has millions of
fucking customers they're not gonna
fucking go for a show man they then they
just not you know they go to 10 hey Joe
are you gonna teach us stuff nah that's
a code that were the teachers are not a
code that's the idea man
I already order like some toys for
little kids that they said maybe you
could teach them how to program with
a MacBook and they're like this little
toys that you build this like little
robots so you could say if if like 3 is
greater than 2 they'll go forward or
like you know if like let's say a string
let's say his name eaten his name is
their e th a and right so that's five
letters so you'd be like Oh Ethan so if
you have five letters how about we
multiply by two how much is it is it
greater than 20 if it's greater than 20
then do something if it's less than that
do something else and you teach them
like that that's that's my plan I like
that really but it's like for little
kids it's pretty cool you know yeah yeah
sound that scratch I want to get my
nephew onto some Raspberry Pi projects
but he just he's too energetic he can't
keep still for shit and don't listen me
you know my nephew we used to be like
that but now he just calmed down
he's more chill yeah well it's not cool
to be like too excited with it yeah
let's say you just gotta be cool man and
