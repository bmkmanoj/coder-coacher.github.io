coding face.com your boys back and not
then did it again
guys listen today's video we're gonna
talk about coal steel news course okay
he just dropped a brand-new Python three
course and we're gonna talk about it
alright you guys this video is brought
to you by viewers like you and people
that support our website coding face
calm go check it out over twenty courses
in there that's gonna guide you to
become a developer from the beginning to
becoming a pro okay guys so your boy
Cole steals back once again dropping
another amazing amazing course I guess
guys listen the guy constantly gives you
very good content I think we should
definitely support him his courses are
usually the best ones on you to me
usually the best ones on udemy so I
would definitely support him his course
right now I think it's like fifteen
dollars which is actually great because
if you guys know about this like you to
me doesn't pay you anything when you
know affiliate links go in and and
everything goes through a lot of times
on the ten dollar course the Creator
actually makes three dollars three four
dollars which really really sucks all
right but like this guy called steel man
he's the man
guys like I'll be honest like I already
bought the course I went over a lot of
stuff there I already know it you know
what I think is really great for you
guys that are looking to get into Python
it's not like I'll say this it's not
like a course that has a million
projects it's more of a course that goes
over the syntax of programming as far as
like Python and that's pretty much it it
has a couple of things you know
algorithms it has a couple of things how
to scrape the internet which is cool
it's great for what it is you know what
I mean but like I said man cold soup
finally he's back I didn't personally I
didn't like the last one that he really
which was about you know against the web
developer bootcamp part 2 where which I
react and a whole bunch of other stuff
it was like a whole bunch of guys in
there that we're not really cold steel
you know what I mean so I wasn't a huge
fan of that one and I think he kind of
noticed it and another thing that it's
cool about the whole course is like I
feel to be honest with you guys I feel
like pretty much everything that I said
here he kind of listened and this is one
of the things that I tell people all the
time man like you don't know who's
watching right I've said this a million
times and this is how I make my own
courses I come in and give people
projects I make sure that people come in
and start coding people go into udemy
courses and they follow along like it
was Netflix right so this time around
what he did was he made it interactive
because we're view to me you could come
in and basically test the people and
know especially with Python Python
you're cool you know compiler anywhere
in the browser right so Python right so
he basically what he did was he teach
you one thing and I gotta say functions
right and then I ran after teaching you
functions he comes in and gives you a
little test on it and basically tests
you to see if you actually understood it
if you could come in and like print your
name or little things like that but to
be honest with you guys it's all about
the syntax right this whole course is
about learning Python the syntax and
it's great because it has it for Mac it
has it for Windows and I know a lot of
you guys yeah I really want to you know
get into Python personally myself you
know I'm I love Python for what it is
for jobs as web developers I haven't
seen that many jobs out there but if you
want to grow as a developer later on and
you say hey man I wanna do what
development I first just to get my feet
wet in the car
you know the community the industry
they're from they are going to jump into
you know doing machine learning becoming
a data scientist you know creating
applications creating you know cool
stuff like Instagram how they have you
know stuff like snapchat with their face
and you could you know go in their image
manipulation like if you want to get
into that right later on I think Python
is great for that
okay personally as a web developer I
think Python is not really worried it's
at when it comes to web development but
if you are somebody who wants to become
a development not just a web developer
somebody who loves to code somebody who
enjoys this and enjoys programming I
think this course is really good for you
guys especially for people that don't
know how to program or anything I think
the course is like what like $10 $15
something like that it's worth it you
know what I mean I'll be honest it's
worth it is very well put you know it's
broken down into sections it has a lot
of different quizzes and problems to
solve
so reality is a very interactive course
okay so I would definitely tell you guys
to go check it out okay
so yeah man that's a quick review about
the course if you're into it let me know
leave a comment if you're not into it
also leave a comment but yeah and by the
way just in case if you're watching this
if you're somebody who started to get
into web development and you want to get
all the core things check out my website
: face comm pretty much you basically
support your boy for coming in here and
give you guys great content and at the
same time it's not free is literally
it's like evil and change you know I
mean I come in give you amazing content
coming here show you some love you show
me some love by supporting the website
and at the same time we get to also help
out other people's and give them stuff
for free the people that can't afford
things I give it up for free you know
what I mean like people be forgetting
that sometimes like I literally so many
people hit me up like for any of
Phillipines like they hit me up like man
like to be honest with you I don't even
have a credit card what do I do I hold
them down you know that's just how it is
the universe pays me back at the end of
the day it's not that service all right
so anyways when it's a boy job back at
it again coding phase comm make sure you
subscribe go join the community on
coding phase comm on the top menu there
should be a section that says chat so
when you click on chat that brings you
to the discord community where we
basically answer questions we help each
other how other people you know any type
of problems you might have people come
in and give you advice on it you know
it's it's always cool to be able to be
part of a community not just learning by
yourself in your house in front of your
computer in a basement you know darkness
not you want to be out here you want to
be able to communicate to other
developers and and ask questions so you
don't have to make the same mistakes
that they already did all right so it's
your boy Joe back at it again coding
face.com your boys back and I done did
it again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
