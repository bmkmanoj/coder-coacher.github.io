again some late night livestream okay
random guys today we're gonna do a
little quick video you know this is a
gift from me to you guys for tomorrow
morning basically we're gonna talk about
free code camp versus coding boot camps
live alright so I have a couple of
basically all of this comes from
somebody who sent me an email and she
basically told me like hey man me and my
wife aren't thinking about getting into
this and you know she wants me to go to
a boot camp I'm like I don't even know
if I should because I'm not really you
know I don't know if I really want to
get myself into that like that so I mean
this is pretty much out the questions
right okay so I'm gonna share the screen
real quick so like that we could
actually read it mind you are do any
glasses guys so so just in case I guess
not so first question is can I use free
cocaine as like intro family familiarity
practice if so what sections are worth
going through you know they got millions
I'm almost done with HTML CSS do I jump
to JavaScript let me see what else do I
do you mentioned you to me is that a
good investment to learn and how
hands-on the projects are let me see
what else you see my wife wants me to do
a boot camp I'm wary the financial
advancement the financial investment and
what the end result would be pace is
also fast I assume let's see what else
she says you think doing something like
you to me is it a good baby step okay so
let's start with those two big questions
very simple the first question is is
more like man can I use free cocaine yes
you could use free cocaine
you know some for some reason people
swear like I hate freak okay no freak Oh
camp is the same thing as coke atom e
same thing that is a solo learn same
thing as everything that you see online
right it's pretty much a place for
people who don't even know if they wanna
code right if you don't even know if you
really want to get into this is a
perfect place to start right go in there
try it out see if you like it if you
don't like it then you move on to
another career or something else right
now like I said you you could go in and
try it out now are you gonna learn
everything in there
hell no I'll be honest you're not gonna
learn everything you have to actually
use free code camp with a whole bunch of
other resources free code camp is great
for like let's say you are on your phone
and even the same thing a solo learn
you're learning HTML CSS are you taking
the train go ahead go on free Co camp
try some other stuff out play around
with it same thing i solo learn calm go
ahead play around with it is it like a
place where you're gonna go in and be
like this is all I need
no it's not it's not gonna happen like
that it doesn't work like that you know
what I mean like a freak Oh camp has
stuff that is just like the
documentation you know what I mean like
it's not showing you how to build a
website how to you know how to set up
everything how to set up your
environment how to go in there you know
from zero to actually building a full
application it doesn't teach you that it
has like little taste of little things
here and there but it doesn't teach you
that now what else do i do you mentioned
you to me so yes you could go in and try
something like cold steel's course it's
on the description even to this day I
still have that course there because
it's legit it's like for the people that
don't even know anything and they don't
know about what development they don't
know about HTML CSS no other stuff you
know you could go in there and try it
out you could definitely try out and you
know cold steel and you're gonna build a
website you know there's a lot of stuff
in there that you know it's not perfect
nothing is perfect right but at the same
time is like you're actually building a
website from start to finish right so
now of course you could go to my website
why don't you say hey just go to my
website because it sounds like I'm being
a douchebag and I'm like self promoting
just like go ahead check my website no
it's like there's a lot of other
resources too you know what I mean so
it's like if you wanna check out my site
I go over all the things that you need
to become a developer right but you know
how this some people might say hey Joe I
don't even know if you're that guy cool
cold steel is that guy you know what I
mean it's like there's certain people
that you just look at the middle oh yeah
that's that guy he looks like a web
developer so I'll trust him so you know
what I mean so go ahead take cold
Steel's course it's pretty much the same
thing only thing is it's different way
of teaching the way I'll teach it I
teach it more in a real-life environment
he teach you more in a enclosed
environment where there's no mistakes
there's no errors it's just everything
seems perfect to me
it gives a force like a freak look of
what what development is I like to keep
the mistakes I like to keep the human
errors I like to keep all those things
in there so the person can understand
like okay there's how you debug things
this is how you find the error this is
how what happens when you bump into like
you know a little block on the road and
how you get over it we have different
you know styles of teaching all right
now you say hey I want to get into boot
camps and this is Annette but I'm
worried about the financial investment
myself too
listen I actually went to a quote
unquote like Institute back in the days
for like all your research and stuff
right it's the same thing they do with
boot camps they come in they teach you
in like three months
they teach you all the basics and they
give you a little pat in the back like
hey you're ready to become a developer
well you could you could have learned
that in your house you know what I mean
like all the things that they're gonna
teach you in a bootcamp is exactly the
same thing that they're gonna teach you
in like cold steel's course on my
website or whatever you can find any
other course out there
they let teach you the basics nobody's
gonna come in and
make you this amazing developer in three
months it doesn't work like that you
know the people that come in to boot
camps a lot of times are pretty much
people who are lying to themselves you
know they'll go in there and be like oh
man I don't even I'm not even sure if I
could start applying for jobs it's like
bro you could have been applying for
jobs a long time ago but you needed that
little boost of energy and a little
boost of confidence behind your back
somebody come in and just go like hey
here's a little BS certificate that you
came to this boot camp that person he
was already a good developer you know
what I mean so don't let uh you know
don't let those things stop you now who
does a boot camp really work for let's
say somebody Johnny the the mechanic I
was bringing up Johnny the mechanic or a
James the truck driver right so Johnny
the the mechanic comes in and it's like
man I want to leave this job I want to
start somewhere I want to start becoming
something else in my life right well
basically he signs up to a boot camp he
knows the little basics of here and
therefore html/css
somehow he gets through the prep work
now he's at a boot camp right it works
for him a lot of times because that
person really wants to do something with
themselves all right and it's the same
thing that anybody could have done on
their own the only difference is now you
have deadlines now you have things to do
at the end of the week you have a whole
week to go over things like let's say
for example you have a project at the
end by Friday you got a deliver on it if
now you look stupid in front of another
20 other or you know or developers who
want to our basically students who want
to become developers right so it's like
you're holding yourself accountable it's
like going to a gym alright but with a
trainer right there's guys that's gonna
go in there no matter what they're gonna
work out and get diesel right but you
might actually need somebody to be like
come on man one more one more don't give
up you know lift that weight up you know
come on give me one more one more lap if
you need that then that boot camp is
perfect for you if you feel like hey man
I want to
become a developer I don't need to
spring and give $20,000 to somebody else
what do I need to do that for when I
could come in and literally do that
myself all the resources are there you
know what I mean so that's my answer to
you on those things what else let's see
what else she got in here I'm just
trying to figure out the best track to
be able to do well what you said design
a website be real were applicable okay
so I'm gonna go back to what I usually
say about this and this is something
that was created by the real tough candy
I'm always gonna give her credit on that
because it's basically the perfect world
and the perfect word is basically saying
tutorial heaven right people could come
in and do something like reco camp
everything is perfect everything works
you know you're not having any issues
and you just constantly taking tutorials
tutorials tutorial satorious tutorials
you could fall into that you could be
here for two years and still not become
a developer but the only way that you're
gonna become a developer is by coming in
and say hey let me look at zero calm
right how does it look calm the real
estate website work can I rebuild it and
rebuild all the features that it has you
break it down you break it down by step
start doing the HTML CSS then from there
come in at the interactivity with
JavaScript then from there you say okay
I don't know the back end so now you
take a back-end course and you
understand how the vacuum works and how
it communicates with the front-end and
then you work on some databases and then
now you go in and find out a framework
like laravel Ruby on Rails Django what
else
Adonis Jas you know you find those
frameworks you build your website right
and the reason why I say a framework
because the last thing that you want to
do is fall directly into something like
Express fall directly into something
like go Lang fall directly into a whole
bunch of different things out there that
you might find even crystal Lang you
don't want to fall into those because
those don't have a structure when you're
becoming a developer you need the
structure to say hey this is how the
views work this is that how the
controllers work this is how the models
work this is how the website works so
your brink will actually come in and put
all those things in order okay if you
come in and you say hey man I gotta
start doing Express and Express you
gotta go in there and find the library
for by a body parcel you gotta find a
lot library for cookies you got a final
a library for sessions that doesn't work
that's not the perfect way to be you
know to be learning what development
that's like actually harder than what it
needs to be so my advice is make sure
you find a framework doesn't matter
which one you want
laravel Ruby on Rails Django Adonis Jas
find one that has a structure so you can
learn how to become in a developer right
now what else she says oh let me see
what else so I hope I gave you enough
background Dada Thank You events for
your time and thank you for your honesty
and realness I know his opinions from
listening I'm researching a lot a lot of
YouTube videos cuz look just as much as
we newbies tried to break in research
break in and research and we got we got
a research yaa - right so we got a
research yeah right meaning like she got
a research mean she got a research
whoever she watches and I agree with you
100% right you got a research everybody
you got to do the research you can't
just come into the internet and be like
hey man this person is giving me the
gospel this is not gospel you know what
I mean like me when I come here I'm
telling you from my experiences from the
things that I wish somebody would have
told me because a lot of people come in
you know there's no youtuber out there
that's just honest there there isn't
I got be honest like most of these
youtubers are like super PC pretty much
they come in to have their own personal
opinions on things I'm just honest I see
going on in the industry I see what
happened to me as a self-taught
developer a lot of people come in and
they have computer science degrees a lot
of people come in and they have you know
a background in you know in different
fields you know some of them were
software developers and you know they're
not web developers and they're not
self-taught developers now who will you
listen to will you listen to somebody
who basically is like hey he went to
college he did the whole process he he
did everything in his own way all were
you listen to somebody that pretty much
was in your same shoes that you had
right now and it's just like hey man
listen to me so you don't make my
mistakes do I care if you listen to me
no right so you're 100% true and on that
because you have to do your research I
tell people all the time I hear people
constantly sing PHP is dead PHP and
WordPress the maximum one you could do
is 65,000 dollars a year
mind you this person or this couple of
people they're they just started
becoming a developer like they've been
coding in their house for like two years
they just got hired you get what I'm
saying like you know it's like you got a
do the research it's like you're a
junior developer you just got hired like
why would I listen to you it doesn't
make sense
you got what I'm saying that's how I
look at things so it's like I do my
research I look at everybody look at
people's opinions you got to go out
there and start looking around at the
industry whole not just blogs not just
YouTube not just you know things that
people come in and leave on the comments
people talk a lot of this right like
they they do a lot of this but it's not
what's really happening like I don't
care about like what somebody comes in
and tells me hey man Ruby on Rails is
dead and then you you press them then
you ask them why is it that because
there's no jobs then you come in and you
put in head-to-head what they were
saying this is better because this has
more jobs
you put a head-to-head and then they
tell you oh no but they're looking for
senior developers and then I come in I
show them
freaking bunch of emails that they're
looking for junior developers all over
the country I get scouted basically I'm
over here like you know when you don't
work and you like a developer you pretty
much get scouted constantly by by
recruiters all over the country I get a
whole bunch of email my Joe Santos
Garcia at gmail it's like a bad dot that
everybody passes around right all these
recruiters pass it around like literal
iterally like they take my email pass it
around and basically they send me emails
from all over the country right and it's
like I'm constantly singing hey Ruby a
rails developer like for the beginning
of like last year like around like May
around there started seeing a flood of
emails of like constantly like Ruby or
rails developer we're looking for Ruby
or rails right and then I guess in this
whole time they couldn't fill in a lot
of the positions so now what they're
doing is they're like hey man you know
what junior level positions for
developers like just they try to hire
people like if they can't find somebody
that is on a mid-level it's at a senior
level they're gonna start looking for
the junior level positions so meaning
just somebody who just started write
because they need that extra hand this
is what people don't understand when you
work in this industry and you get major
projects right sometimes you might come
in and get a project for nine months or
half a year two years and then from
there the project is done and then you
move on to another company right but at
least for those nine months or two years
you have constant work that's just how
it is and if you're smart you're
constantly learning so by the time that
you don't have a job or somebody comes
in and tells you hey man we're gonna
freakin we're gonna let you go because
the project is done we appreciate it
you're like cool I already know react I
already know angular I already know
freaking you know nodejs already know
Python I already know Ruby on Rails I
know PHP so pretty much any job that
they throw at you you could say hey I
could take it right cuz you always want
to be the type of developer that has a
hands-on
of everything you don't have to be a
master of anything at all to be honest
with you you don't have to be a master
of anything as long as you know the
concept of what the concepts of web
development you're gonna be able to be
good okay once you know the concepts of
let's say how the Dom works how HTML CSS
works you're good in the front-end okay
doesn't matter what framework they throw
at you doesn't matter how the industry
changes you know the concepts you
already know how JavaScript works if you
know how web development works in
general doesn't matter what back in
language they throw at you you're still
gonna be good okay so like I said do
your research I'm constantly saying that
to people do your research look online
don't believe everything that somebody
tells you you know somebody might tell
you hey man WordPress is dead PHP is
dead freaking what else Java is dead and
it's like wait what like are you serious
like people will come in and tell you
like like straight up like people come
in and tell you a whole bunch of BS for
no frickin reason and then as a junior
developer you're looking through you
know the online and web sites trying to
do your research and and something might
come in and just give you the wrong
information that might set you back you
know what I mean like I think start
doing like you know back-end development
for like two years almost three years
because in my head I was like oh man
that's difficult I don't want to do that
when I started doing the backend I was
like you know how much money I left out
like my first two years of this like you
know me working in an industry like
there was so many times that you know
even developers will tell me we're like
oh I like certain jobs that I will have
right they would tell me hey could you
do something my sequel and I'm gonna own
now all I know is the front-end you know
it's like you want me to do some
JavaScript I'm there for you buddy but
it's like you know how much money I left
out you know what I mean so it's like
you gotta come in here and and just work
hard man and like as far as like you
know going back to the first title of
this this whole video which is gonna be
hey free coke amp vs. a coding book
which way should you go number one
freako camp it's not the you know it's
not the place to be like hey man I'm
gonna learn everything you're not gonna
learn everything freako campus like an
extra tool you know it's like you could
go in and go to a coding bootcamp and
still use free cocaine it's just like an
extra tool for you so you could practice
and this and that but it's not like a
place where you gotta be like man all I
did was free coke camp and I became
number one developer you know it's like
it's not like you went into like freakin
a Pokemon Trading grounds like oh you
know I caught them all out here man
I went in there man and you know it's
like I was in the free coke amp world
you know free coke can't blame you know
and I just went in there I caught all
the pokemons you know so just go in
either you decide if you really want to
spend the money personally me I will not
tell nobody to go to any bootcamp for
the simple reason that is I caveman
$15,000 that's $5,000 eight fifteen
thousand dollars five thousand dollars
per month to pay somebody for something
that you could have learned on yourself
all by yourself in your house and it's
like pay yourself that if you feel like
you really need the motivation put
$15,000 on your desk and be like I'm not
touching that until I become a developer
give yourself that let's see if that's
not motivation if that's not motivation
you don't need to be doing this straight
up you know what I mean and for the
people who are going to to boot camps
man like you know a lot of you guys are
super talented a lot of you guys are
already developers a lot of you guys are
already computer science majors right
you're computer science major what the
hell are you doing on a boot camp why
you need somebody to give you a little
pat on the back and tell you hey man you
know now you are a developer guys you
know grow some some you know cojones
grow that you know it's like stop being
like you know it's like some people that
you know they go to college and and they
spend like you know man like they don't
want to go to work right there's people
who do this man people go to college
they go into get
bachelor's soon is about to graduate
like oh wait mom dad I'm going for my
masters and it's like okay cool
okay little Johnny go to get your
master's and as I okay cool he got his
master's finally about to finish his
master's I wait hold on mom mom dad hold
on hold on mom I'm getting my PhD okay
now now the kid is getting his PhD ok
cool Johnny go ahead okay okay mom dad
I'm gonna get my doctorate okay cool
Johnny go ahead get your doctorate
degree and let's see you're gonna become
a college professor sign go ahead soon
as they bout to graduate from the
doctors as I hold on mom and dad hold on
I think I'm gonna switch careers people
do this all the time because they they
don't feel comfortable they not secure
themselves to be like hey man I'm done
with school I'm ready for the real world
I'm ready to become my own man I'm ready
to become my own woman you don't need
somebody to come in there you know a
freakin Shonda the the hipster from from
Williamsburg who just he didn't even go
to a boot camp he didn't even go to
college you know a lot of which is
hilarious to me same thing that's how
you know a lot of you guys is like man
this guy's in there that are teaching
you that never went to college never
went to a boot camp and yet they're
teaching you who is like the guinea pig
who is like hey man you listen I'm
special I could do it on my own and
you're not you have to come in here and
I have to teach you I have to hold your
neck until you learn this stuff you
don't need this man you get what I'm
saying like it's kind of ridiculous man
you don't need somebody to hold your
yeah you know hold you from the back and
be like okay man stay in front of this
computer if you really want to become a
developer you become a developer this is
not a thing where people come in and be
like man we gotta close to close the
doors man this is not like I'm sorry I'm
laughing about this but this is not like
a freaking sweatshop in Nepal you know
what I mean were they closed the doors
and the
Factory and be like okay guys everybody
gotta make some so freakin uh
Jordan's right now everybody gonna make
some Nikes until you pass out like nah
man you don't need somebody to come in
and lock you into a room and tell you
you gotta stay in here until you become
a developer you don't need that you get
what I'm saying I hope people understand
what I'm trying to do here I hope people
understand I'm trying to help people out
and I hope people understand I'm trying
to save people money like the people
that be hitting me up is it's not you
know it's not the people that can afford
to throw away $20,000 $15,000 you know
what I mean I guess people that are
switching careers because they need this
job they need this opportunity that
they're about to get but they're not
here because they could just throw it
away there's people out there like that
they'd be like hey man you know you know
freaking my granddad my grandma you know
they got me a little trust fund you know
if I wanted to go to a boot camp Michael
go to boot camp if you're nine that
situation
or if you're not like let's say somebody
who's already established in this world
you don't need to even be looking at a
boot camp you should be looking the
other way like you should try that you
should look at that like like you know
like Dracula looks like the at the cross
like soon as that shows up boot camp def
Mountain whatever and I even wanna you
know sit on this mount in our free
whatever company shows up on on YouTube
right full-stack Academy any company
that shows up on YouTube so did you see
that you were like click X me out get me
out of here this should be like the X
the the freaking cross for you you know
what I mean like you shouldn't be
looking at that man straight up because
to spend that much money it's like you
starting negatively you know what I mean
like me I'll be honest I I started out
of plus when I got my first job as a
developer everything that I got was plus
was profit that's how I looked at it
because I didn't know what the hell I
spent I spent less than $50 in my web
development you know beginning saying
that's all I need it
fifty dollars in my time right my time
is valuable
nobody's gonna give me that time back
but I put it in and at the end you know
paid off I'm a my a millionaire no am i
comfortable yes I'm comfy you got on
saying out here without you know without
shape-up late night one o'clock in the
morning doing a video I'm comfy you you
know what I mean like if you like to
live comfy in this world and I have to
be worried about like man how am I gonna
pay my bills tomorrow oh my god you know
what if my my factory shuts down oh my
god what if my my company lays off
workers you don't need it man you know
what I mean so you already know sorry I
hit you with the hit you with the sauce
you know but yeah man go ahead do your
research don't follow everybody here on
YouTube
a lot of these people just they just
don't know what the hell they're talking
about they just not honest a lot of
times they're not honest a lot of times
they are misinformed a lot of times they
just don't have enough research they
don't do the research people are talking
about frameworks and and stuff like
they've never even used you know people
you see them to haven't even touched a
computer in over ten years and they
giving advices people who just got hired
and are giving advice like how you just
got hired
you can't give advice you know what I
mean like me and you are in the same
level that's how I look at this I hate
I'm a freaking junior developer who is
learning at home and you just got hired
tomorrow I get hired too it's like how
are you giving me advice it doesn't make
sense yeah but anyways man yeah from
here on I said the video is gone now
we're just gonna hang out with the
people for a little bit before I go to
sleep I hope I answered all your
questions and just helped you out a
little bit you know what I mean like
anything you guys want to talk about and
we look at the chatroom see who's here
live with me
but yeah man and I'm telling everybody
guys
I'm not hating a frico camp I'm not
hating on boot camps i hating on
anything i want people to actually
succeed I don't need the clout I don't
need to be popular I don't need to be
getting money from people from not going
to a boot camp I don't need it to be
honest with you guys like this is like
me just informing you what has happened
to me and what has happened to other
people and it's like I'm a self-taught
developer this is how things work you
either come in here you bust your ass
and work hard or you end up paying
somebody man money you know it means a
people is paying $500 for course an
introductory course people are paying
$400 you could get yourself swindle in
you know what I mean like it happens so
it's like you gotta do your research you
gotta make sure find out if you really
want to do a boot camp if you're
somebody who's comfortable and you got
money like that you can say hey man if I
fail in this and I throw you know twenty
thousand dollars a day it's not gonna
hurt my my bank account cool go ahead to
a boot camp if you feel like hey man I'm
over here like if I don't work tomorrow
African you know what I mean if I don't
worry tomorrow I can't pay my rent and
isn't that like you you shouldn't even
be looking at a boot camp straight up
like it doesn't make sense you might as
well go to a college in your
neighborhood that's a like straight up
I'm being honest you know that means so
anyways man so who's in here man before
I go to sleep I've been making videos
for hours man yeah I'm surprised people
is up right now Sunday 65 people right
now
let me see them see Jim I'm currently
doing an unpaid internship May I will
get my associates in computer science
what kind of pay it I hope for an
internship experience and associates
degree listen you could go if you have
the projects man if you got the projects
you got a nice portfolio you show that
you actually know how to build anything
that people throw at you you could get
50,000 to 60,000 starting and there like
six months later you apply to another
place and you go get more money it's all
up to you you know some people might
stay in a company one year to see how it
goes and you know to get their skills
and then later on they move on me
personally when I first got hired and my
first company I just went in there for
three months and I doubled up you know
what I mean I went in there once I got
that that little a little stamp in there
that told me hey man this person's been
working here I jumped ship you know what
I mean
that's what I did I said cool I'm out of
here
time to get some real money you know so
that's my advice to you let me see who
else is in here okay so I'm gonna start
shattering out people so you know
somehow they made it to the live live
chat room we got Naveen we got David
yang David yang what up man I haven't
seen you in a couple of days man you
been you've been lost pearl we got
Kelvin Davis we got Joe house we got
Dennis Odom we got a video we got
Yamamoto Yamamoto some serious money
wells the big tuna
goes gobbling John dis la ramsey Jordan
David Donaldson Pablo why ya Pablo I
says I didn't like free cocaine but it
seems like si
to have a very great community yes it
has an amazing community I think the
best part about freako campus the
community right it's the people are
there people that you know they hold you
accountable like hey if you say you
working on a project you know you could
get in contact with somebody do some
collaboration like stuff like that you
know it's cool for that but am I gonna
tell somebody like that's all you need
for you know to become a web developer
hell no that's not all you need you need
a lot of stuff and you need time let me
see what else Michael Hardin Singh here
over Neil let me see what else over Neil
says free coke em algorithm scripting is
great for learning JavaScript object
oriented programming yes I agree with
that if you want to learn JavaScript and
you want to learn some algorithms go
ahead play around with freako camp like
I said it's a great place to practice
it's not a place to learn web
development like it's just not it's not
the place to go in there but I hear how
long I know everything about web
development it doesn't work like that
guys it's like a great place to just
practice let me see what else for real
if anyone wanted to learn whatever I
don't see your website I mean people
come to my website if they want man you
know I just put
I put the things in there I put it and
at the end of the video and like hey man
come to the website : face calm that's
it you subscribe if you want so now all
the things that you see me here and tell
you about and like just being honest and
showing you like real projects that's
what you're gonna get right I'm not
gonna come in and and give you stuff
like dairy and you know the history of
JavaScript what year was it frickin
creating did you know that JavaScript
was created in one week no I'm not gonna
go in there and and tell you all of that
you know what I mean like we here to
start coding we hit to start making
projects are still we still you know
knocking things out that's it that's all
I do on my website if you feel like hey
man you wanna get a solid portfolio and
you feel like hey you want to start
getting real life experience then you
come to my website alright when people
ask me hey who do you recommend you know
I'm not gonna be like hey man recommend
myself now man that's all go to co steel
man go check that out
when you're done with that if you want
to you come to my website you check me
out right but you know just I still feel
like a like it's like some douche thing
to be like hey man go to my website you
know like oh no I still feel weird about
it like it's not like I want to be doing
doing that you know it's like if it was
up to me like straight up I'll be honest
like if if I was like at the level of
like traversing media we're like a
hundred thousand subscribers and like
you know cashing in you know cause it's
like I think about it like this like I
don't know his own his business and how
much he may soar or anything but I'll be
honest like I make about like from
YouTube six hundred dollars and I got
like six hundred dollars a month right
which is not enough to maintain my
family's not enough to so help tomorrow
and pay for all of my bills and my way
of life like it it just doesn't even do
a little think all it does it pay
for taxes that's how I look at it right
so 600 dollars and that's a 10,000
subscribers right now imagine to me what
I'm thinking when I calculated if I was
to get to like the level of traversing
meeting every you know like those big
guys they're making like a hundred
thousand so I multiply six hundred times
let's say 15 so that's like nine
thousand dollars a month right
nine thousand dollars a month I'll be
like hey guys everything is free Mike
you know what I mean like I don't even
want to be telling people like hey man
we're gonna do a subscription like I'll
be like yo it's free straight up like
for $9,000 that's worth that's worth the
the time and a lot of stuff that I do
you know what I mean like I've it okay
cool
there's no point of even charging
anybody cuz even right now to this day I
still get people that hit me up from all
type of parts of the world that be like
bro
I don't even have a credit card what do
I do I still give them access to my
website right but excuse me
but it's like you know dudes gotta pay
bills
unfortunately I live a living you know
comfortable but I wish I was like you
know I wish I was like already like to
the level of my traversing media and
like Derek badness and those guys like
if I get to that level it's a rap you
know what I mean like it's gonna be
kumbaya all year long everything is
completely free 100% if I will get to
that point but let's see what happens
let me see many boot camps offering
girls serious discounts to attend yeah a
lot of girls sometimes they get our
discounts a lot of schools man so let me
see what else what else what else is in
here ghosts goblins laughing about the
Pokemon training class
how to catch them all you gonna say like
how to catch him or the bootcamp you
know like anybody comes up with a
bootcamp name nowadays you know what I
mean so I'm just reading everybody's
comment the ones that I missed out when
I was talking Lori Holt says lucky for
me my litecoins in December before the
crash paid for my boot camp man congrats
man
personally I would've still told you boy
stay your ass home you don't need to be
spending no litecoin money or no boot
camp man I'm being honest like it just
doesn't make sense man like if you ever
been to a boot camp and especially as a
developer right somebody who already
works in the industry you like I've been
to boot camps I've been to like to boot
camps here in New York City well I don't
live in New York no more but back when I
was in New York City I went to two boot
camps so see what it was all right and
go to meetups and stuff like that and
see what they're working on and see
their curriculum and I'm like wait you
guys are teaching this and like 3 weeks
in and it's like you can learn that
in like two days in cold steel's course
you get what I'm saying like you can
learn that and coast your scores in two
days like why do you need a boot camp
like you get what I'm saying so that's
where for me I'm just like it doesn't
make sense I just look at them I'm like
it's just not worth the money at all
because people start up - in their
careers you want to start positive you
don't want to start in - because it's
like it's like the same thing as going
to college some people they go to
college and they want to be like here
i'ma go too you know freakin Duke
University and I'm a Kemal where $300
thousand dollar debt like those most of
those people are never gonna pay that
 off unless you come from a company
or a company a family who has money most
of those people are never gonna paid off
that you know freaking student loan like
you just not a lot of people are not
gonna pay that off so that means for the
rest of your life you're gonna be
freaking you know you're gonna be like
in debt to something so it's like no
matter how much you you earn you still
gotta pay like $1,500 a month to so
stupid student loan so let me see Joe
how hard was it to get your first
full-time job I think for me it was a
little bit harder because I did it like
the unconventional way like I didn't I
didn't want to go to like no like
regular company and you know I didn't
want to go to no internships which were
not paying right I didn't want to go to
no like smaller companies at first I was
like oh I'm gonna go to like you know
tumblr i'ma go to Twitter and i'ma go to
like you know freakin a whole bunch of
other companies like I had a list right
I went on online I was like where are
all the major startups in New York City
and like I was applying to all of them
right and then looking back at it I'm
like yo I could have probably gotten a
job right away if I would have went to
just a regular company like you don't
need to go working at a big company like
Oh Twitter you don't need it
your first job shouldn't even be there
because I feel like you still gotta
prove yourself and even know if you want
to be in this industry
cuz you can you could like coding in
your house but you might hate working
with other developers in in a work
environment people don't talk about that
you know what I mean like going to
meetings you know kissing ass doing
order the dumb that people want you
to do you know freaking
scrum agile and all this dumb that
you gotta do it in companies you know
dealing with designers who think they're
like God's gift to you and it's like
sometimes you just don't want to deal
with that you know so I think you I
don't even think that people should
start like in major companies until they
build up their themselves and see if
they even want to be doing this like in
the long term you know Kaseem of taro
says joe are you 100% entrepreneur yes
sir 100% entrepreneur everything that I
do is on my own my own money game cash
right now currently I'm setting up a
thing here where I'm getting to know the
industry of here Connecticut getting to
know who are my competitors when it
comes to like web development in digital
agencies I have a couple of designers
that I know so what I'm planning on
doing is besides what I'm doing here on
YouTube besides what I'm doing on my
website besides what I'm doing on my
other personal sites where are
generating money passively besides that
I wanna like you know start getting my
own private clients here in Connecticut
and start knocking out websites because
I'll be honest like this is cool
teaching online is cool and it's great
and helping people out and making money
passively but it's not challenging you
know what I mean
I still need to get challenged so for me
to still continue loving web development
I have to get challenged so the only way
to get challenges when a client comes in
and tells you hey can you build me your
freaking I don't know bill me or Airbnb
in two weeks that's a challenge that's
something that I feel like oh man can I
do it can I get the designers working
can I knock it out can I still a hire
extra developer and you know those
things challenge me so I still gotta
challenge myself you know cuz even brain
now like I just moved over here
why like like 15 days here 14 13 days
and I'm already feeling like okay I'm
kind of bored with it in the sense of
like I want to get challenged I wanna
you know find out what the new meetups
is I get to know new developers here so
it's like it's a lot of stuff that I'm
doing you know a lot of people they
swear man yeah I reading at I be saying
I wish and says man that's a huge waste
waste of time for $600 yeah that's why
I'm telling people like you know what I
mean like I'm here right for 600 bucks
when I think about it the amount of time
that I put into YouTube the amount of
time that I put into hanging out with
you guys talking in a chatroom listen I
leave out of here with $600 from YouTube
like business now I'm not coming in here
for my benefit this is not for me to be
like hey guys like this is how much you
freaking you know be good
nah like I feel like maybe I should even
showy I don't even know if I should show
it cuz I know sometimes they don't want
you to show it or something like that on
YouTube okay maybe I'll show this let me
see if I show this alright I'll show
this okay so what you're seeing right
now is about the whole month of January
alright so pretty much as you guys can
see some days is like hey I made 46
dollars the whole frickin day
but in matte hour is putting Matt time
on coating putting Matt time on freakin
editing videos shooting videos
reshooting it because sometimes things
don't come out the right way or
sometimes the microphone that every
or so that you gotta rerecord yourself a
couple of times for like 600 bucks like
literally the money that I make from
YouTube is just to pay taxes like it's
hilarious man
so yeah it is funny I'd be saying you
know a lot of you guys probably make
more money than me as far as YouTube you
know what I mean like this is kind of
ridiculous but I love him and I get to
hang out with you guys I get to chill
with you guys and you know what I mean
and if I was to show you that you to me
because people somebody sent me an email
they're like man you must make so much
cake from you to me and I'm like bro
like like I'll make three dollars out of
every freaking course that sells like
that doesn't make no money like that's
not that's not enough to pay like
everything that I have at all
my best least now I paid my and I
don't like I don't do no leasing man
leasing is renting a car that's not your
car my is my shame you gotta say
like that's mine you know I could put I
could change the paint on it I could do
whatever I want I put in as much two
miles I as I want nothing limits me you
know even though leasing a car has its
pros and cons but leasing a car is is
renting it it's like it's not yours you
don't want that so yeah man why did you
move out of New York City house and job
market near city where you live versus
where you live now New York City got
everything man New York City got a whole
bunch of jobs compared to here
Connecticut like that's why people I was
looking online like people come here for
like two hours from where I live to go
to New York City to go work over there
every single morning and then they come
back another two hours to come back home
like because there's a lot of jobs in
New York City here in Connecticut is a
lot this jobs but it's not the same that
was New York City core Fe
getting the getting the first job is not
as hard as maintaining it improving you
can deliver as much as computers a
computer science graduate or an
experienced developer I don't know what
you mean by that
guys listen a computer science graduate
I'll being honest doesn't mean anything
it means you you know the basics you
know the things a lot of the those guys
like they have good training when it
comes to like data structures or
learning algorithms they learn how
computers work like from the inside and
out like how the ones and zeros or
hexadecimal the whole shebang they
learned all that stuff right but when it
comes to web development they don't know
 like I'm being honest they come in
and be like oh I know my sequel yeah
good for you but can you build a website
a lot of those fresh graduates they
don't know anything and that's why a lot
of them go to boot camps which is
ridiculous it's like you go to a
university spend so much money
number one and then once you come out
you can't find a job as a software
developer so then you say hey I'm gonna
try to become a web developer but you
never even put in some time to learn it
on your own so what you do is you go to
a boot camp that's what happens to a lot
of those guys man
is it better to do a master's in
computer science or mastering what Cass
I'm not good at coding I'm lost
oh well so what you're saying is I meant
well he says that he meant self-taught
people need some advice on how to keep
the job some bootcamp graduates can't
keep up for me it was really hard to
finish work on time and stuff I mean it
all depends like it depends on you know
different deadlines sometimes to some
jobs you know some people are assholes
let's be honest you might go in and have
a project manager who is just a a oh no
matter what you do how much work you
come in you knock it out there a-holes
the best companies are the companies
don't understand hey this person just
started here so he has to adjust to the
place some people they want you to be
like you know zero to 100 on the first
date and it's like no like this person
needs time to readjust learn how the
company works know how you know
everything works in this company cuz you
might know you might know how to do web
programming and you know stuff like that
but you might not know the company the
company's workflow their deployment
system like you know what I mean like
this a lot of stuff that people have to
take into consideration coding phase and
certifications worth it
did you ever get discriminated for being
a Latin looking lion looking I'm looking
I don't think discriminated like you get
the job but there's certain things that
you know what I mean like you could tell
like I'll tell you like this like even
on on my last company and one of the
reasons why I left from over there too
because and I wasn't just happy I wasn't
I just wasn't happy there I wasn't happy
in that place when I went in there
a lot of stuff that they lied about that
didn't tell me and didn't put me on
which is something that you should do if
you got a developer that's working on
your company you should let them know
what exactly is that you're gonna be
doing and and why what's happening with
the company so there was a lot of stuff
that didn't tell me and it happens to be
like okay I was supposed to go in there
and start working on laravel right to
basically transfer the company from
peril to laravel and basically when I
went in there I started doing all my
work there was another guy who was my
coworker who was a pretty good a pretty
smart dude to this day we still keep in
contact but at the same time there were
certain things that was iffy you know
like that I could tell hey I'm you know
I'm the only Spanish dude in there but
it'll be like said to situations where
even to till the last day like they
thought that he did everything on on the
back end like he set everything up like
I'm the one that set up how laravel
works I set up the whole website
everything in the backend I was the one
that was pretty much in charge of that
because I was the one telling him what
exactly was it that we needed to do so
the owner of the company will come in
and start talking about something about
the website or like looking certain
things or like we're gonna upgrade
something or whatever and instead of the
guy looking at me like to talk to me
about the website the back end and all
that stuff he will look at the other
white kid who who was there like there
would be like no eye contact with me and
him he would just only look at him which
is like in your head well his head he
tol I oh he's the smart guy and this guy
he's just like here helping him out and
it's like bro you don't even know
nothing you get what I'm saying and what
I mean the other kid that worked with me
he was super cool to this day we still
talk to each other but it's just like
those are the type of things that you
you get you bump into like you know like
it's not like racism like oh here's a
black guy here so a Spanish guy coming
in it's like let's talk behind his back
now it's not that it's more of like like
oh yeah he's here but the white guy is
the one that really knows what's going
on and it's like it wasn't the case you
know I mean like there was a lot of
stuff that's why for everybody that
actually came in here and it was
watching me from like a long time ago
you know from when I first started here
yeah so how you know I was like happy in
the beginning and then I just started
going down the hill of like man I hate
this company can talk witty I can't wait
to leave from there this this and that
because there was just like a lot of
like little things like that that were
crazy you know I asked for a vacation
time couldn't even get a vacation time
but the other white cake they get it for
two weeks and then he comes back and
quits the job and to me is weird
it's weird that somebody else could do
that and then I can't even take a week
off when I just literally did so much
work on the website even when you go to
the website now I pretty much did like
80% of the whole website alone by myself
super stressed out knocking things out
yes the other kid was doing other things
in a company like you know being the
face of like the IT team of like talking
to people this and that I'm never gonna
be like the guy to be out there all the
time talking and mingling with other
people now I'm doing my work I'm
knocking stuff out but at the same time
I appreciate the type of work that I do
in I appreciate that I'm the one doing
the work
don't come in like as if I'm an
assistant when I'm literally knocking
everything out you know what I mean so
those are the type of little BS stuff
that you're gonna bump into if you're a
Hispanic or freaking up
black dude you know plus the fact that
we're like such a minor we like a
minority of the minority being in
technology you know when people come in
be like man you know you know this
there's so many minorities in tech
because they count the Indians and
Asians as minorities but it's like let's
count about the minorities within the
minorities like let's start counting the
blacks and the Hispanics there's barely
anybody in the tech industry and it's
like whenever you see one one of us as
our own shoes like like the movie get
out is like hey man how you doing is
like it's so awkward and so weird to see
like a Spanish or a black person in
there you know so that's just how it is
man so yeah man that's just being honest
man we have a lot of people's like y'all
gotta go have a good night gaming have a
good night man have a good one
enjoy your night I'm gonna chill here
for a little bit see what people is up
to but yeah man that's just how it is
man that's just work you know it's like
it's I don't think in this world and
especially the United States is not
about like super racism like there's not
like racism like this racism because
this still raises people but it's not
like back in the days of like it's like
oh the blacks go to the back in blacks
and brown go to the back like it's not
like that no more but there's still
stuff where it's like hey if you're
white you could do this in it if you're
black and Latino is like maybe we'll
give you a little vacation maybe we will
give you some recognition maybe we'll be
nice to you that's just how it is but
it's just how everybody knows this we
gotta work twice as hard for the same
work you know just to get any type of
recognition but that's just how it is
I'm used to it
yeah man that's how it charges like
you're for real job that's how it is man
I'm just being honest you know you know
I feel bad sometimes I wish like more
people more people like you know and
it's weird it's weird what I still find
it still we like like it's like such a
minority of of like Caucasian it was a
Caucasian Caucasian Caucasian in this
channel alone like it's weird you know
what I mean like it to me is weird and
it's not just because my oh man this guy
dives in here and comes in too much
sauce nah it's not just that it's just
it's it tells you something you know
that's like a very few amount of like
white developers who mess with this
channel and to me it's just weird cuz
it's like hey man we're just talking
about code you get what I'm saying like
but some here this this channel is it's
not for them for whatever reason you
tell me you explain that to me like
there's a few white dudes in here but
like it tells you something yeah I know
this there's a few people in here but
trust me guys you guys are like the
minority in this channel like and is
this channel should be for everybody
because this channel talks about things
that is affecting every type of person
you're not saying like it's not it's not
just you know like freaking high colas
blacks and Hispanics who want to get
this type of jobs and want to get into
this stuff is everybody wants to get
into this but there's a lot of people
and like that just is
now some Spanish dude talking about code
I ain't messing with it you get what I'm
saying it's like even though somebody
might with the same a different same
skin color is dumb my come in and give
them a BS content and I will lie to them
and try to you know pretty much milk
them but they not messing with this
discontent this this channel hopefully
we could transcend to a bigger audience
and that's what I want to do I don't
want this to just be a niche audience of
just like a black Hispanics and a couple
of like you know a couple of Indians and
a couple of Caucasians I want this to be
for everybody I want everybody should be
listening to this a lot of the stuff
that I tell people here should be for
everybody but for whatever reason
there's not that many Caucasians in here
there's a few guys this is I'm not
saying that there's not but there's a
few trust me I look at the analytics I
look at I look at all those things man I
look at the statistics and it's like man
they come here they watch the channel
but don't subscribe don't don't know why
listen we need everybody you even the
supremacist everybody should be in here
man everybody should be in here
but what I'm saying is man for a lot of
people those are things that you gotta
you gotta get yourself used to it I mean
there's no point of crying about it me I
don't cry about everything cool I don't
get another recognition like I'll be in
a company doing the more work than
somebody else and won't get the same
recognition as the other person cool boy
I don't care cuz when I go home because
a company doesn't run me I don't need a
frickin badge from the company to tell
me that I'm valuable
Corie say honestly I only know since you
mentioned it today brah honestly soon
you had 100 250 thousand subscribers
love your channel content yeah man I
appreciate it man I want this channel to
grow man I really I feel like if we get
this channel to like a very respectable
number and I know I could do it because
I know there's a lot of stuff that
people the things that I do on this
channel people don't do on their Channel
I feel like this channel is entertaining
it's informative it's cool I feel like
my channel is very relatable this is not
a channel where as I came man this guy's
like super smarter than me and I feel
like dumb when I'm watching this channel
now it's more like motivation more like
hey man I can do it and you can do it
too like that's what this whole channel
is about you know what I mean so we
definitely I feel like we can definitely
grow the channel way bigger but let's
see how it goes man for sure
coding faces global hell yeah man
I got so many people I got so many
people that they liked all over the
place man like that super cool that I
have like people in Australia and
England and South Africa I got so many
people from South Africa it's not even
funny like South Africa's in like my top
5 of like people as much as people that
are subscribed to this thing you know I
mean so yeah man
yeah people is from everywhere man we
got people from everywhere all over the
world can I shoot your videos China
version of YouTube in Saudi Arabia man
Saudi Arabia is getting poppin right now
I heard the princess shaking things up
over there he letting women drive he
doing a lot of a lot of cool stuff man
let me see you seriously bro you should
have open-source projects that everybody
can't work on on the channel yeah man
but the problem you know I've been
wanting to do something like that but
the problem with it is that now
everybody here is at the same level you
know what I mean like there's so many
people who are beginners there's people
that don't even know how to use github
yet like you know it's hard it's hard I
can't wait until I get this audience to
the level where everybody can be
productive where we could be like hey
man let's create one single project and
we all work together to build it you
know what I mean like now beyond nor
fear up Switzerland you know I'm dying
to go to Norway I was watching this
documentary about Norway man it looks so
cool man
William in Finland Finland the
motherland guys man but yeah man I think
look I think we have all type of people
in this channel I want this channel to
be more diverse I really do
I want it to be way more diverse and
half more people from everywhere like
and I really wish like some people
wouldn't get turned off by you know me
coming in be like teach it like that's
all part of like being a New Yorker you
know what I mean like that's just the
sauce that's just a swag but everything
that I do here is for a reason it is
valuable
it's like lessons that I've learned you
know it doesn't matter where you come
from doesn't matter you could be from
the countryside of the United States
either coming here from LA from Texas
from Minnesota I got people from what
you call this on Wyoming Lake no matter
what you from everything that I tell you
here can be applied to your area like I
do my research on the whole country not
just this is what works in New York
because if I was like this is what works
in New York I would just give you
different type of content I give you
stuff that works all over the country
like it's not just here in the United
States but hopefully you know as time
goes on and people start seeing the
value of this channel and start
appreciating it you know for what it is
we'll get more more people in here man
but yeah I'm out of here we've been here
for how long I think we did let me tell
you right now we did an hour and 10
minutes
that's fine
yeah man coding phase back to to this
thing about minorities learning to code
in the states bra it needs to be shown
by real people not Bill Gates looking
people cuz most can't relate me more
devs like you that's exactly why I
created this channel just to show
motivation and just to show people like
hey man there's somebody that looks like
me somebody that acts like me somebody
that talks like me he could do it I
could do it you get what I'm saying like
that's exactly why Mel I made this whole
whole channel because it's just like you
know sometimes you don't even get
motivated you know I mean like you'd be
like you look at so many people that is
just they just you can't relate to them
you got what I'm saying like even you go
to boot camp so you go to meetups and
there's a whole bunch of people that do
not look like you do not talk like you
do not have your same culture that's not
half you know things that you can relate
to so you might get turned down you're
like I don't know if I could fit in
there and it's like this whole industry
is not about can you fit in it's more
can you do the job you get what I'm
saying
Kevin angry and says why do you stay up
late to make live sessions now I usually
I'm going through my emails and I'm
answering emails late night right and
then what happens is somebody asks me a
question which is really good and then
I'm like them I should make a video
about it you know so that's what happens
man
I swam up right now but yeah man I'm out
of here
I'm freaking where you get your
catchphrase which one the I done did it
again just I always say that my friends
I'm like man I done did it again man you
know like I'll be playing NBA 2k I be
like oh man okay I didn't did it again
you know so I was like that's stuck with
me you know so you know there's a chit
chit chat you already know simple job
back at it again
coding face.com your boys back and I
done did it again you know what I mean
so yeah man let's be diseased what up
what you're doing up at this time yeah
that should be partying right now Chris
widely too many stereotypes man yes sir
I think we just need to get together and
just be like yo man you know it's like
somebody sent me a comment the other day
yeah I know people like Joe stop talking
about the trolls and this and that but
that's how it is man there's so many
dudes out here who just like drop like
dumb stuff and be like oh man it's like
you have such a ghetto accent it's like
I'm surprised that you know how to code
I'm like
like you ignoring us he'll like do you
think that somebody from England who has
an accent cannot code do you think
somebody from Jamaica who has an accent
cannot code do you think somebody from
India who has accent cannot code do you
think that somebody from Australia who
has an accent do not code like we're not
supposed to talk exactly alike we're not
supposed to you know have the same
cultures like that's what makes us
beautiful like as human beings like you
go to different parts of the country of
the world and you see different ways of
how people talk only in this country you
start seeing like oh man this person
talks like this so this is ghetto no
this is called culture this is a you
know this is the culture man you know
you you come in for a different culture
your culture it might be you know little
Shan from you know from Dawson's Creek
you know what I mean like you might not
have no culture and Dawson's Creek and
that's on you that's not and that's not
me that's not us that's not the people
that is around me like that's us having
a frickin culture you know what I mean
like that's just how it is you know
everybody has their own culture man you
know and we should all appreciate
everybody's culture for what it is we
shouldn't be trying to forget our own
cultures and assimilate to somebody
else's culture you know we should just
have our own identities and and you know
love each other for who we are and not
for what we supposed to look like you
know I was like we're not supposed to
look like nothing we supposed to look
like how we were born and how we look
that's it it was like you look like that
I said you look like that you talk like
this ok cool you talk like this who
cares
let me see you know how events argue
with rails events
in my expert now I'm not an expert
nothing you know I don't consider myself
an expert nothing
maybe JavaScript because I've been doing
it for so long but I have for about two
years and a half of experience of like
work experience in major companies from
rails so I know how it works I also have
experience for Larry Bell for a long
time like that's like the first things
that I've been learning in other
companies I work for have been in that
so it's like I have work experience in
my somebody like a core contributor to
Rails or core contributor to laravel no
I don't have time for that I'm
making money out here you got on saying
like that's what people who have time I
just don't have time for that PHP versus
rails which one is more fun rails which
one what I think is easier to get into
PHP Scala Perl Scala Perl is that's a
language that you could say is that and
even at that pearl parallel you could
say somehow there's still companies out
there that they are using Perl amen
eventually there's gonna be all type of
people's man I mean look I'm from
Dominican Republic man in Dominican
Republic nobody is like oh I'm black I'm
white I'm this and that like you just
you Dominican here in the United States
is like you gotta fill in a box you know
Oh Hispanic dark Hispanic white his part
Hispanic technically I'm white Hispanic
right but like other countries they
don't make you fill in no boxes it's
just you're American like that's how it
should be Hindu United States they
shouldn't be no boxes of like where are
you from is like your American that's
saying you get what I'm saying but
there's a lot too much history behind
this country so
it's hard to change the whole culture of
a country especially a young country
like this country it only has like what
like 400 years or something like that
yeah pearl it's like pearl is done
jQuery is definitely not that jQuery is
definitely not that that's for sure C++
yeah no it's not that there's a lot of
stuff that people still use C++ for yep
hey abyss you hit in the head man it's
funny cuz we are just animals of the
same species
literally same in sadhus exactly
yeah you know what I was funny I was
like you know even with everything
that's happening in culture and like now
and days and and all the stuff that
happens like you know the whole rape
culture the whole freaking when people
fight and people you know they fight
each other until they die and like it's
like I look at all those things I'm like
I'm not surprised by it it's like people
really think like we're something
different we're just animals like you
know I was like when somebody raped
somebody I'm like it sucks that this
this is happening when somebody drugged
somebody and I go it sucks that it's
happening but I'm not surprised by it
we're animals it's like as human beings
we have certain parts of our brain that
are more lit up than other animals but
at the same time it's like where do we
come from
we're like animals we just happen to now
walk in two feet and we could use our
hands for tools and that's it but the
still animal side is still there
you know people fight each other people
kill each other people rape people do
all this crazy stuff that as a society
we try to say this is good this is bad
but people forget the animal name
of it like hey you're still animal it's
just like we're smart enough to try to
suppress different things and be like
hey man you're not supposed to do this
because you're a human right but are you
surprised that all of this bad things
happen and that human beings do all this
type of crazy stuff like nah we're
animals like like it and like it or not
we're still animals man oh yeah man I'm
leaving you guys with that and like I
said man you know cuz the internet loves
to take things out of context we're not
saying we're not supporting raping when
Iced approaching freaking we're not
supporting raping when i was reporting
murder we're not supporting none other
stuff all I'm saying is we are animals
so it's like you always got to think the
worst walking an animal too you know
it's like when I look at a pit bull
right people walking around with a pit
bull and they're like this is my
beautiful pit bull and he's so
domesticated until that pit bull snaps
and bites your whole neck off you know
what I mean like it's an animal like why
is he trusting that animal like you get
what I'm saying but yeah man I'm out of
here kids man see a boy chill back at it
again cutting face calm your boys back
you're not didn't did it again I hope
you understood everything that I was
saying in this video and you enjoyed it
and yeah we just dropping gems out here
