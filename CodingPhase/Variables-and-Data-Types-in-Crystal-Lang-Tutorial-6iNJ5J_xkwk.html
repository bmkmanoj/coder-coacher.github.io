crystal castile alright guys listen
make sure you subscribe make sure you
like this video man alright so I'm gonna
teach you guys how to declare variable
and also you know the different data
types that it has alright
but first of all we gotta check if your
crystal Lang is on your system right and
we're gonna start it by basically
testing the most easiest thing on the
language right and the most coolest
thing right something called plate right
so we're gonna come here and we're gonna
go crystal plate right what that does is
basically it serves a server and now you
have a little playground for you to test
out crystal alright open this up it
should be here already
well that's for me alright so you go to
localhost 8080 and there you go pretty
much yourself
alright now let's start very simple how
do you declare variable alright let's
say we wanted to declare a variable for
a car brain so we say hey car brand and
then equals Conda and then as you can
see is running in the background and
tells you hey there's a strength Honda
alright so car brand is Honda right now
we basically what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna declare a bunch of variables at
the same time teaching you guys the
different types of data structures that
that I has right so we're gonna sing
boolean oops all right bullying's which
are true or false
all right let's say that's true and it's
gonna tell you okay that's a boolean or
false very simple and sorry guys the
reason why it's been so slow
you know I taking a little time is
because I'm running a lot of things at
the same time as I'm recording this and
yeah alright so let's say numbers right
which are integers let's say 23 but for
joining you dig alright see it tells you
as an integer 32 now let's do a float
which are numbers with decimals flow 64
all right now let's say we wanted to
declare an array right so let's say
array and then I do something like this
two three four that's an array right
there and it will tell us the whole
thing here see array of and did you
started to if I was to go and say hey
the third one I'm gonna name me Joe
because you could put anything inside
out of an array as far as a variable it
could be a number it could be a string
multiple things that you could put
inside of an array
remember and the rate is just a list
remember that guys alright you see so it
tells you you got inside your starting
tool and then you have a string inside
of it
all right now let's say we have a hash
hash is cool because it's similar to an
array but you can name it so let's see
give you a little space just for clarity
alright oops I forgot to declare the
variable so we basically named in this
hash to have inside of it but this
variable to have a hash inside of it
right super simple so as you can see it
has the number or number one is Jo and
number two is James so it's pretty much
like an array right very similar
now that simply wanted to access this
and we'll want to access number two we
don't like this and we say show me James
you see and tells me is actually a
string my own just to me that super cool
right now let's say we wanted to deal
with characters like meaning emojis and
stuff like that
so I'm gonna declare the variable car
right char I don't know how you guys
might say it so let's say an example
something like this and then you and
then the number of it F 61 e and Dan
like a little character you know that's
how it is right so that's another
different data type right now let's say
another one let's say it's super right
we want to do super super similar to the
hash and similar to an array but this
little differences right so let's say
now we want to say one hello that's
another thing in strength for crystal
Lang you gotta put you know double
quotes not the single one all right and
let's say three
that's a tuple right there right now
let's say we wanted to access the tuple
it's just like it's just like the hash
all right another seven to access number
two number two says three so remember it
always starts with a zero start zero one
two right even though there's the third
number but remember it's always starts
with a zero all right now for the hash
you see that as different the hash is
basically saying hey inside of this
variable give me the one that's named
number two so that's why I gave us James
and it's the same thing now for an array
which I didn't show you guys like let's
say in a ring for let's say number three
which is similar tool to a tuple pretty
much it basically does the count so both
0 1 2 3 right so I'll say ok give me
inside of the array that on the number 3
right so the number 3 is actually number
4 here so that's why give us forth all
right super simple right now I'm going
super quick on this
just because this stuff is super basic
if you guys don't notice you gotta learn
this as you go on the languages this is
pretty much if you've ever done any type
of programming this is pretty much the
same thing almost every single language
that's that's what I gotta say
it's like it's pretty much is the same
thing if you're done JavaScript it's
almost literally the same thing all
right so let's say another one there's a
named tube all right name two boys let's
say we wanted to do it like this and we
say Joe
do something like this age we say 23 all
right that's the name tuple right and
I'm gonna show you how to access it
loading okay so yeah so basically
selling you okay name to pool you call
so click on here and you get the full
information so you got the names Joe age
23 so it's telling me okay name as a
string age is an integer this is pretty
cool this just to play around that's
what's called crystal play all right
it's not serious
I'm gonna teach you guys later on how to
do the full coding where if you know
what if Adam or whatever editor you want
to use all right now let's say you
wanted to access this let's say name to
port name and it should give me Joe
yeah then gave me job data all right
so revising this super quick just for
you guys alright so we declare a
variable by just saying whatever we want
to name it so we say okay a car brand
equals Honda that's a strength right now
boolean or you do is declare variable
and say okay false right it's equal to
force right now you don't have to say
anything like I said you could actually
just say false and it's fine but right
now what I'm doing is I'm putting this
this data this data type right inside of
a variable right and basically I'm
saying okay boolean equals false number
equals 23 flow equals 22.3 this array is
actually this array and then I'm
accessing that array or with on the
number three which is gonna give me that
I'm before hash there's the hash you
know pretty much so on and so on
but remember this
so the most coolest thing right now
number one to declare a variable all you
have to do is just say the name of it
whatever you want to name it and then
say it's equal to something meaning car
brand equals to Honda remember that is
one thing that you gotta learn from this
number two you don't have to put
semicolons like PHP JavaScript you don't
come in and say okay Honda and then you
put a semicolon you don't have to do
that actually you could do it but you
don't have to do it it's not best
practices all right
so okay what else you guys should
remember and that's it pretty much it
like this is all the different data
types you know different data structures
that you could use with crystal Lang and
yeah have a sense here happy crystalline
okay guys I'll see you later man coding
face car make sure you subscribe make
sure you like this video man and also
check out crystal cast that IO
that's the new website where all my
videos for crystal is gonna be in there
alright I'm teaching you guys in my own
way maybe there's other people who might
do it better but there's the way that
teaching okay pretty simple pretty
straightforward okay see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
