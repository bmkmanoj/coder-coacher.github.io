asking me for a long time so we're gonna
do it with no js' people love nodejs and
now you can learn no js' with a
structured framework something that
could say hey let me focus on my
application I don't want to focus on the
libraries I don't want to focus on
customizing everything from this you
know from the beginning from scratch
like I don't want to have to build
everything that's the problem with
express that I hate that you have to
build everything on your own from
scratch and it's like now you spending
more time on figuring out which one is
the best way which libraries should I
use instead of focusing on building the
application that you might have in your
head
