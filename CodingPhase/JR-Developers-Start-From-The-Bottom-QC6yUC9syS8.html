coding fees.com your boys backing out
and did it again alright guys today
we're gonna talk about a very important
topic is it money that you want or do
you want the job I mean that's a very
simple way to put it all right
pretty much I'm gonna say the guy's name
with a girl's name who will send me an
email about this pretty much they've
been looking for a job they've been
studying online you know they got the
opportunity and pretty much they got the
chance to get hired from somebody right
they gave him the opportunity and
somebody said hey we're about to give
you the job all right here's the salary
that we think that we can pay you at the
skill level that you're at right now
currently all right and the person was
like man there's $5,000 less than what
I'm making I'm not taking it all right
now I'm gonna tell you my personal story
for you guys that don't know and some of
you guys already know this story right
when I was actually working as an IT
worker in Wall Street I was already on a
path to making you know probably about
70 80 grand a year at the moment when I
decided to quit my job and I say you
know what I just gotta become a
full-time developer all right you know
that was like right after college so to
you know track back a little bit I was
in college I was working in a parking
lot as soon as I graduated whatever I
started working as an IT worker
connecting printers and you know DNS
servers and BS like that for like a good
six months and I was like man I hate
this right I really need to switch
careers because this isn't what I
thought that IT was going to be like and
pretty much I became a self-taught
developer so I started teaching myself
for you know sometime then from there I
got the opportunity to get a job in a BS
company I'll be honest it was a BS
company you know at the moment I was
making like 45 grand per year
nothing crazy but it's like you straight
out of college like what do you expect
people were expecting to to get hundreds
of thousands of dollars it's like no you
got to start somewhere right
so then from there I went to this BS
company I quit my job whatever learned
online went to this BS company and it
was a major pay cut
we're not talking about $5,000 we're
talking about you know like wow I was
making like $14 an hour right like that
no benefits no nothing just like $14,000
and you know why I took it it was a
major picture compared to the job that I
had before but the reason why I took it
was nobody was giving me a chance like I
went to major companies I went to tumblr
I went to a whole bunch of companies
like major startups all right here in
New York I went from you know the people
that create the 3d printers and stuff
like that makers something I forgot the
name nobody was giving me the chance not
because I didn't have you know a certain
skills is because I was a junior
developer they was gonna have to train
me and do a whole bunch of stuff and
they're like you know what we need
somebody to hit the ground running start
working as soon as possible without us
having to spend time training them so I
knew that I wasn't gonna get those good
jobs because I didn't have an experience
I didn't have experience I didn't go to
a job and put in that work right so I
said you know what this job is paying me
$14 an hour I'm gonna take it right in
two three months I'll quit I'll start
applying to other jobs and tell them hey
I worked at this company they trusted me
like I know
I can do this all you need to do is give
me the chance right but companies don't
want to hire people straight off the bat
right and sometimes people fall into
this this little trap of hey I need to
make us much money as the numbers that I
see on indeed.com and I see on on you
know website Stack Overflow and be like
oh guys are making eighty ninety one
hundred thousand dollars and as I
you have to understand the reason why
those people are gaining that money it
wasn't like a luck thing it wasn't a
thing that they showed up and be like oh
by luck I got $100,000 job now
no it means they know a lot right they
have a lot of experience right nobody I
don't care for is coming straight out of
college nobody is getting $100,000 you
know straight off the bat unless they
have like real solid skills it's not
like that man so it's the same thing as
you guys self taught you know you're
coming in nobody trusts you you're
teaching yourself online
you got a level yourself down right and
be like man they giving me the
opportunity right unless you feel like
yeah I could get all the jobs and
something a little bit better unless you
know for sure that you could get a
little something better then take the
job because you might spend a month or
two wasting time and your house still
looking for a job because you didn't
want to take that little job that pay
you just a little bit less than what
you're making currently guys I'll be
honest it's like $5,000 $10,000 on a
paycheck after after freakin taxes it's
like $60 to $150 less than what you were
making before it's not life-changing
it's not like you're you're like oh I'm
making you know freakin $500 less of my
check no it's like tops $150 tops like
what you was gonna do with a $150 buy
some sneakers what she was gonna do buy
yourself some food some extra food going
out you could sacrifice that for like a
good two three months guys the whole
idea of this is for you to get the job
if somebody's already trusting you go in
there go work
knock that out star applying it to other
places right and you have to you know
understand this guy's guys are making
you know ninety a hundred thousand
dollars they have a lot of pressure on
them they're not getting little jobs
that you're going to get as a junior
developer like you know hey could you
build this page for
can you build these little landing page
no we're dealing with difficult things
we're dealing with problems with the
company we have to be on call 24/7
almost we have to freaking architect the
projects themselves if something goes
wrong six months from now we're
responsible people looked at us like hey
why do you choose this technology why do
you choose this framework or if you know
the problems were that we were gonna
have five six months from that right so
as a junior developer you don't have
those problems your problem is I hate
could you build this page for us hey
could you build this HTML email for us
hey can you play around with this little
WordPress and fix it up a little bit
hey can you add a couple of products to
to the database like little stuff right
so you have to understand the difference
you know you don't you never want to
fall into you know and this happens to a
lot people somehow they scheme it they
talk to a recruiter tell them hey I got
skills in this I got this this and that
that they did a couple of projects
online and they think that they're
really ready for that
that primetime you know those jobs
80,000 plus guys you're not ready for
that don't put yourself in that
situation because you're gonna embarrass
yourself I'm being honest this has
happened to a lot of junior developers
people put themselves in situations
where they embarrass themselves where
they now they're at work nervous and and
having panic attacks and anxiety because
you wasn't ready that's where the whole
idea of an imposter syndrome comes in -
in reality we as developers we never
know when we're ready right but the
truth is if you come in and somehow
surrender yourself in through a
recruiter and the recruiters like oh
this person's isn't legit this person
knows this doesn't that the company is
gonna pay you a lot of money but they're
trusting you to have a certain type of
skill right then I trust you that hey
this guy's expert reactors guy he's been
around for a while he knows how to set
up the servers and AWS he knows how to
do this and that this you know what I
mean like there's a lot of things they
as a junior developer you don't want to
be doing
but if you wanna go for the money
you're gonna fall into a place where
you're gonna embarrass yourself I'm
being honest that's what's gonna happen
and I'm selling you out of my experience
where I'm like I was so happy that I
came in earning less right earning less
than a lot of people yeah we're earning
this isn't that they go through a whole
six months of embarrassing embarrassing
themselves in companies right me I never
went through that I want I I basically
scaled myself up to different levels
right
I didn't just go from you know a knowing
stuff in my house like hey I'm learning
teen tree housing new to me and coke
Adam II and then to say hey I'm ready to
give me the primetime guys I deserve to
get that you know ninety thousand plus
one hundred thousand plus it doesn't
work like that
guys you have to put in the work you
don't want to skip those years to say
hey I want to earn the most I can as
soon as possible because when a company
pays you a lot of money it means that
they want to get a lot out of you
right there's no room for mistakes as a
junior developer you're gonna have a lot
of mistakes you know when you're getting
paid a lot of money there's no room for
mistakes you got to understand that
right you never want to put yourself in
that situation so I mean I told the
scales like man if I were you just take
the job you know and this is not is this
is that for you know like I'm going
against them or you know I don't want
him to feel like I'm talking bad about
him or anything I hope you take this as
like a good advice um but pretty much
it's just a lot of people do this
there's not just you this a lot of
people send me emails in and this and
that like I understand this a big
difference when you have a family when
you have you know you have a house you
have a kid you have a lot of
responsibilities and you're like man I
can't I can't go in five hundred or a
thousand dollars less than what I'm
making cuz I gotta take care of my
family that's understandable already
that's understandable but that means you
have to work even harder
all right so but for somebody who
just starting listen Aryans like man you
know five $10,000 trust me that's like
$50 less on your check like I'm being
honest
that's like $50 less on your check after
taxes look it up I mean do the math it's
like it doesn't make sense for you to
deny that job and say I'm not gonna take
it because I'm gonna get more and it's
like have you had any other jobs before
this right it's like sometimes as
developer sense you know people who are
trying to get into this industry
sometimes we feel like we are I feel
like more junior developers feel they're
more entitled to things and as I could
no you're not entitled to it all right
yeah you could try to swindle yourself
into a company but it's like you don't
have the skills yet bro it's like you
still a beginner give yourself time go
into a smaller company go into a company
is gonna pay you a little bit less but
it's gonna be less burning on top of you
all right you go into a company where
they're gonna pay you a lot of money
they're gonna spend and expect that a
lot out of you there's no mistakes there
you will get fired if you make mistakes
and people be like oh this person
there's the perfect thing that people
come in with and they tell you this all
the time to junior developers oh I'm
sorry you know you was in a a fit for
the company's culture that's the most BS
thing that you're gonna hear that means
you wasn't ready that means somebody in
the company didn't like you and you're
getting fired right sometimes they're
gonna hit you with that I'm like oh we
just didn't think that you know you was
a fit for the culture the fam the the
culture of the company dissing - you
know gibberish you know HR gibberish
right but it was pretty much to say hey
you wasn't ready he wasn't ready for
primetime and you know we're gonna have
to let you go it happens all the times
man I keep hearing about people from
boot camps that this keeps happening to
them you know what I mean like yeah
people from boot camps they'll be like
oh yeah
I want to full-stack Academy and listen
now I went to was the iron you are I
want to a App Academy they go to these
jobs right sometimes they they skim
through it right because you gotta
understand the recruiters are there to
get as much money as they can for you so
they could charge even more money
because they charge on a set base so
like let's say somebody goes in and get
$100,000
they make fifty fifteen percent of that
right
so they got fifteen thousand dollars
just because they placed you in there
all right you got what I'm saying if
they go and get you into a fifty
thousand dollar job they're only gonna
get like five thousand like date then I
really want to get that right because
they're not getting a good bonus oh you
know their boss is gonna be all this
type of jobs it's not really worth it
for us we want to get developers in
those big paying jobs right but then
what happens is if you are a junior
developer yourself to a developer you're
learning on your own
you go to these companies where they
gonna give you a lot of work and a lot
of responsibility and when you're not
ready and reality you embarrass yourself
they let you go they send you ass home
after like you know a month or two and
it happens to a lot of people now I want
people to take this as an advice from me
like don't try to be like man I'm trying
to get those $90,000 job a hundred
thousand dollar jobs that's not how the
world works you gotta understand the
more money you get the more
responsibility more skills that you need
to have right if you go and somehow
slender yourself up to the top without
getting those foundations or of like
working in smaller companies working in
even like digital agencies doing a
little bull strapped in little WordPress
projects if you don't go through those
processes like when you go and you
scheme it and you just bypass everything
what happens is you go in there and the
company's gonna give you a lot of work
and you're gonna be stressed out you're
gonna hate the job like no money can
give you happiness when you're stressed
out guys I'm being honest all right so
when you're stressed out when
they giving you stuff that you can't do
and you're like oh man and now you're
embarrassing yourself tonight okay you
do this with this database and you're
like oh I only know MongoDB I don't know
my sequel or you you know vice versa you
know what I mean like once you get to a
certain amount of money that means you
you're already dabbled in all
technologies right okay so that's what
companies are expecting out of me
especially now now you can't even just
be like you know somebody sent me this
the other day is like you know is
front-end development dying and it's
like yeah I think so right it's going
back to how it used to be before before
people used to just call themselves
webmasters right people that know the
front-end people that know the backend
at some point there was a time where
there was like hiring just strictly
finance strictly back-end but now
because of JavaScript and how nodejs
came in they expect them people to know
the front and end the back-end really
well right so a job that you could get
you know five years ago but I hate you
could be a really good JavaScript
developer in the front end and gay you
know eighty ninety thousand dollars
nowadays it's not that easy now you
gotta come in with hey I know the
backend I know nodejs I know MongoDB I
know my sequel I know Sahara deploy to
AWS I know how to deploy to Heroku now
you gotta come in with so many skills
under your belt that is just kind of
ridiculous all right now what can you do
right what is the the best way for you
personally I think you gotta start small
start small and grow yourself into the
industry never try to be like bypass
things in working in in like really huge
companies unless it's like a a strictly
junior developer position where they
specifically tell you hey you're gonna
be a junior developer here and we don't
mind training you for the next six
months if they tell you that that's
great that means they're gonna give you
an easy job you're gonna be working on
easy projects but if you're like working
in a company where it's gonna be you two
or three different developers means like
there's not time
developers in that company that means
you're gonna do a lot of hard work right
and you're gonna get paid well but if
you embarrass yourself right you will
get fired right you will be getting you
know be letting go you know with the
SKUs off
oh we just didn't think he was a fit for
the you know the culture of the company
and this and that you know it's like you
came in late once they'll come up with
the any excuse or if you get hired as a
contractor it's even worse because you
just don't even show up you know your
recruiter is gonna call you up as I oh
yeah
basically the contract has been
terminated and you're gonna be like why
what happened you wasn't ready for
primetime that's just that simple you
know and this is an advice for everybody
guys work yourself up man you're
teaching yourself online man you got to
think about it like this man you got
you're teaching yourself online
sometimes you got to humble yourself and
be like man I'm teaching myself online I
don't have a degree in this there's
nothing that companies can really trust
me with without experience right so if a
company hires me and giving me the
opportunity I gotta take it just because
I have to get into the industry once
you're in and you have a few months of
experience you could go and double that
salary all right but the whole process
of starting at the bottom if you skip
that you can't just be like hey there's
no margin for errors on the next company
you know what I mean like you can't make
mistakes like people will get you fired
people will you know look at you crazy
because they'll be like man why are we
painting paying this guy they're
freaking you know 80 grand 90 grand and
it's like we still gotta train them it
doesn't make sense
all right so if you start from the
bottom when you say okay I'm making you
know 35 40 $50,000 a year it's fine it's
only for a few months man stop trying to
go for those big jobs because you're not
ready yet give yourself the time that's
all I'm saying man give yourself the
time so you don't have to go
you know the embarrassment of like
getting fired let it get him let it go
you know like there's so many things
that could happen to you right you know
cuz recruiters are going to live for you
because they want you to get those big
jobs they want you to get those big jobs
they're gonna be like ya know he's great
he he could do it but you're like I'm
like subpar and and you know whatever
language is out there I still don't know
you know very well react I'm more
beginner and ain't no js' I'm a beginner
in PHP I'm a beginner and whatever and
then you like try you know a recruiter
comes in try to bypass you to get a
bigger job than then you're like you're
like yeah I'll do it
I like the money then it's like bro when
you get let go that's on you you know
and then from there you might just have
a really bad experience with web
development your first job might be
horrible you might be like man this
thing was so hard I don't even know why
I wanted to become this because you you
skipped man levels right so that's all
I'm saying man I wish nothing but the
best for everybody here but listen how
real Casa Darrell says man trust the
process man like trust the process start
from the bottom and don't come don't try
to skip steps man because money is
better here and it's like bro you just
don't know what you're really getting
yourself into what development is hard
programming is hard you know and you
you're trying to go into companies that
they're gonna test you
right they gotta really test you
sometimes those companies that they
might like you in might let you in but
then once you're in there you're like oh
wait I don't know all this stuff I gotta
spend 3-4 months of training and
learning this technologies some
companies they're not with it they're
not happy to have somebody sitting at a
corner and even though that's mad work
to do they they have to sit there and
try to figure things out or looking at
tutorials while they are work because
they don't know there's this
technologies while you probably could
have learned that while working at a
smaller company where you had you know
less
special on you too to perform you get
what I'm saying so yeah man guys if you
want to learn you know web development
