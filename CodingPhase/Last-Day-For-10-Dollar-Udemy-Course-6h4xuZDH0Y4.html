back at it again man coding face.com
guys the missing I don't even know about
this
so one of you guys sent me a message
like Jojo you haven't talked about the
udemy courses man do you know that there
was a sale I don't even know about this
 yeah man so there's actually a sale
right now and today is the last day for
$10 courses they're right there my
description on the description of this
video if you want to learn the courses
that I took now today I'm actually
releasing a review for coke Steel's new
course on my sequel I know a lot of you
guys that love pH on napping speed I
love JavaScript and I love nodejs
so yeah I still haven't worked on my
sequel right so you guys should
definitely take that course man now also
another course I will recommend right
now if you're looking to get into
game development looking for phaser Jas
pH a ser that IO phaser GS search start
up on udemy man this is an amazing
course on it and it's pretty fun because
like for me I'm actually doing that
course right now which is all about
basically creating games with html5
JavaScript so it's like if you already
know HTML and JavaScript you're good man
whoa lift that hell up man trying to
power up yo Vienna I don't know I don't
get like notifications if anybody finds
a cause all I get is like okay I get a
number at the end of the month like okay
200 people bought a course or something
like that all right but I don't get like
our specific notification from Google of
course or who bought what course so I
don't got that information but if you
did buy a course man you know thank you
it does help out it's like they're gonna
charge you $10 no matter what right so
if you use my link what they do it
how'd you turn it
if my boy Joe no $2 because I bought
your course pretty much right
but even if you guys don't want to click
on my linkage farm and just buy a course
on udemy man I'm telling you like the
courses that I got on my description
they like the best ones those other one
that told me to become a developer that
got me where I'm at right right now
right you see where I'm at right now I'm
 heading home from work like I
actually work as a developer there's a
big hundred you know right I did some
people are like that the courses they
actually countless courses so if you
ever been to college you know there's a
big difference between online course and
a college course so it's like a college
professor talking in front of a
board teaching you different theories
and different topics for those of you
that want to take this more serious you
know I think it would be good so
actually if you've never been to a
computer science class so take one of
those courses too you know aside from
you to me because you to me most of the
courses on udemy they teach you on
project-based so they're really good for
that right for you to start building
projects and see how things are getting
to you know they get to be put together
right that's what you to me is great now
if you want to learn something like
different lectures and knowing what the
hell's concurrency knowing what the hell
is computer science what the hell is
software engineering knowing you know
calculus like all the stuff that can
come in handy they could definitely you
know
I'll give you guys the links to those
they're gonna be on my website and yeah
man we in here I just wanted to let you
guys know before I head home cuz I
probably won't be able to
you
put all your clothes out in the middle
of the Atlantic I don't know greenling
thing you know by the time I would have
said hey this up to you if you don't
like them if you don't like the courses
that I took it's fine you could go and
buy another course
who has the password who has the key to
this thing is like no man we it's not
good well not all the time but
everything that's free it's free for a
reason somebody didn't put in the time
somebody didn't put in as much effort as
somebody that is actually selling a
product you know plus it's like you're
gonna get paid like a hundred times to
literate like you know you're going to
be good every course in there is going
to be ten dollars
autism so it's not really you to miss
for it's just that I can't control
myself
I I love learning music yet entry house
is good but you know for me personally
everybody is different everybody that's
why I'm telling you guys some people
by going at Sing Sing se
that you do to me or even Pluralsight
whatever right this different places to
learn everybody has his own way for me
personally team treehouse wasn't cutting
it
like 10 treehouse I don't even think
they have a view Jes I don't like view
but if I'm somebody who is sometime
I welcome reactant that's talking about
a whole bunch of different frameworks
and team tree house was still on angular
now what the like you're telling me
that I'm gonna be paying $10 $9 whatever
and I'm always going to be be
under wasn't a tip
yeah better somebody do it
you know that's what so you guys to my
tutorials right you got to learn so much
more than what you think you know I see
you know good one too
people who do this all the time man
I'll never forget this man
there was one time you know back in the
days back in the days when you saw two
cop shirts and shake cop like you know
$300 jerseys $400 jerseys right I know
one of my my friend
he basically always spent like 300 400
on a throwback jersey right and then he
will get it for $50 cheaper than me and
they were legit and I was telling me Oh
joke no nut job but yo son his name was
one I was like yell horn let me know
wewe copy New Jersey's that so like that
I could save myself the money I could
say if you know $50 - and he'll be like
nah I can do isn't exclusive it's an
exclusive place and then I'm like what
the hell
 he never used to tell me what if I
used to buy his shake all right
you
if I
because of you to me why would I not
tell people hey go check out this
courses that I took you know like so
people are stingy some people are they
just don't want to share the knowledge
at all like you know this people like
that they just don't want to share what
the hell you know how they got there
like you ask somebody like oh how you
got to you know like an example right
try to talk to your doctor right trying
to talk to doctoring Aksum hey how do
you become a doctor most likely your
doctors gonna be like listen kid don't
worry about it you know it's like it
took me a little time he's not gonna
tell you exactly how he did it how you
know what high school he went to what
college he went to what graduate school
he went to you know like he's not going
to give you the whole rundown because a
lot of times people don't want you to do
what they do because if if everybody
knows the the truth of where to learn
certain things or how to become certain
things in life then they feel like oh
they're gonna take my job or they're
gonna take my place like that
happens all the time you know so I was
like me I've never been like that I
don't like I go and get a sale final
