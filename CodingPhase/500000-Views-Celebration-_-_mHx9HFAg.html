Barbra Jean love creating the discord we

first person to donate
I believe he was like the first of the
second one to donate he was the first
one to donate through a super chat and
then there was this other girl forgot
her name I got a look at my account and
she was the first one to donate through
patreon and I really appreciate it
because they just showed that you know I
was doing something cool I was doing
something cool that people are gonna
enjoy it and yeah you know I'm having
fun with it I have a phone word for
YouTube and like I said from the
beginning I made this channel it's what
development you know slash YouTube
channel right so it's not just what the
fundaments about me is about my life is
about the things I go through things
time you know other people go through
that I see you know helping people out
constantly that's the idea behind this
channel if people loved it and people
accepted it they enjoy the channel for
what it is all of you guys are
definitely showing me support over the
whole 7 months that I've been around
so Matt made the the discord I'm sorry
right Barbara has helped out just
putting it out there as well Matt we
need to give the credit where credit is
due
given that credit oh my god man
yeah there's been a lot of ups and downs
man like you guys don't know like when I
started doing this channel my sister had
just passed away
literally so this channel became my
escape to basically get away from all of
this you know like even until now I'm
still like in shock I'm in shock I have
a kid I'm still in shock that I have a
kid right I look at him I'm like wow man
like it doesn't feel real doesn't feel
real having a semi-successful
YouTube channel doesn't seem real and I
can say maybe it is successful right it
is successfully because our audience is
not as big you know what I mean like if
I was doing gaming it'll be different I
probably had my god a hundred thousand
subscribers man you know two hundred
thousand subscribers but I know that our
audience is smaller or more annoyed and
actually better all right so yeah I
could say I got a successful channel
but yeah man thinking about it
back you know to back to January
December man December 27th my sister
passed away until this day I still feel
like it's not real then from there you
know I knew I was gonna have a kid but I
still didn't I don't know didn't plug
together like it just didn't seem real
now that I have him here and I'm looking
at him like he'll this is real like this
is the this is the new reality
you know like since I was little I
always thought I was gonna have my
sister forever like I was still like all
cuz I always feel like getting sick and
 like that so I'm like oh yeah I'm
the first one that's probably gonna die
or something's gonna happen too but
there's a new reality and like now I
have a son I got a wifey and I my house
I got bangs big body bends the money way
that way oh man sorry I get high I get
high because I'm gonna go you guys don't
know what it is to be in a car all right
and your car keeps turning off every
 corner man
yo that was so embarrassing man ah
you know it's really embarrassing man
yeah guys don't know how much I am
grateful to web development like people
don't understand like how much this
changed my life like I'm thinking about
it like if I wasn't doing web
development where the hell would I be
hearing I would have probably still been
stuck you know living with my mom's I
mean my mom lives with me now but it's a
big difference I'm the big boy of the
house you know what I mean like I
control that you know but I yo was
my control that way too you know so
that's a grateful man very grateful
grateful for everybody that came in and
soul of all the time I really appreciate
it guys you guys are the best man
this you know
there's very few communities that I
could see that are like ours where we
all know each other I feel like we all
know each other you know we know who's
gonna go whenever there's gonna be a
video we know who's gonna show up we
know who's gonna be there who's gonna
leave a comment who's gonna be funny
who's gonna ask the question like we
already know because this is our
community
and then on top of that a lot of people
you know supporting me with my website
coding phase comm you know over 700
people like those numbers some crazy you
know like when when I think about I'm
like 700 people believing me that's why
I have to do tutorials and courses and
every single day because I'll tell my
girl my girl there's people out there
believing in me like I can't let them
down I gotta make the best content that
I can you know given the best courses my
idea of this is just make sure that
everybody comes back till seven hundred
people will come back to me and be like
yo I got a job because of you same way
or I created a channel because of you
you know like that's one thing you know
like when I started this thing I did it
because of Steven Grider I did it
because of cold steel because they
taught me this wealth of animation they
got me to the point where I needed to be
you know so I said I'm gonna do the same

but in my whole way I'm not gonna be
fake I'm not gonna be changing my voice
I'm not gonna talk different I'm just
gonna do it in my own way and if people
gravitate to that then great if not then
it's cool I'm just gonna be you know I
could have been here doing videos on
YouTube for 50 people I would have still
been doing it you know this channels are
really really good out there and
they only have like 200 subscribers I've
seen a channel that had a lot of
counting right and he was teaching
Python to people and I saw I saw the guy
yo he didn't even have like 300
subscribers in three years and he posts
almost every single day so to me I'm
like yeah that could have been me too I
could have been just you know making
videos for five people and that
would have been fine maybe that would be
even better for me because then I
wouldn't have been so pissed off when
people started cloning less you know
like I think somebody told me something
like that was it was like imitation is
whatever it's like the best compliment
or some but it does piss me off
when you know like people then filtrate
and come to you and be like oh no I just
want to I just want to learn I just want
to cry but you want to listen that but
then they start copying what you're
doing you're hard-working you're you're
high qualit is your formula the
that works for you they start doing it
but at the same time is like that's what
it means to be successful it's like look
at PewDiePie how many people have not
copied PewDiePie's alright how many
people have not copied um who else is
amol bit cute
like all of them right all the big
youtubers
even though how you call it girl
Michelle Phan right she started really
blowing up with all the makeup tutorials
and all that shame and you know how many
girls copy her style millions so
I know people are gonna copy my shape
and but to me the idea is if I don't
know you or if I haven't talked to you
fine copy everything because I don't
even know you exist you know but if I
know you I'm subscribed to you it and I
 helping you out
don't cologne ma che cuz then it's like
you're doing it right in my face it's
like oh yeah it's like you helping me
out but I'm not doing rain from in front
of you like don't do it in front of me
do it somewhere where I don't see it
like you can copy me copy my style copy
what I do but don't let me know that
you're doing it come on
this is hard work I come here every
single day in the hard work man but yeah
anyways man going back to my 500
thousand subscribers were found reviews
sorry we got things seven thousand
every day
now I know that the channels gonna
continue growing because that's how
YouTube works you keep on being
consistent to comes in and just you know
blow see what look at everybody's
channel they start from the bottom
they spend there's a lot of people here
who you know who are successful now and
they only had like 300 views 300
subscribers like every month for like a
whole year right so what I'm doing is
unprecedented like they have there
hasn't been nobody who's done this
right probably the only person that is
doing at the same level with me is
Christian right so besides that nobody
else in this web development community
nobody has done it like me yeah man it's
pretty cool man I think it I'm doing
something something different you know
and I want to say thank you guys like I
said thank you guys for showing showing
love and always being here and
supporting I really appreciate it we
killing the game let's see what happens
next year right let's see what happens
next year where we're gonna start
touching those hundred thousand you know
hundred thousand subscribers two hundred
thousand subscribers I want to see if I
can touch the 1 million you know what I
mean like if I can touch the 1 million
I'm good because I'll get my little
youtube plaque about a I forgot enough
is the silver or the golden I don't know
one of those the big-ass plaque will be
like YouTube sent me that big-ass plaque
you know the money wait that way you did
so yeah so I'm really I'm really
stressing about it
yeah man I think everybody starts
somewhere and then they start branching
off doing other stuff me personally I'm
always gonna stay with when it comes to
this channel is gonna stay with what
development and maybe gaming I wanna I
wanna continue on like making games but
in html5 not with unity or now with any
other engine I want to
do it with what I would go with I'm good
with HTML CSS JavaScript and then a
couple of other back back in languages
but I just want to stick to that I wanna
stick to the web you know but you never
know I might might just hop on software
development later on if I get bored but
for now all I want to focus on that's
just the web but yeah man we in here
I'll see you guys later man drip DRI BBB
three B's l EECOM dribble dot-com is
better
yeah definitely there's definitely the
you know this the innovators and then
there's the imitators for sure I mean it
comes with the game you know what I mean
you do something successful people see
what you're doing and then they start
taking your formula but the problem for
me is like I'm not big yet you know like
let my formula grow let my grow
because the way how this thing works is
I'm doing something good and then people
are liking and people are gravitating it
right but the audience that I have is
not the same audience that you have
right and they haven't seen me yet so
when they do see me they're gonna be
like oh you copy from this person
because they're ignorant and they don't
know that this person copy for me you
know what I mean like that's my problem
that's where I'm like yelling let me
grow once I become like a hundred
thousand subscribers then everybody
could copy me do whatever the hell you
want but what I'm still small is like
you know what I mean is like it's like
some little kid at a lemonade stand and
 he got the sauce for the best
lemonade but he's just doing in a little
lemonade stand right and then comes
other people take his sauce and
he's like yo I was planning on opening
up a store for lemonade's I was gonna
open up a juicing bar what happened now
everybody got my sauce you know what I
mean so now he can't open his juice bar
because everybody got it and then other
people who did not create and start
opening up the juice bars and you're
like wait what I'm the creator
of this you know but whatever
that's how it is man yeah your boy
shaved I'm out here man wearing let's go
that was the old company I used to work
for yeah it's that's how it is man
Verizon sucks

coding phase comm guys I'm telling you
right now it's the best the best how can
I say this best money you're gonna spend
because you're getting constant content
and when you're a developer and you're
trying to get into the industry one of
the hardest things is finding the right
projects finding the right resources
finding the right things to learn
especially and at an affordable price
nobody's doing it like me right so
