again coding fees.com your boy is
backing out and did it again yeah we
here we live kids yellow man
misinformation man can derail you man
misinformation can send you the wrong
path
right you know sometimes you know you
just have to be careful out here man cuz
it's like you go on ready
you're gonna stack overflow you go on
you know YouTube you go on team
treehouse forums you go to wherever
right and misinformation could pretty
much derail you from oh you know way
that he was going or any was going the
right way and there's somebody hitches
oh man don't do this because this
doesn't that and it hits into left right
I bring this up sorry Philippe we're
bringing you up on here right
so I released that video about why learn
PHP in 2018 and give you pretty much
good examples why somebody should learn
PHP in 2018 right now the title itself
is a little bit
click baby I'll probably change it to a
more of like reasons why you should
learn PHP or something better right but
the first thing that Philippe says is
like you know in the US average if you
have to choose between learning on a PHP
go for know first now what you gotta
remember this is kids it's probably
everybody who's here right dairy junior
developers people who don't even work in
the industry people who never even coded
before right so if I'm watching this
video I'm thinking okay I'm gonna come
in and maybe I should look into the PHP
and I go on here and then the first
thing that I see is like man if you live
in the USA you gotta go for note but
then you don't look at the
itself we're pretty much we go and show
you that you can choose any city in the
United States right any city in the
United States and you're going to have
two times three times four times more
jobs in PHP then nodejs
right and another thing that I don't
know if I want in in the video where I
explained to people we're pretty much if
you're a developer who has been around
for a long time right
or you have experiments all right most
likely you want to work on the newer
things I mean if you are a developer
that has been doing PHP who has been
doing Perl who has been doing JavaScript
most likely you're going to go into the
newer things you're gonna jump into a
lick sir you're gonna jump to know GS
you're gonna jump to go lang all right
now what does that mean that means that
those jobs is gonna be open even more
jobs is gonna be out there for PHP now
this is the thing that sometimes people
forget you know there is a disadvantage
of being self-taught right there is a
big disadvantage which is you don't have
experience right the reason why a
college degree might be good not because
they know more than you most of this
computer science students know the same
amount of programming as you
they have theory what they don't even
know how to code a lot of them trust me
I know I've seen a lot of people that
come in with degrees and then you
straight out of college and is they
barely know anything it happens because
schools are not good schools is not
really good for for teaching people how
to program but going back to - this
thing is when you go into the marking
you're looking for a job you're out
you're looking for a job and you go like
okay I'm gonna try to go for nodejs I'm
gonna try to go for Golding I'm gonna
try to go for all those jobs
that in reality they want people who
have experience right why will they
choose somebody who was brand new right
who has no experience nobody to back him
up nobody to say hey we trusted him
we're gonna hire him right or why would
they choose that person or choose
somebody who has been in the industry
for years right these guys who have been
coding in asp.net who have been using
javascript for years right they know
what what development is like they know
what programming is like they know
JavaScript right why would they hire you
a brand new developer who you know
nobody knows you why would they hire you
and I hired that other guy why would
they hire somebody who's coming in from
Java who wants to say hey I want to
learn no js' I took a little quick
course cuz once you know web development
once you know what development you
pretty much could say you know every
language out there cuz all it is is just
different syntax right but why would
they not hire that person who has six
seven years or even eight ten I've seen
guys going in for interviews with over
ten years of experience as as web
developers who wanna now become no js'
developers why would they hire them
right or why would they hire you instead
of them like you know I mean now when it
comes to PHP is actually better for
junior developer somebody who pretty
much doesn't know anything or somebody
who has no experience who's brand-new to
go into a PHP job because most of the
companies a lot of times they hiring
offshore ready hiring for Indian
developers and they'd rather have
somebody in-house even if that person
doesn't know everything about PHP they
get that opportunity right so if you're
somebody we just pretty much I guess so
many people who send me questions the
McMahan I don't know which one to pick
you bump into that comment you liked in
the USA
you have to choose between learning node
or PHP go for nose-first automatically
you're like oh you know what a lot of
people is gonna get persuaded about that
all right they're gonna be like okay I'm
gonna just I'm gonna learn node right
I'm gonna focus on node right and then
when they go to job interviews they're
like oh wait they're gonna hit you a
whole bunch of questions they're hard
because that's one thing that people
doesn't understand too when you don't
have a degree right you don't have a
degree you don't have to portfolio you
don't have the history you don't have a
company that says hey we trusted this
guy for a year he trusted a guy for two
years in our company we trust this guy
for six months in our company what
happens they hit you up with the white
boards they hit you up with a whole
bunch of difficult questions they they
make your life more harder than what it
is because you have to prove to them hey
you could hire me right and that's
something that I feel like people don't
understand you know when people drop
commas like that it just derails the
people that were going in a right way
and then just derails in like slams them
to a wall because then they start going
that oh they focus six months seven
months on just no GS they go to a job
interview okay they could pass the
couldn't pass the test right but then if
they would want to uh you know focus on
PHP for like a month and a half they
probably could've had a journal by now
could've been doing WordPress could have
been doing Larimer could be doing slim
could have been doing symphony there's
some million jobs out there there's
literally look it up do your research
I'm not talking about I'm gonna do this
right now alive because I like to do
things live and just to put it clear out
there man because I just I don't like
misinformation you know that's the
problem that's my only problem you could
give me any comment you want you could
tell me anything that you want but when
you give misinformation is like that
burns my blood I'll be honest that does
burn my blood that's like right now
somebody tells me right now and be like
freaking let's see something that's
freaking ridiculous they'll be like hey
man a Honda Civic is better than a
Ferrari that would burn my blood I'll be
honest like that will really burn my
blood because it's like it's pretty
clear out there but then there'll be
people who just don't know this stuff
and oh yeah maybe a hundred Civic is
better than a Ferrari right so and
that's what people don't don't focus on
like me I've tried that
now give an opinion or comment that if I
know is gonna hurt other people's I just
don't give it that's what I do
all right but I'm gonna prove to you
guys a little something so this how you
actually look for things and realize how
many jobs is out there how many
companies are really looking for PHP
developers you come here go to advanced
searches search PHP under titles now
mining when we put it by the title you
are actually missing a lot of other
companies because a lot of the companies
might put PHP on on the description but
if they specifically want somebody who
does
PHP they're going to put PHP on the
title so that's what we're searching for
right now this is New York City a
hundred and five jobs right let's look
for nodejs no 52 so for every job in New
York City for node this is actually two
jobs out there for PHP great so as a
junior developer I love I don't know if
people look around this this channel I
think people forget this channel is
about junior developers is about people
who are getting into the industry right
most of these jobs here the moment you
see ninety five thousand all right the
moment you see that starting point
they're not looking for Jenni developers
I'm being honest they now know companies
to come in and give you 95,000 straight
out of your udemy's right here I came in
with a ulama course nobody's gonna do
that for you guys all right so of course
you could get that job in a year two
years from now after let's say you have
a company that trustee you say okay this
person works here he's been a developer
for a year two years right now when you
jumped to the next the next job you know
okay now I want to become a node.js
developer cuz nobody stopping you from
learning in your own crib right nobody's
stopping you from saying hey I've gotta
learn no js' on my whole time I'm gonna
really work hard on this work on MongoDB
working um Express Pass for all this
stuff right work on my JavaScript
interview questions right nobody's
stopping you from doing that but at the
same time it's like if you're a junior
developer and you're like hey guys I'm
just I'm gonna focus on on on nodejs
just because javascript is I already
know the basics of JavaScript and I
don't want to learn another another
language because I keep hearing that
tool I got to start Stack Overflow and
people put in like oh man you can't you
should have never PHP because it's like
if you already know HTML CSS and
JavaScript you could continue learning
JavaScript and do the backend with
JavaScript and do MongoDB with basically
JavaScript because it's very similar to
objects in JavaScript and it's like wait
what hey okay so there's New York City
right let's go to let's see I want I
want to give it to the people in a
chatroom let's look at the chatter of
Marina let's go into the chatroom
where's the chat room real quick I like
to show things you know I mean cuz I
just don't like misinformation
the Internet has so much misinformation
is not even funny when you know and the
problem with that is that it just
derails people you know you could be
doing good you could be like on the
right path because it used to happen to
me like it used to happen to me
the time I didn't learn pH feel to like
probably like my third year I didn't
learn no backing I'm telling you I
didn't learn nothing in the backend
because every time I'll be like oh man
the best you know you just learn HTML
CSS and JavaScript learning angular
backbone business and that'd be a front
of developer this isn't that right
I don't really focus on no back-end at
all right because of like comments
online and things that I will read up
and listen down but oh man you know I
did some a little bit of WordPress in
the beginning but I don't even know PHP
I was like working on WordPress and not
even know PHP like it was that bad right
so all because of misinformation all
because of misinformation and I just I
don't like misinformation because it's
like the the Internet soul full of that
like people just leave comments without
even thinking and then they just leave
it there because it's like if you go in
and rethink what you you write and
rethink of like can it do harm to others
you know what I mean like that's how I
look at it you know what I mean like I'm
just saying I'm the type of person I was
like when when you know like what's this
guy's name
even you he was like oh but you know he
goes like you know people or wasn't gate
Labs is hiring for huge yes and it's
like a bro jail because in San Francisco
four companies are hiring for huge yes
doesn't mean all over the country is
like that at all
all right at all right I don't know type
of person that I look at the bigger
picture I don't look at haters in my
area the solidus on my five block radius
no I look outside of the picture right
and there's the problem where a lot of
youtubers there's a problem with with
like the internet and whole like there's
so much issues man like it is pretty
much ridiculous right
pretty much ridiculous but and
give me a city ring I want anybody on
the chatroom I'm gonna chat room right
now
give me a city right now all right give
me a city let's go give me a city we're
gonna look into it we're gonna look into
that City it doesn't matter any city
that you guys are from give me a city
okay good old DC okay let's say Memphis
right let's say Memphis all right cool
let us go to Memphis Tennessee Tenakee
all right good old Memphis right
the Memphis is what we call a third
market you know it's like a there's like
one of those cities that are big enough
but not big like New York City they're
not big like Dallas they're not big like
Austin they're not big like LA they're
not big like San Francisco they're not
big like Washington State's on capital
they're not like Seattle they're not
freaking Oregon Portland like they're
not like that right so let's look into
this right no js' to this to Jobson
nodejs in Memphis okay that's the PHP
it's wound down right sometimes it
happens like that and that's good
now let's look into another city let's
say what was the other city you guys had
oh let me see I did New York already
let's see Phoenix Arizona see Phoenix AZ
Hale it's 12 jobs fixing jobs right this
is okay no GS three jobs
I'm just saying all right okay let's
look into give me another city guys come
on Nashville and ash meal it's a little
bit bigger city bank I think Memphis
let's look into it
okay there's three jobs for no HP seven
jobs all right now this is specifically
looking into the ones that say PHP and
note right because people get confused
if we come here and we remove this
that's gonna be way more than that right
there's 50 jobs for PHP and if we come
here
now when you say 50 jobs for PHP you
including WordPress you're including
different ecommerce Magento right I just
wanted to see regular PHP right when we
come here we say no which is one of the
things that messes it up is that a lot
of companies coming here and they put
nodejs on the description because they
think not even a couple sorry not even
the company the recruiters they say hey
if we want somebody to know nodejs
which in reality or they really care
about does this person on how to use npm
there's people that don't even know how
to use npm so what they do is as a
requirement to say on the description
node right but somehow people really
think that there's those jobs for no GS
out there right I don't think the whole
United States revolves around New York
San Francisco in LA I really don't think
so right so most of the people are here
it's probably like I don't know like
maybe 10% of the people that comes to
this channel alone they're from those
cities right then everybody else is from
all over the United States right if I
come in and I give you guys an advice
and I tell you hey guys
no genius is the hottest thing right now
in the blocking you should definitely
learn it cuz you're going to find a job
now I mean general and acting us if
that's how it is everywhere
is now that's not how the real world
works is like it's popular in the big
cities New York City San Francisco and
LA a couple of other little places and
even in those major cities it's not like
there's a thousand jobs for four people
it's like fifty to a hundred jobs per
month right so you know we we get this
numbers messed up and we tell people
advices I'll do this do that and we kind
of mess them up and derail them send
them send them the wrong way I see this
all the time we're already I see this
all the time on on YouTube I see all the
time or Stack Overflow you have to when
you give an opinion or you give an
advice to people you have to think of
the bigger picture especially when
you're online most people are gonna come
in and look at a comment look at a topic
that somebody might come up with and be
like oh man this is what I should do
even though they live in and freaking
Cincinnati or they live in Oklahoma like
I can no J let's look for let's look for
Oklahoma let's say kam what's the coming
here he's from Oklahoma City right hey
look at this this is just pointing it
out this is not even going straight to
the title right in Oklahoma City when we
do a regular nodejs
a note search right without adding the
title all right
you have 16 jobs if if cam comes in here
and looks at that comment and be like oh
maybe I should learn nodejs that's what
I need to focus on let's look what PHP
guy
Ernie found literally double if we come
in and we do one title HP it's six jobs
it's not an amazing city to find jobs
but first look at that literally two
times doesn't matter how we search it
there's literally two times the jobs of
known GS and then when we act a factor
of
you know which one's gonna be a higher
barrier for a burning junior developer
to get in when we add that little thing
that little thing which people keep
forgetting about right and the fact that
if something is hot it means all the top
best talent is gonna try to get into
that hi-c the hot job right what happens
to that junior developer what happens to
that person who's teaching himself in
his house what happens to that person
who's learning on you to me laughing
said I wasn't learning on Udacity team
treehouses what happens to those people
right big guy you know what I mean no
loop no nothing just raw they get fun I
think I don't want to curse but that's
what happens you know so this is my
warning to all of you guys be careful
when you read comments be careful when
you look for opinions on youtubers this
even youtubers out here who tell you hey
you should focus on this and that and
it's like you looking back at them you
look at their the history and you're
like wait you just got a job six months
ago your first job and you'll be given
opinions on it all right it doesn't
sound right right now another times to
like this happens is like people giving
opinions on certain things from their
market without doing the research and
looking outside of what's going on
across the globe and across the United
States that's all I'm saying ring and
muffle Philippe I'm taking you as an
example I could have taken this other
kid from Stack Overflow comment but at
least people here they know you and they
know you don't mean it in a bad way
but at the same time I want to point
that out to people you have to be
careful when you while we here searching
for information online because not
everybody is gonna give you a accurate
accurate calming accurate
topping or helps anything in opinion
they're not gonna give you that no
because sometimes I always say this a
lot of times people revolve the world
around them
and don't think that they're part of the
world which is this whole thing right
and it just happens like that you know I
guess like right now if I join if I join
a group right if I join a group I'll be
like man we love we love the Harry
Potter framework and you know everybody
got a nickname like my name is Harry
her name is Hermione his name is you
know Baltimore whatever the other guy's
name is everybody got a nickname for
each other
you know when we go into this the real
world will be like man everybody listen
to indie watch stuff you know the Harry
Potter man everybody does every Potter
framework but then when they go out to
the world they're like that's not how it
is man I got lied to you know I can't
find a job in six months I went to this
boot camp and they were like you know I
seen this all the time look it up you
know people look to boot camps they're
like man they told me that there was 90
percent of the people getting hired for
nodejs developers 90 percent of people
getting hired from Ruby on Rails
developers and as I broke you're a
junior developer companies don't trust
you yet right you can't even pass a
white board a question and because it's
like it's like this it's like I always
tell you guys if you don't have two
projects to portfolios you just need to
get into the industry first all right
you need to get an incident in this
result you could have that stand you
could have that that you know that that
little weight on top of you that says
hey another company hired me before so
it means that they hire me and I was
there for six months a year I'm good you
should
Hayami if you have that you're gonna be
good but if you're showing up and be
like hi and I learned I learned how to
code on udemy in teen treehouse and a
little bit of youtube if you go in there
with just that not even a legit
portfolio because the portfolio is work
what exits out algorithms right this is
why I always tell people focus on your
portfolio so echo X out algorithms they
can X out whiteboard psycho ex out the
dumb question that people ask you this
questions that people ask you on on
interviews just to mess with you
literally just to be like we don't know
if this kid could do anything so now we
just gotta give a lot a super hard
question to make sure that he can't get
the job because we just don't trust them
when you have a resume when you have a
portfolio people are going to trust you
they might okay this person worked for
this company works for this company we
want him right well how do you get those
companies you gotta get your your foot
in the door you know be careful with
listening to everybody out here be
careful with reading every coming out
here it's just not it's just not worth
it you know what I mean that's all I'm
saying
and I'm just saying in in general you
know this is just not just this specific
comment but it's just in general man
like you just gotta be careful here you
know I mean like you you are at a stage
where you are pretty much searching you
don't even know if you want to become a
developer a lot of people you don't even
know if they really want to become a
freaking developer at all you know what
I mean like they just don't know yeah
right so if you come in and you're like
man I'm gonna choose this this person's
telling me this but there are no persons
telling me that and then I go to another
channel and the person's telling me
although this or somebody else comes in
this other thing now you're lost you
didn't even get to to really start
building anything you even get to learn
anything you don't even have anything to
show forth to get a job that's all I'm
saying man you know what I mean
so yeah man we in here and I just need
to put that clear man like literally
this two jobs two to four jobs right not
even for jobs two times and four times
the amount of jobs in most markets
compared to no GS right don't be fool
with what people say oh no Jay has this
laundry is that and yes I do teach no GS
because at some point you will be
prepared for that like you should learn
it nothing don't learn it but you have
to focus on the thing that's gonna catch
you inside the door right so if somebody
comes in and tells the Jemez don't learn
PHP because PHP s-- is old and PHP is de
PHP is a walking zombie like I've seen a
comment today on Stack Overflow where
some kills like he was named a second
before it was Cora some kid was just
asking like a regular questions like
it's like there's so many jobs yeah he
acts something like oh there's a lot of
jobs in my area you know for PHP should
I learn it and then somebody literally
left the comment Willy PHP is a walking
zombie you should not learn PHP because
PHP is just it's about to die any moment
the arms and next is gonna fall off and
I'm like what like where does this
person get this idea like the kid is
already telling you in his area there's
more jobs for PHP but he's asking online
to find out what what do people think a
smart person will come in and tell them
hey look at your areas this more jobs in
your areas for PHP learn PHP but this
kid and I look at the other guys poor
arm profile and the guy's been around
for like
he used to be a PHP developer says PHP
developer for 12 years no G has
developer for 2 years and it's like bro
you telling a junior developer who
hasn't even touched PHP yet and you're
telling them hey don't even learn it
because I'm already burnt out for 12
years and now I want to become an odious
and nodejs is cool and we all got a jump
on it it was like bro man like freaking
information alignment sucks you know
what I mean like I really think so man
sometimes you know it's like and people
probably do the same thing to me they be
like they come in here and they be like
oh man like like when this guy Joe you
don't know what you're talking about
this isn't that in his like man I'm
looking at the bigger picture and I
can't I can't do a and give up an advice
or give an opinion about things just for
my area man I have to think outside of
my area I gotta think about as a whole I
actually do my research you know what I
mean I actually look online I actually
look at what's popular wasn't that
popular was trending and nothing that
which people they confuse was popular
with what's trending popular means
everybody's using it trending is more of
like hey this is cool
people are trying it out and they
starting to use it alright if you look
at certain languages you see that PHP is
not trending P streets actually not
downwards is going down but what does
that mean it means it's not being
installed new right in new projects new
startups they're not using PHP what
they're using is the cool stuff
no GES gold angle or whatever it looks
sir that's what people are actually
using but the reality of things is as a
junior developer especially as a
self-taught the
all right your road to get in that job
it's so much easier with PHP then you
thinking that hey you're gonna get a job
as an ojs developer that's it anyways
any questions any comments anything you
guys want to say about this let me know
I'm here to read see what you guys think
let me see let me see
yes it means let's put this on the
screen bring it up for Phillippe cuz I
still think he really does not
understand nothing I I just told them
okay so he goes like let's see now where
is it
how much you how many new projects no
vs. PHP alright now when it comes to
jobs I hope you understand this two
startups come and go right
businesses are always their startups
want somebody who actually knows what
they're doing
may level to senior level the developers
is rare for a start-up to say hey we're
gonna hire junior developers for our
startup right but you know Sally's
ecommerce around the corner that sells
free game pasta sauce right and they
sell it online they sell pasta sauce
they freakin hiring uni developers
because they've been around for 10 15
years and they actually need just extra
hands they don't need people to come in
and create new things they need people
to just be extra hand and that's where
junior developers come in this is
something that people forget I just
don't know I don't know that what I'm
saying I mean do people understand what
I'm saying here do people understand
what I'm saying I'm just wondering you
know leave one leave the number one if
you understand what I'm saying and leave
the number two if you don't understand
what I'm saying if you guys don't
understand what I just broke down for
why like the past 15 20 minutes cuz I
still
thankfully understand I don't think you
are understanding it's one or two one
hurt to just leave it believe one or two
just wanna see if people are
understanding what I'm saying you know
what I mean like I'm not saying don't
learn no Jesus I'm saying you are a
self-taught developer are you going to
listen to me who are pretty much telling
you the easiest route for you because
all you care about is that one job it
doesn't matter if that one job paste
your 40,000 that one job pays you 50 60
70 thousand you need to get your foot on
the door you know I mean
but falou says I don't understand him
asking me about wish projects which
companies are actually popping out with
PHP there's not that many brand-new ones
right there's a lot of you was using
laravel there's a lot of people using
arrow from a lot of startups right but
if you're looking into like you know
like the cool startups like let's say a
freaking over or whatever like they're
not using PHP they're using no GS but
they're not looking for junior
developers that's it that's where that
the whole conversation that you're
trying to say about newer projects I
just explained it to you that there's no
there's no companies out there that are
brand new like you know startups for PHP
that's fine but during the ones that are
startups and they using node.js they're
not looking for junior developers at all
they're not because why would i if I'm
I've been in a situation right as a
senior developer where I mean behind the
scenes behind the desk asking the
questions to people right somebody comes
in right and tells me hey even when we
was doing laravel or when we was doing
nodejs
being another company I used to work
with we asked this question okay who has
the most experience right there's people
coming in from Java developers there's
people coming in from asp.net developers
who know the whole process of what
development they know the whole process
was XML JSON dealing with REST API right
a guy coming in with 8 9 years under his
belt right or a brand new cake who just
learned it online which one is going to
get the job right now
I just showed you guys from my last job
the most recent one I told you guys a
kid just got hired with no knowledge no
knowledge of laravel no knowledge of PHP
no knowledge of nothing and got hired
for $50,000 this happens all the time
what I want people here is to get the
best opportunity I don't want them to
come in and be like oh man Joe lied to
me I want people to continue getting
those good you know comments that they
keep leaving me on my messages in my
emails and telling me oh man I just got
a job thank you Joe
oh you were so right man I started
applying for PHP jobs and now I got a
job I thought the class that you had
like I even took it out I took it out my
description cuz people were not
complaining
Oh Joe the PHP course that you had was
out it was old it was made in 2015-2016
I took it out when people actually what
course that I took to learn PHP I gave
them that course and people were like oh
that's old this doesn't matter okay cool
I'll take it out I removed it for my
description right and then mind you all
the people that took those courses send
me emails thanking me say hey Java I got
a job
hey I'm working at this agency doing
WordPress it's pretty easy I can't
believe like I even got a job for this
like that's all I want to continue
seeing you know it's not about Joe
versus Filipe
it's more about like man we just have to
be honest here I understand the audience
that's here is people who are trying to
to learn this man trying to get the you
know their foot on the door you have 12
years you say you've been doing
WordPress for a long time then you
should know that WordPress is so easy
that people go in there and get those
jobs they don't even know WordPress
right but how can you at the same time
then you can
fall into a wall where it happened to me
when I learned some of WordPress like
the simple things to do with the UI
right with the user interface and the
front-end but then when I wanted to do
more advanced things I hit a wall
because I don't know PHP how can you
really jump forward and say hey jump
over PHP without knowing you know to
learn WordPress without knowing PHP
that's all I'm saying
so and that's it but that's exactly what
I'm telling you if Philippe says exactly
Joe so why learn the language in
administrative just learning WordPress
and spend more time on know why because
you still need to know PHP to do things
on WordPress
if you gotta create a beam you could go
in and create a child theme but you
can't create your own theme without
knowing PHP if a company comes in and
tells you hey I want you to build me a
plug-in how can you build a plugin for
WordPress
if you don't know PHP that's it I'm done
man no ha that's it no I think I already
like it is is clear if you don't get it
by now I can't I can't try to help you
out man but all I could say to people is
warning be careful of opinions out there
because when you just throw something
out there it's out on the internet you
know what I mean you throw something out
there it's on the engine you know what I
mean like even I myself I'm guilty of it
and then now I've realized I'm like man
I just can't give out opinions on unless
I do a research unless I'm
I'm well informed on it because people
they get the wrong the wrong messages
and they get the real I did a video
about elixir in my room I guess my first
month of doing YouTube I did a a video
of elixir how much I hate it in Excel
and how much this doesn't that somebody
set me down broke it down to me
after they broke it down the same way
now I I just broke it down for you Alex
for for me after they broke it down for
me what did i do I just say cool delete
I deleted it because I was like yo this
is he just broke it down to me he's like
there's no way that elixir is bad and
elixir doesn't have jobs and it mixes
doesn't it's not a great languaging
doesn't have a great paradigm of
functional programming right all the
things that I sell in a video which
misinformed people from learning it and
then the guy explained to me he's like
go look at this you've got ten thousand
ten thousand views on this right ten
thousand people came in so that video
send other people that could have came
in and actually done something positive
with elixir they no longer are using it
or they they think in their head
OLX is not good right because of your
video sometimes giving a Miss
information does more damage than
helping others right and that's what I
want to say you know what I mean like
you got to know your audience you got to
know who you're talking to you got to
know who are the people that are reading
that you know what I mean like it's not
gonna it's not gonna help nobody out you
know what I mean and that's why also too
like somebody sent me just a private
message right now st. Joe you need to
just you know just I don't know why you
answer to anybody in the comments you
too big for that you don't need to be
talking and answering back in the
comments and just do your videos and
that's it
let it be out there it's not about that
it's the fact that I don't want people
missing form right I don't want people
seeing it I'm not the type of person but
I'm I'm a little comic
block something no I let it be there but
I just don't like people being
misinformed right so I rather gift under
the details give them the proof and be
like let them decide all right
if literally we just went online and we
looked on on things that says hey this 2
times 2 4 times the jobs in every city
that you might search for no G as in PHP
then that's on you if you if you don't
want to understand what's the what I'm
telling you you know I mean so that's
all I'm saying
kids so what's good what's poppin nah
I'm just saying I'm trying to help you
out so you understanding you know what I
mean because I don't think you
understood what I was saying and I don't
even think that you saw the video before
you drop the comment and I know other
people will see dander like man maybe
he's right and it's like actually he's
not right you know what I mean but
anyways when we in here we laugh man I
just want to come in here before I go to
sleep let it be out there I'm pretty
much I'm not gonna I must stop looking
at the comments I must stop looking at
the comments whoever wants to reach out
to me send me a message coding phase at
gmail.com you know because I'm not gonna
you know there's really no point no even
I do a video to try to help people out
and explain to them why the situation
why is it wrong then it still it just
doesn't go through so it's like I'm I'm
pretty much talking to a wall like I'm
talking to a wall explaining why we're
here man we in here man I'm just trying
to do my videos record them release them
that's a you know questions leave your
questions send them to me you know and
that's it man cuz I'm just not gonna go
in and and you know read every single
comment cuz then it's like I'm the type
of person that I want to make a video
about every single comment I'm not like
one of those people who just don't read
it and be like oh this is wrong but I'll
just leave it there no I'm like no this
is wrong here's the proof here's how
things are so then when I come in I just
do some a video I'm like or a livestream
explaining back talking back to a
comment then people be like yo Joe you
just gotta chill you know in sync and
it's true I just gotta chill I got a lot
of things to do but I just I enjoy I
enjoy man I like coming in here you know
it's like it's a community man you know
we have everybody has different opinions
everybody has different things everybody
can say whatever they want you know and
at the same time I think I can respond
back you know what I mean I could
actually break it down and I hate this
is right because of this this is wrong
because of that so I have to just do it
I'm that type of person man like I
remember one time we were talking about
you know in the this one of the main
reasons why this thing is so big with me
where I have to explain it to people
because I was just like that listen when
I first came into this thing I was such
a big you know big
Ruby on Rails developer like I was like
so big on Ruby on Rails and I'm still so
big on Ruby on Rails that nobody could
tell me not a prob er else but then I
just kept getting embarrassed right well
you know all the developers come in and
explain to me you know Ruby on Rails is
slow
work da-da-dah they break it down that I
okay every other crap every other
programming language out there is faster
than Ruby right and you would like now
move with Ruby or rails is so easy you
could you know create an app like this
that's easy and they're like listen this
is why people are walking away from Ruby
on Rails this is why no new companies
are really working on it this is why
companies that are actually using Ruby
on Rails only one senior developers
right and it's like I was like nah man
this is the best a lot of times I just
got embarrassed right because this all
the people there's like it's like right
now it was like you know like let's say
I mean fun fun function who have a
conversation he's so deep into
JavaScript that I know he will come in
and break it down to me and embarrass me
just like yo this is why this how all
freaking this how much memory uh a loop
is taking a for loop is taking on on
JavaScript and it's like okay you got it
you know what I mean this times I he's
gonna say ok you got it
you you you got that you know what I
mean so sometimes you just gotta be out
here man and I try to just help people I
try to just give them the right way man
but I do my blood does burn when I'm
like man like where is the research you
know that me it's like when even use 10
means like like boom
you were the freaking creator of view J
yes right one of the most popular
frameworks under the freaking Sun right
and you're telling me hey everybody's
hiring view J yes because you know get
labs and Adobe yen you know Alibaba is
using him and it's like do you just look
at San Francisco in China and now look
at the whole world and now look do your
research like that dude doesn't even do
his research and he's supposed to be
super smart like you know everything
those are the
is that my blood burn on my girl you
supposed to be super smart how how hard
is it that you can't search do a search
before you tell me now hey Vijay has got
a whole bunch of jobs and it's like Oh
like look it up like literally like he
don't even go online and search think we
come here we look at this right view
jobs right there's no jobs for view on
the title right but if you search for
view there might be on the description
because people add it right people add
it to their thing even though they don't
use view like working code right they
use react and I know that for a fact
right working code but they put view
because view is in the top three most
popular frameworks right now but
nobody's hiring for view Jay as
developer all right so it's like even
for this guy was this guy's name mom
Maximilian's the the guy who creates on
the vgs courses are you to me and it's
like yes he come he's making a lot of
money with people pretty much going in
and by his view Jay s course well is
like most of these people don't don't
even do the research you know what I
mean they don't even do the research
like I could go in and sell somebody a
dream but what if somebody does the
research do I look stupid in you know
what I mean like that's why I'd rather
just do my research before I say
anything and it's like you know it's
just crazy man it's the internet blame
it on the internet man there's a
Wikipedia man you go Wikipedia like
there's some stuff that's real with a
Wikipedia but then you start looking at
all all the things out there and like
wait what you could create a wiki I
could create a Wikipedia right now but I
think one of you guys could create a a
Wikipedia and be like Joe Santos Garcia
you two heard you know freakin warning
in Siberia in 1964 and then you like
wait what like I wasn't born in 1964 but
anybody could go in there and put in
that comment put in that information and
I was like you know I was like we look
back at this had to breathe politically
like we bring it to to trauma it's like
fake media is like so this Allah I think
that's true tonight is like this freakin
fake media people could literally go on
Facebook create a media news and be like
freaking Joe across the street guy hit
by a car you know freakin he's being
he's being freakin put down on Onderdonk
freaking cemeteries on Saturday at 2:00
p.m.
everybody shows up and they're like what
happened I saw this on Facebook like
what happened he's he's ok I thought we
was gonna you know have to virgin fall
for him this and that is like some guy
just decided to create that news on
Facebook and now everybody believed it
you know those like that reminds me of
like you know the internet now reminds
me of like I remember when I was like
liking 6th grade a sighting like that
first greatest things people were saying
that uh that Jermaine Dupri high-rate
bow-wow and like that was like a big
thing on my school like everybody told
the body like it's it's great everyone's
I kill you know it's like freakin they
have to give bow stitches and this and
that and like people believed it for
like a good month and then I was like
man I was doing shows what you mean to
pre like that can't be real you know
what I mean like everybody's like man
they had to give speeches to to bow out
man
Jermaine Dupri read them like what you
know what I mean it's the internet
nowadays man like you gotta be careful
with the information you get out here
man that's for real like I'm just making
fun of
you know what it's just funny man I'm
the type of person I just wanna just
correct things man you know I'm that
type of person you know say what you
want you know on that time I'm that type
of dude it's just like man you're the
facts you know but anyways we ain't here
we chillin right now quick little video
yo why people always show up when I'm
doing some like some chill chill video
chill livestream you know it'll be like
30 40 when there's like some Rara stream
is like 50 60 70 people in here watching
like killing jobs going in you know I
mean why you guys don't show up what we
doing something something that's gonna
help you out yeah man I'm trying to I'm
trying to just like you know once I get
this right now you get into it this is
the the raw the raw and uncut coding
fees man like once I get this new studio
that I'm building man I'm gonna get a
studio nice background no more the
ghetto curtain like I'm just not I'm not
gonna have things like this I mean I'm
gonna have you know I'm gonna do the
cold steel thing man I might have the
cold the cold steel thing where it's
like he only asked us to emails duck the
questions people he's gonna have he has
like freaking interns and people who
could just answer to those things I'm
not gonna look at the comments man I'm
just gonna let it be just like cuz I
just see too much on the comments
man I'd just be like yeah what and you
know my Philippe is not just about you
he was like whoa Joe ripped Philippe
another it's just an Internet man
it's like cuz it happened to me man
that's what I'm telling you guys you
know to be careful because it happens
I didn't touch PHP for three years I
lost opportunities I lost jobs darker
taking I lost money I was making as much
money as I was you know the past two
years to three years the first three
years was like I was making like like
 no I mean if I woulda known
before like man I could have been good
since the beginning that's why I tell
you guys go to interviews or show up you
know learn PHP just so you don't you
don't have to go to work already
comfortable you know what I mean like
I'm the type of person that if I know
let's say an example let's say I know
where to get some food cheat I'm gonna
tell you we're together for cheap cuz I
want you to get that savings all right
I'm not one of those people that's like
man I went through it after I let them
go through it nah it's like I'm here to
tell the people the truth man I'm here
to be honest and give them the right the
right ropes man no I don't want nobody
going over here and messing up and you
know going through the wrong ways I want
everybody to be good bro
you know cuz that's only gonna help me
in the long run you know it's like if
everybody here my straight up if I out
of the 1,700 1,700 people that are my
website if those 1,700 people go and
they all get jobs right
those 1,700 people are gonna stay here
and they're gonna come back and tell
another four more people so then that's
like full let's say we have 4,000 people
on the channel or on the website like
it's only gonna benefit me all right so
that's why I'm trying to get people to
start getting jobs as soon as possible
so people can come in and be like yo
success stories you know what I mean
like just give out their testimony I
want people to go on on
all fours and they're all Commons when
people acts like you know you go to a
video but I oh man will you learn you
know somebody leaves the family oh man I
try no matter what to me I don't know
where to learning that people that
learned my way of teaching self to it
had to become a work developer
they'll leave a comment to that person
but I yo go check out called coding
phase go check out his kid Joe he helped
me out go check him out you'll
definitely help you out his website was
legit help Mia so that's all I want I
don't want nobody you didn't be real I
don't care who it is I don't care who
leaves a comment if I know is derailing
the people I'm gonna tell you the true
for body I'm gonna be like yo this is D
really the people this is not it's not a
honest or real calming a real top is a
real opinion cuz it's just not gonna be
good no if we over here if we all
mid-level c-level developers is like man
nerve you know there are no admit you
know you already have five years what
the hell are you doing you know you've
been doing PHP for five years what you
still doing PHP if you jump some other
cool things man that's what I will tell
people what all these people are brand
new developers people who are just
barely getting their feet wet people who
are just they just learning what a HTML
tag is I'm looking at the stats on my
website I'm like young like almost
everybody's doing to learn HTML CSS
literally I thought like people were
past I thought people were like gotta
come in and like they gonna be doing the
JavaScript under no idea is gonna be
doing a whole bunch of stuff the sass
and terminal nah like almost everybody's
doing learn HTML CSS which tells me like
you know everybody's just beginners man
you know I mean like we gotta help those
people out we can't give an overall
message we can't send them the wrong
route you know what I mean so that's
what I'm saying kids
I'm trying to get back to the chat man I
kicked myself out to check now just I
press back and took me out out of the
video let me see how I can get back in
let's see how to get back in our control
room anyways by the way for those of you
that do care about PHP and okay am i
learning whatever you guys want to learn
on the website man just look at the
website we got coding phase calm and go
to coding phase calm your boy is back
all courses go to all courses we never
hold this up man we don't at the bottom
here I started today we got the first
part at the beginning you know why our
PHP course requirements PHP my samples
are about installation our first page
with variables and then from there we
gotta continue you know we hit him we
hitting every single thing that you
could think of we hitting every single
thing that you can literally think about
PHP PHP is so easy especially if you
guys already did how you call this you
guys already did Java scared but you
already understand the concept of
program right now you've gotta learn the
little torques of you know freaking PHP
but that's it man it's not that hard at
all you know we in here kids will be
here me dropping knowledge we
rapping you know good stuff don't get
scared by the role in course for 40
bucks I mean it's definitely worth 40
bucks but we are doing 50% off so all
that stuff or if you're already a member
to my website like literally you click
on the description below you get every
single course for $10 all right
my thing is like when you think about is
the best to you for 10 bucks you could
probably do like two three courses in a
mark right and then so you got in it for
10 bucks and then you get every single
course out there I think you know
someone gonna hit me up today and she
accent like oh like do you see like do
you think that if I go through the whole
timeline would I be prepared to start
going for jobs in interviews I'm like
yeah like once you go and you finish the
future for JavaScript and you understand
that concept and you could go in and
build any design out of in a build any
website out of edit any design like you
go get a job this is a job for you out
there you know you can't stay home all
day thinking man I just gotta keep
learning and keep learning keep learning
and keep learning yes you could keep
learning but you can't spend a whole
year in your house just burning like
learn for like a month two months and
then start applying for jobs you will
get a job and then from there what
you're gonna do is you're gonna continue
learning as you are on the job
yeah man whoo yelling William says um
she sent me an email
she said if I'm starting a Facebook
group
I think I have a Facebook group coding
phase they should be there I just
haven't had already gone in that much
but I think I'm gonna focus on on the
Facebook group man because I I've been
telling people to go check out the how
you call this was the name of a the
discord in this code is cool cuz this
car is like you you chatting live you
know so that's how but the same time a
lot of people that make Facebook so we
also have the Facebook
chit chit chit chit anyways guys I just
did a whole bunch of videos today man
I'm telling you Sam okay you know like
one of the big things about you know
like working for yourself is like you
work for yourself you work the hours
that you want to work you knock out the
things that you want to knock out but at
the same time well use somebody like me
like I'm a workaholic like I'm disabled
personally I just wanna you know I can't
turn off you know what I mean like I was
literally about to go to sleep and then
I was like you know I gotta make a video
about this because misinformation is
really massive people walk all right now
for me I'm like man I can't turn off man
I need to disconnect I need to
disconnect from the internet man he's
like I'm constantly looking at the
comments constantly looking at emails
constantly sending back information you
know so I might have to disconnect a
little bit
along let me see this compatible package
oh yeah right I'm about to head out kids
you know thank you for everybody who's
in here yeah chill with us will nobody
man you know I'm trying to help you guys
out man trying to help you guys out for
real you know yeah
be careful misinformation out there you
are oh man you guys are crazy you guys
I'm reading the comments you guys the
message is on the chatroom you guys are
crazy learning that we in here man
missing check out that PHP toys go sign
up to my website man if you haven't
signed up listen sign up for more
freaking more man like literally sign up
for one month and that's it you know
sign up for month try it out I was
thinking about it I might bring back the
you know for the people that haven't
signed up yet I might bring back the
final special just for the people that
haven't signed up so it's like you got a
one-month trial for like five bucks to
try it out I mean you know a lot of
times people get lost and be like man 10
bucks and it's like do you know how much
money I spent per month on udemy I'll be
violating a minimum of six courses on
getting me per month right so do I
finish all of them do i do all of them
probably no you know but at the same
time it's like I like learning I like
looking at stuff you know and I know a
lot of people create a lot of good
content or
a unity so like when you come in here
and you know I'm gonna give you a good
contact I'm gonna break it down for you
really good and the way that you're
gonna be able to understand stuff man
ten bucks is nothing so a lot of people
are still they still if you like man I'm
just gonna do it for five you know I've
seen people send me emails like oh can I
do it for five and what people don't
understand is like like I quit my job
I'm doing this full time I'm working
24/7 I'm not one o'clock in the morning
talking to you guys helping people out
sending messages out you know you know
for three dollars it's not worth it
now if it's ten dollars I'll make about
seven dollars all right that makes sense
you know but a freaking three dollars it
does so it's not worth it you know
anyway probably will do that this maybe
this week give to people or first month
five dollars in there let them try it
out and that's a you know I mean ya know
I'm trying to stay at ten now I'm
staying at Ted that's the minimum like
if I give people you know it's gonna be
like a coupon code with a the first
month is five dollars for the people
that haven't signed up if you already
started up it's like you can't get you
know but you can get the look we can
find out how special but for the people
who haven't tried it you know it's just
for them to try it out but I okay you
like it cool stay here from 10 bucks if
you don't like it then let's say it
cancels automatically at the end of the
month yeah
yeah but yeah he that kid that's like
one of like I don't know that's like one
of the biggest missing miss informations
up here of YouTube right now I'm never
gonna say about that camera I feel bad
for like a boy on to 202 Mandela watch
this video from the beginning man watch
this video from the beginning just when
I just watch this video like oh god I
was like that's the that's the
misinformation King like like you know
when I say hey people is like they don't
even have a year as developers and they
give him opinions out and it's like man
sometimes it's like you try to try to
help people out you know I mean but the
$60,000 top I mean it's not really true
I know people who make way more than
that you know the top that I've seen
this like 80 80 90 that's a top but
that's the thing is like if you started
looking at the top number of everything
you're just you're just not gonna get a
job I'm being honest if you be like oh
man
people are getting you know top I need
to get 90 thousand dollars you know some
people like you know I'm looking at
those jobs that you know if I start
looking at like let's st. goldang right
like Golan is very very
juicy right brain and you look a
freaking gold egg this guy's making
$180,000 so now everybody gotta try to
learn gold name right but when you start
thinking like that and you'd be like man
I'm a junior developer I'm a self-taught
developer I'm over here on YouTube I'm
looking at videos on YouTube
guys the guys who know golang that are
getting hired for Golding they're not
looking for answers on YouTube that's
the truth I'm just being honest I'm the
type of person I'm very real very honest
where everybody the guys who are doing
on : they're not looking for answers and
they're not looking for help on YouTube
right they just not you know I mean so
it's like you never know what's the
audience who who comes to you to people
who aren't learning people who are
trying to get into the industry you know
what I mean so they're gonna tell them
hey man don't do WordPress don't do PHP
don't do this then people end up not
getting jobs and then somebody who has
less than a year's at developer you know
as a working in a company giving our
opinions to people just messing them up
you know what I mean like that's the
issue of the Antonine guys like well
that's that's why you got a weed out
things man like you know when I listen
to Chris Hawkes cuz he's he gives you my
real life examples and he told to you
like a real person he does the research
he looks for things you know there's
people who just be like how can that's
like you know I love I'm not gonna say I
love developers here who are who are
youtubers who have less than a year a
year and a half you know but how can I
come in and be like yo me and you are
almost on the same level how can I
listen to you you know what I mean like
if I'm a brand new developer you're
almost on the same level as somebody who
just had their first year
I'm being honest you're like this this
close you know you're here
this person's right here you like that
much closer to that person all right so
it's like we listen to a person who who
is pretty much in the same level as you
you know it's like if fun fun function
if the guy from was the name of the
coding tree another cunning from the
coding train a freaking was this other
guy named learn code Academy
if freaking you know what's this other
guy's name another youtuber who who are
people who have experience right because
just because you're here talking to a
camera you give our misinformation to
people you just dear alien people man
like people don't even have years as
developers people don't even work people
haven't even work anywhere besides the
company that they're working on the
person you just mentioned doesn't it
hasn't even worked anywhere outside of
this company you know what I mean like
that's what it's like you'd be like man
misinformation is everywhere kids you
gotta find the right people you gotta do
research you gotta go anybody like when
I'm gonna find out who is this person
I'm gonna go in and try to figure out if
their opinions are are they doing the
research do they have enough experience
themselves you know what I mean like you
know I love people man I love people I
love all youtubers here man
but yeah it's gonna stay right there
Barbara I'm not gonna delete it I love
people I love all youtubers man but it's
like you know I mean like you're in your
first year
you don't even know anything and you
have a youtube channel teaching people
and I mean like how can you I think the
best thing that I like about Christian
and that's the truth
this is what I like about Christian
channel right Christian's channel is
about him showing people his journey as
a developer right he's not really trying
to push you to follow any decisions he's
showing you his life that's it
but if somebody if Christian will be
like hey guys this is what what you guys
need to be learning right now this is
what you guys need to be doing
I would tell Christian Christian if you
don't get the hell outta here with that
like you just started you know what I
mean like you need a couple of years
under the belt to start giving people
start giving people opinions and giving
people ways to actually get in the
industry right but that's not what Chris
Shawn does Christian comes in gives you
blogs gives you good content you know
what I mean
but other people on YouTube you know and
then if I was to come on be like yo and
G check them like y'all bro you give
them freaking crazy opinions crazy
things out here then you look like a
hater you know what I mean then I would
look like a hater and it's like that's
how people will take it but other
developers who have been around for a
while they will understand it's like man
on your first year you don't even know
anything you know what I mean like how
can you be that's what people come in
you know guys freaking sending me
messaging and tell me like yo man it's
like this is not the place you know when
I started doing the crystal length
tutorials and the causes they're like
bro this is not the place for you to be
dropping videos about crystal meth
because there's a freaking a very young
audience when it comes to development
you gotta create blogs you gotta create
you know
different things on different platforms
that's gonna reach to developers who are
mid-level senior levels you know what I
mean but youtube is not the place for
Alec Ivan I haven't heard look I haven't
heard for guys who have been here for
years be like hey man I'm checking out
this youtuber or I'm checking out this
other person they not here man you know
it's like they building projects they
building cool stuff like do you want to
learn something you learn it you look at
the documentation cuz you already have
experience like what the hell are you
gonna be doing on YouTube you know I
mean so but what's such for the YouTube
for you know you to subscribers is that
you come in your YouTube subscribing
you're like man I just want to learn I'm
still learning I'm trying to get into
this thing and then you're like you
don't realize it's like a lot of these
people that are youtube they don't even
have a year on this thing like they just
started you know I mean but I'm trying
to help people out there but some
Mandela like 60,000 is not the top for
people who do WordPress at all but it
does like you know I was like helps you
out man a man so I'm outta here man it's
just like I said I'm gonna try to stay
away from the comments I'm gonna you
know it's like whatever man but this is
my first and last video where I talk
about miss information on YouTube or any
platform out there as a junior developer
be careful be careful with listening to
people online
be careful with you know just the
Internet in general like do your
research
you know if the person is just doesn't
seem like they know what the hell they
doing well like they giving you
something like some type of advice do
your research you know do your research
look it up and I say that's what I can
tell you guys man now but Philippe but
you do understand what I'm saying man
you do understand what I'm saying like
you just saw that common ways like man
it's like young things are only 60,000
so then it's like somebody who's in here
on the chat room would read that and be
like man I'm not gonna wear this because
the Molesey khmer 60,000 but what people
don't understand is like bro you can't
get a job that's a 80,000 90,000 a
hundred thousand so don't you think you
have to start somewhere
you get what I'm saying like people are
kind of retard
yo word man listen man I'm just saying
man look it up man look it up look at
the research man it exactly
I made my mazui Mizzou Z says like your
goal angers our experienced programmer
so pig : over the last year or two
exactly that's not something that you
just be like hey guys I just came out of
boot camp and I'm gonna going join you
know the golang group like it doesn't
work like that you know when people come
in tells you hey man don't do this job
you know I've never done it before but I
hear that I 60,000 that it stops and
it's like wrong wait what are you
talking about like you should mean you
know that's decimal no you should be
like you hush it throat burly you you
don't even have a year in this you know
what I mean like even even have a year
in as a in this thing as a career they
haven't worked anywhere that's like that
you can say oh this person worked at
this company and it's like come on man
think we need to start like you know
they should be like I don't know this
should be like check and balances on the
internet of like people coming out of
way with stuff man
where man I'm out of your kids you know
if you guys want to continue the
conversations go check out the discord
on the description it should be on the
description that this court channel

messed up in the internet right you know
