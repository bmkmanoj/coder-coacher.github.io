man : fees.com you boys back and out and
did it again dad you dig alright we in
here life man alright so I was watching
this right here and I read the whole
article he has a couple of things to say
how he does things right but for me I
was looking at the title which it hit a
very special place right behind my heart
like you know that little space behind
your heart
that's where hey alright um yeah so the
100% correct way to structure a react
app or why there's no such thing pretty
much every single company I've been I've
been on or I have seen work with react I
have seen work with other frameworks
right nobody does it the same way nobody
guys right so why is that basically
react is just JavaScript right this
really no such thing as a the right way
to do react people come in and tells you
and tell you stuff like Oh
best practices best practices best
practices da da da
well best practices is good for who who
created the best practices right
somebody might come in and tell you hey
best practices is to do it like this
right I was watching a tutorial from Dan
Abramov the creator of Redux right um I
was seeing him how he does things were
free act and then I go and I see stuff
that's on the react website even look
the same right so it just don't look the
same everybody does a different way if I
was to show you the way how I did or
react that in my last company so the way
I did it in another company so the way
how my friend doesn't his company to the
way another friend who works
a big huge company does it is completely
different right and I'll be honest it's
one of the problems with working with
certain tools like react or no des or
etc right there's really no standard
meaning you can come in if you know
JavaScript you can come in and build it
however the hell you were right oh and
like I say there there's a senior
developer who been there for ten years
and he that you know why I make the cost
and he does it however the hell he wants
right nobody follows a guideline nobody
follows a certain way to do things
everybody do it their own way people set
up folders differently people set up a
names of files differently that's just
how it is right it's just playing
JavaScript right there's really no but
it's not really like a framework I came
and Koryak the framework this is a thing
that I've been saying it to for a while
people keep saying react as a framework
react to me as a library and that's how
I use it you know it's just a library
for virtual Dom in and you know managing
state but not really managing state but
dealing with stay and reacting the
components that's it to me that's how I
look at it right now
I come from the background of Ruby on
Rails laravel Eva
amber so I know how certain structures
when you work in in certain frameworks
that come in until you hate this how you
supposed to do it those type of
frameworks they have a structure they
have a way to do things and everybody
else follows it so when you say hey this
is the best practices that's how
everybody does it everybody does it that
way when you go into somebody else's
projects they look exactly like yours
but things like react where it's like
more like a free floor it's more like
okay you know JavaScript cool create
your own react component that's it right
that's how things work people come in
and be like oh man
you gotta do what packet like this you
gotta do this and that like that guys
get the idea out of your head
there is no standard for libraries I can
react cuz it's a library you know what I
mean it's like you're using underscore
right or low - who the hell is gonna
come in and tell you hey this is how to
use low test this are the best practice
is this how your folders supposed to
look when you use no - or when you
create a functions that are gonna be
exported get that out of your head it
doesn't work like that the world doesn't
work like that because every single
company's gonna be totally different
what you need to know is the concepts of
react or concepts of certain libraries
whenever you use them there is no
perfect way of to structure react app
there's not because everybody doesn't
completely different every single person
that does you know looks I react they do
a completely different I was watching a
video from traversing media traversing
media does react completely different
than how I do it you know what I mean
and and that's fine it's a library it's
we know JavaScript when I look at his
coat I understand what he did and I
understand why he did it right but I do
a certain different way right there
there is no like perfect spot perfect
structure there is no perfect way to do
this it's JavaScript right this that's
it's JavaScript it's a library so get
that thing out of your head to say hey
we were doing it the best practices best
practice - whoo right you know it's like
some people come to me and they tell me
hey man we you know are everybody using
Airbnb I'm like the Airbnb LinkedIn
whatever I'm like no because I use
standard I don't use semicolons on my
JavaScript I do it different
right and this is something that that
happens all over because when you give
people options
right and you say hey this is something
that's you can come in and use this as a
tool then everybody uses it as a tool
and they use it their own way right to
build their own things there's like we
both use a react but we both could be
building completely different products
we're not building the same type of
product you know what I mean it's like
when you use something like Ruby on
Rails it tells you hey this is where the
folders are this is where the views are
this is where you're gonna put your
JavaScript this is what you put your
sass it's always gonna be there I could
give you a project for them four years
ago and it's gonna look the same way
today
on somebody else's project because they
have certain ways to do it is where's
the conventional versus configuration
like you know what I mean like once you
give people that option to say hey I
want to configure this however the hell
I want
then that's when certain things happen
where is like what is the best practices
you know what I mean what is the best
structure this guy he has his own way of
a building you know components and it's
cool you know but even at that like when
I see this when people come in and be
like hey we create a component for every
single thing on the page
I always looking at funny cuz I'm like
wait not all buttons on the scene you
know what I mean like you know like
right here an example he has app button
footer header and I'm like wait but
button is such a thing that you use so
many times it's like even you know going
back let me go back a little bit because
one of the main reasons why components
were created and why people are jumping
onto components it's so you don't have
to rewrite them or rebuild them multiple
times all you have to do is say hey
we're gonna give this props we're gonna
give this classes and pretty much say
it's like we pass down the props and we
get to reuse to
component multiple times a lot of times
people are not reusing most of the
components that they're building you
know what I really like because you
could build a component that's super
complicated and you can't reuse it again
somewhere else so you have to build
another button component you know what I
mean like and that's like one of the
reasons to where it's like man this
whole idea of keeping things best
practices I always find it to me
annoying and irritating not because I
want I don't want to follow what other
people are doing or how they do it it's
just that everybody does it differently
like it or not the only way to make
people do it the same way is when you do
something like Ruby on Rails and you say
hey this is how we do it
this how everybody in the industry does
it period if you look at I think
somewhere in the react blocks they
pretty much same I hate it's a free for
you could do whatever the hell you want
use it as a library and that's it there
is no structure there is no folder
structure this because you know what I
mean like the only people that could
come in and tell us hey this is how you
build a reactor is Facebook itself
people cannot outside a Facebook cannot
come in and say hey guys this how your
folders are supposed to be this is how
your things are supposed to be why
because you're not the creator of this
you're not the ones with the power to
say hey this goes and this doesn't go
right so you have to go into the library
itself and be like hey like let's say
example you have a component in the room
and then from there you have wonder
sense app and then another one says
containers and doing another one that
says functional or like I say dumb
components
unless Facebook puts it in the code
where people have to put it in those
folders that same structure I just said
people are not going to do it that that
way because everybody doesn't they're
only way alright you know what I'm
saying
amen I love you guys stay up guys check
out my website coding phase comm if
you're looking to learn web development
I'm here for you
basically I created this website for you
guys to just come in learn hit the
ground running you know without the
mumbo-jumbo without the big words
without somebody coming in spending 2-3
hours explaining the history or

hey because you're here for a job you're
here to get your life together you're
here to make money I'm not going to
waste your time I'm here for you guys to
learn and I'm a self-taught developer
just like you so who's gonna be able to
