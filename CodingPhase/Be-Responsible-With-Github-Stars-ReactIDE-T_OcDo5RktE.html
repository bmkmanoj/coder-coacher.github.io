guys
your boy Joe is back at it again man
coding face.com you did all right listen
man yo I just came out of work rainy day
ugly-ass day today and pretty much you
know I would say pretty much pretty much
I want to talk about being responsible
with your github stars all right gonna
be giving our stars to two projects that
just because they seem cool don't give
it a star yet give it a star
once you try and you see hey this thing
works you know we gotta keep the stars
or not you know get the starts to like
the best project or the best programming
language or whatever whatever you guys
feel that it does something good for you
don't give stars just because you you
know you landed on a project on a ghetto
project and you know oh yeah this is
cool I like it let me give it a star and
then I'll come back to it later because
now people are using stars as if they
are a way to pretty much be like a you
know a fucking bookmark and I think that
is fucking bullshit
why because basically this is new
project called react IDE right which
everybody I saw in a blog and I saw him
in like three different websites that
people are sharing and people are
talking about it and they're like oh man
react IDE this and that when you go to
the project the first thing you most
people do is like man react ideas is so
cool you know we're gonna give it a
start so everybody's giving it a start
right now it has like five hours inside
stars on fucking github and it's
trending but when you try to run the
program is a piece of shit it doesn't
work all they have is a screenshot of
what the project is supposed to look
like but it doesn't work so now people
are giving stars and they don't even
notice that hey the fucking project
don't work like that's what I'm saying
man let's try to be more responsible by
giving stars to projects that deserve it
you know if you see a really good
project that you tried it out and it
works then yeah give it a star but just
because you somebody says hey I have
this new project it doesn't work yet I'm
gonna put it on github now you're gonna
give it some stars you're gonna make it
to become a trending project and then
it's like man the fucking project don't
even work when somebody goes and
downloads it it doesn't even fucking
work man like to me is very frustrating
because I see that shit happen all the
time
you see projects that have you know
5,000 10,000 well you know 20,000 stars
and then you go in and you're like man
why are people even given the shit stars
you know cuz people will think okay if
you have stars it has to be good but
it's just not you know a lot of times
people are just giving stars on github
just because
they use it as a bookmark so and when I
say as a bookmark I mean it's like okay
they click the star give it a star and
then that okay I'll come back to it
later so then now the you know the
creators of the the project core people
start comparing this project with
another project and then be like oh man
this project has 10,000 stars on github
and this one has five thousand stars on
github so the one that has ten thousand
stars has to be the best one and it's
just like it's not man sometimes people
are just fucking giving stars out like
this shit is a fucking piece of candy
you know what I mean like not even
trying out the program not even checking
out the shit works not even knowing if
it's a real project you know what I mean
so it's just crazy so that's what I'm
here for
I want to tell you guys be more
responsible with your github stars man
don't be giving our stars to fucking
projects that don't even work test it
out see if it's good because a brand new
developer like you guys or you know
somebody else that you might know my
cedar project like oh man you know
thirty thousand people gave it stars it
must be really good and then you realize
it's a piece of shit you know I mean
anyways man let me chill a little bit
with you guys over here on a chatroom by
the way I'm life a lot of people might
not notice cuz they watch this video
later on but I'm just live right now I'm
live on my lunch break
alright was good was good was good
let me see it was good Seuss was good
long fucking John Locke on John what up
Dave
what up side what up Hector what's
stopping check what up Matt yeah man
freaky lunch break man I'm hungry as
hell so I'm just gonna chill for like
you know a little bit chill hang out
with you guys what up mark chill a
little bit what you guys see what's up
with you guys see what's up with the
squad my boy Cyrus sound what up son
how does seen you in a while man one of
my original subscribers yeah man but
tell me not that that course is not
legit man that course is like super
in-depth into JavaScript Lake there's no
way you're not gonna learn everything in
JavaScript just with that remain
whatever whatever
what up fill in man sir I'm just telling
you guys man be responsible with your
github starts man don't give starts to
every single project out there man give
a start to a project that you use a
project that is useful for you a project
that you could recommend to other
peoples because a lot of people go and
github and then you're like man I'm
gonna find out what's trending what's
really good out here and then you
realize man there's a whole bunch of
projects that are bullshit that don't
even work you know what I mean it's like
me it's like right now I could say hey
I'm gonna create I created the first car
that fucking can fly and then when
people come to my my project and then I
go man we want to see that car that
flies and then when they get there all
they see is a fucking steering wheel and
then you're gonna be like what the fuck
you know what I mean like like come on
man though don't say you got something
don't say your project is good don't say
your project is out
if if it just doesn't work just you know
keep making your project on your own
don't share it to the blogs don't share
to the youtubers if you if you know that
it doesn't work you know what I mean and
that's what happened with react IDE if
you guys want to look it up yeah I could
go and get hub dot-com search react ar e
AC T IDE if you want to check it out man
yeah man you already know shop boy joke
back at it again got crash on in here
okay let me see what's good let's go
with the squad man I'm still with my
squad okay what is get up get up is a
place where pretty much if you have a
project right and I don't know if you
know anything about gay so if you
basically commit your code and you
keeping track of your code you could
post your project your code online and
people can actually give it stars so
like let's say I could come up with with
a new plugin for jQuery for you know to
make slides right and then if people
like it they give it stars so that's
what github is and then it's cool cuz
you get to find out where the newest
projects that people are working on was
you know what's the most popular
languages was the most popular front-end
frameworks stuff like that which is it's
very helpful but then now I was like a
lot of people don't know how to use
github properly like they're using it as
if it's a fucking bookmark like know if
you wanna if you wanna watch a project
there's a thing that says watch click
watch and you can watch whatever happens
on on that project but don't give it a
star unless you know the project works
because then now the star system is
becoming shit
that's what it is that's my problem with
it you know
yeah man you should get a new camera man
and get on your camera bro and get that
you know get a nice DSLR so you could
take it to the next level man you know
even though right now I'm like shooting
straight from the phone and shit but
when I want to make my my professional
videos I use the camera sometimes when
it's just regular vlogs and regular
videos is just you know do it through
the phone what sometimes you gotta go
gotta go professional man but yeah I'm
also getting myself a little a little
MacBook Pro a brand new one I'm just
waiting on until I get this new house
that I'm about to get man when I get my
new house man I'm about to stuck me on a
lot of people out here man the money way
the blue cheese way man it's like man
I've been working hard for this man you
know I'm already about to have a kid I

boys gotta be a father I'm gonna be like

I'm like yeah man shit is gonna be cold
man right now I'm so super excited man
because it's like also too is a I've
been like you know after my sister
passed away yeah I fucking put a lot of
money into a lot of shit and spending a
lot of money and I had to buy stuff for
the you know the the podcast had to buy
shit for the camera for the the channel
I had to buy so much shit you know that
shit starts adding up you know what I
mean like I just had like there's like
the other day I was like I just had
$8,000 cash and I'm like what I money
went I just
everything you know what I mean
something like now okay it's like I got
away another month to get another $8,000
and then so I'm putting down money and
it's like okay I gotta look for the
place
I got a do a baby shower which is gonna
be like another two thousand dollars in
there and then from there from now till
maybe July all the money that I'm making
everything that I'm putting in like for

right place you know I gotta find a nice
little area that's nice and bougie you

could feel I'm the brokest person in
there you know what I mean that's how I
like to live man I like to live around
people that I've gotta inspire me to get
more money to get more become more
successful in this world I don't want to
live in an area where I'm like everybody
else I want to feel like I'm poor in
that area you know what I mean just so I
could level weapon but I okay I'm gonna
take it to the next level covering the
mic my fault
here for a downpayment your day now but
now you know all the money that you guys
donating the money that you put in
that's I already told you that's
straight for coating face I don't I
never touched that like I don't have no
need to touch that that's because like I
need to pay full of servers and that
she's gonna be fuckin crazy amount of
money I already know it cuz Heroku is
fucking expensive man like just right
now I'm paying $50 and the web sites
never fucking life yet the weapons is
not 100% live how I want it to be and as
I got I'm paying $50 from the server and
another $20 for the Postgres database so
it's like fucking it fucking adds up and
nobody is even going on it like that I'm
getting a thing it's like a good seven
hundred users that visit the website
every single day and the website
neighbouring fucking ready to register
anything that's how I know the website
is about to blow up man
once I released the the full version
with everything registration with the
channels where for fucking the videos
for tutorials all the resources man you
guys don't even know man yeah I gotta be
the first ones that are gonna be like
man like I told ya y'all gonna be like
yo I told you this kid bout to blow up
you know it's like I'm doing my thing
out here bro like I'm grinding like you
know this coding face coding faces like
my exit plan man
I've been working as a developer for
five years coding phases where I'm gonna
put all my money into coding phases
where i'm gonna promote the shit out of
it because that's where my business is
gonna go you know it's like I'm always
gonna do all these crazy videos that are
you doing YouTube but coding face.com is
gonna be something else man something
more legit more professional where
developers could go in there and get the
right resources
you know it's gonna definitely be legit
yeah I know I'm not gonna host it for
free but then if you host it for free
right then the problem is that this
downside there's like downtime that
Heroku does like it's free but there's
gotta be super slow for people that want
to load it or you know when people
search : face comm or even the podcast
the podcast is being hosted through
there so it's like I need it to be fast
you know so that's why it's I'm paying
the fifty dollar package right now for
Heroku but yeah man shit is crazy man
I'm grinding I'm out here working bro
Mahe grinding kick you dig
big coat always holding holding me down
the squad is always holding me down man
that's what's up man but yeah man you
know what's crazy man like there's a
whole bunch of freaking youtubers out
here man
watching my channels taking my whole
fucking my whole swag taking my whole
ideas man this shit is crazy
it's like for you guys start watching
and you guys that do not leave a comment
I know who you want don't fucking come
to my channel take my swag and try to
repackage it stop cloning me man this
thing's not fucking Attack of the Clones
man stop fucking cloning me if you gotta
come to my fucking channel say what up
at least man cuz I know you guys are
taking my shame you are taking my
fucking format man y'all know who you
are ya know if you have if you take a
little side for my channel you know who
you are man don't don't fucking clone
the swag man this shit comes natural
right now you're forcing it man you know
what I mean like this shit this shit
comes in natural like that people love
this shit because is your boy Joey I'm
always you know I'm always here showing
Who I am
but when you come in you fucking take my
my format or when you take my my way how
I do my videos or when I do my live
video so when you go and you fucking
just take my shit man and I'm not gonna
say your names because you fucking you
know I'm not gonna be saying your name
until you stop fucking copying my shit I
want to show love to everybody out here
but if you cloning my shit man I'm not
gonna promote you you know what I mean
like
how about exit no you can't freakin if
people want to do their own thing is
just they can't fucking come in here and
do exactly what I'm doing because then
that shit fucks me up you know what I
mean like you could create something
similar to what I'm doing but don't copy
exactly the same shit that I'm doing man
word
I'm give like a little fucking a fucking
source at the end and be like hey man
copy from this channel copy from this
channel copy from this channel thank you
guys you know what I mean like word yeah
so let's go what and what everybody else
will man let me know let's talk about
the stars react ID well react IDE is a
very good idea it's a good idea of
having an ID editor where you just code
react that would be great
now the problem is that react ID doesn't
fucking work so it's like you go through
a whole bunch of blocks and a whole
bunch of retweets on Instagram and
retweets on Twitter and I'm like okay
cool let me go check it out when I get
there and I pull the project and I'm
like wait this shit doesn't work why are
you fucking promoting something that
doesn't work you know what I mean and
I'm I could say I'm kind of guilty in
that sense cuz Cody face calm is not a
hundred percent out there and I am
promoting conference calm but the only
difference is : face.com is a domain
it's just a website it's just I'm always
gonna say Kota face.com because you know
this videos is gonna be here five ten
years from now you know what I mean so
when people come here I wanted to go to
coding face.com because by that time the
fucking West is gonna be a hundred
percent complete but when you over here
promoting a project you're like oh yeah
I created the first car that that flies
in the air and then you get there and
all you have is a fucking steering wheel
and a fuckin and a plan that's all you
have it's like why are you promoting it
if you have if it doesn't work you
haven't tried it out and then people
come in and give it stars without even
knowing what the fuck if the shit works
so now we got a trending
on gay people got a trending on github
and it's like now you're downloading you
fucking waste your time and you try to
debug it you're like oh man it doesn't
work on my computer maybe if I try on
another one
I tried it on Mac I tried it on Windows
I didn't try it on Linux but I try to
induce those two systems and did not
work and everybody if you go to the
issues under github project you see
everybody's asking the same shit like
man does this even work
yeah I'm gonna check out your your
portfolio I think I saw the email but
I'm gonna maybe make a video about it
later on tonight check it out all right
how to make Dominican cookies yo that's
my heart my arm brought me that from Dr
man those cookies are fucking the best
man like straight up what's the core
mission for coding phase the core
mission is look this the core mission
number one when you are a brand new
developer you have no idea where to
start you have no idea what videos you
should watch you have no idea what book
you should get you have no idea what
programming language you should start
with which was the best one which one is
the one that could fit for me you know
which IDE should I use should I use
should it be Adams shitty Visual Studio
code should it be whatever there's so
many fucking options and then people
don't know which one is the best for
them so that's when you know coding
phase comm comes in Kona phase calm
everybody gets to put in their input and
basically whichever whichever is the the
best one of whatever topic or whatever
framework whatever ID stays on top it's
like magic ready
makes what fucking Stack Overflow mix
with fucking YouTube makes with
cope and I Oh like that's what coding
phase is but there is a place for
brand-new developers you know and even
seasoned developers might be able to
come in and help out other people you
know what I mean something that's what
I'm doing
can I get a shout out to Queens you
already knows your boy out here I'm a
little island right now but you know I
will forever be a duel Queens man I love
Queens man I love rich wood
I love Glendale I love mass spec I love
Elmer's I love LIC man I blew a lot of
girls back scene in fucking Elmer's so
it's like I definitely love Queens man
so that's just how it is man you already
know it's your boy Joe out here one of
those Dr Spina hello cat yeah man
yeah brackets was my original IDE man
that was my original thing you know I
gotta be a savage on him like that's the
thing man like that's where I'm gonna
have this channel for cold related stuff
right but I need to also - I'm probably
gonna create another channel of just me
hanging out just talking you know
talking about topics about you know I
don't know whatever music fucking movies
whatever the fuck I want to talk about
you know what I mean cuz even on this
channel like I love coding but I feel
like I'm pigeonhole to just don't talk
about coding and all the time it's like
I can't even have fun I came in I feel
like I can't crack jokes like how I
usually crack jokes with my friends and
shit like that so I want to create a
channel that's about that it's just like
me myself that's it and that's where I'm
gonna put him the vlogs I'm gonna put in
shit with my family shit with the baby
shit with like you know shit of my
personal level like you know whenever
you guys want to see the personal side
of Joe that's what's gonna be there on
this channel I'm gonna have like you
know Co stuff cuz it's coding phase calm
you did yeah man
ya know I could definitely do some daily
vlogs it's just man if my girl was more
supportive and like wanted to be more in
the videos I would do more vlogs because
every time I pull out the camera she's
like hiding shit like that and I'm like
yeah when the baby comes out I'm putting
that baby that baby is gonna be a
YouTube star now baby was gonna be super
cute that it's never been done before
Dominican a Filipino one it's like you
know seeing this kid is like fucking
seeing a fucking liger you know what I
mean it's like this mix has not been
done this shit gotta be documented this
shit gonna be fucking shown on fucking
National Geographic like there's gonna
be a legit baby man like this baby's
like a fucking lighter you never seen
this mix it's gonna be like the nice
soft look for the peano make sure if the
crazy Dominican kid just dabbing
everywhere just dab you know what I mean
so it's gonna be fun man that's what I'm
gonna create the other channel you know
yeah man you know what I mean like we
are here man but yo I just gave you guys
me half an hour there goes my there goes
my fucking lunch break again now I can't
now I gotta eat my food Matt quick as my
lunch break is gone yeah man
let me see and you say look fuck away
fuck around and show you that soon
out here good boss how's everything we
over here live right now live or live on
the internet love on the internet man
laughs on you too you too
it's just live people on people which is
wanna see what's going on exactly
mad people on this thing what's the
reason like what could they say guys
just live just a live video for the
world this it's my boy out here and
getting that turkey sandwich we've got
thousands of people on this thing man
yeah I got I mean I go YouTube videos so
are you do YouTube yeah so it's like you
know doctor you do it work what I took
code basically I do programming and all
that stuff on my time off I basically do
YouTube videos and help people out how
to learn how to code and stuff like that
so how to code
yeah what phone call it is are to
programming so it's like creating
websites creating full application and
you do that on the YouTube yeah there
are people you're doing it for nothing
for nothing yeah Georgette's you want to
get the kids yeah exactly
plus I make a little something from the
advertising I'm gonna hit you gut I
think it's like a wonder you start
making money on YouTube after how many
hits no make money soon as everybody
anybody sees the commercials you're
gonna get have achievement if someone
sees the commercials on your YouTube
they get you get paid like
like 10 cents cents yeah and then they
have to watch the whole of the
commercial right now in total it'll be
like from 900 to 2,000 a month yeah
extra so there's just extra that's just
extra money doesn't extra money that
comes in outside from what I do
yes good people don't like a job yeah
exactly exactly the people yes right
here guys
man I'm out here man
Long Island man this whole I know
everybody's nice out that's why I love
you out here I'm from the city man if
you guys ever been to New York New York
people don't do a fuck they don't want
to talk to you that I'm gonna say hi to
you they don't want to make no
conversation but because this is Long
Island which is like the outskirts this
the suburbs of New York City
people are fucking nice people talk to
you people wanna make conversation
you know like that deli that I just came
from I'm actually building their website
because that's one of the workers that
work there but me and the owner are
super cool and I'm building their
website tool which is gonna be like
extra $1,300
which is not that bad you know for
making a website for a deli like you
know how simple that shit is that's like
$1,300 in my pocket for no no fucking
reason and like that's what I'm saying
like you guys get out of take this
coding thing serious guys man you guys
don't know how much money you can make
on this thing man like this is just the
beginning you don't have to work for
fucking Google to make good money man
like working for Google is actually a
fucking disadvantage because you're
pretty much just working on the same
fucking project all the time and and
fucking everything has to be under
control and under wraps and you know
play when you work for yourself and you
work for a smaller company where you
have more time to work on personal
projects man you good cheap good
yeah man I don't make Damas I mean from
YouTube
man youtube youtube money Google Adsense
right Google Adsense I make from YouTube
alone probably like 300 to 400 dollars
which is nothing because I don't do it
for the money on the advertising but on
my other websites the Adsense account
I'll make a lot of money that's like I'm
good like and then coding freeze calm
once I release down man
because you gotta understand the
advertising and basically in programming
IT you make so much more money than any
other you know let's say I have this
music website - right I have a music
website where for every click on the ads
I make only like 8 cents right now on
coding face.com for every click on the
world on the ads I make about like six
dollars for every click just a click so
when people go to my website and they
click on the ad because they given them
like fucking boot camps you know boot
camp commercials or fucking Google cloud
or Amazon fucking servers whatever
Heroku commercials I'm making like six
dollars per click and if you add it up
and you'd be like oh man how much is
that one once you start getting like you
know a hundred thousand subscribers a
hundred thousand you all users on it I'm
talking about big-time money man
that's why coding phase is my my exit
plan like I'm not looking to work for
nobody else no more you know so
what you think of our react native you
know that fable didn't use a man react
native isn't legit man react native is
this is hot man
yeah I work I work like a small amount
of I mean I can say a small amount of
hours any fucking hours that I work
anyways they still to me still a lot but
