you already know simple job back at it
again : face calm listen your boy is
back
you already know make sure you subscribe
make sure you like this video and make
sure you leave a comment man just leave
me one letter just so I can oh you will
see it man
leave a little J in there man you
already know all right
so the subject of this video is pretty
much programming is your golden ticket
and why do I say that because y'all
don't know if you guys remember that
movie Willy Wonka right and then the
little kid who got the little chocolate
bar remember there was like other kids
who got the chocolate bar and was like
they got there there was kids who
 already had everything they were
good you know what I mean it's the same
thing for programming and development
there's people out here which is not to
lock them off of the the scale from this
but they're really good you know there's
people who are already have careers and
they're like oh yeah I'm in marketing I
was already successful you know what I
will become a developer there's people
who pretty much they're like you know
chefs or they're working in business
they're working in this distance and
this right they're good and they
switching the careers to programming and
development right there's some of us
that pretty much come from nothing just
like you just like me and just like a
couple of other people that's out there
in the world we just pretty much come
from nothing
natan you know what I mean like once we
get that golden ticket we excited we
happy we like you know we we feel like
we don't made it and that's what I'm
saying
like you guys should take this
opportunity of learning how to program
and learning all of the stuff you know
take a seat golden ticket this the
golden ticket is gonna get you off that
$10 an hour job this
it's gonna get you off working two jobs
this the tickly that's gonna get you
driving something comfortable instead of
that car that keeps breaking down on the
highway this is a freaking city that's
gonna get you and your family to in a
better place where you could say hey I
could travel wherever the hell I want
there's people here in the United States
that have never gone out of the United
States people think that hey there's no
poor people here in the US the u.s. is
the richest country in the world but
what that means is we can afford
material things you know like this even
the poorest person can walk around with
an iPhone you know you can't say that of
people in other countries yeah you call
for the iPhone does it mean that the
quality of life is better than a lot of
other people's no you could own the
 iPhone that's what it means
you know what I mean so it's like all
you have to do is apply yourself and
basically take this time and be like hey
man Joe gave me a couple of courses that
 work for him don't sort of
courses that work for me and I'm giving
it to you guys I'm telling you hey take
those courses learning if you don't want
to take those courses fine don't learn
those courses look you're new to me for
other courses click on the link below go
you to mean search for other courses
that you might like okay you don't like
you to me
fine go to teen treehouse plural site go
to whatever the you wanna go to but
take this opportunity and basically
learn how to program this is the future
you have to understand this is the time
to do it now there's people that were
you know in the early 90s who were doing
this thing and there was no money back
then on this thing and
and the dot-com bubble blew this up
and everybody wanted to learn well you
know programming and building their own
Amazon but that fell apart 2008
came from the part but now is
booming so you have to get in now
because once this drops it's too
late you know that's not gotta be a lot
of people who's gonna come into this
industry make their money make what they
needed to do and move on to other things
- at the same time programming is
something that you always got to be
passionate is it something that you're
gonna die with meaning are you gonna
 die in front of a computer no
that's your choice you know what I mean
like for me I love programming but do I
want to sit in front of a computer 24/7
no that's not what I want to do what I
want to do is be teaching that's what I
really want to do and I'm getting there
you know what I mean for you guys you
guys might have other passions too some
people like to be musicians you know you
might not have the opportunity you know
to actually promote your music hey if
you're gonna work on something work on
something that is gonna pay you you know
become a developer do you think have
your plan B of your music go ahead
promote it with the money that you're
making from development and that's it if
you blow up cool paint some other people
they want to buy real estate some people
they want to say hey man I just want to
own houses and rent apartments and
whatever yeah man
sacrifice yourself two to three years
for five years ended in this industry
from there you have enough money build
your credit bill yeah you know your
finances up go ahead and start buying
your house and start buying your
from there that's it keep the only thing
you've always got to be passionate about
program but it doesn't mean that you're
gonna have to die program you know what
I mean like all of this other you know
Bill Gates freaking Elon Musk Mark
Zuckerberg like all of this guys man
they love programming what do they do
programming every single day probably
not
they got so many other passions and
other things that they could do because
of this that now they don't have to
program every single you know for eight
ten twelve hours a day you know what I
mean seriously this is your golden
ticket
don't let this pass man don't let
people tell you hey man I see people who
leave dumb comments here like man we
want people in the industry that you
don't they they here for the
money man
nobody I see it just for money they here
for a better life who the hell wants to
be working at McDonald's nobody you know
what I mean they there because they have
to get something better for themselves
just to eat but doesn't mean they want
to stay there you know what I mean
there's people out here who come here
and leave comments tired and just
completely dumb denied it's guys
all two always talking about money and
always talking about this dissing debt
man this is just like the carrot
the front of the you know the
little rabbit just to get the rabbit
moving and then at the end what do you
do you give to carrots or the
rabbit that's what I'm doing to
everybody here I'm putting the money
back in front of you and telling you man
come to get this money back so until you
you know once you get to learn all the
stuff the money bags gonna be there
waiting for you
so you could do everything else that you
want to do in your life now it's all up
to you are you gonna let yourself become
one of those people that pretty much
they saw you know the golden era
you know technology and let this
pass and you're gonna be in your house
like man I'm still here Walmart
man I should have just went up and
started learning programming back then
that's on you hook man you want to say
that one more that's on you you want to
stay at your job that's on you
and but also in this for everybody who's
out here and always saying man this
guy's one of my money dissing that it's
not about that man is that if you come
from nothing you're appreciating more
there's people you guys know who you are
who pretty much they're coming from
other careers they're like oh you have a
marketing guy I'm already making money
on this I'm a business guy
I'm already making money in this sin hey
I'm a I know somebody who who
was a super successful business person
learn programming whatsoever
bootcamp got the little step' or his
thing and became the head of universal
was the guy a great developer know he
just came in so who was there was the
neat
what was the the market and said you
know what I'm gonna learn this thing
actually make this thing even way better
than what it is because I have to the
knowledge of it so it's like a lot of
people who are already successful and
other things get coming into this
industry and looking down are the people
that don't have nothing and st. the
you doing here you don't got you
want to get in here just for the money
don't get anything just for the money
what they're telling you is just pretty
much is some because they
already have this they already have
to together they already have good
laughs they already have mommy and daddy
trust fund money and that's the reality
thing this is something that nobody
likes to talk about here in the United
States people don't like to talk about
the money
they hate that and but you know who
is it that the ones that hate talking
about money the ones that got it you
know nobody's gonna come here and tell
you hey
