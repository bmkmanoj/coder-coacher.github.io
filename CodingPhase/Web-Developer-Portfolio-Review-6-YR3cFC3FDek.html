out it again man coating face.com
your boys backing out and did it again
yeah guys today's topic is another web
developer portfolio you guys this video
is brought to you by viewers like you
and people that support our website
coding phase comm go check it out over
20 courses in there that's gonna guide
you to become a developer from the
beginning to becoming a pro alright guys
so let's get to it so today we have
felicia campbell calm and felicia you
are very very lucky you actually have
your own calm like you don't know how
lucky you are that nobody has snatched
that up yet you know cuz people is out
here that i oh shoot
john smith calm snatch you know what I
mean you kid is like I saw this the
other day I was like on thinking about
getting a domain and literally the
moment that I thought about it saying
I'm about to put it in I'm going through
the whole Namecheap process to basically
get the dot-com somebody came in and
said sorry is not available number yeah
luckily I have my own tool so which is
Joe Santos Garcia calm which that
website should be up pretty soon I
should be bringing it up so you know I
mean so yeah but anyways let's get back
to this so today we got a portfolio
let's refresh this let's get the full
the full experience okay so as you come
in
Felicia Campbell web developer Apple
Computer def right there that's all I
needed to see you're good that's it we
don't need to see no more joking um yeah
so if we scroll down a little bit okay
things go a little bit choppy a little
bit slow it's not really her website
it's more my computer I'm rendering I'm
recording I'm doing
all of this stuff all at once so this is
her section she got email CSS JavaScript
jQuery let's see lay this works okay
click on hold on I'm clicking nothing is
happening what's going on all right
Felicia when you see this here if you
put something here you need to make sure
it's clickable to the project or you
know show us what you got okay this
right here I'm not even gonna go in it
because it's like it's like what is this
is like a RGV it's like a little color
picker it's fine great I couldn't
definitely see that you're starting I
mean this is cool it seems cool it's
like a little color game I guess okay
refresh let's see okay what's going on I
don't know I don't know how to scam
simple soup to work but yeah so let's
keep scrolling wait wait wait wait wait
a minute
there's a scroll bar here and there's
another scroll bar here why would you do
this
no only time that I will recommend this
is if it was in a situation where the
page is 100 view height and then you say
okay whatever the elements inside that
could be scrollable but this you could
have just you could have kept it
scrolling like it didn't need to be
scrollable inside of the section it's
like I guess you put in what like a
fixed height
yes there's a fixed height on it if you
remove that and remove this move this
you could have been good so yeah all
right now a lot of you guys are gonna be
like oh man this portfolio doesn't look
as good as the last one but that's not
really what's important here you know
what because it was important is
Felicia's trying she's trying to get
into the business and this is such an
early stage you know I always tell
people like when they send me on their
portfolios and a really really early
stage of their career and like esday
learning like they very brave because if
you look at my first portfolio it was
like really really bad you know like
really bad I didn't even know how to do
many ins like I don't know I was doing
HTML tables like it was bad so Felicia
are you actually doing better than me
okay but at the same time now we have to
critique it as a professional would okay
personally almost all of the time the
hamburgers always on the right side I
mean it's not a set rule but it's like
almost that's where the user is so used
to seeing it so I was like when you come
here this thing you always looking for
the menu on the side okay
please it can be there but the button
itself needs to be here all right and
that's not like set in stone you could
put it wherever the hell you want but
most users are used to seeing it here
all right now as far as this is good
that's fine no animations here is cool I
like that you share a little bit about
yourself a humble friendly team oriented
professional is currently serving my
country in the US Navy saying about they
web developer by night listen you can't
go wrong with that
that's that swag that's that a we out
here you know US Navy SEALs we in the
squat you know what I mean I don't know
why I've always feels like I'm playing
SOCOM or something like that
whenever I think about the Navy but I do
love the Navy yeah so going back to the
portfolio man I think there's a lot of
potential here I mean you're learning
you're still getting your feet wet you
know I could tell that you know how to
interact with the page you know jQuery
you know your basics of JavaScript now
it's all about presenting yourself as a
professional owner right this is like
the first portfolio trust me this is not
gonna be the first one for you and the
last one there's gonna be at least
another ten portfolios that you're gonna
create and then the last one you're
gonna be like oh now I'm happy with it
and then by the time you say now I'm hot
right there you already thinking about
the next portfolio that's just how it is
that's how we are as Peron you know
developers so what I would say to you is
pretty much go check out dribble comm I
always tell this to everybody check out
dribble comm try to get inspirations
from people when I say inspirations
doesn't mean cop
be somebody you could come here and look
at something like magazines the same
magazines right back in the days I
forgot what was the name of it it's like
a lookbook people you should take
magazine images and cut it out right and
that's why I created this project called
the design storm on PHP which basically
mimics that it takes images and says hey
I like this I like that I like that and
then basically what it does is it just
keeps saying an area and you say okay
this is my inspiration for this design
this is my inspiration for this website
so let's say an example you was looking
for a magazine style you wanted
something nice and clean or let's say
you wanted something like portfolio you
can look at somebody's work and be like
okay cool I like this person's work and
get ideas from what they have and then
you put in your perspective your
creativity and then like right now I
like a lot of things from here reni I
like the layout okay but there's no
colors so it seems pretty dead to me
okay so what would you do you could come
here and look at let's say you like that
let's say you like that portfolio right
that style you can come there and but
okay I like that but then now I wanna
look at something like this I like the
colors inside of this website okay so
now you will take the style of that on
the website the colors from this website
the button from this website and create
your own right create your own style now
a lot of people might think is this
copying is this taking ideas from other
people guys doesn't matter who is the
designer they all take ideas from each
other and that's the truth right
basically when you are a designer you're
constantly looking at magazines you
constantly looking at nature you're
constantly looking at you know images
that you might have seen when you was a
kid you might find other artists
everybody gets inspiration from each
other so what people do is constantly
they in their head they either take a
picture mental note
sorry a picture take a mental note and
then what they do is they say okay I
like this I like the colors of the
sunset at 6:55 in the morning I like the
layout of the subway letters and you
know it's like you take all those things
and then you create your own design your
own website right now this isn't a
design course this isn't a colour theory
course this isn't nothing this is just
me reviewing a portfolio but I'm showing
you guys how I create my own designs how
I get inspired by others how I get to
learn by others okay
so yeah you see this like this is nice
like this blue is beautiful you can used
as your hover State for your website you
could use this as your gradient for a
section like you know for your contact
section whatever you want right so
you're taking like a bunch of different
designs and creating your own portfolio
your own design your own website okay so
that's my advice to you Felicia
that's my homework for you so take a
little time go through dribble comm is
the RI BBB le yes three B's I don't know
why they probably couldn't get the
domain okay so make sure you go check
that out and yeah we hear any new
portfolios you guys want to send me I
actually have a long list this was not
the typical way how I choose portfolios
but I'll show you guys just right now
for everybody that sends me portfolios I
have a whole bunch of portfolios to
still review okay
and that's not even counting whatever
was there from last year so I have a lot
of portfolios you know come in and
review for you guys and I'm gonna
continue doing this videos hopefully you
guys really enjoy hopefully the people
that sent me their portfolio understand
where I'm trying to help them out with
and yeah let me make sure yeah so
there's all the portfolio's right here
okay so that's like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
11 12 13 14 15 16 and so yeah so I
pretty much skipped everybody you know
sorry guys I just had to do it for
Felicia but yeah so the next person is
probably gonna be Harrison if poke
keeping me I don't know how to say it
but yeah so as you guys can see is your
