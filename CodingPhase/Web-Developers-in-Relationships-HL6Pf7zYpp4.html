back at it again coding face.com man
we're gonna do a little conversation
really quick you know about
relationships and you know trying to
learn how to become a web developer or a
software engineer or anything that
you're doing life right how important is
it to actually have somebody who is
supportive like you know I've been with
my girlfriend for five years we're now
engaged so to be married and um it's
been pretty you know you know a lot of
ups and downs but the same time there's
a lot of positive things that have
happened in our relationship and the
main reason is because you know she's
been so supportive like when I first met
her I was doing IT work and she seen my
whole transition from you know from
leaving my old job to becoming a web
developer and you know spending all
those nights of you know like me her we
usually talk from I don't know like 9
o'clock to 11 o'clock right but
throughout the day like I wouldn't keep
in contact that much and at first it was
like you know a little problem here and
there because you know how girlfriends
are they want you to be in contact all
day like hate when i text you text me
back and this and that and sometimes you
know you're busy you know
so at one point she understood that what
I was trying to do was something that
was gonna better our lives you know I
was gonna be good for her I was gonna be
good for me um and she actually gave me
that space which is something why I'm
still with her like you know I'm still
gonna be with her forever
you know as long as well I'm alive I'm
gonna stay with her because you know she
earned it everything that that comes
from you know although the good things
that have come from what development you
know from YouTube from my job everything
that I've been doing for the past few
years she's earned every week reward
that I get is
like anything that I get is you know I
give it to her you know as much as I
can't no yeah and like she was just
there you know what I mean like I don't
have my mother Holle have my sister and
I have nobody that was like supportive
like oh yeah I keep doing your thing she
was the only one that was dan you know
in the sense of like you know showing me
love and you know and be like
understanding that I needed to learn how
to you know do what development the
right way and I needed my space like I
couldn't be on the phone all the time we
couldn't hang out all the time as much
as we wanted to but you know she knew
that I was doing something positive you
know and something that I loved for you
guys I would say hey you gotta find that
person because you cannot be able to
learn when you're dealing with like a
lot of you know drama from your
girlfriend and and you know jealousy and
you know insecurities and somebody who
doesn't have nothing to do like that's
one of the biggest problems like if
you're over here trying to better
yourself and get put on the person
you're with is pretty much a bump like
all she does is just oh yeah talk about
clothes or she wants to go out and this
and that or whatever and you're here
trying to actually do something positive
she's gonna bring you down
so you gotta find somebody who's
actually has a hobby who actually has
something to do with herself and also to
is like trying to better herself and you
know it has a plan like a five-year plan
because there's no way that you're gonna
be able to you know be able to learn how
to code and learn how to do this web
development if you're constantly
fighting with somebody or somebody's
constantly like Oh every night when you
come home instead of you spending time
with me you're on your computer like if
you can't understand what I'm doing then
I don't need to be with you you know
what I mean like that's how you guys
gotta be and I know sometimes it's hard
you're gonna be like oh I love this girl
I love everything about her but she's
not supportive
listen guys you gotta you know you gotta
do your own thing you gotta move on
because this isn't she's not gonna
change this is not new you know what I
mean women like that were you know
probably cheat on you because you're
actually not giving her enough time you
know in her eyes and a lot of times is
because if a woman doesn't have nothing
else to do and they want to be all
cuddled up with you and you know having
sex and doing all this stuff which is
always good
what at the same time it's like ma I
need my space let me work let me let me
do what I gotta do so we could be good
and we could say hey next year let's
take a vacation or let's say hey let's
buy a house hey let's go somewhere else
that we've never been hey here's a gift
to you now I could for tea you know what
I mean like that's how it should be you
know it should be a team work and you
know you see images out there like oh
you know relationship goals and and you
know the type of girlfriend that
somebody should should have like you
know you see all this stuff but you know
sometimes yeah you think like oh this
girl is not the right one also too
sometimes you just gotta talk to them
and be like hey listen um I just need to
do this I need this time from me you
know for the next six months all right
where you say here I need the six months
of me preparing myself to take my career
to the next level if she understands
that and she's a you know a woman that
loves you she's going to understand that
and say hey you know what okay baby
take your time I'll support you I know
in the end you know it's something good
for both of us if she's that type of
woman that she's a keeper
if she's giving you drama and all this
stuff and you have to be worrying about
like oh my god I'm not spending enough
time with her she's probably cheating
when she's doing something she's not the
right woman for you you know what I mean
like me and my girlfriend is not perfect
no fiance she's you know we're not
perfect but somehow we made it work and
you know
everything's been good like now she
knows the reason why I was busting my
ass or you know the past four or five
years you know when we was together in
the beginning it was the first year you
know I think it was like the second year
so matter one year and then the second
year that's when I was like okay the
beginning of the second year I was like
okay I'm gonna take this web development
seriously so she kind of saw a big
difference from you know we should talk
from like 9:00 o'clock like 11 12
o'clock and then it became hey I'm
talking to her for like 20 minutes 30
minutes you know late nights you know 11
o'clock
so you know we we lost like two hours of
you know the time that we used to hang
out but she understood why you know and
like now we're gonna get married we're
gonna see each other everyday like you
know like it pays off at the end of the
day you know what I mean so anyways guys
I just wanted to let you know a little
bit about relationships and and how to
deal with it then you know the type of
person that you need to be with to be
able to you know make a move like this
and you know make sure you subscribe and
make sure you like this video man make
sure you share this and you know it's
just me giving advice and giving you you
know something to to think about
especially of our relationships because
