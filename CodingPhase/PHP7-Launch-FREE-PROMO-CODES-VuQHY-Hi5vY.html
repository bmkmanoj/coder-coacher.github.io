basically of get all-access pass you're
already have it it's all my website but
there's a lot of people who who can't
sign up to the website or choose not to
so at least we gotta give them course
completely free you know it's just to
celebrate that we we got this out and
what I'm gonna do is give them a free
code for you to me and then they could
use on you to me and hopefully they
leave our honest review and they take it
you know what I mean we can only wish
for the best for everybody yeah man
yes sir
yes Blanca we in here yes yes yes yes
what you're gonna get in this course
that's a good question let's go into it
let's go to the course content
you gotta get the introduction why you
should learn PHP and how to install it
you're gonna go over the PHP syntax
which is about I will say like maybe
like four hours of PHP of learning
everything about the syntax and you know
me I break it down easy for anybody to
be able to understand and be able to hit
the ground running right that's the
whole idea of this I'm creating courses
that's gonna take you months to do and
and it's gonna be like oh man I gotta
come back like you know somebody will
still tell me they're still working on
the web developer boot camp I'm like
like you bought that like three months
ago you know what I mean like I try to
keep people engaged you know that course
is great but at the same time I feel
like a lot of people like they lose
focus sometimes so in my course is what
I do is I keep you entertained keep you
building stuff that really matter and
break complicated topics like
object-oriented PHP and make it easy for
you to understand it then from there arm
currently we got the simple site doing
this one I'm uploading it right now as
we speak the credit with PDO and my
sequel so pretty much this is how to
save
basically create read update delete data
to my Seco of PHP and then at the same
time we're going to definitely jump into
the laravel project which is next and
this laravel project should be done by
the end of the this weekend by the end
of this weekend I have everything done I
had they order HTML CSS all the project
stuff is done or API stuff is done it's
pretty legit man
pretty easy this was this project the
crowd is done is basically it's
uploading right now if you're already a
member to my website you already have
this course you could definitely go to
coding phase calm and you will see you
there but you know I'm giving it out on
udemy because a lot of people they enjoy
you to me you know they're like having
all the courses they're like they
already bought a whole bunch of courses
there and yeah see learn PHP seven
that's another thing to all the people
that buy any courses on my website send
me an email I also give you the the free
code so you to me like people like to
buy the courses on on my site and then
you know sometimes they're better oh man
you know can we get this on you to me
yeah you could if you already bought it
you you know that's that's yours you
know you could take that same coding and
use it in in freaking how you call us
over there by Netflix Netflix I'm sorry
I'm like half sleepy half half awake but
yeah you could use it on udemy but like
I said sorry I'm like half sleepy I need
some PHP in my life
dean says we got Kelvin Davis man we in
here
let me see who else is saying here who
wasn't seen here leave a comment guys
leave a message I'm going to be choosing
a couple of people that I'm going to
give our free code to the latest udemy
course that I just released which is
learn PHP
several Arabic master course over seven
hours we're talking about a total about
twenty hours of content pretty much a
lot of work but you definitely gonna
learn PHP you know and we go a little
bit into my sequel I'm gonna create on
my sequel course separately because it
would have been like you know if we
create a 20-minute PHP course and that's
when I'm in a 20 hour PHP course plus
another 20 hour my sequel course a lot
of people's not gonna finish that a lot
of people would give up halfway through
like you need to give on incentives to
continue so when you put everything in
one courses like people don't even
finish it you know so the best way to do
it is to have any multiple courses and
and give it to them by creating projects
so that's what we're doing man and like
I said if you're part of my website code
offense com you get all these courses
automatically anyway so you know what I
mean I think that's the best deal you
get over twenty courses for literally
like 10 bucks 20 bucks a month that's it
you know and more courses coming through
like pretty much you're gonna learn a
lot like let's say somebody signs up for
a yearly the yearly account like you
good for the whole year I would I don't
even think that you you're gonna need
any more courses out there like I'm
being honest cuz it's just there's so
much content already there alright so
let me see what's my chat room was my
chat room man we got 39 people okay we
in here what up
okay good luck Geo first round door you
got it man you're gonna get that job
yeah man sometimes other people get
boring you know what I mean
give me that PHP cause I'm gonna be
milling rockin ah Oh God
let me see without without without
without without without without what up
you know leave a comment listen there's
40 people I want to see everybody leave
a comment so you I could then choose out
of everybody who I'm gonna give the the
code to we're giving it to a couple of
people man I'm Emma Susie why you always
says Dominica even in Dominic King the
mini king the main Inca what the hell is
that Dominican let me see let me see
LeBlanc and says man I'm still working
on that social media cause I can say I'm
learning more from your courses then I
am in a boot camp I'm using your courses
to help complete my assignments from
there shaking my head yo whatever you

here to help you out you know um nah but
sometimes it's cool you know you go to
the boot camp you get to meet with cool
people you know you carry great you
can't have no regrets in this world Hey
Joe what do you feel about the Zen PHP

sure you leave a comment there's 40
people in here leave a comment so you

freeze never it's never bad you know
what I mean
and for other other people that you know

guy's my website is there and trust me
is worth it like I've never came here to
waste your time you know I don't do that
I don't come in and try to give you BS I
give you stuff that is gonna be really
useful and like real life experience you
know what I mean James Bond says the
courses are way better than Linda's
robot instructors yes trust me Linda was
one of the original websites that I used
to go to it's like
let me see let me see let me see who's
in here man make sure you leave a
comment make sure you leave a comment on
the live chat we here live kids man we
hear chilling you know yeah I think I
think Lincoln bought Linda and it's
being pretty ish for the past God knows
when Joan's doing all of this and Kazi
talking about you should be helping the
people around you Kazi look listen god
bless that kid man you know we have
nothing against them his video what he
said was something like hater says I'm a
scam I've that I remember I gotta watch
my video over again
I don't remember me calling him a scam
or saying anything like that what I was
saying is like hey at that price it's
kind of ridiculous you know and then he
says something on his video where it was
like more like hey if you know you're
charging this little amount then what
type of quality of content you have I'm
like my constants pretty good it's like
he's like oh what type of clients that
he get I'm like I don't even get clients
like my clients is its from the spots
man I just finished doing a stripper's
like literally my boy opened up a strip
club
I finished his website I got paid like
$6,000 for it cash you know money right
that's the clients that I get you know
just cash money you know I mean like
money cash cash money that's what we do
you know what I mean now as far as jobs
and companies I just went to an
interview just the other day and you
guys saw me do a video where I just say
I'm not taking it they were trying to
give me like almost $100,000 and I'm
like I'm not taking it if I was
hurting or I wasn't doing good or I
wasn't like doing my thing out here then
people would now be trying to you know
throw me all these jobs and all these
opportunities I just don't want it you
know what I mean we in here man yeah
like it's crazy like I did do which is
funny it's one of those situations like
I've never data a website for a strip
club but it's hilarious because hey it's
free money six thousand dollars for a
freaking a landing page a landing page
and a user authentication to be able to
email or his email list six thousand
dollars I think I'm doing pretty good
you know what I mean like that's I don't
know it took me literally almost a week
and I have to do everything and six
thousand dollars guys you know what I
mean like it doesn't matter what web
site is like we good you know what I
mean I'm a business man out here man
when it comes to money that's what I
care about you know what I mean plus is
like us so much BS know his video that I
was like man bro I just wish that he
will understand was that the thing this
is the same thing with Eli the computer
guy and before I even go into a rant
about these people
people just don't these people just
don't look at the comments you know what
I mean like you have a hundred thousand
subscribers that you pay for so
basically you bought them right so if a
hundred thousand people that you have
there and you're only getting one
percent of those people because you want
to sell that 500 what's the point of
that right what is the point of that
when you could literally create more
content for everybody and say hey I'm a
guy I'm gonna give it to you guys a
hundred dollars
even a hundred dollars is fine like why
five hundred dollars that's ridiculous
that's like a price that you look crazy
you know what I mean I got show people
you know this guy this guy at Todd model
like this guys are freaking they hire
him from like Google they hire from
Facebook when
training all right they hired that guy
and that guy is charging like $230 with
a 50% off which is what 100 in in $15 he
charges and that's like a professional
like professional professional like no
joke
crazy animations crazy editing on their
videos like $130 you know what I mean
like does just come on I'm about the
people I'm not here for the youtubers
I'm not here for the programmers I'm
here for the people I'm here for you
guys that you know when I find something
great like today Stephen Grider's came
out way what of course luckily I had
like a good week to be able to go
through it you know every view it I just
don't review things to review him but I
hey guys Johnny small created a course
go check out his course to get a
freaking how you call this our referral
or money I don't care about that what I
care is about that when you guys come in
and take that course and you know Joe
was right this was a legit it was worth
it so now my name has credibility
because all I give you is good content
and what I give you is something that
you could have affordable my name holds
weight you know what I mean
that's why I tell you about certain
things you know what I mean it's not
like I'm over here like oh let's try to
make money is like bro I could do that
if I wanted to but that's not my goal my
goal is to pretty much give content give
good quality content to the people
yeah man let me see my boy see
cityscapes see I could show you the spot
it's a pretty legit spot man my boy
kicking it man that's what I need to do
man my boy kicking it right now my boy
killing listen you gotta get money out
here man I always tell people you got to
open up your businesses it doesn't
matter what type of business it is man
if you make your money out here you're
making money out here man I'm trying to
find a spot yeah man but yes sir and so
we are here just you know we killing the
game right now long this launching a lot
of things for this year that we working
on I'm working hard kids know we
grinding right now okay let me see let
me see what I what I what up who's in
here
my money ain't even side money no more
word listen that's how you do it man
sometimes you gotta you gotta do what
you gotta do man
how
been coding how long have I been coding
kids
I've been coding since the age of 14 I
started building like little websites
like HTML that's all I know right
I learned CSS in 2012 and then from
there the whole year all I was doing
just landing pages and you know a little
bit of jQuery 2013 I stepped it up
started learning a lot of JavaScript and
then I was doing just JavaScript for a
long time till 24 no till 2015 for like
almost for like three years I was only
doing for a network cuz I was scared to
do the backend right I thought it was
gonna be like super difficult to do this
and that and I was like this is dumb and
then from there once I learnt it it was
like oh my god I could have been making
so much money even from the beginning
because I had a lot of opportunities to
become like a back-end developer and I
always would be like nah I don't know
how to do the backing I don't know
databases I don't understand it I'm good
in the front end cuz you could fall into
those traps of being comfortable just
doing one thing so yeah till now so now
I've been doing this for a long time
worked in multiple projects multiple
companies did a lot of freelancer there
a lot of contract work for major
companies like one thing that you know
somebody asked me to like this there's
the last interview that I want to write
just to show up I'll go to the guy and
he's like I see on your resume you know
if you've lasted almost like you know
this place is that you only lasted a
like three months six months a year and
I'm like yeah I'm like I told a guy I'm
like listen I'm a millennial I believe
in and pretty much as I hate I believe
in working on projects I don't believe
in companies you know and then the guy
was just laughing
I don't because I just don't believe in
it I don't believe in in in like
companies at all I believe in projects
you know what I mean like I could come
in and work for your company to do a
project but you can't think that I'm
gonna stay there forever I just is
that's not me you know what I mean
what's the average time you spend on a
company Joe before moving on um nine
months to a year
that's how I like it that's the sweet
spot for me I can't stay in a company
for more than that it's just it's boring
to me you know what I mean cuz then like
let's say I come in I do my job I finish
the project oh I haven't even talked
about this
did I tell you guys that um now you guys
can see the website that I was working
on for like the past year and some
change in the last company I was working
on so I'm gonna show you right now oh
let me see how can I share the screen
with you guys alright so let's see
wayback machine I want to show you you
guys
I got when I got there this thing was a
mess all right so I'm not called your
face what is a on 39 dollar glasses icon
okay let's see February all right so you
guys can see how this website looked let
me see if we could get
oh man okay I don't know if if it's
showing up see maybe this one was show
it because I want to show you guys the
BB four and after doesn't show it cuz
let me see I don't know if you guys got
to see it okay okay here it is okay so
this this is how the website look guys
there's our website looked it looked
pretty bad
like it's like looking at a time machine
right now mind you looking at it now and
seeing what how it was man like it was
bad kids like literally it was bad so
alright now let's go to the latest
website that I was working on for the
past year and a half okay is a new
design new design basically all of the
stuff done by your boy everything that
you see this certain things that are
still messed up I mean they lost it like
that but that because they needed to
launch it the website looks so much
better more cleaner you know I built
this whole Tryon system which is
hilarious like you know they got other
developers there but they look then even
fix this look this is what I'm saying
those are things that need to get fixed
and then even fix it like like come on
guys
like that's why sometimes I'll be like
man I'm just glad I was out of there man
you know but the website does look so
much better
you know I built this whole system here
pretty much you come here let's say
let's say a picture face you can go
picture of somebody's face okay let's
see let's see this guy save image put it
into the the website come here click
there all of this stuff is done by react
okay you put in your PD you know like
this is what I'm proud of the website
for like besides this like in the fact
that I I and my other friend we did
about 80% of all the backend here like
the database structures was set up by me
everything is set up by me as you can
see
keeps your your glasses there you could
change the tents this and that you can
come here change the rotation you know
put it however you want it then you
click done it does a it takes the
coordinates that you have it sent it to
set it back in and keeps it in the back
end and then now you have your image
here you can also technically which is
somehow I finish all of this of it
somehow they they effed it up so because
they don't know how to really do react
like that but um yeah so so I mean the
website is done it looks a million times
better than how it was before
this right here to is supposed to be
react you know I miss EF davidic yeah I
think at least they kept that yeah so
it's like a whole bunch of stuff that I
did on this website like most of the
website I did like you know pretty much
oh yeah all right now let's go back to
here so there's the stuff that you know
I'm looking at the website if you guys
was to look at the older website like it
was just bad it was just like really
really bad and the back end was horrible
it was done in in Perl which is super
old super outdated horrible horrible
system but somehow we made it work and
we had to switch up from Perl to laravel
within like a month
cuz there's some some crazy stuff people
were doing over there oh man
I'm so glad I'm out of that company but
yeah now of course you know yeah it's a
lot of stuff there man like there's a
lot of stuff that you know I wish sorry
I was like you know things would have
been even better if we had like the
right team all right if we had the right
team and there cuz guys trust me that's
why I was like so stressed out on that
place cuz literally we have so many
issues there and people wanted us to
finish this website like the website has
a lot of logic this is not like a
regular website dealing with glasses
it's a lot of details to it it's not
like you you have sneaker it's like okay
sneakers you know what sizes are there
and what colors are there that's saying
what what brand they are that's all you
have to worry about with glasses you
have to worry about the sizes the shapes
are freaking what type of lenses is a
lens's of focal lenses bifocal
progressives there's a million different
options so we had to build all of that
stuff in less than you know like a month
and a half and make it live right and
then when we launched the website we
launched it with the look of the older
version so people don't get confused and
be like oh there's a brand new website
it looks totally different so we had to
keep the older version the way how it
looked but the whole back end was made
with PHP Lera
so it was like extremely freaking
stressed stressful because people didn't
even know you know like the people in
the company made us transfer this
site in like a month and a half and then
pretty much like there was like a
million bugs because it was only two
developers working on it there was one
guy that was remote and every time that
he worked on it he broke something we
had some other lady that every time that
she worked on something she wanted to do
it like um Michael is like playing PHP
and now used the framework laravel so
she wanted to hard-code stuff and she
was like coding horrible like her code
was like the worst if I was to show you
guys like some of her code it was like
extremely bad and I was like man you
know luckily we cleaned it up we
finished everything you know so it's
like when I left our company and the new
kid Joe who was a a junior developer
like just straight out of college like
no history with back end no history of
front-end like I show him all the things
I gave him access to my web site
he learned to react in like a week he he
got hit you know up to not to part with
everything that he needed to do but when
I left there the web site was already
about 85% done already everything was
already done there was really nothing
else that they needed to do except just
clean up a couple of things you know
what I mean but yes so it was pretty
crazy like one thing that I will tell
you guys I mean when you were a journey
the developer when you're a junior
developer like you don't have an option
to be like choosing what company you
really want to go to you don't don't
have that option but as you get more
experience you get better you gotta have
the option to choose where to go to
don't go to any company that has a
smaller eye team than eight people if
they have less than eight people working
as developers that's a company that you
don't want to be in
especially once you are already
accomplished and you know your stuff
because it's like you have certain
standards of how things supposed to be
and you know business owners they don't
understand the technology behind their
websites you know everybody thinks like
hey we have ID and it's like bro it's
like you know people even that whole try
on tool that I created like people were
like complaining about it and this and
this and then like they comparing it to
like snapchat they're like how come
snapchat could do this and and we can't
do this on the web and it's like do you
understand the difference between webs
and software like there's a huge
difference right and then like there are
so many things I'm like yo man I can't
work with people like that like you know
I got this an opportunity next week I'm
supposed to go to Priceline in
Connecticut they want me to go in for
interview just for the hell of it I'm
gonna go I'm I'm not sure if I want to
take it because I might be moving back
to Queens but I'll keep you guys up to
date you know I'll keep you guys up to
date or you could just look at my
LinkedIn if I get hired by them and they
want me in I might take it I don't know
yet I'm 5050 right now to be honest with
you guys I don't know I'm gonna go to
the interview and see what they offer in
and see how how the team is see how the
offices are if it's something
comfortable that I want to do you know
because in reality I want to work
another year before I say hey I'm not
working no more because I want to stack
up like right now I'm making enough
money to be good right but like let's
say if I go and I work for another
company for let's say a hundred thousand
a hundred ten thousand right if I work
for that company all that money that I'm
gonna make there is gonna be for savings
I'm putting that straight to the savings
I'm not wasting any money so my goal is
to get together at least $250,000 cash
by the end of next year
you know I'm about probably like 40% in
to that goal that I want to get to so my
goal is to have that amount of capital
on hand so then from there I can go in
either axe for long for like another
$250,000
which will make me half a million
dollars in and then I can open up a
really nice business something that I'm
really gonna fall you know really work
on or if not I'm just gonna keep it on
savings and just like put like half of
it on Bitcoin or something you know just
to stack it up stack the money up until
I get to that you know half a million
dollar mark that I want I want to have
that's that's my goal half a million
dollars before 35 I'm 29 and my goal is
to have half a million dollars cash I'm
not talking about you know how some
people play oh yeah god you know I got
investments in this like anybody could
do like we all could buy houses we all
could buy cars we all could put things
on credit cards we all could do all of
that stuff I'm not talking about that
I'm talking about cash you know like a
lot of those people you know oh I got
four houses five six houses and I got
this distant that yeah don't talk to me
about that talk to me about cash how
much cash you got on you you know what I
mean and that's what I want to do that's
what I wanna that's my goal you know
when I get to that that first goal which
is the the half of it 250,000 cash then
I'm gonna make an announcement gonna hey
guys I made it to you know halfway there
when I get to that well half a million
dollar cash then that's when I'm gonna
be like yo I'm gonna turn up I might
just be like a new freezer eight naw man
now I just wanna you know I gotta set
myself up man I have goals you know what
I mean like you guys gotta have goals to
guys like every five years you guys
should have a goal you guys got to have
a goal man you got a you got to do
something with yourself you know what I
mean you can't just be out
here just leaving everything behind is
it okay I might just live to live like
nah you gotta give yourself purpose in
this world you gotta say okay my purpose
is to do this my purpose is I have a lot
of purposes in this world I want my son
to be good I want my son to be able to
enjoy the things that I didn't have like
for example like going to a private
school you know go to private school go
to a really good high school then go to
a like Ivy League's you know University
like to that level and then from there
have him choose whatever career he wants
and you know still have some money there
safe for him so he don't be like me when
I was like 18 i was- i started negative
i didn't have nobody to come in and put
no money on me you know like I know I
got friends who their parents is like
okay they don't even have to pay for it
they go through the whole four years of
school never paying bread they
have money in their pocket I didn't go
through none of that stuff I want my son
to live I want my son to live the things
that I wanted to live through you know
what I mean so he i'ma live through him
you know what I mean
so for me to set everything up and be
able to have him good and you know any
other kid that I might have out here I
have to set myself up and set goals so I
don't be one of those people that just
be like hey yeah listen man I got an
apartment here on Brooklyn I'm living
this this and that like nah man cuz I
see people like you you see it all the
time guys you oh you have to do is go on
Instagram to be honest with you guys you
gotta see out there there's people who
live really really good lives meaning
like they could travel to wherever they
want they could open a business whenever
they want they could invest money and
whatever they want you know what I mean
like when I first heard of a Bitcoin
when it was like proud like you know
fifty dollars are on there I didn't have
no honey that was a long time ago I was
like I don't know 2011 around there I
was broke I was thinking about how I'm
gonna pay for it my next ride to school
you get what I'm saying like I couldn't
even invest into it I wanted to get into
it but I have no money
you know what I mean so it sucks when
people say you know the rich is getting
richer and the poor is guarantor that's
how it is you know if you have money you
could get more money if you don't have
money it's hard you got to go through a
hustle you gotta work hard out here you
know what I mean so I don't want that
for my son I want my son to just be like
to just slide through life and like not
even think about it not even think about
how I'm gonna pay for this it's just
there you know what I mean that's the
type of lifestyle that I want him to
have so yeah man you gotta work hard man

motivate people man yeah I try to
motivate people I'm trying to do it man

a Nokia phone right but this is certain
aura about it you know what I mean like

doors at the top
those that I broke but what makes this
room special you know in a month and a
half I'm moving from here and when I
move from here we're not gonna have all
of this stuff because we're gonna have
something bigger flash here nice you
know something that we gonna be proud of
but you know we bring in the ghetto
curtain we're not leaving the gate I had
to get up current this is like a this is
the the channels mascot you know what I
mean like look at this man like I'm just
saying though like we got the ghetto
curtain look this is not even supposed
to be up here right and then we have the
little Asian little Asian curtain in the
back for no reason because this type of
curtain don't even block anything from
the Sun and people could walk by here
and they could see me right through this
thing and I've been so lazy to go to
Ikea to buy another one you know this
thing is is here all right so the get of
curtain is coming back with us it's just
it's part of the magic of the channel
part of the magic of the website you
know I'm building a studio pretty soon
it's gonna be legit nice cameras the
whole shebang is gonna be open to the
public you know I'm gonna have like an
office and then I'm also gonna have a
studio for me to record it's gonna be
open to the public where people could
come in if you live close to New York if
you live in New York you could come
chill with me come hang out with me you
know I'm also you know I'm also brand
branching out to don't live reviews
right I'm doing reviews I got a lot of
stuff going on I'm I'm branching out
doing reviews um I'm just taking my
channel I'm checking I'm taking my whole
brand to the next level right and that's
all thanks to you guys you know it's
like that's what I tell some people like
you know I only got 10,000 subscribers
you know what I mean like how does Joe
make all this stuff happen does Joe sell
drugs
somebody sent me a message Joe Joe sells
drugs on the side this right here is a
bull now you just gotta know how to
maneuver in this you know and when you
give content to the people good content
people want to keep you and keep you
there right Plus also too you gotta take
whatever you getting like I get a small
percentage of the people to give a
little what like five ten dollars a lot
of people sign most of the people that
sign up to my website you're paying five
dollars to the website per month right
but what do I do
I reinvest that and give it back to the
people I come in and help people out
I don't come in and charge an arm and a
leg for stuff that I know they could get
for the same price in other places but
the reason why they come back is because
they like the sauce they like the way
how I break things down how I help
people out you know it's just that's my
my purpose in this right and at the same
time I have other things that I do on
the side you know for those of you guys
that send me the email right now I'm
going to be sending you the promo right
now I'm missing I'm missing you guys the
guys that won AJ and the other girl
forgot her name you you guys are missing
out man
you haven't sent me an email you got one
minute before I pass it on to somebody
else
you guys are slack yeah slacking right
now seriously I got you bro
Oh Sylvester hit me up like yo you just
made my day
listen that's why we hear you make my
day because you came hang out with me
you know what I mean I was feeling a
little bit down because of the whole
thing with little peep and I was feeling
a little bit depressed cuz I was like
man my sister passed away last year is
about to be a year now that she passed
away in December 27th so then she he's
young he's a young artist I know how it
feels to be in you know those circles of
you know people passing drugs and this
and that and then you could fall into
the this dark place and you know you
could just die and it just reminded me
of my sister you know all the stuff I
was a little bit depressed so thank you
guys for making my day you know what I
mean
and thanks to you to me for letting me
know like hey Joe your your course is
live right now kick you know what I mean
like imagine this guy's think about it
like this imagine in 2012 I was nervous
to go out and try to get a job right I
started in reality I start in 2011 I
started in 2011 in that whole year was
like starting to like you know learning
and and like learning stuff online and
this and that and then 2012 I got my
first job a year later not because I
couldn't get a job in the beginning but
because I was insecure I was nervous I
was like man they're gonna ask me a
whole bunch of stuff I'm not gonna get a
job I'm not gonna do listen that then I
got a job and then what I'm saying broke
the ice then now I'm in interviews like
dizzy you know what I might like I I'm
in that doing like this like a I go in
there like this door the flexible I go I
go into interview sign I go into
interviews pretty much just like hey
guys how you doing dad
my name is Joe that Santos that Garcia
dad
you know what I mean and then now like I
started doing this what course isn't
like we're really growing pretty freakin
fast with zero promotion you know this
was my goal I would say I said I'm gonna
come in I'm just gonna create my channel
then I realized I'm helping a lot of
people out and then people will send me
messages or hey man I'm still doing the
the color coding bootcamp from cold
steel is taking me forever I'm kind of
losing interest and say you know what
let me put my own spin into things
created the way how I wish somebody
would have taught me and then I created
my courses right and then now the
courses is growing like crazy udemy's is
bout to throw the bag at me you know
what I mean like they bout to start
promoting me like you know what I mean
like that's crazy and I'm still like
under $10 nah nah under but I'm on
10,000 subscribers and I keep bringing
up that number because you could you
could literally come in and compare my
channel so everybody else the so called
competition and then you realize like
how can I be doing so much good stuff
and so much things with this you know
small amount of subscribers how is that
it just doesn't make sense you know what
I mean like I didn't buy subscribers I
didn't promote this I it's just genuine
people that come here you know what I
mean like this is not fake accounts this
is not you know hey I'm buying you know
300,000 subscribers from India
I'm not buying like I got a lot of
subscribers from India but all of them
are are genuine people and people send
me messages like man you need to do
something about your website I can't buy
anything with rupees and this and that
you know it's like I try to help them
out but that's not my focus you know I
don't have to go in and swindle the game
so everything that I do somehow it's
like it's just blowing up and the reason
why I'm bringing all this stuff up it's
not to like show off what to do what
but it's just so you guys can understand
me where I was at in 2011-2012 so now in
2017 I'm teaching my own courses I'm
breaking it down to people you know it's
like there's a lot of growth like you
know I freaking like I don't know man I
upgrade it out here you know what I mean
without having to change who I am
without being fake without you know
acting different like I'm still I'm
still in spots like this like hey you
know what I mean like hey my name is Joe

yo Li Shu go-to coinbase right now kids
goddamn it man it's goddamn Forks we're
about to make mad money right now on
coinbase okay so freakin latest news
breaking news guys
so coinbase just sent our email there's
the email that they say they have been
numbered developments of with Bitcoin
Segway to X since our last update no
action is required and all funds stored
and coinbase remain safe
last week the Segway 2x development team
announced they would no longer continue
with the project in addition a
significant portion of miners in other
community leaders withdrew their support
for the fork however despite these
developments a small number of miners
may attempt to go forward with the fork
we wanted to provide clarity about the
potential outcomes of the fork in what
coinbase were doing this scenario to
protect customer funds coinbase will
disable Bitcoin sent and received at
2:00 a.m. Pacific time on November 17th
and the several disabled buys and sells
an hour before the fork which is
currently predicted to occur between
6:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. Pacific time
November 17th all functionality will be
renamed shortly afterwards scenario one
network is unusable support for the fork
remains at the current level of
decreases the Bitcoin 2x network will be
unusable coinbase will not support
withdraws or trading I say will not be
possible to move these assets currently
we believe this is the most likely
scenario if the network gained support
they we will enable Bitcoin to X
withdraws from the platform network is
usable as transactions are being
confirmed and reasonable speed we will
allow coin based customers to withdraw
Bitcoin to X we will not immediately
enable buys and sells as pre really
stated but we may enable them a later
date
we will keep customers updated through
our block
in other words kids same thing that
happened before is about to happen now
so coins bitcoins are going to go up
probably in the next few hours
and we're about to make money and then
on top of that you're gonna get other
coins from the Bitcoin where's the
Segway to X which is cool so there's
like you getting money from over there
and money from over here
yay all right so okay let's see let's
see let's see let's see guys of you if

I'll see you guys later man was I
completely self-taught yes I have a
degree in programming systems and
another one I went to school for
communication design but I'll be honest
I didn't learn programming in school
like they were trying to teach me like
C++ and like I understood what a
variable was but the teacher was so bad
it was like so bad that to be honest
with you they didn't teach me nothing
like when I finished school I was like
blank I was like I don't know what I'm
gonna do with my life like I was working
as an IT worker I was like man I was not
like didn't teach me anything you know
what I mean so I consider myself
completely a self-taught developer
because everything that I do is
self-taught you know I'm really from you
to me you know that's one thing that
people be like oh well you took a class
from team tree house and like yeah I
signed up for the Forum the Foro was
poppin
but I didn't really learn any different
in treehouse cos when I try to build my
own websites I couldn't do it then I
took the the khoi's from coal steel and
a couple of other courses that I took
from the beginning and then I was
building my own websites and like
breaking down the layouts and doing
everything understanding more CSS how to
lay out things with HTML so it could be
easier to control or CSS like all those
things like man you know I have a choice
in I'm a local college of computer
programming and analysis
I'm also self so do you think degree
will still give me that little edge yeah
it's not gonna be bad it's not gonna be
like oh my god this person got a degree
now it's gonna be good yeah plus you
never know how we might go years from
now you know what I mean like ten years
from now things might just get super
competitive you know right now we live
in the Golden Age the people that get in
now they're gonna be good forever but
the people that you know are coming in
later on and they don't have a degree
I don't know how is gonna be five ten
years from now you know what I mean
right now people just getting higher
left to right but you know if you have a
degree in or you like almost finishing
finish it you know what I mean oh yeah
