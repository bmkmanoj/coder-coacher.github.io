at it again man coning face calmness and
ebullient back I didn't did it again all
right guys listen man I'm super proud of
myself right now i created the rocky
stack right so I've been telling you
guys about crystal been telling you
about I'm about to make some tutorials
on or react I've been telling you about
all the cool things that this you know
this language this new programming
language can actually do and why would
you actually want to learn this like
listen brand new technology not that
many companies are using it so why would
you want to learn it right you're a
brand new developer right well basically
everything that you're going to learn
from here and from now on you can apply
this at any other language or any other
company that you might work for you know
any stack that you want to work you who
apply this to the mean stack you can
apply this to the lamp stack you go
client goes to the lamps pack you cool
apply this sue or anything pretty much
any stack that's out there you can apply
the the tools and basically the
knowledge that you're gonna get out of
this right plus I'm like super proud of
those guys like this thing took me a
long time I you know I came from nothing
I came from the bottom I came just like
you guys like came from like not knowing
how to print hello world to actually
building my own stack in my own the
framework right and just using it in a
way that anybody else out here can
actually use it in and learn something
cool lottery right and at the same time
is like it's pretty legit pretty fast
like all the benchmarks are through the
roof faster them go faster than elixir
faster than mean what the mean stack
which is you know angular or no Jas
Mongo so right now the rocky stack is
killing plus we love in the no go right
now oh yeah and you know we're doing our
thing man so yeah I want you guys to
first of all I want you guys to take
your time give this thing a chance i'm
gonna make tutorials on this for like
the next you're the next year this whole
year i'm going to focus on making
tutorials for this but the same time
every tutorial that I'm making I'm gonna
tell you guys hey you could actually use
this in the milk idea who actually uses
in the PHP stack whatever you want to
use it on right so there's got to be
mostly react and basically how to post
into a server how to do databases the
whole shebang right this is just an
introduction guys all right so yeah man
all you have to do right now is go to
coding face basically you go to github
com / coding face com right just like
that coding face calm / rocky right or
you can just come here you go to coding
face the first thing you're gonna see
this rocket right also for you guys that
like to read and like to understand
what's behind the scenes and sometimes
if your nose for whatever reason all you
have to do is check the documentation
which is right you know you got a bunch
of info and yes everything that you
might need to even get you started right
okay guys so we got to start this up
like this man we're gonna do a little
quick run at it right so since I already
installed it I'm gonna tell you guys
exactly what you're going to do so
you're here in the documentation you
come here and says okay here's
insulation right basically you download
the project you guys are cloning or you
could just download it regularly right
here don't lose it right and then you
put it into a folder that you want to
have your project well the first step
you gotta do is basically I'm still
crystal Ling alright so you're going to
top copy this copy that put it into your
terminal paste it there and then go
through all the steps here if you have
medical you have your Linux you can do
the same thing like i said on Windows
but basically follow the steps right so
on Mac you run this
then you run this which is just to
update homebrew you have stole crystal
lang and then you install your then from
there you're golden all right now your
next step is you're going to install the
dependencies you're going to say okay
shards install and now you're inside
your project you say hey charge install
and update in a stolen all the shards
charges just like packages all right for
crystal then you install yarn you're
honest all this is gonna store all the
packages that you might have for know
like you know no Jas or mpm or anything
like react or Redux whatever it is
that's in there that I have for you guys
basically installs it for you right then
you're going to install go right there's
got them stolen globally I already did
it so I'm not going to do it again
basically you paste it there and then
your gold right so you probably like you
know what I how would I install all of
this stuff right why would I take my
time to do this thing well you got a lot
of cool features right so basically when
you were so all of the packages all of
the shards you're basically going to get
a server you're gonna get rowdy you're
gonna get databases you're going to get
crystal Ling you're going to get react
and you're gonna get gulp already set up
for you so if you guys want to start you
know hitting the ground running this
server is gonna help you out this whole
package this whole stack in general is
going to help you out alright so pretty
much right now we're gonna say yarn run
server right what does it going to do is
is gonna start a server for you so here
you go the rocky stack alright so that's
what you're gonna get localhost 3000 all
right now what do you get with the rocky
stack right and I'd okay what the hell
is this well basically we're using react
with this what it means to say the rocky
stack react over crystal camel and yarn
pretty much you get in the whole package
is a modern stack is pretty much
everything that you
me just to hit the ground running all
right so so you want to change your CSS
but you want to do in a more modern way
just use sass right so you go to assets
you go to sass me go to the main.css and
let's say you want to change the
background to read all you have to do is
say your run watch so now it's got to
watch over all the changes in your CSS
and javascript and i'm going to show you
that in a little bit but look you see it
already compiled every day i will be
adding live reload that's going to come
in this week but yeah okay let's say we
want to change that see it's already
changed all right now you're probably
like okay cool I could oldest was
regular CSS and I could just you know
refresh the page whatever right cool but
we also have the JavaScript set up for
you so you can come here and there's
actually a react component right I will
be teaching you guys more of our
reactants we also so we got to build
something super cool okay so there's the
component let's say you want to change
this page and you like okay the same
example Power Ranger whatever you wanted
to do right so because it's watching it
and seeing what you're doing basically
it compiled the JavaScript for you so
click we should first say powering you
right now all the stuff you probably
like oh man with the dualism noj yes and
yes you could do an orgy yes but this is
actually beautiful there's a pretty much
the future I was development and i would
say guys give it a try give it a chance
start building your websites with the
rocky stack and follow me I will be
doing a tutorial was this all right so
this page is gonna be super cool well
gonna be teaching you guys in here is
going to be react I'm gonna teach a
crystal which you guys like I'm we're
going to review my
so everything that you're going to learn
from crystal you could literally
implement it to every other programming
language I'm going to teach you the
easiest way to learn how to become a
full stack developer the easy way the
money way that way you did okay so this
whole page we're going to build and
react and we're going to do API calls
right we're going to do get close we're
going to do post request basically the
whole page is going to be functional
it's going to have signings it's gonna
have identification is going to have you
know filtering of the posters basically
the movie information the whole shebang
after you finish this I guarantee that
you're gonna understand what's happening
on every website that's out there right
because every technology that I'm
bringing into here is going to be
applicable to any other stack out out
there right you can apply that to
anything all right guys listen man make
sure you subscribe make sure you like
this video man and listen guys take one
second to go to the gay right go to the
github account you know Cody face calm
you know come to rocky click here
download it or clone it and also make
sure you give it a star guys give it a
star let's get this thing trending
that's the that should be the title of
this let's get this thing trending let's
get it out there let's let the community
judging and it's fine if you like it you
like if you don't like it is fine this
is my very first stack that I create and
my verse first or framework that I'm
building there's gonna be good things
there's gonna be bad things but like I
always said you know this show improves
just improve every time somebody gives
me something a new idea or anything new
that I gotta create on it but the same
time guys I'm gonna be teaching you just
everything that you might need for any
stack because one thing that you guys
gotta understand is that once you learn
one stack once you learn one programming
language and once you understand what's
going on
one in the industry or what's going on
in a website and a web server then you
can put that in every other language all
right I started with just JavaScript and
then from there I learn PHP so then I
understood the backend from there and
then from there jump to kno jes and then
from there I jump to Ruby and they're
from there I jump to you know Java their
lower java before I jumped into a lot of
languages which I understand and then at
the end I actually have two choices I'm
saying hey I like this one I don't like
the other one and then I be an
adjustment my own choice on which one
I'm gonna stick with but if you guys
trust me and you understand what I'm
trying to teach you guys you will give
this a chance and trust me guys I'm not
going to make you waste your time this
thing is going to be the way that you're
going to understand how to become a full
stack developer the easy way the money
Wade the freeway you did all right
you're really on a simple job back at it
again coding face calm make sure you
subscribe make sure you like this video
and like I said make sure you give this
tingle star if you gotta get them give
it a stock let's get this thing trending
let's make the industry talker body cuz
you know what we in here I'm doing this
