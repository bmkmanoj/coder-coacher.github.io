simple jump back at it again man coding
face calm listen your voice back I
didn't did it again alright guys so
somebody asked me Joe how can you not
forget you know how can you not forget
the first programming language that you
learned or how can you make sure that
you don't forget a programming language
especially when you jump into other
programming languages right well this
question is very soon very simple and
it's not that difficult guys sorry ok
let me break it down to you guys once
you know one programming language you
can pretty much say you know every other
programming language because every
single programming language is going to
have the same things it's going to have
operations is going to have conditionals
is going to have variables although i
know my service is really bad over here
in the parking lot so i'm gonna try to
leave from here oh yeah so
 idiots man yeah so going back to
it sorry I'm live driving and on a rainy
day so how not to forget our programming
language like I said there's going to be
programming or painful variables if
statements switch statements loops what
else objects are less types which are
arrays to you know those near part of
computer science just knowing those
things right knowing different data sets
on data types like you know you know
freaking arrays objects and all that's
right so once you know it in one time in
one language you know it in every other
program the syntax and also to guys like
if you're working like right now for me
i'm working on JavaScript but then I'm
also working on PHP and then I'm also
working on crystal lang and then
sometimes i'm also working on ruby and
then sometimes i'm working on java so
how do i remember one of these things
and do i remember every single you know
every single syntax of each language and
the answer is no I don't remember every
single thing so whenever I forget like a
you know a certain thing from like PHP
like PHP has a function call range right
in a ruby has the same thing that's
called range but is the syntax is
different so what do i do I just go on
google and search range I search range
Ruby
now I know what it's supposed to do but
it's written differently so it's like it
doesn't matter what language you're
using it's always going to be the same
thing it's just gonna be written in a
different way so once you know one
programming language you're good for
life it's like you know it's like riding
a bike once you know how to ride a bike
and you know how to stay steady on top
of a bike you're good you're gonna be
able to do that or any other bike on a
motorcycle it could be anything come
you're going to be a tricycle like you
already know how it works you know how
that you got to balance yourself that's
it but besides that it's the same chain
I know you guys somebody left me a
comment I gear you got to make videos
more more to the point and it's like
okay cool I do need to make the videos
more to the point but these are live
videos right now these are not my
official videos my official videos are
the ones that are neither me making
tutorials or me in front of a camera all
right when you see me here and it's like
a little bit of bad quality is because
I'm doing a live video so you gotta
understand i'm driving i'm doing a whole
bunch of so it's not that easy to
stay focused on the same topic alright
but yeah so like once you know one
programming language guys like you're
gonna be fine stop worrying about and be
like oh my god there's so many different
languages and how do i remember each one
it's like you don't you don't remember
each one is that simple guys all you
gotta know is the functions love you
know what's the goal that you trying to
do so like right now if I wanna if I
want to declare a variable in JavaScript
right if to declare a variable you got
out to do a VAR a let or const all right
now for PHP the way how you declare a
variable is you basically you do a
dollar sign and then from there you put
in the name of the very
which is different than JavaScript but
how do I know what to do is basically is
like okay if I didn't know PHP all i
know is JavaScript I will search for
something like hey how do you make a
variable in PHP google will give you the
answer you already know what you want
out of it and then just copy and paste
guys everybody does it nobody here it's
an expert like nobody here knows every
single thing in the world at all trust
me just because you guys are brand new
doesn't mean that you know somebody
who's five ten years in the game it's
gonna know more than you in the sense of
like oh they're smarter than me or
whatever no it's just more of like they
know how to search things you know
Google is your friend no yeah once you
know program won't programmable one
programming language you're good man you
know you're good you don't need
to to worry about oh my god gotta
remember every syntax it's like know
whenever you need to do something in
that language then you find it or you go
through the documentation or you search
on Google now saying let me see so
what's up what's up with everybody what
I what I would up am I streaming every
day yes I'm streaming every day this is
what I call my lunch break chronicles I
usually do like a 10 to 20 minute little
live video with you guys answer some of
your questions so yeah
don't worry man don't worry man i got
you i mean the the group is growing the
Gator account is definitely getting
bigger now more people are joining
because of you mat so you know you're
definitely one of the people's I'm gonna
take care of like once this thing gets
poppin like you're definitely one of the
people that I gotta definitely you know
gives you a little sign you know where
we got 120 people I don't even know
what do you mean how do you get more
practice during your udemy course do you
mean hey while you're taking the udemy
course how do you practice it at the
same time is that what you mean Orlando
because the way I do is I watched the
whole the whole course right and then
from there what I do is I create the
same project again but with a couple of
changes so then I'm looking at the
project that i created while watching
the video whenever i need to you know
have something as a reference and going
there and look at it and be like okay
like let's say for example when i was
learning kno jes and I was watching koat
steals course right to learn kno jes the
way how i did it was I follow the whole
course right and then after that I
decided okay I'm gonna make a a book
library right so it's just me creating a
books creating books and then from there
posting it to the database so what I did
was I copy what i had already no matter
of fact i started making it on my own
and whenever I got lost I would look
back on the code and then just copy
embed okay this how you do user
authentication this is how you do
passport so that's how I learned it
but why does if you know C sharp how can
JavaScript which is easier you up
the problem is that you're thinking
about JavaScript like just like a pure
programming language you got to think
about it as the Dom because I'm pretty
sure the dentist messing you up is
dealing with stuff on the Dom which is
different from when you're dealing with
C sharp C sharp is just program it now
when you're dealing with JavaScript you
got to think about the Dom you got to
think about hey how do I target this div
inside of another day with an idea of
menu right so you gotta understand how
to target those things so I would say
try learning some see CSS and how to
target a little different different
elements and inside the page and then
from that you want to say how the Dom
tree works it's that simple
yeah man not only gonna I'm definitely
gonna say you know take care of you Matt
like I'm like I said I'm thinking about
once I I get to 500 and get into 500
where 500 5000 subscribers I'm gonna
take care of you know five people and I
feel like I'm definitely gonna take care
of you you know I'm gonna I was gonna do
four hundred dollars for one person but
what I'm gonna do is to be fair because
there's a lot of people here who helped
out and show a lot of love I'm gonna
give a hundred dollars to five people on
the channel you know cuz there's no
point of me you know earning a little
extra money from YouTube and then I
can't give back so i might as well give
back money to you guys not really into
the community you know what i mean and
guys make sure you everybody that's
watching right now go ahead give this
video a like so other people come in
because that's how YouTube works if you
guys don't give it a like that other
people won't know about the the life's
true okay so everybody right now give it
a like I'm gonna see there's 30 people i
wanna see 30 likes right now there you
go we going up right now on the lights
come on everybody they started something
people right now everybody give it a
like guess what other people have the
chance to see the notifications
you dig there you go we halfway there
come on everybody else watching give
this thing and like right now we have
waiting right now there you go two more
keep going keep going keep going come on
guys you guys could do it there you go
everybody give this a like come on we
got 12 to go 21 come on we could do it
we could do it guys come on
let's give this a hundred percent likes
right now yeah man I deserve to earn a
little Sun you know but it's better when
I could share it you know everybody if I
could give out free courses then yeah
then it's even better oh by the way guys
I I forgot to tell you this
while I really wanted to make the video
about listen guys so I got an email from
you to me you to me is gonna change the
way how the whole system works so you
literally have the next few days to buy
courses for ten dollars every other
courses is going to be $15 $20 or
twenty-five percent of whatever the
original course is so I think this is
gonna be like the last few weeks that
you're gonna be able to you know buy any
course for cheap because now it's going
to be random it's gonna be totally
random some guys take advantage today I
bought four courses already that's forty
dollars that i know i can't take those
courses right now I'm gonna take it like
a month or two from now police on by
under my ten dollars but in or out in
the beginning of may or may first they
changing their whole system the way how
is going to work is even the links that
i'm going to give you guys they're not
gonna work for everybody the same way
so if i give you a link for you that you
live here in the united states it might
be fifteen dollars right but somebody
that lives in in England is gonna be ten
dollars or somebody who lives in India
is going to be five dollars so
everybody's going to have a chance to
buy courses for cheaper but then it kind
of it up for people like you guys
that you know you come to my channel
i'll give you a link and you could get
it for ten dollars and it's guaranteed
for ten dollars now I was not gonna be
like that so now you're pretty much
gonna be like it's like a random number
you know like one day you're gonna come
in and the courses is going to be a $35
fifty dollars so what I would do is just
buy as much as you can for ten dollars
guys because they're gonna hit
you in the head next month next month
you're not gonna be able to get those
ten down expressions no more and it kind
of sucks because that's why I always
tell people bar from you to me because
it's like you could get it for ten
dollars but now they're going back to
the old model how they used to be back
in the days I used to buy courses for
forty dollars thirty dollars so it kind
of sucks but I understand what they're
doing is because number one they want
more people the internet and
international market to be able to buy
more courses and for the courses
creators to be able to make more money
so today if you go through my link skies
it's on the description or you go to
coding face.com /resources you're gonna
be able to get the courses at ten
dollars guys take advantage I'm telling
you right now listen thirty dollars
forty dollars that you're going to buy
that's five courses five courses you're
gonna be able to be good for the next
you know next few months
so take advantage like straight up like
I'm just being honest I both for courses
today because I was like man today
starts to ten dollar specials I'm gonna
take advantage cuz next one if I don't
know what the hell they're gonna be
doing they told me they sent me a
 email right telling me like hey
we we appreciate what you're doing next
month um the pricing is going to be is
gonna fluctuate it's gonna be different
for every user so I'm like that's just
gonna suck because if I give somebody a
link and be like okay guys this link is
gonna be ten dollars now it's not gonna
be ten dollars now I was gonna be
depending on where you live and I'm like
that kind of sucks you know like what if
I live here in to us and I don't want to
pay thirty dollars for course
you know that's my limit thirty dollars
is the most out I'll pay period but you
know kind of sucks man all right I
really think it sucks for real
mmm mmm mmm up yeah angular got a new
release which is angular for all right
dude I'm live right now I got the I got
a turkey man I got the turkey man
 he's like yo you live right now
I'm again I'm live right now
use a VPN say you live in India but I
don't know how they gonna do it man I I
think it's gonna be kind of crazy I
think it's gonna hurt their business I
think they're gonna after a few months
they're gonna go back to doing the
ten-dollar specials and you know fitting
our specials because it makes sense like
if I'm a user I'm gonna buy the courses
at ten $15 $20 but if you charging me
more than thirty dollars it's hard for
people because it's like you're ready
you know like let's say somebody works
at McDonald's and they're like oh I want
to become a web developer and I'm going
I'm like yo I'm gonna spend fifty
dollars which is like almost a whole day
of work half a day of work of me working
at McDonald's like you know what i mean
so you know what I mean make sure you go
through the links that i gave you guys
because that also helps me out it gives
me a thing like two three dollars for
every ten dollars which is naming that
much you know and they gotta charge you
that anyways the way how i'm gonna break
it down i'm gonna break it down one day
maybe tonight I'll make a video for
other people are you that want to know
how how you to me pays out to the people
that give our links just to be you know
to be transparent I don't even like
people to think like I'm over here
making a million dollars of this
cuz i'm not i just like to be
transparent be like hey man all you're
really doing is buying yourself a course
for yourself and then from there what
you're doing is supporting me for you
know coming here and liking the channel
so that's what you're doing you know so
it's like if you buy a course for nine
dollars i'll make to Las if you buy it
for ten dollars i'll make a two dollar
fifty if you buy a course for fifteen
dollars i think i made like four dollars
and then no matter what if you go to you
to me calm directly your means gonna
charge you the same come out the only
difference is that i'm not gonna get
anything out of it which is cool tool
you know but at least if you like the
channel support it whenever you're gonna
find force just come back to the channel
click on the link and then by course it
just helps out guys so it's like that's
all I'm saying
yeah I mean full stack I wouldn't say
it's not a myth full-stack to me it just
means that you understand what's going
on in both sides you don't have to be a
master of everything all you need to
know is just hey what's going on so like
let's say an example I'm all I'm all
user right I come to the page once i
land of the page that's a get request so
I get the page then from there if I want
to fill out a form that's a post request
right now in the back end when the user
does a get request I want to serve him
something sir from a page but serve him
a data right now once they do a post
request to my side which is the server
what I want is basically to take
whatever they post it and the variables
that they're giving me are there could
be a text for you it could be a text
area what I'm doing with that is pretty
much putting it into a database saving
it or showing them something new that's
it if you understand that whole process
then you're good you're full stack if
you know how to create layouts and you
know how to create a page out of a
design and you know how to deal with the
back end then you're a full stack it
doesn't mean that you're a master of
everything it just knows that you know
what's going on on both sides there's
people that can't do both sides these
people that they pigeonhole themselves
and be like oh all i know is javascript
so all i'ma do is the front end but then
they never connect to an api or they
never do post request to a server and
then it's like your pigeon holding
yourself you know what i mean so I guys
there's 40 people in here come on we
halfway there everybody give this
alike man keep it going man if you
haven't given this page unlike you
haven't given this video feet are like
give it a light come on guys you guys
could do it
I don't cause you learn to give it a
like it's free man likes is just one
click that's it okay let me see you
learn so much on it mom we're in the
back end stuff yeah man yo also guys oh
man come on we got 39 people and we got
35 lights come on there's four people
who are playing around right now if you
know you're watching and you haven't
given this a like stop playing give this
 alike okay we're missing two people
come on we can do it we could do
it guys come on we got 41 people now
come on guys 43 people come on you see
the thing is growing because everybody's
giving it a light so now google shows it
to everybody else that's how it works
when we can't be selfish we have a good
thing going on here with this community
so only shoot we got 42 people we got 41
likes come on whoever hasn't given this
thing alight come on you playing
yourself give this alike you're
playing is 10 there you go we did it
4242 that's what the I'm talking
about we got it you dick yeah how we got
42 people when we got 43 likes we went
above and beyond right now Oh shoe man
what do I think about free coke and free
coal camp is cool to play around with
guys but I'm being honest it doesn't
teach you how to make a website it
doesn't teach you how to make a web page
they teach you like little things like
oh how to do a variable how to do a
little algorithm how to do or change the
CSS style but it doesn't teach you how
to put everything together putting
everything together that's the big thing
you know that's the the big pop up when
you get to that then that's when you
know you're you're basically doing some
good web development out here you know
now we may be where Drake voice matter
of fact soldier boy voice
where were word for real guys man take
advantage guys today I think it's like
till the 27 foot study I think to the 27
is gonna be strong turned out of course
man take advantage guys take advantage
I'm gonna make another video later on
today and I'm gonna explain the whole
you to meet process for you guys so just
to create because I know everybody here
knows how to buy a course from you to me
but this is going to be a video for the
people that you know they search online
that I ok how to buy a course on udemy
so when they find that they're gonna
come to my videos and I can help them
out you know so don't be mad at me when
you be like you see like how to buy a
udemy course don't get mad don't be like
oh man we already know how to do this
Joe why are you making a video for this
and it's because there's got to be other
people who's going to search for that
and they don't know they they don't even
know how to do it can I put a list of
all my enemy courses yeah it's gonna be
a long list it's gonna be a very long
list guys cuz i have a lot of courses i
have to account on you to me that's how
crazy it is i got one that got bent
right because i was Aldean and that's
one thing that you know i'm gonna tell
you guys don't try to game the system
because i did it and i basically got
penalized I was you know buying a whole
bunch of courses and then if the courses
was like really really a neighbor if it
was really bad but I was just like
returning them every time and
they're like Gil you're buying 30
courses in a week and then you're
returning 27 of them right why are you
doing that and then pretty much they
penalize me and they ban my account so
you know that's what happened and then I
had to create another one which I have
few courses there but i'm gonna show you
both both courses man both are both
accounts so yeah go see like I don't
play no games when it comes to you to me
I spend my money on this like I
know a lot of people be like oh my god
its front end dollars a lot of spenders
in that man you know when I started
three four years ago you had to buy
courses at the real prices when you see
a hundred seventy five dollars that's
how much in use of course and then I
used to have to wait until it was like
fifty percent off thirty percent off i
remember i bought the cold steel course
for fifty dollars that's like unheard of
now you tell somebody you pay 40 hour
full course on you to me they look at
you like you're crazy and but for years
ago you know like 23 years ago it was
like that so he's like you just have to
spend money like now if you buy a coach
for ten dollars man you don't even know
how much is saving you know cuz this is
other guy who whose name is I think West
boss or west Bros or some like that
his courses are really good but they are
very expensive and i bought one which
was the es6 course just because i wanted
to buy it i wanted to support him
because it's like that's how I am like I
know like I'm making some money now you
know what I mean so it's like I go and I
by real music i buy music from itunes or
I signed up for Spotify now or if like I
really want to watch a movie I go in a
buying Amazon because I want to support
those people I understand what you're
broken you don't have no money yeah you
gotta go on torrentz you gotta go on
this and that but if you know you're
cool for ten dollars bio course man
don't go on torrentz don't do what I
said because all you're doing is
basically telling telling the Creator
like Oh fu because I want to get
for free you know
yeah I think his courses are fast-paced
one thing his courses are more for
people who have who know what the hell
they doing already like for you guys you
guys are already you guys are brand new
developers like Wes boss wouldn't be the
right place for you guys Wes boss is
more for somebody like me who who has
years already making you know websites
and doing web development but want to
retouch a couple of know things you know
like I wanted to get better with my es6
and then i have bought his course and
then i bought the seafront Grider and I
was pissed off because i bought the West
boss course and then I was like oh
sniffing brighter got a course on this I
should I just came here so
because i love all his courses even
though i already knew es6 i bought it
anyways it's only ten dollars man it's
like me like I told you guys I only buy
courses when its own special i'm not
spending any money above thirty dollars
or nobody's course Jesus Christ can come
out and be like yo guys I'm on you to me
make sure you you hear the gospel I got
the nice gospel tutorials Jesus Christ
I'm not buying your clothes for 30 above
thirty dollars you know what I mean like
that's just how I am i'm not spending
above 30 so that's why wait for the
tutorials to be down until our special
are still white box yeah books this can
be good to you know but you could buy a
book if you if you learn better like
that then yeah what's the best way to
retain everything in javascript is it to
just buildings yet just build things you
know the first thing you gotta build is
number one you gotta create a to-do app
even though it sounds dumb but
creating a to-do app is gonna teach you
how to post into an array right push
into the array remove items from an
array and to be honest with you guys one
of the most useful things that you're
gonna learn our arrays and objects when
it comes to javascript because you're
gonna use those things all the
time
you know I don't mean anything like that
you know i love jesus i love god i love
everybody I'm just saying like you know
that's an example I guess somebody comes
to me like hey my name is Jesus I'm
gonna be like yo Jesus I can't buy your
course if your course is beyond thirty
dollars for it like give me that
special let me get the code let me get
that cold k because i'm not i'm not
trying to be spending money like that we
get money but we gotta do this on a
Jewish way man we gotta find them
savings bro
you're big you know what I mean yeah
understanding the weird part is super
and deaf you gotta use that course like
an encyclopedia guys that that
JavaScript course is like super in-depth
like it's more for like this how i will
use it i will learn the what developer
boo came from cold steel right and then
from there you get the basics of java
script now once you need to learn more
complicated stuff like in react or you
need to do other frameworks go back and
learn the weird parts of JavaScript
learn that so you can get to the next
level and you're like you know up to par
with everybody because dealing with
frameworks you really gotta know
JavaScript you can just wing it that's
why I don't like angular or our view
because anybody could just wing it and
be like oh yeah I'm a JavaScript
developer because I know how to use view
and I know how to use angular and it's
like no dickhead like angular review
make it in a way where it's easier for
you to create stuff but it doesn't let
you learn JavaScript because if I tell
you hey can you do this in JavaScript
you'll be like um I need to bind this to
whatever I need to use my V bind to do a
for each like happens all the time
people don't even know how to do it for
each loop yes sir we got 51 but as we
got a high number of people in here but
the highest number that I got was 74 74
people live you know we get in there
74 people was definitely the record and
I was like in the beginning when I first
did my second or third life when I used
