naturally this when you guys see me like
a little bit down is because I might
having like health problems like you

have a lot of problems that don't share
to the world when you see me like this
it means I got some sleep it means I got
you know I got to eat properly I got to
UM you know ate some good juice hey some
good juice I drink some good juice you

naturally right so you know screw my
yacht Joe you dig you know what I mean
like we just bring that energy when we
do this web developer lunch breaks it's
like we hang out we talk about cold we
answer questions you know we eating
juice or now you know what I mean we
induce now you know yeah yeah go and
Davis is crazy man we're back in the
days man I used to be ranting like yo I
freaking people from my job get me
pissed off cuz you know what it is is
like I'm very passionate about this
right but at the same time I don't like
when people try to take advantage of
that right and like I used to be
stressed out and that job is like you
know everything that I thought that was
gonna be in that job it was the complete
opposite like I hated it I hate it like
a lot of stuff from that job man like
the projects that I was working on I was
like yo this isn't what I signed up for
like this isn't what I wanted to do you
don't know I mean like I literally had
mad money saved like when I had quit
the previous job I say I'm not gonna
work for a whole year right cuz I had my
money saved right my plan was that I was
gonna move to Thailand and I was gonna
leave the United States right that was
my plan on what was it August 26 yeah
August 2016
all right and then yeah was it all this
2016 yeah August 2016 and then like a
week after I had just left my other job
right
recruiters is calling me up like yo we
got a job around the corner from you you
want this or now I'm like oh man is
literally five minutes away from my
house let me just go show up and this is
why I don't like going to job interviews
because a lot of times I get the job
sounds messed up but it's true I don't
like going to a lot of job interviews
because on the first day I'll most
likely get the job right um because of
the skills that I have you know the way
how going there you know I usually go
into interviews you'd be like yeah shoot
boy Joe out here what up I got the
skills you're trying to hire me or not I
just go in there into interview like
that nah I just I always get hired on
the first date like they be like oh when
can you start and this and that so I've
never really had the opportunity to sit
down and take time off and like choose
that the right you know the right
company for me like you know some some
people they have that option right when
I first got into this I was dead broke I
didn't have no money and I have nothing
so it's like my first job for a job that
hired me I took it
right so from there on the past five
years you know it has been almost like
that because every time that I leave a
job somebody's all we got a job for you
come over here and I'm like okay cool so
I'll just take it right even if I didn't
want to take the job
I just take
so um only time that really said no to a
job was that that thing from Viacom
because the whole job would have been
just doing JavaScript without seeing
nothing like meaning like my job would
have been just debugging the advertising
from vh1 and TV like you know every time
that you let's say you go to vh1.com and
you watch Love &amp;amp; Hip Hop this
commercials that show up right and
sometimes these glitches there's there's
books so my job would have been not
working on the website not doing
anything like that it was just literally
fixing the bugs in the advertising I was
like this is not for me so that's the
only time that I've said no to a job but
most of the time somebody comes in to
hey man you hired an alcohol whatever
it's like less problems for me to
continue looking for jobs right so and
you know things happen whatever I was
like man I'm not gonna take a job I'm
not I'm not trying to get hired right
now I'm trying to just chill and then I
got hired at that last job I was saying
was it 39 dollar glasses comm and they
were cool whatever but the whole place
was a mess it was a mess I've never been
in a company where literally the website
itself which is the bread and butter
it's a mess the people there were oh
nice everybody that worked there they're
nice everybody the owners are nice
everybody is there but the system itself
the business logic behind the scenes was
a mess I was like yo this is not what I
I wanted to to work at right and then
once I finished from there like I fell
at the end I was like I felt like people
were kind of ungrateful all the work
that I did that was like you know I'm
out of here like bro like I don't need
to be in here like you know I got money
in the bank saved like I don't need to
work for the next 2-3 years like I'm
good you know what I mean like I don't
need to be out here you know I mean so
like I was like why am I getting stress
about this job when I could literally
leave but I didn't leave because of my
my co-worker who was mad cool and there
was funny this that I didn't leave
because of him and but he left
I still love them though man it's
hilarious man but that's how work is man
so every time I used to come to or do my
web developer lunch break I used to come
out here be like yo man I will give you
guys knowledge but the same time I've
also shared the days down stressed out
the bad things that used to happen so
here man it was just like a headache you
know what I mean and then it was funny
at the end of the job he was like it's
like Oh Joey we saw in one of your
youtube videos that you seemed pretty
unhappy here I'm like yeah now you just
noticed that like I don't need to be
here you know one of the worst things
that can happen to a company it's like
when your employee has money on his
pocket right like that's like the that's
the nightmare of like any employer right
when you're good you don't need to be
there that's like right now that's like
let's say right now for example Mark
Zuckerberg be like you know what eff
Facebook all right I'm gonna go outside
I wanna work in other people's companies
having more exact work at a company is a
problem because Mark Zuckerberg who get
there late mihari Zuckerberg will do
whatever the hell he wants cuz he got
money in his pocket he does not need the
company that's gonna hire you know what
I'm saying so it's like a lot of times
that's how I felt like you know at the
end I was like man like why am I here
like bro like just for my website so
long I make the same amount of money
that I was making there's like why am I
here stressed out like if I'm gonna work
at a company it has to be like something
like super legit like a company where
I'm the dumbest person in there like
that's how I look at it like I wanna be
I don't want to go to the company the
next company I go to if I decide to work
for anybody is I have to be the dumbest
person in there period right I don't
want to be in there oh this person knows
that I don't want to be in any company
that I'm the smartest person there right
I don't want to be in any company like
that
not because I was like I can't handle
this just I don't want to be in that
because everything falls on you all the
decisions falls on you or distress falls
on you
all the drama falls on you any mistakes
falls on you and it's like man I want
somebody else who way smarter than me
who's gotta motivate me to go to work
and be like oh man I want to work around
this guy so you get what I'm saying
like sometimes the money or the company
is not even worth it man so it's like my
next if I go to any job I don't even if
I will go back to work I'll be honest
I'll never go I don't know if I'll go
back to work full-time for anybody
because it's like I know too much I've
seen too much you get what I'm saying
like you know what I don't know how to
explain this to you guys but it's like
when you know too much and you seem too
much it's like you can't go back there
to that you know that that freaking
dirty water from that dirty well you
know so it's like hey you got to pump up
the water to come up and when you see
the little the little things of the
little bugs at the bottom that look like
freakin that they bout to turn into a
mosquitos like you're not gonna drink
from that water no more man
you're not saying it's like I've seen
too much I already tasted the good water
of freedom you know what I mean like I
tasted the good waters of being
entrepreneur and you know living your
life and making your money in businesses
and you know getting the ball rolling is
like how can you after you it's like you
know mark let's say Mark Cuban how can
Mark Cuban go work for somebody else you
get what I'm saying like I feel that's
where I'm at right now like you can't go
back you gotta understand like I know
for a lot of you guys be like damn yo
you make it sound like it's crazy it's
bad being a developer is not but it's
like I've transcended to something else
like I don't even know you know I was
like I came out here became like some in
a year or two two years two years and I
already transformed into something else
man I can't go back man you know if not
you guys gonna see me or all freakin
right here on the web developer
lunch be like ah man you know man like I
could have been I could have been making
money on my own right now I mean lunch
break right now kids like you know what
I mean like it's crazy so let me see
what's going on let me know if you guys
wanna run out you know go over some
questions whatever you guys want to ask
me you know me it's my web developer
lunch break man my what developer lunch
break I come in I do a little quick rant
you know I go out you know go to the
deep end then I come back and you know
it's like hey man we out the water skate
you know so be back all right so talk
about the stuff that you guys want to
talk about let me see man Kumba
butterfly Kumba butterfly oh yeah man it
worked for you Scotty Scotty says dude
Joe prize for making the golf course I'm
glad that somebody's watching it you
know what I mean I need to add it to the
web developers how you call is to the
timeline because I don't think a lot of
people are taking it because it's not in
the timeline so I gotta fix that tonight
can it
if I used to get to your financial level
oh yeah man I made a lot of mistakes
kids like that's what all the things
that I tell people I'm sorry to go into
this other right but this is why I tell
people you know so I'm gonna share this
so what's his name so people don't think
I'm the one that's asking this massive
demand says can it take less than five
years to get to your financial level
listen kids like everything that I'm
teaching you guys everything that I'm
telling you guys about it so you don't
make mistakes all right so you could go
in here right let's say you learn to
become a web developer you learn to
become an iOS developer game developer
whatever you decide to be right you work
where you work your first year your
first two years
your first two years is really just for
you to get yourself level off right get
the experience get to learn everything
that you need to learn prepare yourself
because anybody that comes in and tells
you hey you're gonna be a developer in
two months three months it's not gonna
happen
you're not you're gonna be able to get
hired well you're not gonna be like a
legit developer you're not gonna
understand everything under the Sun
right away it's gonna take you a year to
write and that's being honest and that's
because you're gonna need the experience
every job that you go to is gonna teach
you stuff that you never thought that
you was gonna need but at the end you're
gonna you're gonna learn all those
things and it just it makes your your
level of understanding programming in
general so much better right because you
you bump into problems that you wouldn't
have bumped into by doing a course by
doing a tutorial like there's only a
only way to get it is by getting
experience either working with a client
or working with a company so take that
off like your list for the first two
years is you just learning excuse me
you just learned and just getting
your your feet wet in the industry right
after that right your first years like
okay you excited you a developer you
like earning sixty seventy thousand
dollars you know okay cool or maybe more
if you know how to school your self in
your good the first year right you come
in you handle yourself you take care of
your finances you start paying off all
of your bills you start paying off all
your credit cards you start paying off
all the things don't go crazy don't lag
like a lot of this you know those little
hipsters that be doing this stuff right
you don't try to keep up with the
hipsters man listen if you don't got
papi and mami as a as a pillow so when
you fail you could fall back on them
don't do the hipster way right the
hipster way is to go into a three
thousand dollar apartment live right in
the city like those are that's for the
hipsters man if you're not one of those
people that got money like that and you
could say hey man I got parents that
taking care of me I got a little trust
fronting here in case I fail if you're
not one of those people follow the steps
right your first year you're gonna go in
you're gonna work first year don't go
crazy don't buy nothing crazy you come
in you pay off all your credit card
debts you pay off all your things you
make sure you build your credit right
your second year your second year you
still either working in the same company
or you working another company you come
in and they're from there you say okay
cool
I have a little something last year
you're not paid everything off now you
give a little something to yourself you
could buy yourself a car you could buy
yourself a nice little trip say hey man
I'm going through freaking Alaska I'm
taking a cruise to Alaska it's gonna
cost me $3,000 vacation time go ahead
gift ourselves to you give that to
yourself right there from there your
third your fourth and your fifth year
it's more like you already know what
develop me you already know programming
you already know those things now it's
about looking at the long term now is
when you start saying hey man I gotta
use this money that I'm earning from
this company to invest
either advertising my own websites my
own projects my own things like that's
what you're supposed to do right and
you're definitely gonna be way better
off than me you know in probably less
time you don't know saying like this
things that I didn't learn in the
beginning like it's just like me flowing
through through life you know what I
mean you know when you're a little kid
you just like flowing through life
flowing through life you know that's
where I was that now your boy is focused
you can remain - straight tunnel vision
I'm just like this I don't see nothing
else you know out here all I see is a
bag at the end that's how you got to
start thinking after a while man because
you could fall very easily into the same
cycle you know what I'm saying like you
know you can say hey man I'm in the same
cycle of like let's say I was break this
up this analogy right you could be a
mechanic right and you could be a
mechanic you say oh cool now I'm earning
some money yeah I'm a mechanic and I'm
working for uh you know mercedes-benz
and I'm the guy fixing cars but now
you're always working for mercedes-benz
and when you tell your friends is like
hey I work for mercedes-benz and people
be like oh wow you work for
mercedes-benz right well you don't all
mercedes-benz and that's not yours you
go home you'll work or five years from
now ten years from now that
mercedes-benz dealer dealership might
not be sending as many cars as they were
before economy went down uh stocks
crashed uh freaking real estate freakin
is going down whatever could happen
right Donald Trump has a third term I
don't know you know what I mean
something to happen but now you're that
mechanic right and you're there and then
they say you know what that mechanics
been here for like five years you know
we're paying him too much you know
sometimes you come in lay sometimes they
don't like you that much you're not the
favorite
and let's just say you're not the
favorite one so who's getting cut when
they say hey man we gotta cut down this
is gonna be the you know the the owners
son is it gonna be the guy who's been
there for 20 years is it gonna be the
new girl who's getting paid minimum wage
because she's brand-new right now it's
gonna be you is gonna be that random guy
that gets cut off so you no longer
working at mercedes-benz so what happens
now now you're looking for a job you're
looking scrambling cuz you didn't save
your money you didn't have a business
you didn't have nothing so now you're
just like oh man I gotta find another
job another you know what I mean it's
like if you want to live in that world
you could live in that same world as a
developer right you can say tomorrow hey
I work at Facebook
I like our Facebook and then one day
Facebook is not doing that great
Facebook becomes a freaky Facebook
becomes my space right Mark Zuckerberg -
took a pee took a piss in front of I
don't know the president society and
people like oh my god something happened
to Mark Zuckerberg company's going down
stocks is going down now you like ok now
you get a fire you get whatever listen
I'm just making stuff up right anything
could happen when you just depend on one
company or you depend on oh I'm working
for this company know if you have a
skill you have to use your brain to make
that work
you gotta become entrepreneur you have
to come in and make your own money you
can't just be dependent on somebody else
alright let's say right now a lot of you
guys have a lot of good skills right in
other careers right and for whatever
reason though those other careers did
not flourished and then I people did not
appreciate you people did not support
you people did not promote you right and
then you're like you know I'm tired of
this I'm gonna become a developer cool
right what being a developer what it
does it gives you the opportunity to
actually come in and build your own
businesses build your own things cuz now
everything's on the web everything is is
online I mean let's say I worked for let
me bring this up I was watching Steve
Maddens documentary right watch it go
watch it on Netflix this is what I do i
watch documentaries Wow a lot of you
guys are watching Marvel Comics Marvel
videos people are excited about the new
Black Panther movie listen that's not
gonna put no money in my pocket I'm
actually out he's still learning I'm
watching documentaries I'm watching
history I'm learning from things those
are the things that motivate me all
right so I'm watching Steve Maddens
documentary right he was just a dude who
literally he put in shoes on girls on a
store he was a Salesman he worked retail
right he wasn't smart he had a DD he had
a whole bunch of stuff right that you
will say hey man this guy is gonna be a
loser right nah you know what he did he
came in he said hey I could actually
come in and build my own my own shoes
and then he started making his own shoes
and then from there going to store to
store and selling it out of his truck
his car his trunk so he sold it out of
the car hey man so Mexican dude which I
didn't even know so he's like when it
goes down to it a Mexican dude helped
out Steve madding Popoff right so it's
crazy
we everywhere lands Hispanics we
everywhere we somehow we you know what I
mean he's like hey man you think
somebody's demand was like there's
always a Mexican dude doing the power at
work or something like that so I was
like we everywhere kid right so it's
cold I forgot the name is search Steve
madding on Netflix tamp go watch it is
really inspirational and the guy he's
like legit he's just a regular do he's
like me he's not like super smart he's
just some regular dude you know when
you're just a regular dude out here you
could win if you have creativity so
whatever this guy he came in he created
his empire just from like
and now is like one of the biggest
brands in the world and I mean I bring
that back to us as web developers
because it's like you come in and be
like hey I'm a web developer at XYZ
company and that's it that's all you are
you work for that person and you work
for that company
well how about you come in and say hey
I'm more entrepreneur I'm on somebody
who's creating startups your first
startup is not gonna work your second
startup might not work even your fifth
your six it's not gonna work but on you
seven you're gonna do something great
that's like everything that I've been
doing like the past you know past two
three years like I've had a lot of
failures like this is something that
you're gonna keep on hearing from people
you're gonna have failure failure
failure but what you do is since you're
smart and you you have a skill you work
for a company you use them to basically
find your side businesses your ideas so
you're using you selling your services
to them or to a client to whoever you
want to do however you want to do a
freelance and online whatever you want
to do online right from there you come
in you fund your all side business as
your own side ideas your first one might
not work your second one might not work
your third one might not work your
fourth one might not work your fifth one
might not work your six one might not
work but do you give up no on the
seventh
you're gonna see that boom right it's
like this happens to everybody everybody
who who you see that has money in this
world and has done saying to themselves
like you know like I don't know I feel
like I'm 30 years old
I'm just like I'm getting to this to
this point right where I'm like
everything that I'm touching is like is
becoming fire right everything I touch
somehow generates money right popobawa
right and money is not really the the
big part of success right was the big
part of success is actually saying hey
now
with this money that I'm making
is like now I could come in and create
the things that I wanted to create from
the beginning all right so that's what
you guys will need to do and that's what
you guys need to understand it's like
just keep working hard get your job go
in there do your work do what you got to
do but you gotta have that Plan B Plan C
plan D you can I just say hey man lay
back and be like hey I want developer
now I work for Zillow I work for
zappos.com I work for whatever company
is like bro that's not your company
that's not your company like your worker
there tomorrow they cut you out you're
gone you know somebody hit me up today
uh I'm not gonna say his name but he
told me is like oh man you know I was
working for a hundred thousand dollars
you know I got hired a few months ago
and then now I got laid off because my
health guys this happens all the time
like I have health problems that I don't
really go too deep into right but at the
same time it's like that's why now I'm
so grateful I'm like you know thank God
I set myself up to where like hey man
the days I don't feel good I just don't
do anything the days I feel good I come
in I do all my work but everything I
gotta do but if I had to go in and work
24/7 at a company like and I was
depending on that little check like that
would be a issue because people get sick
people get a whole bunch of stuff so
it's like he had to go to like the ER
and everything got go to the doctor and
he got laid off because of his health so
it's like you telling me the company had
no loyalty to you
you got what I'm saying so it's like
this happens all the time stop trying to
be loyal to a company your company's
never gonna be lower to you right a
company's lawyer to their investors the
owners the guys who founded that company
Venna Lloyd the employees very rare you
see that only time they you seen that I
think that the other day on this guy who
he Bora was a yogurt company and he paid
all of his employees like hundreds of
thousands like a you know like two
hundred thousand dollar bonus for
everybody even the janitor like a two
hundred thousand dollar bonus like you
would never see that hey you will you
work in a freakin XYZ comm you're never
gonna see that nobody's gonna come to
you like hey Joe
hey oh my god you did an amazing job you
know it's like our profits went up they
doubled last year we make ten this year
we made twenty thanks to your your
improvements to the website yes $50,000
he's of the hundred thousand dollars you
earned it nobody's gonna come to you for
that right the financials
you know when a company's doing really
good they don't even want the employees
to know about it right you have to go
out your way you gotta find out if the
stocks went up you gotta find out like
they ain't try to tell people that yo we
doing good kids like everybody's getting
some getting getting money you know what
I mean like nah they're not gonna do
that for you so as a developer come in
put in your year your two years to three
years all right stack up put money
stashed up put it in the bank keep it
there
you know if you don't have no kids no
family no no and no responsibility keep
it like that being on let's keep it like
that because that gives you more freedom
to take more risk right this days a bit
like you know if I was by myself I would
probably take the biggest risk I'll be
like I'll sell everything that I have
and I will move to either Dominican
Republic or move to Thailand and live
off that and there for like the next 10
years like if I sell everything I could
live off the next thing is and just
worry about creating startups and
creating new companies
you come up with ideas like that right
so he's like taking advantage you know
what I mean so yeah man and by the way
happy Valentine's man I hope you have a
you know a little shorty right there
little Netflix and chill you know tell
Yo Ma my brain hurts
I've been I've been coding too hard you
know hold me down my you know don't
forget you know what I mean yeah man we
in here man so I'm just reading the
comments see reading
comments reading the comments says Mike
say hey I just got hired as a junior
back in no Jes developer they're gonna
put me on a project but I think I still
have stuff to learn I don't feel ready
what should I do
listen just go with it go with the flow
you don't understand if they're gonna
put you on a project that means that
project is already set up that means
that project is already you know
everything has been architected is that
even aware architected um it's already
set up is built for you right somebody
went in architect the I don't even know
architect isn't work what's the name of
the word that I'm trying to say but
basically structured the whole project
for you
right so they already did all the hard
work all you're gonna do is just
literally show up look at what they have
if they tell you hey could you add
another route for you know this rest API
you look at the other recipes that they
have there and you copy it pretty much
so you learn from the type of you know
coding style that they're using and just
that's it you know I mean like and at
the same time Google is your friend man
like once you know the basics and you
know your way around a Java Script like
the answers are on the internet man what
people come in and be like say hey oh
man you can't Google everything you
can't you're not supposed to do this
guys listen the biggest geniuses out
there they google it right cuz you still
gotta look at a documentation you're not
gonna be able to learn the other stuff
by you by yourself like out of your
brain you have to look at a
documentation even back in the days
those guys who were reading you know was
it Pascal or whatever has like all the
freaking old camel like they had to look
at a book right when you were stuck you
opened up the book and found exactly
where
that she was at and found out how to do
something it's the same thing the only
difference that now is there's Google
Google you saves you the time of having
to read through the whole book to find
your answer that's a so you're gonna be
fine man
Martina Nicolai you commenting on the
videos that you you can make money from
niche websites can you talk about it
what kind of website can I make to make
money online well there's a lot of ways
man you could come in and create let's
say you like let's talk about shoes
right you will come in and say hey I
like shoes I like Gucci shoes are like
salvatore ferragamo shoes I like I don't
know whatever you like great you create
a website that filters through the whole
collections of Ferragamo right and you
show people where to find those shoes
right and then now you either can make
money from the advertising or you can
make money from actually affiliate links
or you know Commission links Rainey so
people buy those those shoes and you get
a commission for it right now you might
think oh man it's not gonna be that many
people well you'd be surprised you know
your website starts growing
you know I first you're gonna see very
small gains you're gonna see like oh oh
man I won not one I I earned freaking
six dollars today might not seem like
much but leave that website there if it
earned you six dollars it means it's
gonna earn more later on so you leave
that website there you add a couple of
extra features all right there from
there or you can create like a a mailing
list and be like hey you basically you
code this in the backend you set it up
where hey any new shoes that come out
from Salvatore Ferragamo you basically
send it to an email to the
to the users that signed up to your
website as a mailing list or they
register to your account whatever and
pretty much now every time my new shoes
come out you get a commission alright so
there's like there's so many different
ways you you got to start using your
brain you know it's like you gotta start
using your brain the same way how you
will start a business for you know
selling things physically you can start
a business online right if you make
people's lives easier you're gonna earn
money right if I come in and I create a
website where I say hey I'm gonna filter
out on Netflix all the Netflix movies by
date by whatever data right cuz Netflix
is super annoying I don't know if you
guys have noticed this Netflix you but
you could be on Netflix for half an hour
trying to find a movie because you can't
even filter you can put it in by a date
you can put it by John I mean you can
put by John Robb but there's so many
stuff in each genre that it overlaps
each other they'll be like one thriller
movie will have a horror movie inside of
it it's like the filtering sucks you
could create a website that filters just
all the Netflix movies and pretty much
gives people the the right movies right
you could create the an algorithm some
 right and basically from there make
money off the advertiser alright you
just got to do the research you got to
find it yourself you got to find where
there's a problem where there's a
problem you find a solution and you get
paid because you found the solution for
it okay now a lot of times you're not
gonna be able to say hey I'm making you
know ten thousand dollars from each
website it's not gonna happen like that
sometimes them might be like hey you
have five six websites one makes five
hundred another makes two hundred
another makes a hundred I know makes mm
that even for for myself like even right
now like um you know I have a website
that makes 200 I have another one that
makes two dollars and a half
the one that makes four thousand I have
another one that makes a 150 or even
like with my whole courses and
everything that I do right I'm putting
in the knowledge that I already have in
the things that I already learned to
teach you guys right I'll take that in
from there you know my website I make a
pretty good at my own like maybe like
two three thousand right so if I make
two three thousand from that website
then from there I have other places
where I could go in and put my courses
and you to me right you to me I don't
make anything you to me I'm making like
three hundred dollars right but this
other website and I stack or stack
exchange I might put it there and then
make another eight hundred dollars and
then I might put it in on Pluralsight
and if fluoro site they decide to say
hey we're gonna pay you freakin oh no
another thousand dollars like all that
stuff starts adding up man you wanna
have like twenty different websites
twenty different ways that is generating
a thousand dollars each that's the goal
once you get to that point you're good
you get what I'm saying
cuz now at some point all you have to do
is manage each one of them like all my
other websites that I have my niche
websites that I have I haven't touched
them in like two years it just generates
money every year it goes up $500 $600
higher every month like you know it just
slowly but surely five years from now
who knows you know this what this
YouTube thing right I come in to YouTube
I hang out with you guys I talk about
code I talk about things that I'm
passionate about
right when I first started last year you
know how much I was making I was making
like I think it was like twenty five
dollars a month for like six months
straight and then from there it did a
little jump and went up then we started
making like three hundred dollars so for
like another six months I only made 300
dollars a month from YouTube right
there from there we went up now in
January somehow it just went up
skyrocket so now is making now hungry
right now
I used to have another YouTube channel
oh that it was all about music all about
just regular stuff just like I would
just review music albums and stuff like
that
right I sold that I sold that that
YouTube channel but that channel it
didn't have no advertising or nothing it
sucked
hey I will get like I don't know like
half a million views per month so 5
times as much as this right
so I calculated the other day I
calculated the other day that if let's
say let's say like traversing meteorite
traversing medium must be making about
$10,000 to $15,000 a month just from
YouTube right now that's not to say all
the courses he has on you to me all the
courses that he has on other platforms
on what's the other one that he had the
company the first company he was working
with I forgot the name of them but
basically he was selling courses with
them for a long time like he still got
that content out there on the internet
they're still generating money no matter
what so all other stuff just start
stacking up you got I'm saying and we
don't know how many websites he's built
niche sites and in projects and startups
it's like who knows you know saying I
probably making like 1520 thousand
dollars a month or more me I'm very
close and I'm I'm close to those numbers
and I'm not even I'm not all up to the
level that he's on you got a saying so
it's like imagine to the level once I
get to like a hundred thousand
subscribers two hundred thousand
subscribers like the amount of that
I'm gonna be able to do it is gonna be
ridiculous maybe because the money that
you you you make you don't make it to
say hey oh I have money I have a lot of
blue cheese and you know it's like it's
fun to do that right but that's dumb the
best way to do is say hey man I make it
on this now I could take this and find
my other startups and other things that
I want to do like even coding phase calm
my my goal for coding phase comm is for
us to be able to have every single kid
around the world who's you know from the
age of zero from a baby to seventeen
years old be able to have all the
courses for free right once we get to
that point and we have the 50 poorest
countries be able to have all the
courses for free when we get to that
point we're gonna have thousands and
thousands and thousands of people go to
the website right so what's gonna happen
there we're gonna have to be able to
maintain it so if I don't make enough
money from all the other avenues that
I'm doing I'm not gonna be able to
maintain that website you got on saying
so that's how you got to think man you
gotta start small you start with a small
niche site you start building on like
that and use things to fund the things
that you really want to pop off right
because I have like a music website that
I don't care about that is generating
money but it's there I haven't put no
new music or anything in there for like
two years and it's generating money but
at the same time I used that money to
fund all the other things that I have
like you know help coding phase the
hosting like paying for teachable
comments not cheap you know they hit me
up the other day like hey you're you're
getting to a was it a data quota or
something like that so they're gonna
have I'm gonna have to pay more money
you know it's like it's gonna be like
five hundred dollars per month or
something like that like you gotta say
like my internet calls like 200 like
there's a lot of stuff a lot of things
that is ridiculous but you just gotta
start from the beginning man like learn
to code is just the first step there
from there is on you know I mean
yeah man I'm just reading everybody
staying mad Lisa 3,000 man I'm trying to
cop that Lisa 3,000 tonight you know I
mean we recently done him as a
hundred thousand subscribers without
burn yeah man hundred thousand
subscribers like that's the start man
yeah the problem with teachable is that
I don't have to worry about I mean it's
not a problem the good thing about it is
I don't have to worry about hosting if
you guys know about hosting video it
gets very expensive I guess very
annoying our servers go down a whole
bunch of stuff happens right like I
don't want to be dealing with none of
that stuff like already deal with enough
like I have to answer emails I have to
setup you know the courses I gotta
create the courses and you know record a
whole bunch of stuff I do a lot I don't
want to have to also have to maintain a
server and maintain everything it's like
too much work
yeah so it's like it just becomes too
much at some point you know cuz you
gotta understand I'm only one man
right now I have this kid Jake who's
helping me out all right in the
descriptions right but even at that like
I'm trying to set up this jeonyul
scholarship right the scholarship
program that I'm doing which is gonna
bring thousands and thousands of people
to the website that's gonna be
completely free because they're gonna be
like you know little kids who want to
learn how to code right so what that's
gonna do is gonna bring stress into the
servers right so we're gonna have to
upgrade everything and that's those are
the things that people don't see you
don't know saying like people come in
and be like oh man it's coding face.com
he's trying to make money nah bro I make
my money you're already from my websites
like this is like my extra stuff this is
my kumbaya Joe you get what I'm saying
like when I come in here this is kumbaya
Joe this I'm doing this for the love I'm
doing this for just for the hell of it
to make sure that everybody is good
people get the opportunities that I got
you know like when I was 40 nobody gave
me a link to a website that hey you
gotta learn to code for free
you know what I did that for me you know
what I mean like freakin was a freak oh
can be cool you know what I mean but I
still don't feel like it teaches people
how to build a full website and how to
work at a company right it just teaches
you the syntax so it's like I want to
become the the website that you know the
kids go to that people go to to learn
how to code that when they run a
real-life environment again I'm saying
like not not that you know tutorial
heaven so at the same time like this the
only way I could do it you know is to
really go hard and help people out it is
just by me generating money from other
places generating money from coding
phase calm and at the same time pumping
a bright back into coding face.com
you know I just got like put it right
back in there you know what I mean like
here you go coding phase huh
put that right up in there you know take
all that whatever profit I take from the
side I've been like yo put that right
back in there and I'm mature well I'm 30
years old still man immature somebody
please tell me what I don't know I find
this funny just going like this and you
I don't know
but yes I'm just putting everything back
in there why am I doing this now Jesus
Christ I'm so immature but yes so I'm
taking the money and just putting it
back into coding phase calm and just
like helping it growing and everything
that I do is surrounding this right you
know because at the end of the day I
don't know I'm thinking about setting up
like a media company like that's the
goals like setting up a media company
setting up you know something that takes
all the skills that I have you know
marketing web development you know
freaking
generating money all the things all the
skills that I have in being able to do
all this stuff and just you know somehow
start hiring people you know cuz I can't
do all this stuff like right now I'm
doing a lot people don't see it man but
I'm doing a lot man
like people think like somebody sent me
an email the other day is like hey Joe
they shootin answered my email I show on
a video that you looked at the you
looked at cuz I guess you know sometimes
I put the screen and you can see what's
on my email
he's like you've read my email and you
ting answer answered me back and this
and that I was like bro I can't answer
every single email like I have to go in
and order you gonna say like after going
order I can't skip people like I read it
and then I said okay imma come back to
it you gotta say it's late bro like I
can't be answered
yeah I'll tell you true for Blanca you
to me is like the worst place to be
honest with you you to me takes your
course unless you like Stephen Greiner
unless you like cold steel is now worth
it I'll be honest I put it my some of my
courses on there because just so people
could find me in there and say hey man
go check out coding phase calm but you
to me is like the worst mace because you
gotta understand when affiliate or let's
say an affiliate takes your link right
to your course and he shares it right
your course course only $10 all right
after a cool $10 or $12 whatever right
he gets I think like 25-30 percent of it
right then you to me guess another 25 30
percent of it at the end of the day or
like 50 percent I don't even know
exactly how they break it down I just
know that from every ten dollars I'll be
getting like three dollars all right so
they say is free hosting is this isn't
that I don't know man like I rather I'd
rather go into teaching wimpy teachable
and then say okay
her mum's like currently right now I'm
paying like a hundred something per
month for the hosting and then from
there whatever is from there I have to I
think is like 3% to so the credit cards
and stripe and stuff like that sometimes
three point something so PayPal and then
the rest is just like profit and then
remember half of that almost half of it
is gonna go to taxes so it's like you
know what I mean when you break that
down from like you to meet you like hey
man if you're making $3 you're really
gonna make a dollar fifty cents from
like after taxes so it's like it's kind
of ridiculous
Joe should we learn the new gold course
before or after advanced CSS sass I will
say I'm gonna put it right right
after right after the JavaScript course
because you gotta know JavaScript to be
able to to take the the gulp course like
you gotta understand like if if you
don't take JavaScript you're not gonna
be able to understand it so be a man so
let me see what's good Joe is there any
particular reason you use Linux for
building a grant project oh that was
just because I was just trying it out I
wanted to show people like how easy it
is just using Linux and you know create
your project and it's actually so much
better than Windows but yeah I wanted to
show you guys this - I forgot I totally
forgot about this we was talking about
so many different topics I wanted to
show you guys for those of you that are
members of the website if you guys want
to follow along with me basically a
Craigslist clone is live kids is not
complete I'm building it as we go so if
you want to follow along if you're
already there a whole bunch of courses
or if you did the react course and you
say hey man I want to continue learning
more react come through this course with
me and you're gonna have a lot of fun
okay because you're gonna learn how to
basically work with react router you're
gonna learn how to deal with routing
with nodejs
and yeah that's what we got right now
you know the whole website
final product should look something very
similar to to this okay there's the
other side let me see so this is the
homepage I changed it around a little
bit because I didn't like this to go
from like left and right so what I did I
say hey I'm gonna put it inside of a
container and ya still gotta make it
responsive at the end so it's like
there's gonna be a lot of stuff that
you're gonna learn from here you're
gonna learn how to work with CSS grids
how to work with Flex boxes how to work
with react router how to work with react
if you still haven't got really used to
working with react go check this out man
is on the website if you are a member
you already have it okay so if you go to
coding phase comm I haven't added this
yet I haven't added this yet to the
courses here I'm gonna add it today but
all you have to do is pretty much go to
the members area and you're going to see
it here learn react by building a
Craigslist clone alright if you remember
guys listen there's no other website out
there like mine I'm being honest like
I'm seeing a lot of people I looked at
the competition I looked at what other
companies have there's no other website
out there that is following a timeline
like mines and teaching you everything
that you learn from the previous project
gets shown on the next project like you
like reinforcing everything that you
learn so it's not like you know when you
go to you to meet you buy a course from
you to me you learn one project right
and the project that's previous before
that has nothing to do with the one that
you're doing now and if you go to
Pluralsight is the same thing every
instructor is teaching something
completely different sometimes you might
take a plural site one of the reasons
why I hate on it
because it's like somebody might be
teaching react beginning a react course
and then the intermediate react course
is completely different than how the
person who was seeking in the beginners
course so it's like totally different it
confuses you but yeah and ting treehouse
like always it's always behind there's
like they have a lot of cool stuff there
but it's just behind on things plus is
like $30 per month you got on saying
like here you if you use the link in the
description you get in it for $10 per
month
I know people who even guy you know for
$5 from like the very first people that
signed up back in or what was it August
or July
back in July 2017 they still paying five
bucks right freaking the people who came
in for the New Year special right people
paid 65 percent off so for 65 percent
huh people got it for seven bucks a
month like there's people paying that
you know I know some people that signing
up now they pissed like man I'm paying
ten I'm losing out on five I'm losing
down to whatever guys those are like
special sales that I do once in a while
I'm also gonna do another one pretty
soon I don't know when when I guess
imagine a major holiday I don't know
what Labor Day or something like that
when the next major holiday comes up
I'll do a major sale you know but for
literally ten bucks guys you can't go
wrong man somebody sent me a message
like hey man can I do this you know can
I get it for cheaper I'm like bro like
like this this is the idea of like some
people's like bro you you're not gonna
be able to profit in this world when
you're trying to take like you know the
cheapest route right
like I'm literally putting this stuff
like giving it away like go to other
people's channels go to other guys who
create courses guys who are literally
sending one course one style for 500
like go look it up like is not me
this was Brad hussy warehouse he teaches
one thing in charges $200 $200 for one
course and I love the guy but you know
what I mean like was this other guy's
name its Anthony on us and I forgot his
own name some I forgot
another guy he's like a angular guru he
only teaches angular he charges like
$200 for the whole course just for
angular alone I'm pretty much teaching
everything are you coming into the
website and learn everything about web
development for literally like 10 bucks
like you know how crazy that is
like I don't know man but at the same
time I know how people are you know yeah
man yeah
those people you know you can't doesn't
think man like if you had a four five
man I told people from the beginning
like this is nothing that I'm doing just
for one day
there's like four ever guys like I'm
bringing in you know game development
I'm bringing in machine learning I'm
bringing in everything about web
development I'm bringing in mobile
development right I have another friend
of mine who's also setting up just right
now as we speak
setting up the whole curriculum for an
iOS um course that we're coming out with
right so you're pretty much for five
bucks you could have been good you know
what I'm saying what I tell people is a
sale you sign up man you're gonna be
good I'm not trying to become a
millionaire of this thing this is my
gift to you guys just for supporting you
know what I mean like this is the
kumbaya stage you know what I'm saying
like ten years from now you know
people's gonna come back and be like oh
yeah man I used to have this thing for
five bucks now is fifty I don't know how
much is gonna be ten years from now you
gonna say there's gonna be so much
courses and so much stuff on the website
like it wouldn't make sense to be having
it at five ten bucks right if we have
let's say for example two hundred
courses do you guys think like for ten
bucks is gonna be worth it it's not
gonna be worth it at that point right so
prices is gonna change but whoever
signed up already that's your price
forever you know what I'm saying so yeah
man
you just gotta you gotta really go in
there man I'm trying to
help people out man but come on man
don't be like hey okay okay can I get
this foot you know can I get this or
cheaper name what it is like come on bro
like and then the dude was paying seven
bucks like this this is where I want to
pull up pull out my last little hands
that I have from the side just like just
