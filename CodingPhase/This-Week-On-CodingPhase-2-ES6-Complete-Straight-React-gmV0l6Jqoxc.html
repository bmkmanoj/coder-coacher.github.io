coding face.com your boys back out and
did it again alright guys listen this
week in coding freeze comm what have I
been up to alright pretty much you know
I've been here knocking things out
knockin videos out for you guys you know
we updated the timeline basically we
finish the terminal we finished what
else we finished we finished the es6
right so although the es6 videos are
complete right and then from there we
jumped right onto the react course guys
I know a lot of people been waiting for
this so I was like you know what let me
just get it out the way
cuz I know a lot of people have been
asking for it and like you know what Joe
go ahead give us the five projects and
what better way than to do it with react
right just to make sure that you get
hired guys that's the whole plan so
pretty much I spent the first half of
the week working on the introduction to
react a very simple tutorial a very
simple way for you to understand it in
just plain words right showing you
step-by-step on how to basically start
with react and I didn't go really too
deep into this introduction because I
wanted to have you guys go deep but on
the project's themselves right so you
can understand what's the process of
building web applications alright and
also basically all the skills that I
have and how I work at my job right and
the things that are people are basically
expecting from you right so that's what
I've been up to basically you know set
up our project did that you know got
that lay down let me see what else let
me mute the let me meet this for you
guys basically we got the project I
start from the header right now
I finished the header we laid down the
HTML basically breaking down everything
into components you know which is pretty
cool because a lot of people they think
that you have to code in HTML CSS first
and then jump in to react and it's like
no you can start building your page
directly from react you don't have to go
in coding HTML and CSS first and then
jump to or react now you could do that
straight in JavaScript right like in JSX
like that's the beauty of reactors like
you're not doing something that's
completely different you're like oh I'm
gonna go and start making an HTML CSS
and then I'm gonna convert it to
JavaScript and then to the JSX know you
do everything from scratch
with react right so that's the beauty of
it so what I did was basically this week
we I basically just went in did the
header right so the header is already
done alright now we did the header broke
this down into basically the header
that's one component then this area is
one component and then inside of this
component there's two components which
are the filters and then the listings
and then what's crazy I also broke it
down into more components so pretty much
you have this here that's a component
right this right here is a component
this whole area right here is a
component the pagination is a component
all right and then from there the footer
is pretty much static so that's gonna be
a separate component which we're gonna
call footer right so that's what I bring
up to man right now if you guys want to
see exactly to what part were up to
right now
I'll show you somewhere here let me see
where's the project give you guys
exactly a preview where we at currently
so let me see how things local host 3000
okay this will react so we got the logo
we got the menu
we got the button on top now it's about
breaking everything off like this how I
do my things I pretty much go in and I
lay everything down HTML all right JSX
right and then from there I give it the
styles so it's pretty easy it's an easy
way to learn then from there I do a
final retouch to the CSS where I come in
and make everything nice and nice and
clean but at first it's just pretty much
laying everything down to see how I you
know how I'm gonna lay down the
components and then from there we go
into the logic which is probably like
the second part of the whole the whole
project right but right now we just
building things up man that's what I'm
telling you guys right you guys should
definitely check this out a lot of
people are sending me emails telling me
like they enjoying this they really
didn't think that react was gonna be
this easy and I'm like yeah man is
pretty easy like you know what I mean
like I have everything already set up
for you guys you don't have to worry
about gulp you don't have to worry about
wet pack so you're pretty much hitting
the ground running learning the
framework first and then learning all
the other stuff that you know takes a
little while to build you know like you
know either gulp you could use fuse box
you could use webpack you know whatever
you want
alright I was talking to this kid I
forgot his name
I think Felipe or something like that he
was telling me Oh Joe why didn't you do
this in wet pack in you know you could
have just done everything in what
packing this a video that I'm building
about it like why I don't use webpack to
do everything for me like I like the
idea of having control of basically of
my tasks with go you know everybody has
their own workflow right
me I'm a coke guy I'm kind of switching
up to a fuse box which is gonna be a new
tutorial that I'm gonna do for you guys
on that's gonna be another free tutorial
because it's pretty easy and it's pretty
legit so I want you guys to learn that
be
for everybody start jumping on it you
know me I'm the guy that comes in tells
you about something before everybody
starts jumping on it but it sound that
they jump on it I'm like oh that's all
for me you know what I mean
like I already been doing it alright
it's like hyper app I was looking at a
couple of how you call is like blogs and
I'm like man everybody's talking about
hyper app now I'm like I've been talking
about this I've been doing this already
you know what I mean like one of the
first people online with tutorials on
hyper at right we still not done with

a remote job so I'm basically giving you
guys that and yet man so that's what's
up on this week on coding phase dot
comment I'll see you guys later man I
love you guys listen make sure you
subscribe me show you like this video
man and come to the website coding
phrase that kind of register guys this
guy this thing is for you nice man like
this is not for nobody else this is for

could come here leave a comment I'll
help you out you know you got Desmond's
he has some issue basically I told her
like yo just send me the information if
I can't figure it out from here what I
would do is basically I'm gonna tell him
like you know send me an email directly
send me the image of what exactly is the
the issue that you have in from what I'm
seeing here can I find module gulps ass
all you have to do is install gulps ass
I know it sounds crazy but that's pretty
much probably it right now of course
it's probably some Windows error you
know is which is why I tell people man
you got a jump on either Linux or Mac
guys like I swear to God when it comes
to to development guys you have to
always do like a hoop you got a do a 360
flip in the air to make things work on
Windows when on Macs in Linux you get
that by just having the system like this
tools are made for Unix right
most of the systems are you know the NPM
yarn all of this stuff are really made
for for UNIX systems all right and it's
like you're simulating you simulating
the server right the servers are not run
on Windows unless you have like a dotnet
server but nobody runs that you know
what I mean you got to go Daddy nobody
has a dotnet server right you go to
whatever the you know ocean all of these
systems are basically built on on Linux
you go to Amazon Web AWS they all on
Linux guys so it's like you know I don't
know what else to tell you man that's
what I tell you guys Linux for Windows
right or if not man just go here look
bash Kubuntu cuz in realities though the
problems not window the problem is is
the the command line man you can't
you've pretty much like I don't know
it's like handicapped right the whole
system is messed up man
so it's like come here install this
windows subsystem for Linux
documentation install this man that's
all you really need
those guys are on Windows and you're
having trouble with we certain things
look it up online man YouTube it I don't
know you know what I mean like I can't I
can only help so much I don't have a
Windows computer I tried to stay away
from Windows computers basically but
everything that I do works for Windows
Linux and Mac it's just take a little
time guys so basically either
and so bash it boom - or pretty much
look it up on YouTube how to run node on
your Windows computer because I don't
have windows all right guys I love you
