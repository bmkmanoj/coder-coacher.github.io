fees.com your boy is backing I didn't
did it again doing a little live video
man there's just a message for everybody
man I really wish you were more
dedicated I'm talking to you this is for
everybody burn talking to you I wish you
were more dedicated to this man I wish
you you will really take this more
serious instead of hanging out with your
friends on Saturday you would just take
two months come chill with me on the
weekends do some tutorials either here
on youtube or on my website or you to me
or if you don't like the way I teach
fine do it with somebody else but I just
wish it was more dedicated I wish you
were creating more things I wish you
were building real projects now you know
just coming to YouTube just for the hell
of it you know
like I wish you you would just take this
more seriously because you want to
become a developer right don't you don't
you want to become a developer don't you
want to become somebody successful in
this world don't you want to change your
life like none of this stuff comes true
for free and I'm not talking about money
and I'm talking about the time you gotta
spend into this it's gonna take a while
but you have to do it for yourself
because nobody's gonna do it for you
nobody's gonna come here and give you
the secret code to become a developer
nobody is going to be able to give you
the cheat code if something takes five
hours nobody's gonna be able to give you
give you like a two-minute version of it
no one is going to be able to do that I
don't you know what I mean like so it's
up to you you have to do it you have to
really go hard man it's like right now
people ask me Joe why don't you put more
tutorials on your YouTube more free
tutorials there or give more advice or
talk about certain topics and it's like
why is now everybody's gonna do it it's
like right now I just released this
hyper app tutorial which pretty much I'm
telling you guys ahead of time like this
is the wave there's the new wave you
know how people got excited about react
a few years ago people got excited above
you literally hype rep is like the
latest thing out there and I'm not
saying hey you have to just jump on
every trend because you don't that's not
what you're supposed to do but if you're
a brand new developer
and you have no no knowledge of let's
say front-end frameworks
I mean wouldn't you want to do or at
least listen to about cope right so the
tutorial was about cope and at that time
I was using something called grunt
alright so in my head I was like oh I
already know I already know cope like I
already know girl why do I need to learn
cope why am I going to invest since it
is because all the things that I learned
in that tutorial
I still use
and that was something that at the time
I was like I don't need this I don't
think I need this all I need to learn is
HTML CSS but I learned it anyways
because I was like you know what I like
this guy on YouTube and I checked it out
you know YouTube is I really don't think
YouTube is supposed to be a place for
somebody to learn like full-on courses
on YouTube
I don't think YouTube is made for that I
think YouTube is made for smaller
tutorials like you know small tutorials
where people can learn from it
but it's not supposed to be like a full
course like I mean I don't see myself
watching 10 hours of of YouTube to watch
a course I don't see myself doing that
you know what I mean like I don't see
myself doing that I don't see a lot of
people doing that so when you see like
another youtuber drop like a course of
like I don't know 10 hours a
series of 10 hours most people don't
even watch it most people don't even
finish it because YouTube is not the
place for them out of let's say an
example out of 10,000 people only 500
are really going to finish it so that
means it's a very small percentage of
people who are actually going to finish
any project that be put on on YouTube
but I'm talking to you I'm talking to
you that really wants to become a
developer listen take advantage man take
advantage really bust your ass man
don't just be like oh I'm gonna
subscribe to a channel just to subscribe
like you should be wanting to do a
tutorial you should be wanting to bust
ass like if you're you have some free
time go ahead do it man you know I want
you guys to really learn this hyper app
this is like one of those things that is
ahead of his time man
plus it's gonna teach you a lot
jQuery is just like something that is
super simple super easy to do but could
I build full applications will be like
from scratch and know what the hell is
going on No
so that's what I'm telling you guys take
the back down but em out got some
new stuff if you really with me
trust me just do it
I'm not doing it for my fun I'm doing it
for you guys like you know what I'm I
create something it's not for me to just
be like oh you think I really want to
sit in front of a computer every record
a content like a tutorial for you guys
for my fun no it's not for me it's for
you guys so you guys could really
elevate your money and get to the next
level I'm not doing it for me you know
what I really wanna be doing right now
like I want to be building my own
projects and have fun play some ps4 you
know what I mean
so it's like if I'm not seeing you guys
wanted to you know interact or work work
with anything that I give you guys other
people who signed up for my website are
completely different that's a whole
different I'm not talking to you that
a little bit of this you know what I
mean like I'm doing this for you
guys the people that come to my game
old things already complete this like
for you guys Stefan and everything get
up there but it's like I feel like you
guys don't don't take advantage man
on my channel at 8,000 people a hundred
two hundred people get to actually do
the tutorials I don't think I don't
think that's a good number man what that
tells me is like there's eight thousand
people that like to see me talk here but
they don't want to put in the work man
and that really sucks because I don't
come to YouTube to talk and like
you know dabble Oh dad all day like it's
fun I don't want to say to help other
people but at the same time it's like
how can I help the people that don't
want to be helped
you know what I mean is like you I can't
help you if you don't want to help
yourself you know you have to take
advantage man I'm like I'm telling you
guys I'm like a glitch in the matrix you
know it's like a lot of people don't
even want to tell you how to get into
the industry because there's people who
in their head they're like oh we're the
smartest people in the world and this is
9 you know only a smart person should
learn how to code like that's dumb you
know what I mean like that's just sounds
so dumb there's a lot of people like
that I mean there's a lot of people that
have been doing like coming up and just
be like oh they act like they know
everything under the Sun and reality
they don't know you know it's like
I come here for you guys man I really I
really want you guys to take advantage
man I really want you guys to just like
come here pick my brain and it just like
you know leave comments send me email
send me messages take advantage man if I
if I would have found a channel like
mines when I was starting up man I would
have followed that light to the
line like everything I would whatever
the door would have been saying I would
have followed it because as you can see
I'm here for zero nonsense zero
like I'm just here to help you
guys you know what I mean so you gotta
take advantage that's on you
it's like that's all I tell people I'm
like young man if I would have found a
channel like this I would have been who
knows I would what how I would ever not
man there's people opportunity you know
you guys
would you help you out let's say
Medicaid are
I come home start answering email start
sending out
you know like I'm doing this it's
 free hey pro bono like you know
to me like I'm giving you everything I'm
giving you mad hours and you telling me
that you can't do one to tell you if I'm
showing it to you it's for a reason it's
not because I want to do it for myself
and like oh I want to be cool and create
a tutorial on this no I'm doing it
because you need it I don't need it I
already know this I'm the one that
 works on this field I'm
already successful at what I do
I want you to be successful I want you
to when you go to your next interview
and they actually hey what type of
projects do you have you don't go in
there with the same that
everybody else goes in this is gonna be
a hang and get a reactor view right then
I look at you oh yeah there's 30 other
 people doing the same all
right you want to come in with other
stuff something that makes you stand out
well you could be like oh this person he
has a full website he has a couple of
clients that he created websites for um
he also working on the latest framework
out there he's in the community he's
part of a community you know things like
that that goes a long way because
it shows people that you're really
wanting when I come here and do
something for you it's not for me it's
for you
like I don't get nothing like out of
this every time I drop a video you
know how much I make out of video $3 do
you think think do you think I'm gonna
you know come here spend a few hours
creating videos for you guys do you
think I'm doing it for me to get $3 per
video like that's how much I can $3 per
video I'm not here for this you know
what I'm here for helping you guys out
man and I feel like you guys not taking
advantage man I want you guys to really
go all out man
I've been here seven months seven eight
months and it's like you have to do it
you know I'm looking at everybody's
messages right now every comment and
it's like she's gotta go all out man you
got to start working man you the idea
that you think like is gonna happen
I don't know where it's not gonna happen
man
it's not gonna happen you gotta make it
happen
you can't leave things to the
destiny or the universe brings you oh
yeah man one day I'll be successful the
the universe is gonna give me something
good cuz I'm a good person no the
universe is gonna have you living under
a bridge like that's the truth there's a
lot of good people who are
homeless and just they up in
their life you know what I mean that's
saying not because they were bad but
because that's how the universe works
you know that's how the world works so
it's like you got to make it work for
you you gotta say hey if I really want
to go all out this year and so I already
spent seven months watching Joe right
watching Joe on YouTube I want to really
go all out and I want to have a
job beginning of 2018 if I already spend
a year on this I know a lot of you guys
who half a year in this almost almost a
year or whole year already and you're
telling me you haven't found a job
you're not doing the right things you're
not listening to what I'm telling you
you're not building anything
none of the tutorials I told you to
build you didn't get to do it no other
five projects I told you the restaurant
the real estate dumb a digital agency
the portfolio like you didn't build none
of those things and you know it you know
this like a iMac or this video the
wake-up call there's the wake-up call
for you guys man because I just like I
released this tutorial and I'm like man
there's 8,000 people that I know that
when I drop a video every
body watches and everybody checks it out
but this a large amount of people that
just don't do the work there's a large
amount of people that just don't watch a
video if it's a tutorial it's a large
amount of people that just not putting
in the work man it really sucks it
really sucks because I want you to be
successful I don't want to be here
talking to you I don't want to be
here on this car driving around or when
I come home in front of my computer just
to talk to you and be like hey guys
I'm living good hey guys I'm having a
great day hey guys I'm I'm doing this
and that I'm not here for them here for
you I'm here to help you because you're
supposed to be here you're supposed to
be doing what I'm doing right now you
get what I'm saying
like I'm not doing this for me it's
like right now I wanna go home
you know I want to do right now when I
go home I really want to eat some food
then from there I wanna jump on the
computer and build my own hyper app
 application release something
cool put it on coke pan put it on on
github get my name out there right
because that's what I really want to do
but you know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna
dumb it down and instead of doing that
I'm gonna create more tutorials for you
here on YouTube for you to take
advantage and it's only gonna be 50
views maybe 60 views that only a few
people are gonna watch it but it's like
I'm still giving you a chance for you to
get this man
I'm not when I tell you something and I
teach you saying it's not because I want
to do it for myself I want to do it for
you I want you to really get this
man there's really no point of you know
you being out here and thinking hey man
one of these days I'm gonna become a
developer one of these days I'm gonna do
this and that no man just do it
if I tell you do something do it I'm not
gonna tell you to do something for for
fun man
we're too old for this right now
you know what I mean like this is what I
call the wake up call there's the
wake-up call where you guys really gotta
bust your ass man I really don't want to
help you guys out man
it's not for me at all hmm like it's
it's fun it's fun sometimes you know
going YouTube and seeing a lot of people
that watch you and stuff like that but
the same time I'm like how many of the
people are watching me how many of them
are successful as developers alright not
that many they're getting there but I
want every single viewer that I have to
be successful
as a developer and then pass it down and
help out the next person and tell them
oh you know who helped me out three
years ago this guy who was online called
cotton face this guy named Joe he was
super cool super cool dude but motivated
me to get to become a developer that's
it that's all I really want all right so
I don't know man
you know I was like I'm not a guy who's
over here teaching you how to fight in
MMA
I'm not a guy teaching you how
how to make a million dollars
with zero percent down for real estate
I'm not a guy with a bunch of
Rolls Royces and a Ferrari and
Lamborghini with a shelf full of
books I'm not that guy I'm not a
multi-millionaire who has a whole bunch
of cameras following him of me talking
 to people and throwing at a
wall and basically whatever fits for
everybody everybody thinks all this
guy's a genius I'm not that guy I'm just
a regular dude who lives a very
comfortable life and I think more people
should live like this more people should
be successful more people should want to
learn how to code code is the future you
tell me
what you guys want to do I want to help
you love with I can't help you if you
don't help yourself
looks like I walk around with this
camera it's to record whenever I can and
that's for you guys you know that's why
older people that sign up to my website
I really appreciate it because it's not
even about the money is about the fact
that you guys are taking the initiative
I don't care if you you signed up for
one month and then you cancel the next
month
now you cancel that same instant I don't
mind I don't care about that why I care
about is to know that you came to the
website you got what you needed and you
learned and then you moved on alright
that's what I want you know because the
problem about here on YouTube is that
what I want to do I don't want to become
like a YouTube personality and be like
oh god it's like wherever I go people
will be like hey there goes coding face
nah man I'm here to like motivate people
get people to start working get people
to live a comfortable life and I like
live good
you see where I'm at I'm good kid you
know what I mean so I was like I want
you to do good man
that's all I'm saying yeah I wish
nothing but the best for you guys man
also I just want you guys to really do
the work I don't want you guys to just
let this opportunity go by cause I'll be
honest I don't know how long I'll be out
here I really don't know how long I'll
be out here I've been doing this one
seven eight months every day of video
you know one of these days I'm gonna get
burned out right now the day I get burnt
out I want people to say hey I learned
something from this guy but it's up to
you guys man it's up to you guys if you
took advantage while I was here you know
the day that I stopped doing YouTube I'm
just gonna delete the whole YouTube
account and you know all the videos are
gonna be gone but the people who
actually watched watched it and took
something out of it those are the real
winners you know
exactly there you go any for music then
from there you start teaching other
people you know I want you guys to
really do your thing man but take your
Vantage thank you antigen what you got
right now man that's why you know I'm
gonna continue doing my YouTube here but
like I said I just don't want to do lots
of Tori's I don't want to do anything on
YouTube because it's not worth it
people don't do the work which
discourages me because it's like when I
come in here and I'll do a video I could
do a video in five minutes this
takes it takes no brain cells out of me
to just come here and be like hey guys
what is your boy Joe dab hit him with it
right I just come in here and do that
I'm good and get a couple of thousand
views but that's not why I came here to
youtube I came here to help you guys out
man
that's why I don't want to I don't feel
like putting any more tutorials or talk
about anything on YouTube business it's
like it's not worth it it's like so many
hours and then people don't even
want to do more work so and then on top
of that YouTube already has the people
that they're gonna give you soon when it
comes to tutorials like no matter what
so you know I mean so I just want you
guys to take advantage man take
advantage while your boy is here right
now take your masters test you should be
learning all of this stuff it's gonna
change your life man
I guarantee it I wish you guys would I
would have seen my whole journey from
the beginning no of course not I
wouldn't know I would never get rid of
you I would never get rid of the website
that's that's what I'm telling you guys
I'm putting everything into the website
but I also wish the people that were
here you took us look the people that
are on my website those are the people
that really want to become developers
those are the people that really want to
go hard but then the people on YouTube
is people that they like me they like my
personality like what I talk about it
like will not for a little commentary
and that's great and I appreciate that
but at the same time and I wish
everybody really wanted to become
developers everybody really wanted to do
a change in their life you know I'm
still gonna do my all my tutorials going
straight to my website directly because
that's where the core audience is that
that's what the people that really want
to learn that's where they have you know
this courses are paid for this courses
are free you know what I mean like I
just want more people and more people to
get into this field man one more people
to really go hard
for years Detroit Buffalo don't worry
I'm good I'm not gonna delete anything
not anything anything I just wish you
you guys that don't get to you know take
advantage the ones that don't take
advantage so take advantage man all
right guys I'll see you guys later man
stay up I'm gonna do a couple of other
videos later on and yeah man you
everything no Cody face calm your boys
backing out and did it again I hope this
thing is a wake-up call for a lot of you
guys man really don't waste time and
right now you're probably like 25 24
next thing you're gonna do you're gonna
blink and you're gonna be 35 you're 35
and then you're gonna blink you're 45

good life out there there's people who
