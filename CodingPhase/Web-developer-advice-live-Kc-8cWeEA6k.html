what I would up your boy jose back at it
again man coding again working on coding
face calm we're getting pretty far
enough I might be able to not release
the first stage this week well maybe
tomorrow and I what I mean I just you
know want to keep you guys updated the
hell is this issue like always this
always going to be a problem in
basically encode shits crazy just a
little while ago that's why you gotta
use game man i've been using goodbye
keep forgetting to commit I
overrule something that I was working on
I'm right now and pissed man cuz
now I can't get the file back because it
happened so long ago happened probably
like two hours ago and it's like
see how it was lying on Alton okay yeah
man some receivables go with you guys
see what the hell is this error just
pissed me off right now okay background
line 222
oh right here should be fixed let me go
to the chiro see what the hell you guys
are too miss yall we live probably now I
didn't notice or even live right now
yeah man saves lives man up it's
really messed up because I had I mean it
wasn't that much but it was a good
section like and now I got a
recode it again oh man so yeah so this
one we got so far right now basically
you know you're gonna be able to click
on on this you know whatever channel you
guys create to be a react of the Python
could be anything out there right could
be the harry potter framework all right
you can go here click then from there
you know you can put in you could add
another blog you cool you know
link up video you coax a question and
everybody else could comment on it so
that's what channels is gonna be that's
what I've been working on the whole
thing getting all this stuff set up and
we're almost getting there man
definitely work yeah man step
straight oh yeah yeah so the section
that i might stop at was right here
where you actually you click post and
then it pops up right here and then you
question
to pick up a doable a blood to a link or
you do a question so know what
 is crazy because I lost that whole
section now going to recode it again so
matter of fact let's do this right now
yeah but we're going this thing
trickling all sections this channel
section for late sometimes out i'll also
say two o'clock so it's like five hours
man she's crazy man like you know when
you're building something it's like I
saying another video you know a small
project become such a large project at
the end and you don't notice them so you
start working it because all of this
stuff lucky you come here but oh this is
simple you're gonna hate this is just
like you know post okay cool well you
got to create the controllers for this
you got to create the migrations you got
to create where the images is going to
upload you got to style this page then
from there you got to create a
relationship so you got to have a
relationship between on the channels and
then the pose so pretty much what this
does it goes okay it goes channels and
then whatever is typed here is searches
older posts that are pretty much part of
this this channel for know right and
then you got to create all of this stuff
all right and then from there you gotta
have this a star system
so the star system is going to work by
basically every time you pull something
you get one point all right every time
you pull something got a point every
time you add a link you got a point
every time you you know ask the question
you got a point now every time that you
answer a question you get five points
and every time that you comment on
somebody else's thing you get another
five points so that's gonna be the
system so yeah something simple this
isn't gonna be no you know Stack
Overflow ways ok we we've given somebody
your rating system this is more
like k this this is going to show who's
more active pretty much the star system
is just to say hey be active in this
community is for you guys don't just
come you know don't come to a video and
then I hate i watch the video but then I
don't say nothing don't read the blogs
or somebody's blog and then don't say
nothing you know what I mean I just
leave her a comment leave something you
know because everybody is going to post
on here is going to take their time to
post something you know so the least you
could do is just to give back some
feedback you know what i mean so maybe
i'll fix up the the star system later on
and then the heart is always going to be
the heart there but the heart depends on
whatever you know whatever this is so if
somebody likes this the heart goes up so
the heart is basically just giving
people information of what this this our
topic is about like they people like get
the people i like it you know what I
mean now the stars is more about the
individual like how active is this
individual on the website and what else
what we gotta do I gotta start in style
this dates all right so let me continue
with this all right you know after low
while I'm a cold right now and a little
one will go back to the chat
we chill with you guys and answer some
questions if you guys want or I'm just
gonna talk which is I think not I
me let me see more what I hell is this
thing okay more brother ok so this

big
Chinchin tip tip to tip tip to all right
let's change this up a little bit more
all right this thing to work common BTN
oops that's all right now this two days
I'm gonna make a flow right
see what else should I do she'd be like
a little hover effect on back down then
I forgot what color Wednesdays
he's off let's see how that goes
okay so I didn't change color longer why
little over one Baumbach this thing
supposed to choose colors what up make
sure those things are compiled
see when this thing is live for some
reason starts going super slow I need to
get a new macbook I've been cheap lately
because since I'm trying to buy this
house I've been just trying to stack as
much as I can while I find the right
house because I keep hitting zillow keep
hitting on hotpads.com and finding the
right houses it's a challenge right
see what's go with you guys what you
guys is up to man Chim Chim Chim Chim
see we got Ritchie in here we got Aaron
and beta back at it again we got twice
and PB on we got Anthony we got hi to
all got Geoffrey we got Marquette we got
seen we got mad deal we got a few days
you will become what developer all right
it looks neat man on let me see what's
in here slim who else ma'am yes I use
man of course good old man you know
saves you from the headache of you know
dealing of like installing PHP in the
right version of PHP like man oh that's
one thing about me man I don't care
about the server I don't care about the
 language I don't care about how
to set something up all I want to do is
code you know what I mean that's why I
have Heroku late I use her real coup
because I all I have to do is code I
don't want to deal with servers I don't
want to deal with setting up the
deployment all this extra like yes
I could do it but when I'm calling stuff
in my free time man like I just wanna
 cold you know but yeah anyways
man with you guys is up to man
you
Oh are you on lunch were you working at
your boy Charles out here man your day I
mean I can't wait to finish this whole
website man dishes that will be so legit
like you know of course it's gonna be a
couple of finishing touches you know
once i get everything in there but man
I'm telling you oh and one thing like I
think by Monday I'm gonna let people
register so like I told you guys before
whoever gets to register now forever
forever forever forever well I register
in the first month and a half right from
the moment that I make the side able to
you know be able to register whoever
signs up is gonna get this little
thunder right there which means you like
a founder you're like one of the first
people that was there from the beginning
so automatically you're always gonna
have this council everything you know
what I mean like just because you will
stay it from the beginning like this
thing is about to blow up man like I'm
telling you guys I've done other
websites where i had half a million
views like a month half a million
subscribers and when I subscribers
unique visitors on the website and I the
way how promote things and I'll get it
things out there and the money that I
have now to actually put int and pay for
google adsense and pay for you know I
might even pay you no pay a little sign
to a Aaron beta and
krishan and paid a little sign into
 yeah other youtubers I'm gonna
came in like promote the
and I will pay you like it like
this like my exit plan guys like this
website is literally my exit plan from
the industry like nothing that I don't
want to work as a developer but there's
more to life than me sitting in front of
a computer 925 or
for somebody else especially when I
already did this for a long time and I
have so many other skills where I could
basically really shining and get
going you know what I mean like there's
no point for me to like I'm
going to prove anything working for any
company now like I'm not gonna prove
anything to them I'm not approve
anything to myself so now my next
challenge is this this is gonna be my
 business this is where I'm gonna
get this watched a really big
and then from there just make money off
the advertising and yeah that's it you
know like I'm not saying hey I'm gonna
become a millionaire tomorrow but man
this bout to blow the up like
you know like everything I do has been
like pretty successful the past few
years so now with this one like I've
done different different website stuff I
have a use equip site which generates
money by itself but I had an anime
website with generating money by itself
I have a phone applications out
there that just generate money by itself
now i'm getting to a point where I could
literally be like okay I'm not gonna
work and for nobody i'm just gonna work
for myself and work for my own products
that's the goal that's the goal for next
year so this whole year is just gotta be
grinding it out i'm still gonna continue
working in the company I work for I want
to finish the website that they have
that we're actually working on right now
I want to finish that project but then I
don't know if I'm gonna stay there for
another year you know what I mean like
it's gonna be a year this year so I
don't know what will be there for 23
years you know to me like I have to
reinvent myself like I've done the
developer thing I've done everything now
it's more about hey let's take this
to the next level do this you like a
business and you know like
I have a lot of ideas of things that I
want to do and that's why this website
so big for me because this is like my
exit plan man like I know what this
website could do just from everything
all the ideas that I have for it and all
the connections that I have in the way
how promote things and the fact that a
lot of you guys is definitely gonna
support me and this works is gonna be
free hello yeah name it uh-huh yeah
thank you song to door handle you did a
hangar done mmm okay Wow baba bhai yeah
man so this website is a hundred percent
free right this works is gonna be one
hundred percent free jizz people come in
here like I'm not planning on oh
hi coalition milk people out of their
money because I hated that
when I started making why I
started learning what development I
 hate it when I will go and be
like oh man I'm just trying to find the
right resources that's all I want I'm
not looking to be buying your
bull your book I don't want to
 go in if I can pay a hundred
dollars for your course like i
could pay for somebody's course if the
course is under thirty dollars but i'm
not paying anything above that i'm not
paying it because there's so much
content on the internet that it's like
it's not worth it you know what i mean
so this whole website is not about
 milking people because i
hate that this whole websites gonna
be like hey man advertisers you guys
want to advertise to you know our
developers and
because a lot of you guys is going to be
working in major companies so it's like
if you know a year from now you guys is
working at I don't know whatever XYZ
company right you guys see a commercial
on the website then from there you might
be like hey you know XYZ hosting got the
best hosting in the cloud or whatever
you know what I mean that's where I'm
gonna make my money where it's like okay
just from the ads when people
click on the adds here or if I put
videos like pre-roll videos I might put
like a pre-roll ad um stuff like that
but not charging people money and be
like oh game hey joined his
membership twenty dollars a
month for a chat room like it'll
make no sense you know what I mean like
as I look at him like I wouldn't pay for
 I'm gonna make people pay for
i wouldn't pay for you not i mean
like there's no point because there's so
much content on the internet the whole
idea of this is to basically just have a
community of people come in here and
just regularly you don't just talk about
 ask questions and just you know
share new new things that they might
find you know like that's the point of
the website is not to be like
hey join this website to get a
membership like no like you're a
douche bag when you delicious you know
amazing gotta fix this little thing yeah
man well anyway listen what you guys up
to
all right Oh cronies Cronus promise
without what I would up couldn't see you
looks pretty dope Thank You Man you know
hopefully the know you guys like the
website this this website is for you
guys you know websites for people that
is trying to get in the industry website
for people that just wanted you know
chat with other people that's trying to
get into the game or other developers
you know I mean so take a something
rather have someone tell me to create it
well yeah now I think the hardest thing
like if you guys see like when like the
other day I was coding something on this
website right that took me two hours and
that's because I'm actually thinking
about what I'm building for it thinking
about the design thinking about the code
thinking about the database that
takes mad long because you do it so many
 it's like there's only so much that
you could do by itself but when I'm at
work I already have everything there's a
list of things that I have to do so I
just go in there knock it out the way
get it done that's saying you know I
mean so it's easier to actually have
somebody build somebody else's product
because it's just easy you don't have to
think about it you just like okay then
you wanna a a blog here here's a
blog you want a chat room here's a chat
room you want a photo here's a
photo you want a API that connects to do
a Google API you wanna Matt
here's a map like you know little things
like that is easy to do but when you're
thinking about product you're like man
what was the goal of this product what
is it that every page has to look like
was the design was like the colors on
any there's so much to it that it takes
time you know
isn't it better to have four page in the
middle and an ad on the side side of it
or isn't this place home oh I don't know
I like the ad here I don't know if you
guys have any me guys you're more than
welcome to tell me whatever the hell you
think like there's a reason why I'm
building this thing live most people
create their website and then they show
it to people when it's launched you know
boy for me I'm here because I'm I want
to get your opinions to that you guys
are the target audience where this
website is mostly going to be targeted
to some so whatever advice you might
want to give me or anything you let me
down let me know sorry I'm like
hard for me to talk is a tire my
 tongue hurts did another
video i did a video of i did three
videos a crystal lane which were pretty
 good they're gonna drop this
week but as you could see talking on the
in front of a camera for you know 30
minutes each video makes it
tongue tire and you dry counting
down the days that I gotta work toward a
new job don't worry that is around
the corner you're gonna be fine which
one's better game developer web
developer i don't know i have another
bing a game developer so i wouldn't
being able to tell you if i'm gonna
freelance on the side probably you know
 somebody comes in and you know like
one of my clients that I hate could you
add something to the websites that we
already built for you then yeah I'm
gonna I'm gonna fix it you know or like
let's say an example like a new client
comes in is I think you build me a web
site for my business then yeah it's like
okay they got three dollars
dollars four thousand dollars thing yeah
I build it Henry Vasquez damn you sound
like me and every other dominica hell
yeah madman you know what once the
miniguns is crazy i was at work right
and there's like two girls who work like
a customer service and they started
talking and I was like wait they
Dominican and then I started hearing the
little accident I'm a up they Dominican
I was like okay there's something
mannequins in here you know what I mean
I there's almost no Dominicans in the
what development industry like there's
no Dominicans trust me I I look
man I'm out here I'm looking for
Dominicans I'm like you dominican you're
not dominican okay cool but but that's
how viaje you know i mean like there's
no Dominicans I'm like one on one of the
few i'm just watching myself over here
i'm like yeah probably think like yeah
 crazy and this and that but you
know it's funny man I'm gonna talk about
this yeah because this is
hilarious some do left me a comment
right and I was it I just od'd on the
guy I'm a deleted because it was just a
little bit too much but whatever the guy
he goes like why do you always do
strange phrase for your thumbnails all
right just wondering is this some kind
of joke or you're trying to be
entertainer what kind of crowd do you
want to reach with this I don't think so
many people that is involved in coding
is very interested in this you do often
one our videos with one percent good
information and the rest just
took honestly ok man if that kid was
raring for me that guy could I know who
it is I know it's some nerdy ass guy
like you know some guy in his
basement playing Dungeons and
Dragons and
you know with a stick up his ass hasn't
had a girlfriend in a long time you
don't know how that tastes let's
just leave it at that right so let's be
honest there is this type of group of
people that take this so seriously
like man calm the down this is
youtube if I wanted to become you know
if I wanted to become like super
like I don't know i don't i don't want
to say the words that i want to say but
if i wanted to be like super
uptight about this i would just
make videos will be like hey hey my name
is whatever whatever and you
know i'm like let's say John
summits all right John Solomon sees a
good guy right but his videos are to me
they're very dry like I can't see I
can't see his personality the guy is not
really like kinda himself is more like
he's selling something selling up
portraying something to the people and
to me that's just not me you know I mean
or I'm not making tutorials on every
 video that I do here because
this is YouTube when I come when
it comes to YouTube I consider myself a
youtuber right when I my work I'm a
developer I'm a whole different person
I'm over able to you know with
the button down shirt I don't be
doing all this magic me go to the
meanings and be like yo what else shot
jjjj your boy jose out here doing
meetings without balling like i'm not
i'm not going to go in there like that
come on so this is youtube for me when I
watch a lot of youtubers I get bored
especially when it comes to web
development so it's like what did I do
with this channel I made something was
like hey I'm just gonna talk to them
like I talk to my boys hey you know what
I mean like that's just what it is if
we're looking for educational
 like there's a million
channels for that like
I don't think I half of this channel
classified as educational you know what
I mean like this is just a YouTube
channel this is not some where it's
supposed to be I'm teaching
people I don't know so
crazy course about what development or
whatever like I'm giving you guys my
personal views are certain a lot of
times I don't even give you my complete
personal views because then I'm just
telling you guys what to do you know
what I mean I I'm giving you like a
general information but giving you
resources giving you the right resources
so you don't waste it time and like
things that I see online that be like
hey man this is you know I mean
like be prefer be be was that I said man
there was a video that I did be
responsible with your kid up stars right
just saying be responsible
because you're giving starts to
people that have shitty projects that
are not even done yet and there's like
they build it up hype behind it it's
like view Jas everyday
somebody goes and gives view Jas because
they read a article and they
give it a start my you they still
working with react they still working
with Agilent it's still working with a
whole bunch of different technologies
but they give you jes a start just
because they saw on the block and that
are all cool i'll come back to it and
then give it a star so people are giving
stars to a frameworks and libraries just
because they're using it like a
bookmark when they created the star
system it was a way to give it give
different libraries and projects are
ranking on github and people
have been using that as a
bookmark so now it inflates the numbers
of people that are actually using it and
then people be like oh but you know
 50,000 people
symp you jealous and then you you figure
it then you look online or job
boards and indeed calm and whatever and
then you see that view Jas is
not even five percent not even three
percent of the industry's using it so
people are just giving it stars
just to give it stars you know I mean so
that's why I made that video but in
general like people not
understand it is just a YouTube channel
man this is now I'm not here to be
educational and like I'm not here to be
you know you dis a lot of that you
could get out of my my experience and be
like man like the PHP video I talked
about how everybody used to say PHP is
shaped PHP is dying when I started so
what happened I basically became just a
front end guy for three years right I
didn't touch the back end because I was
like oh man like we're going to touch it
PHP is dead oh there's a lot of jobs for
JavaScript and then I learned node but
then the jobs for nodejs they're
not hiring you they're not hiring you as
a brand new developer like you have to
have experience like you're not just
gonna show up and but I hey guys i have
three months of a experience in
javascript hire me as an oj s developer
right when there's guys who have been
doing JavaScript for 10 years
you know that means from now you're
competing with those guys PHP is like a
super open industry right now why
because a lot of people are jumping out
of it so for you who is a new developer
is good that people are leaving it
because companies still using it so now
developers are leaving it that I ok I
want to work on some time but working on
PHP for the last 10 years okay you've
been working on PSP for the last 10
years you want to work on whatever the
 Harry Potter a framework right
you want to jump on that so cool now you
jump on the Harry Potter
framework you leave PHP alone now for a
brand new developer that company still
needs it needs a developer for that
position so now we're going to look for
developers for the brand new ones new
developers junior developers that's what
you guys get to shiner yeah I get to
come in and with a hey man I know PHP
like it's great if you could get a job
in OG guess you could get a job a ruby
on browse you could get a job in
whatever language that you like cool but
if I tell you this industry
needs developers every day and
there's like there's not enough people
to do the job they're constantly hiring
hire people from overseas
because nobody here in the US wants to
work on PHP because most people online
say is and in reality it's
just another programming
language you know what I mean that's all
I'm saying like I'm giving you guys the
easy route i'm giving you the rate the
real rap the route that's gonna get you
out there like you don't let up you
 listening to this guy's tell you
don't learn this don't learn that don't
learn this isn't that if there's nothing
proof like if this proof that
says hey man there's no jobs for PHP
i'll be like man don't learn
this but if I'm telling you there's
more jobs of PHP then all the other
programming languages combined don't you
think that if they need they need so
many people to work on PHP don't you
think that you as a brand new developer
have more chance of getting in right
away with just two three months of
experience at your house that's why I I
preach here and it's like hey I want you
guys to get it I don't want you guys to
be like me when I was studying this
I took like a few months and then on top
of that I was like I wasn't even secure
about myself I was like man I don't know
if I go to this interview I don't know
if they're gonna ask me some dumb I
don't know that at out I didn't go to an
interview for a year and I already know
how to cope I was just building website
it's on my own for like small clients or
you know small businesses like that but
when I went to a company I was
like man I could have been working here
for you know for three months already
you know what I mean for the since I was
three months in I could have been
working there and then I could be making
even more money those first three years
as as a developer because I would have
been doing back and work that's another
thing that you guys don't know if you
are back in developer you get paint mode
you get more money more money in your
pocket ten to fifteen dollars and
sometimes even twenty to twenty-five
thousand dollars more than a front-end
developer because the front end
developer is just a one-trick pony they
have to give you a PSD and then you
create that and then sometimes you mess
around with something like react and
connect to our API that's it that's your
job but when your back-end developer
you're able to work throughout the whole
website so if somebody does a senior
back-end developer there you're gonna be
able to come in and he's going to be
okay cool now I have an extra hang
whenever I need to work on something I
could give him somewhere to from the
back end and we could build this website
like this but when you're just a
one-trick pony you know you know this
JavaScript and I'm saying that that's
that's wrong but you need to learn the
back end to be a developer because you
could be a front-end developer and just
knowing the front you could be a
back-end developer just know in the back
end but to get that title which is
something that I hold dear and I
 put it up there and this why
tell people just because you have three
months in a boot camp does not mean
you're a developer like this
 it takes time people who have gone
to boot camps they understand what I'm
saying they understand that you know
even after you graduate this allowed to
say that you still have to learn so it's
like you have to give the people that
hold that title developer some type of
respect when I came in I gave people
 oh they're respect on my
ok this person's been around for

5 10 years you know I given the respect
they know more than me you know I mean
but now I was like man somebody comes in
but I they stick some together
stamp that up here it boy go to the
world and call yourself a developer
you're not a developer you until
you have two projects to prove it
because when you go to this job
interviews unless you have either a
connection in or you know somebody or
basically um you know you've met
somebody from the meetup or stuff like
that where it's like it makes you more
likable to get the job if you don't have
those things if it if you're Joe smoke
and you just try to be like hey man I'm
gonna learn how to become a developer in
my house in and I'm just gonna learn
this stuff on my own if you don't have
the time and you don't put in the time
into this thing you gotta give that
some respect and be like man I'm not
really a developer until I have the
projects to prove it you know what I
mean like and that's how you gotta think
you could not come into you could get
hired tomorrow yeah you could get hired
but you can't be like in your head and
think like oh man i'm a
developer now and it's like you don't
know the front it or you don't
know the back end you're not a
developer you can't build a whole
website by yourself you're not a
developer yet you're a front-end
developer for your back-end developer or
you're a junior front end or you're a
junior back in that's in you know back
in the days if you guys don't know about
this and look it up before they broke
things down and I think that was wrong
for them to break down and be like
okay you just focus on the front end you
just focus on the back end back in the
days there used to be something called
webmaster if you look it up to all the
websites people you should be cold wet
mess when you a webmaster is the same
thing as a web developer you're pretty
much doing everything on a website you
could tell them deployment you could go
into the front
back-end deal with the databases deal
with problems that happen throughout you
know your page and pretty much
that's when you're really a developer
right now going back to the
 comment why I went into this
little rent is pretty much guys this
channel I'm here to just give you guys
advice on that has happened to me
I'll that I see people go through
because it's like I'm just somebody in
the industry you know what I mean a lot
of these guys they don't even
share like this guy here is one of
those people I know people that are in
the industry and then I can you tell
them my young man how did you know how
to do this and they'd be like oh no no
you know I went to school and this is
this and that whatever but they don't
 tell you that they went to this
website and they learn they didn't tell
you that hey I'm most of the time I
searched on stack overflow or hey I did
this and this like they're not gonna
 tell you because they try to
close this thing in there's a group of
 nerds who are pretty much trying
to block everybody else to come into the
industry when you're just a
regular person like let's say you're you
know let's say an example your your name
is Nadine rent your Nadine right you're
this girl from whatever from Oklahoma
write your name is Nadine you will
 you graduated from high school
you went to two-year college from there
you got married you had a kid now you
divorce with your husband I am giving
you a little background there's just an
average woman right Irish girl right
this guys they wouldn't want
that person to get it just because she's
not part of like the club of like the
 nerdy kids that were in
AP class or the nerdy kids doing
calculating and this and I like bro like
 your regular people anybody could

it's more about just you know putting
the time into it a lot of these people
do want normal people to get
into the I swear to god they don't
want people to get into it because it's
like a Sikh it's like they wanted to be
like a secret Club was like oh man this
is just for the Nerds this is for the
guys that are already in love with this
this code and it's like man this is just
a career man people are
seeing just trying to get their
life together and be able to feed their
family why the are you trying to
stop them you know what i mean so that's
where I come in them like you know what
I just want to show people that a
regular guy I regular person could do
this thing can be successful and just
motivate you guys to basically continue
coding and learning to code that's it
and that goes to the whole rant and
that's it but yeah so when this guy
comes in like you do whole thing one our
videos with one percent of good
information and the rest is just
 talk honestly buddy like I
don't know you got a read one
this video like two three times
everything I just dropped right now was
 gems I wish somebody would have
told me this when I was
started you know what I mean like stop
thinking like oh my god you got a
 loved to Koh so much that this
 is not a religion man it's
it's a job people want to get
into the industry and they want to be
able to feed their family why are you
worried about who gets in why are you
worried about who who's over
here on YouTube making a video about
code like stop being so worried
about this man it's just a
job right you nerd like you know
what I mean I don't know man like I'm
just being honest I and that was a
 massive rent that I just went
into but anyway let me see what you guys
are too
anywhere else will go home talk that
 jump some people think yeah they
don't take so seriously where and
I'm just diving through the office and
 like people really think like I
just I just come into the office like
how you doing boss dad like I'm not
coming in there like that man like this
is YouTube I come here to have fun and
chill with you guys like come on settle
down should I learn what the way I'm
gonna learn development object to see
man is up to you guys if you want to
learn what development whatever let me
out to me is easier to get into and once
you like learn programming from that's a
lot into I want to go into another wage
Iraq but what development is good
because you can learn this quick
and then from there start getting paid
for your work you know like you could go
in there and just become a web developer
and start making money man when even
without I didn't apply to jobs right I
was doing freelance work I was getting
like 2,000 3,000 dollars here and there
you know off craigslist which I could
still do if I wanted to but I don't you
know what i mean so and it was cool it's
like not a lot of the other careers like
you know application developer or you
know software developer like this not
opportunities like that where you're
gonna find people in the street or like
in small businesses that hey could you
 build me a nap when you tell
people like you want to build them a pin
in like you tell her how much it's gonna
cost and how long is going to take
people get scared now if you're going
but i hate you want a website i could
build you something quick that I lie or
whatever they're gonna cool here's the
first thousand dollars for you to go you
know stop get started that's it now you
got money in your pocket
and in reality you don't even know how
to you call that much but
everything you can googly as you
basically learn as you getting paid
that's what I do and also that's why I
like what development let me see what
else what else since when could you
lashing on YouTube damn bro where you
been it's been a while but you it's been
a few years since you could go live on
YouTube and it's a my friend got a
back-end def job after three months of
programming yeah it's easy you could get
in I'm still learning lerigot what to
know or to know together work just be
able to build this thing just be able to
build anything to anybody throws at you
that's when you know you're good
if somebody tells me hey Joe build me a
 search admit I can go and build
it they tell me hey Joe build me a
social network I could go ahead and
build it they'll be like hey Joe build
me a ecommerce store a store i
could sell sneakers i could go and build
it for them that's when you know when
you're ready you know it's like
you could get hired before you know all
those things but once you know those
things you it's like you've walking
around with a trophy on top of
them that's like hey I got this
trophy I already mastered everything you
know what I mean like you walk your with
this trophy you know so yeah man
just keep growing and keep making
 ah you know keep making
websites you're gonna be good
whatever without without yeah that's
that's what I like to I like teaching
too yeah man I'm just here i'll just get
spit some knowledge man share my
experience sharing what i have and let
me sleep what should I name this thing
what should I name this this video imma
call it web developer going on Iraq
dropping gems yeah man when I make a
larval series I mean this if you guys
wanna mess around an hour ago there's a
lower caste calm Oh check it out
yeah yeah man start building real
websites man like you guys don't you
don't know man if you get stuck in this
cycle the cycle of just hey I'm Maxine
treehouse every day and I'm just
following the instructions that's not
how to teach you anything if you fall
into this zone of like hey I'm a free
coke campaign all I'm doing is just
following with the videos what the
shows me whatever right if you fall into
that thing that's a trap I've
seen people that it takes them a whole
 year and they don't know how to
 call you'd only way you're gonna
learn how to code is by building things
so like you see this website right ok
this is YouTube how about you guys
recreate YouTube and say ok let's
recreate YouTube and let you say
ok there's a header right so you're
going to create everything from here
create this there's an input text field
there's a button this is icon this is an
icon there's a div with an image or you
could do it as an image and then put
border-radius fifty percent and it makes
it to a perfect circle so long ass is a
square right then here you will have
this thing you break it down you'll be
okay this there's a div there is another
visitor like Masseria h5 there is a h6
this is a div with a border around them
and then you do the same thing for every
single one and then you come here if you
use jQuery you say ok when you click
here something is going to pop up from
the left so what this is doing and say
okay you're going to create this into
unordered list so all of this is just a
bunch of unordered list right this is
one on order list on order list an
ordered list and then the reason why
this thing popped up to the side was
this thing has a margin of whatever the
size of the many ways
so it's pushing things from the left
matter of fact of padding sorry it has a
padding of like let's say 200 so you say
okay for this thing to move to the side
you make it at 200 rainy so you said
keep adding left 200 and then now you
have this thing pop out from the side
and that's it and that's how you break
down websites right you do that and
you're gonna be fine trust me guys man
any good you to me touch full hour ago
well I was saying I'm gonna tell you
which on my life
listen guys I love this guy as wendy is
but his videos are
hideous stay away from this video's man
this guy's he just I don't know the way
he explained is horrible
but let me see where is he
this guy Maximilian
let me see where is it modern web
development will flower about 5.2 like
this is a little bit older there's like
a year old a year to almost two years
old right but everything that you have
you know from this is the same that
you gotta learn anywhere else so if you
wanted to learn anything from all arable
I want to go to him here or Lara cast
now this is a day if you're good and
learning by following steps and like the
person explaining to you everything
that's on the website are on the
framework then i will say use Larry cast
but if you're a complete beginner and
you like the beginning stages of PHP use
this guy and that's it
yeah oh yeah man
yeah he's he's a Arnold man as wendy is
like man I can't talk
either I could imagine people be like
man this guy is Joe's voice man i can't
 listen to that guy in the
 Park castle I can't listen to
that guy in a tutorial and I
will understand it you know what i mean
but as Wendy years man he's now that bad
his courses good the problem is he's
always doing some dumb in the
videos like there's a whole bunch of
mistakes and he copes with a whole bunch
of mistakes that pisses me
off like imagine me charging you money
for our video that's full of mistakes
which means I didn't edit it I didn't
 fix it out by didn't plan the
 course right so now I'm making a
bunch of a mistake so it's like why my
pain is guy to teach a
whole bunch of mistakes because it's
like you be following it and they at the
end of the video even oh wait wait wait
wait I'm sorry I made a mistake all the
way in the beginning and like
now you're confusing like wait so does
 that he was teaching me for the
past 10 minutes was all a mistaken as I
care I think I made a mistake in the
beginning like come on now i use both of
them I used to depends on it I like to
use bootstrap for the the grade in that
same I guess you see here i'm using the
bootstrap grid but everything else on
coding in myself and like here i'm using
high quality i'm using flex boxes you
know one point might use everything flex
boxes but i'm not a hundred percent
comfortable with flex boxes on my
website because they're not armed hi
coalition you can use flex boxes for
every browser this all the browsers that
 it you put
on flex boxes and the Flag boxes
they up they up your whole
page oh yeah man she's looking good man
I am I continue this tomorrow I'm
getting tired I want to play some ps4 we
got ps4 guys add me on tracks add me on
the PSN network how much time does it
take to build a full technical side man
it takes a lot of hours man in a lot of
days
what do you mean border-radius page oh
you're talking about the generator this
this is an open two guys once you know
just how to edit things on CSS
that's it it's time for you guys to move
on to JavaScript all right
because there's no way that you guys are
going to you remember this whole
thing to be like okay how to change the
border top and border tablet is that
border top left ready is for pixel
you're not going to be able to remember
every single thing of CSS CSS is
 huge is humongous there's no way
that you're going to remember all of
this nobody does so that's why you
have ma you know border-radius
generators or you have CSS gradient
always use this whenever I'm
working with our radius you know not
gradient because it's like who the hell
is going to be able to remember all of
this lines you know what I mean
like there's no way that you're
gonna remember this off the
top of your head you're always gonna
have to go to the documentation and see
what the hell is going on
yeah man I'm out here doing this thing
like I'm grinding guys I'm building this
thing for you guys this is for everybody
man I'm just building like that I
was 10 like just like you guys I was one
of you guys where I was just like man
how the am I gonna get an idea like
can I get an idea to build a facebook
can I get an idea to build a netflix can
I get an idea to build a Twitter most of
the time you're not gonna get those
ideas right why because a lot of times
dumbshits have already been created
right so for me it's like I'm building
this thing where I see a problem i see a
problem in the industry ways like when
you have brand new developer you're
constantly looking for four different
resources so that's why I build this
thing so it's like hey you have channels
so like I said we are like no GS we get
to post here and get comments and then
read you know you're gonna have like so
blogs or whatever you're gonna have to
be able to share our links or YouTube's
you're going to be able to add questions
right now you also going to have stacks
so like necessary I use laravel i use
laravel HTML CSS i use react in
javascript right so those four or five
things that's my stack right my personal
stack so then i'm gonna be able to
create my own stacks and people are
gonna be able to vote on it in bed okay
I like this person stack I like what the
library said this guy you know mash
together to build projects so that's why
the stacks is going to be there and then
the community is going to be able to
choose which one are the best ones so
like let's say you have stacks right so
here is going to be different stacks
like mean stack Python stack laravel
stack and then let's say an example you
clicked on a stack it takes you to the
mean stack on the mean stack you're
going to have different skills in
every skill there's gotta be different
things that you got to learn so like
let's say for HTML so learn HTML is
going to be a HTML intro their section
typography navigation tables forms so
now once you master all those things now
you know HTML so you could check that
off on your list I mean okay now I know
this much from the stack right then from
there when you click on HTML intro is
gonna take you to video in the video
you're gonna have the top video for each
dome intro to HTML right so somebody
like let's say let's say Charles comes
to youtube and it's like he's like intro
to HTML all right he comes here he finds
this guy and he's like oh I like this
guy no you like the computer guy right
so he copies this link copies his name
comes here adds it to this list here and
then people when they click on the video
the video pops up the video pops up here
and and a pop-up right now I haven't
built it yet and then you watch the
video and then you can say okay this
video is good and then vote on it or you
could just literally go here but I oh I
like this one and then you vote on it
well whichever is the one that has the
most views the most likes basically
shows up on the top right so now the
community decides which is the best
video for intro to HTML so now as a
brand you know Brian your student of
trying to become a walk developer you're
not out here looking throughout the
whole internet like oh my god
where's the best laravel tutorial what's
the best of HTML tutorial what's the
best dissen that it's like the community
gets to choose which one is the best and
then of course if there's another one
that's better and people get to vote it
up I'll be on the top it's that simple
oh yeah so now you get the idea of what
I'm doing
yeah exactly
yeah there's a lot of designers in the
West Coast man yeah this a lot of route
a lot about model binding in here so a
lot of relationships in this
 website trust me yep i get the
same ads yeah man yeah so I'm saying
Douglas I'm trying to just I'm trying to
build something that there's a need for
it and that's the same thing for you
guys you know you guys like let's say
you guys live in an area where nobody
knows where it's the closest bowling
alley right so create a website where it
basically shows two people where's the
closest bowling alley because there's a
need for that people don't know where
that that's at so it's like that's what
I'm doing before I don't understand this
I don't understand how all these big
developers and create this amazing
products and it's like the idea behind
it is you gotta build something that
people are in need of like this I know
people are in need of like this free
cocaine freako camp is cool but people
are not voting and not deciding
which one is the best ones you know and
I don't know for me I feel like learning
from just reading texts because
you need somebody to explain it to you
and a lot of times it's better to just
you know man I don't with you
because of you if you know about
development the view is using something
that's a copy from react right it's
literally copying react right and then
on top of that is mixing all the shitty
 from angular right and then on top
of that is doing everything on one
 file as if we was back in the
days doing backbone that I find it to be
 right and then people are
switching to UJS because they don't want
to use compiling files right then I want
to use web pack then
use none of that shame or es6 so they're
using a view for it then okay I could
just put a view on the page and I don't
even have to compile it I don't have to
transpile it so then people are
using it for that but then if you want
to get the full features of view which
is view X which is a completely a
 ripoff of react then you have to
use transpire no matter what so as I why
the hell would I want to use
something which is just pretty much a
 copy of it especially when now
or react fiber is coming out in the next
few months exactly most companies is not
gonna that's another thing to guys using
view for your personal projects is great
but when you go to a major company you
get hired and you got a better hey guys
hey i work at you know it's like me
working at a Viacom and be like
hey guys I know we're working on this
website for MTV but can we add
view to this page they got a
look at me like I'm crazy they
gotta be like what the are you
talking about view JMS on a major web
site they're not gonna do it so
it's like you're learning
something that you won't be able to use
in real life environments so that's my
point of view on it yeah man I will see
you guys later I'm gonna play some
peaceful I'm tie my head hurts
I've been coding for like five hours and
I've been talking with you guys for
nine for one hour straight so um yeah
yes I love I love using the
you know this thing this
 I love using those words right they
just you know that they roll out the
tongue so perfectly alright guys so i'ma
see you guys later Wow
he got a little add a little and look at
all right guys oh by the way I almost
forgot by the way guys if you guys are
looking for courses make sure you go to
Coney face calm stop playing yourself
like i'm updating this thing and not
only am I gonna have to resources I'm
gonna have I have a connect I have a
connect that's gonna give me codes from
the apple store is gonna give me some
codes from a couple of good websites
that's gonna get you ten fifteen percent
off a lot of good products so this is
where I'm going to put all of that
and it's gonna be really updating also a
lot of people keep telling me man when I
click on this course is giving
me full price hey guys if you
listen to me like i always say I've been
telling you guys that if that happens to
you is because you already bought a
course before and there you have a
cookie that's following you around so
what you got to do is you go to the
website you click on it open it in
incognito mode incognito mode you get
that for ten dollars you never know
how to game the system guys you guys are
 developers man if you see some
 is wrong with the website you like
met Joe is Gary me a link to
this thing and supposed to give me a
discount but the shoe is coming up for
$175 on finishing in incognito mode
because there's something called cookies
guys whenever you go visit a website and
then I ok this person already bought a
course before and he does it he doesn't
deserve a discount you go ahead
this and you will I you and imma
get my discount cuz joking with
a leg no matter what so I'm
