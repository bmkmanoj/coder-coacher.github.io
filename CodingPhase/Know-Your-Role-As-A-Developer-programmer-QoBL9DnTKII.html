those good kids good morning woke up
late today
well there's okay because I'm staying
late I worked it's all right I'm super
tired turn this thing off put a seat
belt what's good 84
let me find that you wake up early son
what you doing up at this time
whoa
I'm going to see if I can set this up in
the right decision okay here man so this
morning we're going to talk about know
your role knowing your role bro like if
you are developer if you are a
programmer your software engineer if
you're whatever anything that has to do
with code you fill in the blank great
guys know your damn Road right so so
this guy left a messenger coming like oh
man why should we use dribble somebody
else's design and when we could just
make I won't website what do people care
about seeing our own website like the
reality of things is none of you guys
have had any training as far as like
design work typography color theory like
all of those things this one makes a
great website you know when people come
into your page they don't be like oh my
god this guy has an amazing code his
code is so efficient oh my god
everything is minified and ugly fighting
and this and that like no nobody go see
your page then looks at your Cokie what
they look at is the page itself if your
page looks like typography looks
like the design the spacing the
padding margins everything looks like
 then somebody's going to say oh
this website don't even work this
website's old this website is is not
good so for you guys who are basically
you know programmers logistic program
there so that will cover every type of
you know from front end back end so
engineering whatever it is if you're not
a designer you're not a UI designer you
don't have the qualifications to come in
and create your own page and I'm not
saying that you can't do it because yes
you can do it but you it takes time like
you can't expect for your your pages to
look amazing when you don't have no no
design background like you know I think
you go to a website and you black oh my
god I love the speech I love how
everything flows I love how everything
feels that's not the developer who does
that that's the designer in the UX Oh
person that you know wax designer UI
designer will does all of that so
that's what I'm saying
you know what I mean like you guys got
to know your role feel like feel like
bringing out the rock and break the rock
is here know your role jabroni like nah
but you know I love you guys but you
know sometimes even myself
like I actually have a communications
design degree have communications design
my background is in this
so my background is basically I could
have been a designer if I want I just
think this is kind of boring but I
create my own designs
I create my own things that I know you
know typography and or color day right
now I hope what to say so I'm not saying
like Oh God
once again Joe show it you know try to
find a course for UI design and see if
you cool level up your yes a lot of
people's website so a lot of people's
portfolios they don't look good at all
guys like I'm being honest your
portfolio's look like like I'm just
being honest like cultural AWA RDS calm
so it's like a awards calm
Goldin find inspiration for look at a
great designs look at what you know
different digital agencies are creating
so you could get inspired you can see
what good design looks like search for
portfolio so you can look what a great
portfolio looks like you know from real
developers real designers so you can get
an idea how your portfolio should look
like you know if your portfolio doesn't
look like that it doesn't look up to par
then you know your portfolio looks like
 it's that simple when it comes to
to web design there's no middle ground
there's no like oh it's okay it's like
it looks great boy it looks like
it's that simple
you know so I said the fella poor coder
programmer know your role like know your
role you know them well like what you're
good as a code if you're not going to
design understand that you're not good
at design so it's not going to hurt you
to go and dribble that kind of final
design that's great and then from there
take little pieces you know what I've
done so far like a lot
I go there and I find like four or five
different pages right that I like so am
I like the menu of one am I like the
accounting area of another one am I like
the mobile version of another one right
so I'll take all of those things
you
but bass
I won't bring it up create
but yeah like you guys should be
I love will feeling
you can't go in and tell people
Oh
then keeps cutting out Africa hate the
fact that I have horizon in Long Island
I thought this was going to be
great because I keep hearing horizon has
the best coverage in the world this and
that but it keeps cutting out
I am so
and I just want you guys today to
understand your role is at the front of
random heroes at developers to create
the fishing club create code that's
going to work code that has no bugs
you know so that's your job a job you
don't get paid to come open designs so
when you're creating your portfolio
you're creating your page the last thing
that you want to worry about is oh now I
gotta learn how to become a designer in
a slight go know your role
learn how to become a great developer it
designs from someone else anything I say
now if on your own time you say hey I
want to take a udemy course or UI design
that's great because it's not going to
hurt you it's gonna you know you know it
means it's going to make you better
developer because now you're going to
have more skills you're going to have
corn or design skills and you don't know
what things are supposed to look like
how spacing supposed to look everything
supposed to be a hierarchy from them you
know that's a Polish
right so
that's my video for this morning before
I go to work yeah man
just keeping it positive go sauce with
the sauce trick dripping water dripping
off the sauce right now kick handle with
the drip let me see what up man
and this is who's up right now 84 set
bro I'm up by 5 a.m. every day
mm-hmm work out cold get ready for work
all right and we find out you over here
trying to get diesel son
let me see love your sarcasm
damn Joakim came out with a leather belt
this morning I'm having the mimicking
mother childhood flashbacks Jones
illegal to copy a dribble design and
turn it into a website yes it's legal
now of course are you going to sell
those those designs as yours are you
going to create like let's say you're
creating a page for a client right you
can't copy the exact design that
somebody has you can look at somebody's
design and get ideas get a little bit
from hangar a little bit from her soon
as you start mixing it up your own way
then it's a whole completely website the
moment that you keep everything the same
the same typographic the same menu the
same logo the same everything that the
person created then yes you know if you
create a website and the website become
popular whatever or the client like
let's say you created a website for
coca-cola for example who knows if
that's going to happen you know but an
example you create a page for coca-cola
you stole the design from dribble now
that designer has the right to sue
coca-cola
so now coca-cola is going to
fire yes and it's going to get you in
trouble now in the industry that you're
going to be known as somebody who you
know got fired from coca-cola right so
now to say that
doesn't mean that you can't copy other
people's you can't copy other people's
code not other people's call other
people's designs no it does not mean
that because every single person copies
from everybody else somebody creates
something everybody follows that trend
and creates created their own way now
you just cannot copy the exact design
and resell it meaning like you can't
create you can go and dribble find the
design and then start selling it as a
template you can't sell it to people
so you can resell it basically now if
you want to sell it or you want to do
something with the design and you're
like oh I love the design then reach out
to the designer on dribble and tell them
hey man I wanna I want to buy your your
your design I want to buy your your logo
I want to buy whatever it is reach out
to them so legally you have everything
in order you could be oh yeah I reached
out to this person and I bought it from
them you know what I mean
yeah not 84 I did when it comes to to
the web which is something that kind of
sucks when it comes to the web people
copy each other all the time people go
in and copy from each other all the
 time even major companies copy
from other companies right right so you
can get sued for that but you can get
sued for is if you copy the exact same
code or you copy the exact same design
meaning you did not change it you did
not make it no alterations you didn't
make it your own so like let's say an
example I downloaded a PSD from from
dribble right if I downloaded PS
different dribble and then I reuse that
PSD to create my own website now when
the person has the right to sue me if I
go and I sell that design to a client
and we'll I hate I created this page and
now I'm putting my my logo on it that's
when you know I could get I could
definitely get sued you know but besides
that everybody copies from each other so
that's just how it is that's how it's
part of the industry where hey guys I'm
gonna see you guys lived up man I
 got to do some work I don't even
want to come here but it doesn't work
where it yo man I'll see you guys later
all right take care
84 holla at me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
