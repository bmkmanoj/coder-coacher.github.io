so yeah Dhanam is like yo I'm in here
I'm live man
so before we start talking about
interesting stuff let me give you guys a
little preview on what I've been working
on dum dum dum dum dum dum
yo today has been super fun man I really
do love for Donna's GS Donna's GS is an
extension from Ruby on Rails to
extension tool Arabelle so what they've
done is basically bringing all the good
stuff from Ruby on Rails and laravel and
brought it to no js' okay I don't know
if you remember like last year I was
into a diamond cas even before anybody
would know about this right this year
2018 map people's gonna be talking about
it
just remember remember who taught you
first
who taught you about adonis yes right
everybody was so Express I say I'm not
really into this because the problem
with expressing nodejs is the fact that
you have to build everything from
scratch right you have to go in there
and it's like they give you the tools
and then you have to build everything
for some people they might say hey
that's great you know what I mean I
could go in there that's like you know
somebody coming in and telling you hey
man here's a piece of Honda Civic
you know and go fixed it up you know
it's like you see those guys putting
freakin the hub caps on and put in the
freaking the rims making the doors go up
spending Matt time into it like man this
is legit man I could customize this I
already pay $400 for this thing right
but then again it's a Honda Civics the
1999 Honda Civic so no much no matter
how much money you put into it still a
1999 Honda Civic you
same and then comes the Ferrari you got
a saying you got the dhananjaya as the
Ferrari of noche yes like it has for
everything already built like I'm more
about building stuff I'm not into the
hey let's just spend 20 hours
customizing something like to our like
like I have an idea I have a project I
have something that I want to build I
have clients I have people that want me
to build something for them so then what
do I do I say Wooster the frameworks
that all for me everything that I need
as a developer without having to spend
time on building things from scratch and
there you go Adonis GS is the answer for
no G yes okay now Adonis GS is not super
wide popular yet because like I said you
know for you to really become popular in
this world of the web you need to
actually have people rallying behind you
meaning you gotta have a company a major
company to rally behind you it's not
just like you showing up you know how
many good frameworks or good libraries
people come up with and never see the
light of day it happens right
luckily Adonis GS is one of those
frameworks that is coming up a lot of
people are talking about it a lot of
people are using it on production sites
already and yeah so it's like I'm super
excited about it now
going back to the project so this is
where we up to right now I did I think
like six seven videos already and I'm
gonna share in the screen of where I'm
up to right now so this is the the
project itself okay so it's the social
media site so far this is where I'm up
to we basically finished everybody who's
following my my website and following me
as we built this this is where we at we
basically have the drop down section
here we have the side pages which are
going to be like groups
we're gonna have already done this is
already done which is like the search
area this is the notification not
notification this is the updates section
okay we finish the notifications we've
basically we laid down already the HTML
for the updates so the updates is gonna
look like this okay so that's how it's
gonna look
we're gonna have a messenger so people
can message each other you could have
multiple friends that you can follow and
then you can send them DMS you could be
like hey Maura what up you know be like
yo what you're doing MA or the girls
could be like yo what up pop or you
could be like what up MA I know whatever
you into ma whatever you into you gonna
save you're into that you into the wild
world a man vida loca
go ahead ma do what you got to do so
you're gonna have the messenger right
here on the side and it was cool about
this is that you know this is a floating
floating application for those of you
guys that don't know what a floating
application means it basically is an
application that floats so I'm gonna
show you right now so there's your
desktop on on like let's say a 1080p er
4k so pretty much we basically create
this floating application which is a
container around so it looks nice and
smooth it looks nice and clean it looks
as if you're landing on a page that has
an application open so that's how we
building this website alright and then
when we come here we make every our
responsive we're gonna make it
fullscreen okay so it's gonna be full
screen so like let's say this is the
size of a laptop is gonna be full screen
for the laptop and then of course from
desktop for
for tablets we're gonna change things
around and for mobile we're definitely
gonna change things around okay now for
desktop and larger screens like 4k or
the super wide screens then it's gonna
look like this okay so we're gonna have
a floating application cool now let's
keep it going
so yeah man yes I'm using a darkness on
this so this whole website is gonna be a
social media site that we are creating
from scratch
okay this is gonna teach you how to use
migrations this is gonna teach you how
to work with my sequel this is gonna
teach you how to work with WebSockets
okay with our nodejs you're gonna be
able to use certain power on separate
parts of this tutorial this course is
really a course you know it's a full
full project right basically is going to
have react I'm gonna bring in react into
this project so we could have two live
messenger showing up you know as people
log in as people like or log out or you
know notifications you can receive the
message the thing pops up shows your
message oh hey no Johnny you know you
got a DM soon as you log in
I wanted that if you have like a message
I wanna have two little you got mail you
know like we gotta make it nice and nice
and cool you gotta say like certain
legit certain legit that you can say oh
wow I built this now I know all these
different concepts so now if you have an
idea to build a social media write a
social media website now you're gonna be
able to know how to do all of this stuff
if you have an idea of creating any type
of business like let's say you have an
idea of the crew to create a service
right now you're gonna be able to know
how to break things down into sections
and beam okay I just finished my
user-centric a
now let's go here create the migrations
for my post and related to the users
like all the good things right so yes a
very complete project and it's super
easy I mean if you already know
JavaScript you you're gonna be at home
right you know it's up to the people to
decide what they want to do now I do
mention this all the time if you are a
junior developer you just getting into
the industry
I do recommend to learn PHP first okay
but listen if you're one of those people
that's like listening I just want to
learn nodejs which is thousands and
thousands and thousands of people
basically thousands and thousands of
people that show up on my channel and be
like I want to learn no J yes I don't
care if I if I need to do whatever I
want to do no J yes even if I could get
a job tomorrow in PHP I still wanna do
no js' okay cool so here's no J yes you
want to learn no js' yours no Jes you
want it no js' here's nodejs
alright so so you get what you wanted
okay everybody wins and I'm excited
because this is cool I was like you know
I haven't really done any more any like
advanced projects like this this is a
more advanced project like there's so
many different concepts that you're
gonna learn in this that you can take
from here to any other language you know
from programming in JavaScript to
learning to do it to PHP like all the
concepts that you learning here you
could drag it to other languages now if
you did the PHP 7 course or you're still
like halfway through it you can
definitely bring in all that knowledge
like you pretty much could skip like I
don't know like five sections of this
course because you already know that
like most of the things that I already
taught you in PHP are the things that
are in here already the only difference
is we're doing it with JavaScript
so you can pretty much go in there I
like you know do what Burke a always
does going here and putting on three
times speed you know what I mean so it's
up to you now Johnny flora flora Monde
says which one is better what I was just
at a meet-up some dude was on
PHP and said go learn Python that's the
problem with you know you need to ask
the person be like hey what exactly do
you mean by learn Python do you want me
to do
data science do you want me to do
machine learning do you want me to do
what exactly is it that you want me to
do if you're in the web your plan is to
be a web developer
okay quotes quotes web developer then
you want to study PHP okay if you want
to say hey I want to learn programming I
just want to learn the concepts Python
it's not bad to start with write Python
it's like Ruby is pretty easy to start
with okay but it's an old
general-purpose language which means you
could use them for anything now if
you're like somebody like me who says
hey man if I can learn all the concepts
with any language maybe just maybe I
might want to do something that gets me
a job as soon as possible and I'm not
competing with every other computer
science kid that's out there maybe
maybe that's the maybe face somebody
screenshot that watch them but somebody
put downs your icon that's the maybe
face like we don't know like I don't
live in the maybe I live on the hey man
I'm trying to get money I ain't trying
to be out here on a maybe I don't live
off or maybe I can't go to the bank and
be like hey sir do you do you have
enough money to pay off your bills
maybe you got he gonna say like can I
get a job maybe are there gonna be like
thousands and thousands and thousands
and thousands of college students going
for the same position that I'm going to
maybe now do you want to be under maybe
side or do you want to be on the I ain't
trying to play that side you know what I
mean oh man let's see do you ever draw
out the control flow for web
applications you built even before
creating code yes sometimes but I used
to do that but now I'm just like I
already know exactly what I want to
build like it's weird it's in my head is
like I already know it's like okay I got
it list I got to do migrations I gotta
set this up it's like all other stuff is
in my head already but yeah man yeah
there is a guy I forgot his name like
every time I do a crazy face he's like
yo that's my new white card you know
somebody somebody take the maybe face
you try to get a job next year maybe you
know let me so say that's on you
you gotta say so you try to have a job
next year maybe maybe I'll do it I
should do escape
um matter of fact I'm gonna do a skit
somewhere this week I'm gonna take my
time I'm gonna do a nice skit
it's like hey man oh you want to get a
job tomorrow you want to get paid fifty
thousand dollars minimum sixty thousand
maybe and some do is a why not because
PHP is dead so you're not gonna get no
money out here so you you planning on
staying your mom's career for the next
six months while you're still looking
for a job in and people calling you a 34
year old loser for staying home and not
doing nothing and you have no money in
your pocket your girlfriend says yo I
can't come to your house cuz you came
for Netflix so it's like I'm just saying
do you want to be though the maybe guy
it's like I'll throw it - I'll throw it
- luck I don't believe in luck you know
I know this luck out there but I don't
want to leave it to luck I don't want to
leave it to that that I ain't leaving it
to that top totty totty totty totty
totty totty totty I ain't leaving it to
her I say listen look your thought but I
ain't leaving this to you I'm gonna take
my destiny in my own hands you know I
mean that's what I do I don't know am I
wrong for that I am I am I wrong for
saying you know like hey man stop stop
leaving things for the maybe guy leave
that for them the maybe guy you know
what I mean the guys are saying he lives
his whole life is mainly you know I mean
like hey you was gonna play basketball
you was gonna be a basketball player you
think you think you could make it but
you're only four feet tall maybe I'll
make it maybe instead of doing something
with his life you know what I mean or
the guy died
you tell him hey man you could actually
get money out here and you know instead
of you looking like a loser in your
house on your basement your mom's
basement
and why he can't pass through you gotta
go to wife hees house because you came
in a Ford Netflix for six months you
know what I mean and she's coming
through and giving you bread and butter
you know what I mean like because you
decided to be them maybe I'll leave it
to I'm not gonna be the maybe guy so
it's up to you guys man yeah Jonnie
floor aman is like yo I'm just playing
Joe I know it was gonna get to this this
deep listen man we go deep man we go all
the way to the tippy top man that's how
deep we go you know I mean so ya need to
stop doing it I need to you know listen
I need to stop doing that somebody hold
his hand right the way every time I say
I'm going deep I gotta do this it's not
right you gotta say anybody that comes
in here will be like damn what type of
channel is this you gotta say so
anyways man is we're just joking we we
havin fun out here you're saying you
know we follow st. peach for for the
comedy you know she's she's a very funny
person now I made listen if you wanna
you can learn anything out there right
you can learn anything
the problem is what type of person you
are if you are the type of person that
you're in a situation where you want to
earn money then yeah like you need to
learn the things that's gonna get you
higher there's people out here that they
live for papi and mami you know it's
very easy to say I'm not gonna go and
take this WordPress job in and do this
and that yeah buddy cuz you live on papi
and mommies you know on the tit you know
what I mean
like you right there your mom got you
like this all day you get on saying but
when you're an adult and you're like yo
I got bills to pay
I'm already working so if I'm already
working and I'm gonna spend time
into this coating she like I'm gonna
spend time to actually get hired as soon
as possible so I could do a transfer
from my job to a beautiful job
something that's gonna pay me more money
than where I'm at if you're one of those
people then you can't live in that maybe
world
you're not saying now if you're a kid
from papi and mami well you could just
take risk and say hey MA hey mummy can I
kick it here I know I'm 29 years old but
you know now I want to do a career
change yeah I'm gonna move back in mommy
if you're one of those people then go
ahead you know freakin leave it to
destiny leave it to Lady Luck to see
when when she gonna get you that Python
job you're gonna say like that's just
being honest right
it's just it's not everybody that's
getting it and it's harder to get it you
know let me see yeah man everybody
behave PHP man it's like it's like the
cool thing to do you know you don't get
brownie points you know you don't get
medium claps I left them I love somebody
a comment on medium you remember when I
said man people are tired of libraries
and you know people are tired of
libraries coming in and showing you know
a new version every single week and
somebody was like oh it's because you
don't like this is the war on career for
you sir and this this and that I'm like
buddies I love learning new things I
just don't want to be relearning the
same that I learned yesterday
because some guy is looking to get some
github stars and a couple handclaps on
medium you get what I'm saying like you
could do that if you got time for that
and then you look at doing dude looks
like he hasn't seen the Sun in four or
five years you got a saying do looking
out here pale you know what I mean
looking crazy you know and it's like
yeah that's because y'all here
you trying to learn everything under the
Sun
I don't learn everything under the Sun I
skim through it I look at him okay cool
this is nice I like this concept I like
that concept I like this framework I
like that framework but I only learned
that things that's gonna put money in my
pocket things that's gonna help my you
know my value as a developer something
that's gonna say hey if I was building
applications and it took me five days to
build it then now with something like
let's say an example for a Dinah's Jas
right what you should take me a day two
days to set up everything from scratch
with Express I'm done with it I'm like I
do that in like two hours with Adonis GS
and I'm already set up
I could start building my application I
have an idea
I could start building instead of me
coming in and having to build something
from scratch and whatever you know what
I mean like that's something that I say
okay I'm gonna learn that that new
framework because it just it helps me
out it makes my life easier you know
something like webpack I don't know if
you guys have seen that web pack is like
that cancer of of JavaScript people keep
saying hey man we should just do
everything through web pack and I'm like
do you understand what you're asking
people you're asking people to jump over
a 500 feet wall the very first time and
they like it but I don't get easier
the next time you try to jump it's only
gonna be 400 like you gotta say that
people come in here and people be like
yo man it's 500 feet whoa you're gonna
jump over but don't worry next time
because you already did it one time the
next time is gonna be 400 feet it's
still 400 feet you know what I'm
saying like anyways man but yeah man we
out here we got 1.5 million views we're
chillin I'm gonna start making the the
link available for those of you guys I'm
gonna hang out with me come chill come
chill with your boy you know what I mean
yeah man
webpack is
the cancer of JavaScript man it's like
it's like I don't even know like it's
cool this this thing start is good but
the setup is it takes so long now
somebody might say hey man I only do it
one time and then from there I go and I
can just copy and paste it yes we all do
that right but the process is so
ridiculous that nobody god forbid you
wanted to build something and you have
to use webpack right from scratch and
then now we're talking about Babel our
see now we're talking about also to our
plugins now we're talking about loaders
now we're talking about rules now we're
talking about a whole bunch of stuff
that is like if I'm a junior developer
and I come in I'm like cool I want to
become a a junior developer and then I
see this 500 wall which is what has
happening to people they will a jump
over that just to become a developer and
it's like yeah because some guys he
thought that you know making things
complicated makes him look smart and
it's like great and now the industry is
following it thank you buddy
you get what I'm saying like it's
ridiculous man so yeah
let me see let me see let me see let me

I tried everything to like save you guys
money man you know Martin Contreras you
can just come in and come chill man
Tooley barber you're interested in the
Facebook clone the Facebook clone is
just the view right so the whole course
is about HTML CSS there's no back end
there's no logic behind it it's just
HTML CSS it's a way to get people
excited to learn how to code with HTML
and CSS build their first website okay
so yeah yeah man people
time's man shout out to Barbara she's in
here today haven't seen Barbara in a
minute
I said Barbara's notification
I think the PHP laravel course I put in
my hours into it
and I teach you like everything that you
need to start building applications on
that one so
definitely that one but I think this one
that I'm building right now my topic I
think this one my topic because this one
has a lot of cool things like we have
WebSockets we're have you know dealing
with migrations living with my sequel
dealing with database deploying like
there's so many things that we're gonna
have to do in this course like if you
think like you're gonna come in and just
do like one or two things this is like a
full-on full-on
application man this is not like we're
doing a couple of little things like
we're integrating everything that we've
learned so far
you know I'm even bringing in some react
hopefully people that they're watching
the course and haven't taken react they
they take it previously so I'm gonna put
them there are youkilis any in the
requirements to let people know like hey
man at least know something of react or
know some type of front-end framework or
something because sometimes people they
try to skip you know people will be
like yo they're not even good in
JavaScript yeah and they'd they want to
jump into something completely different
well I did never even did a front-end
framework and then they want to jump
into nodejs like no js' is really for
the people that have been doing this for
like at least a month you know you can't
just be like on your first day back cool
I'll just jump into nodejs is like nah
you gotta you gotta you know you know
you gotta give yourself some time man I
know you want to build a cool stuff but
you gotta give yourself some time man
project meant to be unfinished the last
video of the series left me puzzled
yes it's just is a free tutorial it's
like a free tutorial it's not a full
project again I'm saying it's just like
a free project like sometimes I'll do
like little free tutorials that I put on
YouTube or I put in you to me and then
it's just like a little taste right
you
yeah I was enjoying the - boy yeah man
if you enjoyed the dashboard man you're
gonna enjoy this man cuz this is like
really building a website that that's
what it's just a view like right now
what we have right now
like all of the stuff that I'm doing
right now let me show you all of this
stuff that I'm doing here this is the
view like I could do this quick like we
could do this in a couple of hours when
I finish everything of course if you
wanted to have it like this how it is
perfectly with the the gradients the the
different box shadows everything like
you have to take your time to perfect it
right and that's what I'm doing I'm
building everything taking my time but
this is just a view like this what the
user sees but he can't do anything
without no logic if there's no logic
this is just like an image you get what
I'm saying like this is just a
presentation thing and that's what the
dashboard is that's what the Facebook
clone is it's just a - it's just the
view it's just you learning how to build
something with HTML CSS now you're
really gonna be putting this website to
use you're gonna build it you know
something that you could login for the
people that were wondering about type
Lord you know he built this with nodejs
but he there's a full application this
is not some something that he just came
up with yeah maybe I'll do this I just
do the view it's like nah he has to go
in there put the logic for this he has
to put in the logic for basically for
tracking every single word as a person
types so there's like closest friend and
then if you make an error shows you
where you make an error if you try to
continue typing it doesn't let you until
you fix it like all of that is logic
guys so you know when you build
something HTML CSS that's just like the
view that's as if you was drawing
something on a piece of paper but just
because
draw it doesn't mean that it's a game
you get what I'm saying like you could
build something that's just an image and
I say
listen huh wonder how many people will
sign up if it was a dollar versus 10 and
how many will actually do the course at
one dollar group versus the ten dollar
group that's 100% true you're honest
you're doing a very good comment right
there Berkey remember I don't know
there's a lot of people that are
brand-new developers in and subscribers
here if you remember when I first came
in here all the type of videos that I'm
doing on my website I was doing them for
free on YouTube nobody was doing it
right the moment we said hey man we're
really putting in a lot of work into
this there's a value to that course
there's a value to those videos right
people say okay cool now we want to do
it it's crazy my website every time I
look there's at least 40 people in it
you know now of course I wanna sell
what dollar is like that would be like
slavery you guys know how many hours I
put into this like it takes a long time
to do this you know this time stop be
like oh I did a 20 minute video and then
with the editing and fixing things up
and and thinking about how the course is
gonna be it could easily be an hour and
a half just one 20 minute video yeah
exactly
yeah the the passive income the passive
income course is a pretty legit course
that's actually right now my top selling
course on udemy that's my number one
selling course on udemy Raina
people love that course um what I would
do is not even to a part two I would
just I'll add more content to it that's
another thing too when you remember to
the website a lot of people I don't know
if you guys notice it maybe people don't
notice it but I add new content to
different sections on the website it's
not just I'm doing the new courses I
forget about everything else
I'm constantly adding new stuff you know
like I'm still adding stuff to the
Craigslist clone like tomorrow the whole
day I'm doing about eight to ten hours
on working just on the Craigslist clone
today I spend about I think like four
hours on on the nodejs course I'm still
adding more stuff to the Ruby on Rails
course I have another project for the
Ruby on Rails because what we did on the
Ruby on Rails I told you guys the basics
and then now I'm adding another serious
project for Ruby on Rails so I'm still
adding more stuff to it you know even
the PHP of course I want to add more
things you know the thing is that I
wanna have a variety it was a variety
sorry variety of courses for everybody I
want to have the nodejs which is what
we're doing right now I have two two to
three courses on or react for the people
that want to just focus on they're on
the front end I have the PHP for the
guys that are looking for jobs and
looking to get in the game right now and
then I have Ruby on Rails for the guys
that's also trying to get a job as soon
as possible and then from there I'm
still gonna add more stuff to PHP like
we're still gonna add another section of
WordPress we haven't talked about that
yet are saying so
is definitely a lot of stuff that I'm
adding man let's see hey Joe your

but yeah pretty good no that's what's up
man
I mean I need to try one of those I
haven't tried it ever you need to get a
wrist pad I mean all my program and
friends occurred and friends they use
they're talking about all their you know
like ducky shine fives and there's that
you know sound like hey let me try it
out and actually it's pretty good man
you could type type faster you could
also make make mistakes faster like
anything else but yeah I got it I gotta
try it out man maybe I'll buy myself a
little mechanical key boy real quick and
plus it looks like a little like a
little disco of my house is turned off
the lights go crazy wouldn't hey you
know why so was good what you guys been
up to man
this week mad has been getting clients
and clients it's being so good man for
me god bless you know like I was like
going from like no work to like now I'm
swimming in it you know and it's like
you know I took the route I couldn't get
in programming when I was when I started
programming so I had a little bit of
digital marketing experience and I just
needed work so I took a digital
marketing job
it's caught on this fire you know I mean
the SEO AdWords you know having that you
know I'm looking into optimizing my
AdWords account with JavaScript you know
you could do scripts in there you know
and doing a lot of like you know
learning a lot of about WordPress you
know making custom themes and stuff like
that because I've had a couple clients
where you know we've had like e-commerce
solutions to WordPress and so forth like
live pricing based on a market or
something and a diamond I'm also have my
hand in the diamond builder but this is
mostly project management type thing I
don't I'm not coding it directly
I just code on the side like obvious
yeah cool cool cool I mean that's where
and that's where is that man as long as
you're making money you're you're able
to feed your family you know and have
some money saved up on the side you're
good make sure you got headphones win
make sure you have got headphones have
you come in put headphones on man but
yeah man so yeah god bless everything is
good and you know it's um you know I
really I really like what you're doing
you know push him you know like you know
that like I feel like we're the rejects
of our times gonna come you know I mean
all this hard work you know I feel I
feel like a lot of people you know even
like from other channels and all the
people like you know some guys I see
this on the comments people hit me up
like well it's like why are you
promoting this and there's like some
guys that might have like 300 thousand
subscribers they're saying to do this
other thing and it's like yeah buddy but
most of the people they don't take into
account your life meaning they don't
take into account your location they
don't take into account what you need
they basically giving advice or tell
people they hate go do this and that or
learn this framework or learn this
language because number one I like it
know
- is cool number three is a little
faster than the last one that was there
so it's like now instead of giving you
an advised as I hey man you trying to
get into the industry and you're trying
to get hired as soon as possible
the they're not really you know given
that advice that people need they given
the advice that they want you know what
I say like you said earlier with the
content you know right now I'm on up
work you know and I see all day long
content I need content I need content
because content drives SEO hmm you know
that's one way like you said that's one
way to just get into the industry you
know if you could type fast you book
reports you know that BAM you could do
blogs you know I mean like and you get
paid for it
the end man I think look like this
channel you know I named it I named it
coding phase because I wanted to do and
talk about coding but personally
thinking back at it I should have named
it like income face you know what I mean
like because that's why I'm here
you know I'm here for that income I'm
here to help people either get money on
the side and a side business either get
a job that's gonna pay them more money
you know to get to the point where I'm
at you know and to the point where you
are like you know I'm pretty sure a few
years ago it wasn't like this for you
know what I'm saying so that's how it
was for me like I told a story today
like you're I was freaking working at
our money exchanged got fired and ended
up in the freaking parking lot ended up
in the freakin parking lot you're gonna
say and that's the type of things that
happens in life so what you're gonna do
you're gonna you know cry about it or
you gonna do something about it you know
I don't know man people gotta have
different type of goals out here man
like working for let's say an example
working for Google should not be
everybody's goal because at the same
time it's like if everybody says man you
know let's say the guys that was working
for Google's I mean my dream is to go
work at Microsoft like you gotta sound
like they're not gonna do anything there
wouldn't be a Google here you know my
papa in a bad place their work yeah no
it's not but I'm saying like if is like
Mark Zuckerberg was like listen man I
want to go work out my space I want to
go work at a French stir I mean if he
thought like that there wouldn't be a
Facebook today so it's like people gotta
get that bug in their head of like hey
man this is a skill that can change your
life and you also have to make your own
decisions to me you cannot come in into
the industry and just follow what
everybody tells you because not every
every Road this is not like a cookie
cutter thing was that okay everybody
learn angular today and that's a that's
all you're gonna need there's gonna be
companies out there they're still using
backbone this is gotta be companies are
still gonna be using that a knockout you
know their company Durham Fortran
Fortran exactly so it's like or even
like oak was a COBOL a lot of the a lot
of the freaking banks are using like
crazy programming languages that you'll
be like wait what do using this and it's
like yeah you know like the past few
years a lot of people have been focused
a lot on JavaScript this JavaScript has
been exciting and it brings in something
new every week people are creating
something every single weekend thanks to
MPN which is really the the machine
behind everything because you can now
say hey I'm gonna just do a node and
then now I I have M p.m. on my computer
so now I have immense knowledge of
different libraries out there I could
just download in one second right before
I wasn't like that
so even with github and everything you
know I wasn't like that now through NPM
you could just download a whole bunch of
libraries and things that save you time
by for think about like those developers
that have been here for like 10 20 years
you know those guys is not looking at
every single thing that moves they were
looking at the things that make the to
make the needle move not what were like
people are saying oh this is hot right
now it's like nah that's it doesn't move
my company that's it
it doesn't move the business like I I
have to say I have I linked up you know
one thing I recommend that anybody
listening who's trying to get in you
know you got a network you know like
because eventually network you know you
become friends with some of them and
then you know little by little you know
you're gonna see in a year time so you
guys are probably gonna be working
together throwing work at each other you
know like you know you never know you
know so like I have friends that have
been in the game you know since 2001 you
know and like they'd they tell me
they're guiding me and I find a tri-five
family or whoever that you know and just
ask to make you know can I talk to you
once every six months or something once
every three months you know just to kind
of help me out you know a couple
questions yeah you know yeah so yeah you
know working with other people is always
good going to meetups a lot of times you
you gotta go to meetups to me with new
people that you would have never bumped
into you know what I mean like this guys
that I've met
I meet ups are even when I was working
in different companies that if I didn't
work at those companies or I didn't go
to that meet up I was never gonna bump
into those people you gotta say so
networking is very important to first
impressions always is good for a new
developer and you know I always respect
somebody who makes their own decisions
you know what I mean like there was a
company I worked for a short amount of
time because the the developer that he
was like the senior developer him and
two other guys created this advertising
company and from advertising they
basically created their own Google Ads
Network like they created like their own
ads Network where they sell ads to web
sites privately so and they will have
like major companies they they will have
things like I don't know it was about
exchange yeah I had exchanged like
out-brained how all that right so
this guy's they freaking they build the
from the ground up they were making like
10 million dollars between all three of
them and then they were hiring new
people and I was like one of the new
people
I got hire there and the dude the
everybody that worked there was super
nice and super cool but the kid who was
technical the guy who built the websites
to date all the technology stuff he was
just an asshole and their grandma's boy
oh no I was like so they were that main
programmer was the cabin after anyway
yeah I know you mean yes so so he was
just a UH a ho and I was like you know
what I don't want to be workin him but I
did respect him I still respect him
because he taught me something that
until this day I use it is like I make
my own decisions I can't be worrying
about what's out there and be like oh
just because everybody started giving
give up starts so something doesn't mean
that that thing is good because when you
start using it it doesn't fit to your
business model
it doesn't fit to your workflow it
doesn't fit to what you want to build
I'm more about building projects and
building applications and building
things for clients than me saying I just
want to use something that's cool like I
could care less if it's not cool exactly
a lot of times he's like heavy older
time programmers you know they're they
love programming so much their
programming this court BOTS
you know like on their downtime and
Kotlin or in you know a Haskell you know
or in rust you know like you know stuff
that they don't work with you know like
it's almost like I feel like with
programming and I started when I was 17
with visual basic 6.0 back in the day in
99 mm-hmm so like like you know and that
but that was a you know anyway I went
into the tree business I was in the tree
business for 15 years and I that's what
got me into this business because I've
seen the biggest dummies start them
start businesses and make them a lot of
money you know ain't hard to start a
business and that's why I realized you
know you could do that you know sir but
I'm just in the wrong industry yeah
then you realize that the dummies have
all the smartest guys working for them
and it's like and that's how it is is
because those guys they they tap into
something that these guys who are like
the geniuses the guys that could come up
with hey I just created our library that
save you two milliseconds and it's like
those guys are still working for a
company and sometimes you might see guys
are super brilliant and smart working
for you know a company stuck at the same
level never leave that company because
they're too scared they're like oh man I
don't know I remember this guy that I
met before another company he was like
man I'm a.net developer and that's what
I'm gonna be for ever and you know I've
been doing this for ten years almost 15
years on some crazy like that I was
like bro like you gotta expand your mind
to other things and then comes comes to
show like he was there for Man Lord and
he was stuck at 70,000 I went in there
on my first year I was making like 88
right which didn't make sense I'm like
how are you here for 10 years and you're
making less than me and it's like you
never jump to another company every time
that you jump to another company you get
paid more you know because they value
the skills that you're bringing in when
you come into a company let's say
there's a very good advice for all of
you guys are watching this if you are a
junior developer you go to a company and
you see that they don't give you no girl
raises meaning $5,000 and above after
your second year then you gotta get the
hell out of there that means you're
never gonna make anything that means
they already they already saw you and
they're like oh man he came in here as a
junior developer like he should be you
know all that he knows he learned it
through us that's how they think so as I
give they don't think like that they're
gonna have you under the wing forever
you know what I mean like when you could
have went to another company and with
the skills that you have make like a
hundred hundred twenty thousand dollars
why would you stay in a company trying
to be loyal to somebody that's not
lawyer to you you're insane so that
happens to to a lot of
and it's like also - is like if I'm if
I'm like super smart with you know
programming I'm really good I already
have a lot of experience what is the
point of staying in jesu and staying in
a company for 10 15 years went by in
that time you could if you were smart
that the money that you was earning you
could've opened up your own business you
could have done other things there was
another developer that I met that pretty
much he was like oh he's an OG he's like
one of those guys that was freaking
programming in the 70s or some like
that
he was like yeah we was programming our
freaking walkie-talkies for the
government and this and that I'm like
this guy was old he was like 60 65 he
was retired already but this guy he was
smart he came in he he basically he did
programming on his time right whatever
they pay him at that time but then he at
the same time he had another business he
had a boating business where he says hey
he buys boats resells them and then now
the guy is good you know and I remember
he was giving us like a talk on a
meet-up and he was like yeah just make
sure as a developer you know you you
have a lot of skills that not everybody
has that you can using other industries
in under and other businesses that later
on with the money that you made here and
if you do the right investments you can
move into other things you know you
don't have to stay working just for a
company forever and not everybody looks
at them be like oh that's good it's like
you got a frickin movement right anybody
got any topics for tonight man we're
here till 11 o'clock at night I love him
we calling this finito
let's talk about pricing want to talk
about pricing let's talk about all right
hold on let me see what problem yeah let
me see how let me see what people say in
the chat Joey you say that $100,000 you
were in the car
if you're making making that much money
but to wearing course 2,700 that's not
that much money just asking yes you are
completely right you know if somebody
comes in and they're paying twenty seven
hundred dollars a month then also too
that's therefore because they're idiots
you gotta say like look I myself I could
have stayed in New York right I'm
averaging about eighteen right now I'm
averaging per month eighteen right I
could have said hey i'ma stay in New
York when I was living at the same time
that I was living at and probably would
continue paying all my bills at the end
of the month was totaling up to $8,000
what did I say I say you know baby we
getting the hell out of here because I
want to do a sacrifice for the next 2-3
years to just save all my money and then
I'm gonna take it to the next level
right for me to take it to the next
level
I need $250,000 cash or more so I could
come in and tell a banker but I hate I
got this much money this how much I've
been doing I need a million dollars so I
could come in and now take it to an even
higher level right but if I was to stay
in New York and stay over there paying
at the same amount that I was paying for
the house and all the bills and
everything I wasn't gonna be able to
make that that that amount of money that
I want to make within three years you
know so what did I do
I moved over here to Connecticut I'm
only paying like $1400 here and I got a
big-ass house I'm chillin yes I live in
the woods yes I living in the mountains
but I love it I love the the fact that I
come outside I don't see nobody there's
a huge park right next to me this you
know I live above everybody I look at
everybody from up top to below I just
like okay everybody's below me you gotta
say it's a good feeling right in New
York I was living in a neighborhood
where you know like I was the bump of
the block you got I'm saying like I was
the bum of the block pretty much like
everyone you're broke if you're making a
hundred thousand yeah like exactly I was
a bum
there you gotta say like dudes is out
there you know I go to go get some
donuts and some bagels at the local
store guys is jumping in on Bentley's
giant guys is jumping in it's on the
under brand-new Tesla's right I'm not on
that game let me get to that game once
attached to that 35 that 40 mark I will
be at that game right but you have to do
sacrifices if you are a developer that
live in San Francisco right and you
could get paid the same amount in Austin
right go to Austin right you gotta save
more money you're gonna be able to do
more with your money if you just say hey
I want to live in a high-rise er in New
York City okay go pay $4,000 a month for
a studio just to say I live in in
Manhattan that's something that you do
when you're like 18 19 years old 20
years old around there and let's say you
you graduated from your school you went
to a major company you got picked up
whatever and then they like say they
tell you hey what do you wanna do you
want to live in Brooklyn or Queens or do
you want to live in a high-rise er and
you say oh yeah I'm just gonna get a
four thousand dollar apartment and rent
out all the other rules so two roommates
and then I'm gonna be there that's cool
were you young right when you're like a
2021
but when you're in an adult you gotta
have goals you gotta set go see yourself
unless you come in from papi and mami
with this money in your family then yeah
you don't splurge but if you're not you
have to be smart I see this all the time
from people that they they had gave
money now and they over paying for rent
the overpaying for cars they were paying
for everything I did that because you
know I thought I was in the tree game
you know I used to be a tree climber at
like for 7 years and then the other 7
years I did sales and management so I
used to manage 35 people and do sales
and so forth anyways like you know when
it went one year I was on my own you
know think I was like 26 25 and I made
around 1820 and one month but let me
tell you I didn't have kids you know
this is back in the day when
I was a little wild tree climber so like
you know that money flew you know I mean
like I don't want to say what I bought
because this is a family-friendly
Channel - hey but either a lot of Xboxes
either a lot of drinks you know for the
ladies you know I mean like dumb stuff
like that you know don't do my mistake
you know and you know save up that money
you know spend it on something that
assets that's something that's gonna
make you money not something like cars
and this that that's actually
depreciating in value you know so
definitely but my question for you since
I have somebody I've been meaning to ask
I mean because you know I'm having the
issue where you know a lot of times I'm
trying to bid on these jobs especially
like these but let's talk about small
little WordPress you know clients you
know first host they kind of suck in a
needy but still they're like the the
bread of the the I don't know there's
money to be had you know what I mean
yeah but like I'm feeling that when I
give my estimates like I don't know I
just I feel like I don't have to like
confidence to really be on a higher
level I mean but at the same time I
still want to offer them I feel like my
product it still would help them you
know I mean you know it almost feels
like you know when I shoot a price out
it's like how low can I go type thing
instead of you know like instead of
putting cushion on it well I think look
this what happens it also depends on
where you find in your clients right
look I worked in two digital agencies
before where one was like legit ain't
once was legit where you will get
clients where you have like you know
Nike you have catalogs you have stuff
like that those are big big contracts
right so there's two different worlds
it's that type of digital agency that
the smaller digital agency that serves
the smaller businesses you know the mom
and pops the new restaurant that just
opened around the corner
the exactly that in the world I mean yes
so the the thing about that is that you
gotta understand that's that's uh more
of a quantity game the more clients you
get the more cards you get the more
money that you make now in the other end
you see is more of the quality it's like
you get one solid client and that's all
you need all year round
right and then that's how you pay
yourself you pay the other developers so
if you do everything yourself right and
let's say I don't know Joe's pizzeria
hichy office oh cool you got you make
websites like we need a little website a
little mom-and-pop website here you know
nothing too fancy nothing too crazy
yeah you look at the business you look
at what type of business it is if
everything is brand new everything is
like Jay they got the new chairs they
got the you know the stuff where it's
like you know they making money they got
a couple of employees then you hit them
in the head then you'll be like ok
depending how much how much time it's
gonna take you to build it then you
could be like okay it's like twenty four
hundred three thousand if it's like
something super simple right now if or
even more depending on how's your game
like if you're respected in the
neighborhood you could get even more
money than that because I remember this
the agency that I used to work for that
was like a smaller agency they basically
charge people like five thousand dollars
like people that just open their
business like they don't even know if
they're gonna be here for the next six
months but they wanted a website but the
way how they used to do it is we used to
have a storefront so when people used to
pass by they'll be like Oh what do you
guys do here is that all weird did your
agency dah dah dah
check this out you could get things
printed you could get whatever and from
there is a more of interaction right and
then now also or we had day websites in
the community so people be like oh you
know Martha saw
a bakery down the block we built that so
now it's like okay those businesses like
oh yeah so he did this he did that he
did this he did that so now they wanna
work with you so now you could literally
be like listen we're actually busy we're
doing this in there we have too many
people so it's like it's gonna be $5,000
now if they don't want to take it and
then be like we can't do that right now
then you say okay so we will come back
to you when we are available and we'll
give you a smaller budget that you can
work with so then what you do is you put
it on hold for like two weeks and be
like Oh things opened up a slap opened
up but it's really no clients
it's just you didn't have nobody it's
just like now you give them that two
weeks I'll be like oh now we opened up
can you make 2,500 you gotta say I can
set that up on HubSpot and you gonna say
like yes I got video HubSpot you know
what I mean put it on the calendar real
quick yeah no I know what you mean the
follow-up phone call yeah so it's like
now you you hit him with that with that
 right luckily for me I know I
never was the one that that that worth
like the clients hands are cuz this a
project manager there's other people I
was just a developer right but I picked
up on everything when I was working in
any company I know every single move of
the whole company I know how much they
making and how much I'm making out of it
so like that when I come in I said I
want a raise or I wanna days off or I
want to do this and that I'm like yo I
just brought you ten thousand dollars
last week don't tell me nothing that's
the type of person that I am I like to
be on top of everything because if
you're now on top of everything I know
people that they you know they work at
companies for five ten years don't even
know how much the freaking company makes
a year like how are you there you know
what I mean like you don't know what's
the value that you're bringing into the
company you know it's like gone
this kid told me this my one of the
employees that used to work with me my
coworker he put me on to this game where
he's like hey
always keep track of everything that you
make for a company and see how much
money did you just make them you know
when you you go into a company you try
to you try to make them money as soon as
possible so like let's say you come in
and your back end developer you you go
in there
dating ax you for this but you just
go in there and you say okay you go you
go through the database you find out you
go through the thing but I okay put it
into charts put it through what say CSVs
you know work around with the data
whatever
put it through freakin a graph then you
realize you're like oh wait you guys are
losing money on this item you I keep
promoting this item this item never
sells but its other item is the one that
you guys need to be focusing on and yeah
I don't do promotion on this item now
when they promote that item they make
mad money right so now they come back to
you and blame oh wow Joe what else do
you know what else can you help us out
wait you're gonna say so now you're
bringing you bring your value to the
company right and that's what I try to
do when I go to any company I just try
to bring in that value and just try to
make them as much money as possible so
like that so like that you you could be
a valuable person you know if you come
in late one day what the hell they're
gonna tell you you're the guy making in
the money bringing in the money you know
what I mean like that's just how it is
yeah yet the ground up that's what I did
yeah but you know the in somebody says
mom's mom and pop says my cousin knows a
guy he can do a wordpress site for 350
yeah there's people that could do
websites for $50 you gonna say hey let
those guys out they're starving you know
what I mean but that doesn't mean that
you have to go at those levels because
the you gotta put it out there you gotta
be like listen man this person is gonna
copy and paste your whole website he has
one thing that just copies in piece your
website is not customized you
clients is gonna notice it and the
quality is gonna be very low your images
you saw them straight up your images is
not even gonna be looking good this
person doesn't even know anything what
they're doing in there you go.you that's
what you gotta fight you know 350 and
what happens is these people buy these
solution is cheap you know they say yes
these cheap estimates and then later on
they get stuck with this product that
they're like this isn't working it's not
converting clients and then they have to
spend a lot of money on fixing at all
yeah I think the best the you know
agencies are the ones that have really
good designers and really good content
editors you know because sometimes you
you might have a good product but if
it's not presented properly then it
won't be able to sell you know you gotta
make a website look like a million bucks
if unless exactly what I'm telling my
friends like we're gonna start a
collective you know it's a group of us
you know a lot of my bosses you know
stuff I'm getting people who have more
experience than I do you know and like
I'm pretty much gonna make them you know
like it's our every a collective is you
know where everyone owns a part of the
business you know so we I have a friend
on up work since he's getting rising
talent he's getting work up the wazoo
and I'm helping him out with it you know
so we're pretty much gonna be a network
and I just found a graphic designer
thank the Lord because like you said you
know you have to make the website your
presentation first impression all of it
has to be match and all of it has to be
three hundred percent yeah yeah yeah and
then you can say alright you know X
corporation you know my proposal twenty
grand
mmm and y'all so let's give us a chance
for everybody else is getting here man
if you guys have questions you guys got
other topics you got Donovan Louise you
guys want to jump in listen jump in man
don't have to just wait until we shut up
how's it going Joe I'm good good good
good let's go with you I lunch manage is
happy to make it make the stream I've
been working pretty hard at a new job so
I was gonna actually well how's your job
going you're still doing the net over
there how is it yeah I'm just going
pretty well I'm not really doing that
Ned to actually got another guy for that
I'm more doing the angular stops okay
how's it going it's going pretty well
it's going pretty well it's just
learning a lot um I've found out that
the stack that we're kind of using this
mean so you know me just trying to like
get in and learn you know the mean stack
I'm coming from more of a lamp stack
personally so getting used to mean I'm
working with Mongo and things like that
so it's going pretty well just I'm
learning a lot and I'm pretty excited to
be you know learning so now does happen
you know that's good that you you gained
the exposure to to the mean stack I mean
what angular you guys using angular 1 to
angular 2 plus whatever we're using to
and up and thank God we are because I
try to learn angularjs on my own and I
just can they just didn't stick with me
it was really hard to learn and I think
the reason why is because I bought a
udemy course on angularjs and I don't
know if it was just the the shorter was
bad or I was just not feeling it you
know but I just had a bad experience
with angularjs mm-hmm when I hopped into
angular 2 it just everything just came
to me with you know switch with the
angular CLI with components and services
and observables and things like that
just all of that just clicked with me
this was so fun yeah so uh real quick
Joe those wanted to let you know I'm
working on a side project with angular
I'm working on his web app that once I
get done I want you to be able to review
it I was one to say that real yeah
definitely send it to me man I want to
see everybody's
applications whatever application you
got out there let me know let me know I
also got like an application I'm working
with what a friend of Mines if any you
know once it's done you know I'm
definitely gonna have a lot of you guys
go in there and just like pick at it and
see what you guys think we want to do
like a startup like a music startup
where I don't know it's like a mixture
of like worldstar with with like
Instagram but for artists like I don't
know if that makes sense
it's just like being able to give the
power to two artists to be able to show
up like in the front page like a lot of
times you go to websites like worldstar
or even YouTube or whatever and to get
to the front page and get to the
exposure you have to pay people right
you have to either be like oh I gotta
pay for advertising or I gotta pay $700
to be on a big page and worldstar
whatever so we was thinking is like how
about we give the power to the people
you know what I'm saying like people get
to decide who who goes to the top every
single day so something like that you
know but we definitely gonna bring that
up later on and when you have your
project send it to me for sure and
absolutely definitely I'll be able to
I'll send it to you once it's done so
yeah let me see how about you Luis Luis
you still there
lise anybody anybody want to jump in the
livestream come on guys man get hype yo
Louise a live stream for your a big
milestone man yeah when you hear Luis
the same time so I'm like here but not
here
not at school that's cool man so um what
you working on you working on something
personal or like work yeah I could I can
like share my screen looks like share my
screen this is this little application
here so like I just wanted to create
like JSON like add a song API and you
can kind of like create the response by
clicking on images so like to say you
want to get like 10 images of cats or or
anything just like just look for them in
here let's look for card it's a quick
card so now you get like 10 cars and
then you can just click on them and ask
them to your like JSON collection I
guess mm-hmm and now you're gonna get
like an endpoint and whenever you have
that endpoint you're gonna get the
images that you selected so that's a
little thing I've been working on it's
like a little project I've been doing
cuz I gotta learn mo Bex now for for my
work so this is kind of like my like
learning tutorial I guess mm-hmm and
that's cool man that's hot right screen
not as hard that's not man that's I mean
that's how you learn man every time that
I wanted to learn something new I just
start building an application in like
bumping into the headaches of like how
to do something so like that you know at
the end I'll get exactly the results
that I want
yes so I come from Chrome like using
Rita I've been using it for a long time
and now for like the new company that
I'm working for they they're using low
backs and I've been trying it out and
it's it's so easy and like you know like
read okie got a bread like a ton of
boilerplate and with mobic so it's just
like super easy that's hot
I haven't tried molbeck so now you got
me interested to even give it a try I
just thought I was like man this is
gonna be like some clone Redux clone but
is it good is it like is it worth
checking out yeah it's definitely worth
checking out like like I wouldn't
like really big projects but maybe if
you gotta do something simple mm-hmm you
can just like throw babak's in there and
it'll automatically like rerender your
page you know like have you used redux
before like I'm pretty sure you yeah
well you know there's like a lot of
boilerplate you got set up like you
gotta create your actions and then you
gotta like dispatcher like the connector
is like all this that you got
to do yeah I'm like what mo buxie just
you just change the value directly and
you don't got a dispatch anything cuz
like all these valleys are being
observed and whenever you change it your
application just rebrand yourself it's
pretty easy to build stuff fast that way
yeah that's why I like the Hyksos that's
why I really liked hyper app because
hyper app the framework itself it's
already built it's like having Redux
already built in to the framework so
that's why I like hyper app so much but
yeah if the if it's simpler than the
Redux I could definitely check it out
because one of the things that I hate
about Redux is like you say you got a
dispatch they gotta go from one function
that goes to another function that
passes to another function to get to
this to the state that the state is
gonna change and it has to be immutable
so you have to create a new wait yeah
yeah like is a headache is definitely
annoying so I know if there's something
better out there I can't imagine I
wouldn't say better it's just different
and I honestly didn't give it a chance
because at work I use it and you know
like that's kind of like the hype these
days like oh you got East Redux with
reaction honey and that's what you hear
like everywhere and you see all these
tutorials then I mean there's actually
like other stuff out there that's it's
pretty good as well like try not make
sense I'm liking it so far
yeah mobile says it seems pretty cool I
seem like a talker body
that was like this girl asking people
like Oh which one is better
three ducks or Omo bags I think that uh
I think are you talking about the prithi
girl from the yeah the little Indian
girl
like are you talking about the react
conference like yeah I think so yeah
okay yeah so I had seen that and it
seemed cool it seemed like some people
liked it the majority of people were
using Redux so I'm surprised that you
know your company is the application
you're working on this is something
small something light no because I just
got hired and I mean I need like a
clearance like I have a really light
like a Coburn thing yeah I don't really
know anything yet and if I did I
probably wouldn't be able to tell
anyways yeah of course but yeah I know
how it is man sometimes drinking this
companies dies like you're so pretty
like nip/tuck like yo you can't say no
yeah but yeah no that's cool I gotta
check it out I gotta try it out
I was looking there's this article some
guy created a it's like an app not an
application is a library that uses redux
that basically saves you from all the
headaches of Redux so I think though
that was pretty cool
like when you mean like saves you like
headaches like what do you mean like
boiler plate like the boiler plate like
it is like let me see maybe I could find
it I think I like them my medium let me
see
it's like medium Redux yeah so I ran
into that same issue like that like the
boiler plate issues and I just started
creating like bash scripts yeah no I
think remembering all this stuff yeah no
I don't even like I just copy and paste
it I just like are you freaking going in
there and try to dilash it from scratch
this is like it's like a headache you
know
mmm-hmm let me see you was there three
ducks redesigned let me see I think
you're sweet let's redesign redesigning
a real exciting come on me check I think
I follow
is cold it's cold rematch
we met mm-hmm let's call rematch let me
say yeah that's like the first thing
that like puffs up you look for it
yeah Rima hatch rematches he respects
best practices without boil Utley more
actions yes
okay seems like maybe the reason like
some sort of abstraction that ya don't
like does everything for you under the
hood exactly like it seems like it just
saves you the headache of like doing the
whole boiler plate of redux which i
think that's what most people hate and i
don't know if if you had an issue like
learning in the learning curve for me it
was like I don't know I like it was kind
of hard in the beginning I was like wait
what was going on here cause it's like
it's going from one function to another
function and then goes another function
then to go to the global stage and then
you got a freaking not mutate the data
as I hey don't do this yeah yeah yeah I
know what you mean I mean like it's hard
to get it at first at first and then
once you get is good good but I think
it's also good because if you have never
been exposed to functional programming
mm-hmm it does like um like opens your
mind to like other ways to like do stuff
like I didn't know anything about
functional programming like before using
burritos and dr. itÃµs like I learned
stuff like Korean so it's like a
function that returns a function and now
you got like like the first function has
state saved on it and then use the
second function so I don't know anything
about that
and like Redux critics brilliant isn't
that like what's the name of it of the
function I know it's when you keep when
you keep the funk when you keep it's
like you keep the function keeps the
state of the previous function that's
carrying it
it no there's another word for you um I
can't remember I hate when I hurrying
there's I think piping some people call
it pipe
it's like composed but the other way
yeah and then compose sing it when you
can beat up the last function guess and
put it into the next function and then
the output of that goes into the next
function yeah now I want to know what's
the name of it I think you're talking
about composed know this there's another
name for it they use it in a ruby hey
when I can't remember something I feel
like the older I can't remember stuff
really gave me annoying okay hold on
it's the low line okay I googled the
little line I can't remember the name of
it what is the little line in truth
lambda this is like a lambda functions
yeah there you go
God Gary I hate why I can't remember is
like it's right there in the tip you
know is like I can't get it out like yes
lambda yes yeah yeah that's what it was
kids you know that means some Oh God so
you still you still mp8 yeah I'm in PA
for now but I'll be moving into Virginia
seam so um I've been looking for like
part lasting stuff and yeah I'll be
moving soon so they they holding you

do I have to leave this keyboard down
and fight somebody up in here you know I
mean like like it's crazy but now but
definitely I I love my friends I love
the people that watch this channel it's
like we have fun we crack jokes you know
my whole point of this is like we don't
have to make code boring code can be
boring let's be honest people be like oh
it's never boring you
programming it's a blessing it's a okay
it's a blessing but this times what you
just want to bang your head off on the
keyboard you're like okay I'm dying here
you know somebody throw me you know like
a low life line it's like where's Regis
when you need a wins like yo what's the
life line number for this you know
I mean this sounds like you can't find
the answer on Stack Overflow you can't
find the answer on on whatever right so
it's like you might need a little break
come how you know chill hang out with
other developers you know so it's cool
man I'm glad that Kevin Kevin put you on
man you know that that's what I want
more people man put other people's on
cuz you know one thing that I'm proud of
for this this channel is like we get no
love from YouTube we got no love from
nowhere like this is like organic
everybody that comes up to this channel
is like organically it's like somehow
they were looking at a crazy video next
thing you know I was like the number 27
and they said let me click on that crazy
guy and then now they found this channel
it's usually some crazy story like that
so you know I'm happy what we got here
and I'm happy that Kevin freaking put
you on man so yeah um so how how long
you been in the boot camp so far like
how many weeks about 12 weeks now that
started on January 6 okay and what was
he doing before this I was transporting
manager at a hospital in Boston okay
cool cool cool good move kid you know I
was doing photography or video
production as a hobby and honestly I
wasn't happy like for the money like
feels like a rat rat race to be honest
is like you're not working like 10-hour
shifts had six employees like you know
what I mean like at 27 I was ago it was
like like it was more for the title I
was like yeah you know mom mom and the
family was proud but the day I wasn't
happy so I wanted to create and be
creative you know I mean like in tech
world embossed McCambridge like you know
me is definitely something major you
know what I mean yeah and like yeah mit
have all these like smart people you
know surround yourself with Eagles are
gonna fly you know what I mean so yes I
couldn't do that
not as good man that's definitely good
yo and what did what they're teaching
you guys in there they teaching you guys
HTML CSS no GES what else so for the
first I must say first month it was HTML
CSS you know you learn the basics of
HTML and then CSS you know you wouldn't
float no you lent flexbox and kind of
taught as grid but we didn't stay on it
that long but after that we went
straight into vanilla JavaScript for
like a week or so and then went to
jQuery well for jQuery for about two or
three weeks and I kind of messed me up
because I go and vacuuming us go back to
vanilla JavaScript and I was already
getting right with the jQuery so getting
the functionality with that and try to
come back to it was like hard you know
using like you know the dollar sign I
forgot all the selectors for jQuery but
you're not doing that for vanilla you're
doing like a DeBellis now whatever the
case yeah so that messed me up and then
after that after that pretty much what
two API so auth getting a whole back-end
learn how to do Mongo Express no no Mon
right now we're both are going to react
so that's it just a monthly you look at
what you have because we're about to go
dive into that and I kind of want to get
my feet wet a little bit because yeah
you know this is hard bro because you're
going at a fast pace and like people
learn this in four years and you're
doing this at 14 and like you know yeah
that's cool man look I think this is the
rice that I could tell you and I tell
everybody that's going to a bootcamp you
gotta know you're you're basically going
to to learn everything as quick as
possible right what you should
definitely try to do is spend as much
time as possible on your own also when
you get home try to knock out as many
hours as you can so you could come back
prepare to the courses because they you
know they gotta keep on jumping to
different things you know it's a good
idea for now to start looking at react
and understand how it works and then you
know even from my website my website
it's go react quick and easy just like I
just make it more relatable things that
you could go in there but all things
topics that would be more difficult you
but oh this is easy this is not even
hard but react that first time you you
might look at him like wait what the
hell is going on this thing is rendering
this the state there's local state this
it's like a global state and now we need
something to manage all the states of
all the components so don't get
overwhelmed it's just it's just like
jQuery it's like it's just something on
top of JavaScript that's it you know so
you're gonna be fine I'll definitely
check out on the website and you're
gonna be good man
you're gonna be golden how much longer
you got left in the book camp about two
weeks so we're gonna do reacted in pug
and I forgotten some other some other
other languages I forgot what he said
but right now is basically trying to
finish this final project because at the
end we have like employers at a
graduation hmm try to get like you know
hired but the most part for the last two
weeks I've been doing you know practice
question interview questions doing Cold
War's you know I mean and actually
getting interviews which is weird
because I also you had no experience so
me getting these phone interviews as
well and I'm about to go into the
technical side so kind of nervous cuz
it's like yeah man it's like different
when you're going into like a hospital
setting you're gonna interview where you
go into a tech world you have like the
behavioral then you have the technical
and then like you know all right so
let's say if there give me a fist but
fizzbuzz question I know that but what
if they do some wild like crazy after
you crazy methods and this and that and
then yeah so I'm trying to get that down
and doing whiteboard a lot yeah and you
say the syntax and everything not as a
sup man that's definitely cool also too
man
I always tell this to people you know
sometimes you might think like hey man
this is the type of company that I want
to be in but when you get there you
realize that maybe that's not where you
want it to be yet so even if you go to
an interview and you might get it you
might not get it always know that the
next one you're going to
you know is like you every time you go
in as a brand new developer somebody
who's self-taught or going to a bootcamp
or even a fresh college key right like
you go to this interviews you go to the
interviews to really learn what's out
there what exactly is it that they
asking you right so that's how you
always got to think about it and you're
gonna be fine you know you're gonna find
a job there's plenty of jobs out here
the problem is that most people just
don't want to go through the process of
learning or staying in front of a
computer you know there's people who are
just meant to be walking around you know
hammering something on the floor picking
up a box is like you know is like it is
in their brain or something you know but
for some of us like you and me that we
think beyond them we know we can do this
then this is gonna be easy you know what
I mean like at first you you feel like
overwhelmed to like then this projects
this you know how is it gonna be when I
get the job is it gonna be the difficult
and a lot of times you go to a job and
you're like wait I went through this
whole interview process and this was the
little thing that you wanted me to do
you know it's like you you might go into
a company that has a long process to you
just get hired and then when you get
there then I hate they just have you
fixing menus and stuff like that like
yeah it happens all the time you know no
matter what as a junior developer
they're never gonna have you doing the
most difficult things you know that
companies know who to pass things aren't
to you know what I mean so no matter
what you go to a company they're gonna
teach you how they do things you you
might be at the bootcamp and you learn
in pug you might go to the next company
and they might be using ejs or they
might be using slim or they might be
using something else you got are saying
so no matter what they're gonna teach
you the ropes so I feel like what's the
bootcamp they like so I know ejs for the
most part like I used that with the
templates you know to use the note but
it's just going to cheese they talked
about like they asked me actually about
the money right off bat I never
that happened in like they already
talking about salary we're from like the
first ten minutes at the interview like
oh so what are you trying to make I'm
like honestly it's kind of weird because
you want to be humbled but then like you
know mean like I definitely put in work
like if these twelve weeks like I've
been eat sleeping in code like you know
what I mean
like this is all I do put everything
aside like you know and this is all I do
from wake up to go to sleep mmm you know
so like you want to be humble but then
like you definitely want your money like
you don't want to cheat yourself out
yeah yeah yeah yeah you want to learn
you definitely like a good spot we get a
good mentorship that's what you're what
you're about and yeah definitely
interested but like you know I was kind
of with when this lady asked me today
like oh so what do you expect on Meghan
I was like all right why no junior
developers make around like sixty to
eighty five K do I say 75 do I say 60 do
I say 85 you know I don't know yeah I
think I think you should always start
with like 75 you'd be like yo 75 that's
why you know that's like a minimum right
and we also to it depending on the
company right if you send out a resume
let's say I don't know let's let's do
this life kids so cuz I like to to have
good numbers on Glassdoor
like just right now cuz I'm looking up
the company I'm trying to figure out
what's the reviews what type of question
is it yeah exactly
yeah so you're doing it right yeah I did
a lie bro I'm sure like I see I've got
to become a director for a hospital and
I was more calm during that didn't
actually with this tech stuff to be
honest yeah no I mean that's how it is
is it's something new is a new career is
is your new change you know there's so
many things like for me I'm taking I'm
gonna tell you about me like when I
first started doing this I was like man
am I gonna fit in am I gonna have people
interviewing me there's gonna be
assholes you know what type of companies
is out there for me what can I get what
type of salary should I
Milo bowling
you know am i messing up so there's a
lot of stuff out there like let's say
I'm trying to find like a good company
oh let me see put in Boston I'm a and
you start applying for jobs already or
date hitting you are from LinkedIn so
it's a mixed some between me actually
you having my LinkedIn and sending out
my applications and reaching out within
the program actually help you not only
with the code inside with sometimes I'd
like getting you interview prep you know
just some people not kind of they're not
as extroverted their introverted you
know we don't know how it like speak or
really be asked social or you know this
anything anything of that sort just get
you prepared for it like the interviews
and actually learn how to hunt and go
get it like you're not me before like I
was going to meet ups but that was cuz
like photography or videography you know
they learn like Photoshop or Lightroom I
never thought about like the tech world
so what if I got into tech world I
thought about it but they already had
that in the curriculum to actually do
that to go to meetups and you know what
the it's a requirement for you to get
this many basic cards per week you know
what I mean so like yeah so with the
people that contacted me mostly you have
yeah setting up that resume in the plan
to the internships
so I mean I'm looking at this one like
wave here right so we're looking for a
front-end developer right and they asked
him for one two three years of CSS HTML
Javascript that means that you're gonna
be doing like the basics like this is
not gonna be nothing crazy is telling
you hey do you want do you have
experience with react in particular or
any PHP or the server-side language I
mean like this is something that would
be perfect for you something where you
could just be like okay I will apply for
this and I'm looking for let's say 75 or
80 thousand they went into pay ninety
three ninety three is for like somebody
who's been
doing this for a while it's very
comfortable so for you as a new
developer you can say hey I'm looking
for a tu you know what I mean and then
they'll be like oh we don't know if we
think that you have too much experience
I mean if you have the projects that you
can show them like hey this is the type
of work that I've done and this is the
type of quality that I can produce for
you guys thank you who gonna you're
gonna get that eighty right if you don't
have that yet because as soon as you you
graduate you don't have a huge portfolio
right you still have a lot of projects
from from the boot camp then in a
situation like that then I will say hey
hit him with the 75 be like listen
minimum that I can make it 75 the cut
the company that I used to work for or
the hospital I used to work for I was
making $75,000 and that's my minimum
that's you know that's just to survive
you know and that's pretty much it
because sometimes I hear from people
that they like me I don't know if I
should know try to get a higher pay but
I don't know if they're gonna give it to
me because of you know I wasn't working
as a developer but it's like now when
you go into a job interview or they
interviewing you through the phone you
gotta make sure that you're not gonna
make less than what she was already
making in your life you know and the
only reason that you might take a job to
make less it's a situation like mine's
when I first got in this I started
working at $13 an hour which is
embarrassing but the reason why I did it
was because I was like yo I don't want
to waste time in my house waiting for
somebody to give me the opportunity like
in New York is it was very competitive
when I started it was very competitive
and I was going to like major companies
I was going to like tumblr Twitter and
like those guys were getting like the
best of the best
all right I wasn't prepared for that
right so for me to get that stamp get
that first stamp of like hey this we
trust this kid he's already working at a
company I went out of my way and say you
know what the first company that
hits me up back I'm just gonna take and
i'ma just work there for a month two
months and then move on to the next one
so I got paid I got my experience and
then I literally was making like three
times as that in the next job you know
it's like I wasn't sweating it you know
so it depends on the person to and what
situation you're in when I was like when
I left I left everything I left a Korea
of iti was doing IT my whole I guess my
whole life was like man I just want to
work in Wall Street that was my dream I
made it to Wall Street and I didn't like
it and then I was like okay I'm just
gonna try something else and then after
that I just like I say okay what do I do
that I continue going to interviews
until I get a job or do I say hey
whoever gives me the job first takes it
and then I continue getting interviews
while I'm working there and that's what
I did you know it's like everybody has
their own road you know plus I feel like
for me it was way harder you know what I
mean like I started and I could have
probably started getting a job like at
the to three months mark but I took the
long road I try to master everything and
that's one thing that I will tell you
don't try to master everything well you
have to do is understand the concepts
all these things is gonna come in
through the years this is not gonna come
in in like two three months like when a
a boot camp you go to a boot camp the
boot camp is just showing you the
concepts of web development right
they're not gonna teach you everything
that's under the Sun because all of that
you learn it through experience in
through the years so your whole job
there is just to understand the concepts
understand what programming is
understand what functions are variables
how loops work understand the the things
that makes web development how to work
with the Dom how to use JavaScript for
interactivity on the website those are
the things that they're gonna teach you
but everything else you're gonna get it
from from from a job it's not really the
bootcamp or even an online course like
you can't teach the things
that you gonna the problems you're gonna
bump into at a company nobody could
teach it to you because only that
business has those issues you gotta say
like so it is just like once you're in
you're in so here I'm not so definitely
appreciate the advice to men because
yeah definite kanda made things like you
know will be more settling you know I
tell people if you're self toy man if
yourself taught you teaching yourself
the best way to have a nice portfolio
something that shows them that you are
on the same level right now when you are
like in your situation I think boot
camps are a little bit different boot
camp says they care more about what's
the technical things that you have done
and like you know don't test you with
exactly what you say like a couple of
algorithms too but like you know you go
to a company they'll try to test you for
algorithms double IO let's see how how
his brain works and we're taking a risk
or hire him but my advice is try to get
a portfolio trying to get something
legit your presentation your first your
first look it's always gonna be what
people's gonna remember you for if you
go in then you have a you know a a dumb
project like hey here's a JavaScript
clock like nobody's gonna take you
serious like the best way to do is
create a full application front and back
with all the technologies that that
people are looking for right now you
know so from what I hear you're doing
good you got a project that you working
on and you gotta start working with
react pretty soon you're gonna have
everything that you need that you need
so look we do it like they taught us how
to do the whole github and push in so we
try to push it's not try like we push
every day
those green squares so yeah yeah every
every week we're definitely completing
the site or two so you know for from
I'll save the time I started there's
definitely like at least 48 repositories
nice nice they look a bit low I think
now it's 43 my bad exactly oh you know
yeah definitely just for the most part
I'm not gonna lie the presentation the
CSS the styling it hasn't been great
because I was more worried about the
functionality of things making sure
everything worked on the client-side so
yeah that was like mostly when I was
worried about getting JavaScript right
the CSS was like guy to keep it moving
like you know this code is coming so
fast this project so you really can't ya
know it's you know I mean yeah in that
situation definitely you know I think
like you know for bootcamp boy I think
it in that stand it's like your focus
more on the technical side try to get to
learn as much as you can from the
technical side and the presentation is a
little bit secondary but yeah definitely
don't forget it they're really nice
where they don't get me man it's just
like I didn't at the time when the boos
doing CSS I didn't spend as much time as
I did on like the JavaScript I mean like
I should have spent more time like I
taught myself flexbox I was so cool I
was mess with the floats I went back to
position and still was like you're
Berlin you need to cut that out for the
most part a night came back to the
flexbox doing the Flex box and
everything's responsive how I wanted to
clap everything had everything bus not
the containers it was a weird setup to
be honest I really like veered off and
had to come back to the right way but um
they styled like I can come back and
refactor but okay make sure you get it
right and working before you worry about
stuff no that's what's up
and you got anything online anything
that you've worked on or Heroku or like
ah I was actually even he was actually
speaking about that recently within the
weeks so I just got hip to it okay okay
yeah definitely man
got a Pokemon is like really the github
and now like I had my website so all my
all my work is on my github and like
throwing my LinkedIn they had like the
resume and everything so they know where
to go so yeah okay yeah definitely try
to put it up online just in case you
know a lot of times - I'll be honest me
from like working in companies and
interviewing people that used to come in
and um you know don't be like oh man
could you just check out what I have to
send the resume and they like this one I
have on github mr. projects that I've
done and then at the end of the days
like most of the time we don't even look
at it because we like we're not gonna go
in there and download the project
install in our computer download NPM
modules you know so definitely in the
next couple of weeks man start putting
your projects even it's like two to
three projects online just so people
could see it you know right I'm
definitely gonna start doing that that's
for sure I can do that I'm gonna add as
many as much to my portfolio as much as
I can in the next two months
yeah man you've gotta put it up man cuz
it's like a lot of people just don't go
through it you know it's rare I haven't
seen like people that have gone through
like people's code like they look at him
be like okay doesn't look clean there's
their comments is there are order of
things too you know if he's doing like
let's say I don't know for loop when he
gotta use the dot map you know like
those little things people could catch
up on it but most of the time is like if
our HR person you send them your resume
they're looking for the website cuz
they're not gonna go they're not
technical they don't know what they was
there all they know is like oh what
companies have you worked for and then
they look at the website after company
now if you have for your own projects if
you okay these are the projects that
I've built so now they they compare it
to the company that they work for and be
like oh wow he's doing websites that
look better than our come
or he's doing a website star on the same
level with our company now we gotta give
him that second call close the buck
please I'm sorry guys yeah yeah so forth
the program they definitely I think it's
called we stir or Avista it's like a
video cover letter so basically we
introduce ourselves and we show our code
via the screen and actually go through
what exactly we're doing and explain
that you know busy like you would do any
any interview like do basically treat it
like a a whiteboard and explain
everything that that's going on hmm
so I'm that's supposed to be coming up
but I'm definitely gonna get hip to what
you said what you said the Roku right
because like I said he just said it like
a few times we're from the weeks okay
how many people how many people are in
your class
Oh 13 oh that's good it's a good number
there was that 23 but you know some
people they'll feel you thought I'd like
to drop out or they make you they're
like yeah like wait hold on I'm still
HTML hold on to survive you know I mean
I love cuz we definitely grew as a
family you know I mean there's people
that I definitely you know I mean I
introduced to that within these 12 weeks
I never would have spoke to you know I
mean if I was on the other side
definitely look at you know like for the
better for sure definite on my lane I
definitely enjoyed it even when it's
tough like burr like yeah I love it
cuz when you do get that when you do get
it's a guy holic yeah exactly
you know because the the good thing
about programming right and anything any
other other fields web programming or
software game development whatever right
like the best part is finding that last
piece of the puzzle is like they give
you a million piece puzzle and it's like
okay solve this you know it's like you
in a freaking butter knife and it's like
you got to figure it out that's how it
is and then now when you put in that
last little piece on the puzzle you like
took me a two days to do this but Lucas
is completely you know you know so
there's
you got a shot you get like a little
shot of dopamine you're like okay I'm
back you know what I mean you look at
yourself in the mirror like I got this
you know I mean got me messed up it was
like I never had it been like I never
had to be like so perfect in my life you
know what I mean because you had to be
like 100 when you write this because you
must have any type of syntax like it's a
rap like it's not working
look at you like miss a semicolon or a
curly brace somewhere or any one of
those like it's a rap so like it's
really yeah it's definitely unique
that's the beauty of programming man cuz
programmer I would say is just like math
is like two plus two is gonna equal four
right if you come in even like two plus
1.78 is like wait that's not for you
know what I mean so it's like if you
mess up somewhere it's gonna give you
that error is gonna give you a
console.log Eric it's gonna give you a
runtime error if you're doing a
compiling language it's gonna it's not
gonna compile it's gonna be like hey
buddy you up three pages ago you
know so it's like that's how it is and
and not everything in life is like that
it's like sometimes you can wiggle
through things as I show you a cashier
is like oh shoot well we missed two
dollars as I hope whoops and that says
that you can't just say whoops on
programming
you can't just be like win game but I
walk nobody noticed that it's like nah
people notice it you know so it's like
you gotta be on top of it so that's the
the good parts about it man but yeah man
I think we've been here for a while guys
I really appreciate it you guys hanging
out with me I hope you guys oh wait wait
wait wait wait wait hold up
I almost forgot one thing who are the
winners of the the freakin nodejs
courses man well I wasn't I wasn't yet
the other day yeah then remember we all
have people sign up for the forum so now
we got to do that let me see let me find
out let me check the forms forms real
quick I gotta announce this I gotta get
this out there's people out here waiting
peoples out here
scratching their neck like Oh Joe I
appreciate that - you know I was like
yeah where you know I'm not even right
with node like I can run the server and
everything but I'm really not even that
great with it I'm surprised I can
actually even do that yeah now that's
hot so okay so we got 37 people I'm
gonna download the CSV okay
damn I got so much in my computer I
gotta clean this up yeah I signed up for
the course today

be legit man is if you look at the the
design it's gonna be freakin super dope
like is I'm going in very detailed and
then we're gonna build everything from
scratch with you know Donna CES if you
like you use Express before you know
