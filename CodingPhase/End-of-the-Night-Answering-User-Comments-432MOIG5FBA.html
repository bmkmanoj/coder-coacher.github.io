man code offense calm listen I'm gonna
try this out I'm gonna see how long I
could do this because I do this every
single night right right before I go to
sleep right before I leave the computer
I go over every single comment and I
read every single one of them right so
what I'm gonna do is when I'm actually
reading this I'm actually gonna go in
and answer the comments on this last
video everyday it's oh look like a
knight I'm gonna try to do this all
right don't hold me to it but today
we're doing it all right so um yeah so
what deaf violinist is like yo man super
hype super hype for hi Brad yeah
definitely
he's saying here like hey on a side note
like he thinks I should send out emails
you know like once a week or once every
two three days to notify the the users
who are subscribed to my website and let
them know ahead of time like hey man we
just released uh you know four or five
videos six videos eight videos because
that is true you know
I'm constantly doing videos and
uploading them to the website but in
reality I don't think you guys get
notifications like hey Joe just adding
and seven videos to jQuery Joe just
adding five videos - hi Brad Joe just
adding you know five videos - no js'
most of you guys don't get those
notifications the only way for you to
find out is to log into the website and
go into whatever topic it is that you
want and see oh I haven't seen this one
that's the only way right so I'm
thinking about doing that basically
doing like that email and letting
people's knows exactly the things that
I'm working on I also got to be more
organized in the sense of like hey when
I finish a video and I upload it I
should make a list and be like hey
there's the videos that got uploaded on
Monday there's the videos that got
uploaded on Tuesday you know just for
the people to know and be like hey these
are the things that are actually live
right now let me go login to the website
so what they're violinist man you know
man this definitely is a good idea
you know over here reading real tough
candy she's like yo Chris could take the
simple program around and start
reviewing protein bars topless yeah well
uh let me see what else we in here I'm
reading all this stuff man this is
hilarious to me like this guy goes like
Sam Sam I think I seen him before but
I'm not sure he goes like yo I do not
care about cold uh-huh so this is the
video that I did about today about the
stuff that I was gonna release on my
website in the tutorial and he's like
yeah I do not care about called webdev
it's not that difficult there are tons
of great tools to deploy great sites in
less time than it takes to watch this
video I want business ideas how to make
money on the internet give me ideas guys
I'm not Gary Vee I'm not you know one of
these guys who is just constantly over
here like just here to give you ideas of
how to make money online like brown like
this is not what this channel is about
is called coding phase this is the phase
of coding it's up to you to decide what
exactly it is that you're going to be
building with the code it's not up to me
to tell you hey guys there's a business
proposition for you guys there's like
you know there's the next thing there's
like you guys need to build the next
Bitcoin this isn't that like nah that's
not my job
that's on you you know what I mean like
you have to use your creativity like if
I'm to be honest with you let it be
little be honest here why would somebody
tell you hey this is my business plan I
just came up with this business business
plan and I'm gonna tell you hey guys go
build this so you can make money it
doesn't make no sense right like why
would anybody do that you know it's like
when I see people online they'll be like
man how to make money on real estate
with $2.50 like bro like it's not
possible like if it was possible people
would be doing it all the time you know
when people come in be like how to you
know how to sell on eBay and Amazon and
be calm
our seller like don't you think a lot of
people will be doing it out there like
by the time they're they selling you
those those are those courses and stuff
like that it's like in reality is
already gone man that mean it's like you
know whatever they teaching you that
means everybody has been doing it for
years right I see people who talk about
affiliate marketing and this and that
and it's like man by the time that you
you're already telling somebody that
like you know like somebody could come
in and be like hey guys you know I do
affiliate marketing in and you know this
is the best way to real people or you
know real people in it and sell stuff
online is like bro by the time you
saying that it's because you already did
it you made your money and you know you
don't even care no more right so
everybody else knows that it's not a
secret you know it's like when I look at
ty Lopez is like bro like sometimes
someone his messages are are positive
but at the same time is like man like he
knows he's trying to catch that you know
that 1% of the 1% of those people who
have never seen any crazy stuff like
this on the Internet
it's like you know when you leave your
mom to your computer and she's clicking
on the on the little thing with a hey
joko I'm trying to win $1,000 on on this
thing it's like ma that's the
advertisement like those are the people
that they still trying to catch you know
what I mean like what I do on this
channel it's not that man it's like I'm
giving you an option to a career man I'm
not here to tell you like hey man this
is how you make money this what you do
this it's like yeah and you know I
appreciate you Tyler Fleming as I go
it's a go it's a go makes his money from
what that man you're on the wrong
channel like like this is what I tell
people like you know they're like man
it's not about code I want to know how
to make money online as like bro there's
a circle it's a big circle right you
learn how to code you get to work you
get the skills differently you start
making something that's productive you
start making a business you start making
your own app you start making whatever
whatever software as a service that you
want
out there right but it starts here at
coding this is why it's called coding
phase from there sky's the limit
it's up to you we don't know right now
listen right now we're looking at at all
these people here who are subscribed to
this channel we don't know who out of
here is gonna come in and create the
killer app we don't know what we doing
is leaving a little bug in their head
like y'all this the coding app right
here create something I give you the
tools created from there is on you you
know what I mean that's what I'm saying
now keep going down on the comments let
me see you let me see oh yeah so we got
Chris Hawkes
I guess he appreciate the comment that I
made for for his videos on because I
really do think like Chris Hawkes has an
audience man you know this times that I
want to create like super like
complicated stuff but we added I don't
have that audience guys like you know
there's like one or two guys like I feel
like Phillippe is one of those guys
desert they like itching for like give
us advanced stuff it's like bro you're
like one out of like five thousand
people like for every 5,000 people on my
channel there's like two or three guys
who are like mid-level advanced it's
like that's not the crowd here you know
what I mean like yeah I know what I'm
doing I'm trying to bring this crowd to
the next level but we gotta give them a
chance to understand all the stuff and
learn and then we're gonna come and
start building more advanced courses and
more advanced topics
I got a build my crowd you know to me
like my crowd is not the people that are
you know it's like Chris Hawkes Chris
holes crowd it's like people like me
mid-level to senior level guys like
they're not they're trying to learn HTML
like they learned that stuff like eight
years ago eight nine years ago you know
what I mean like the people who are here
they're beginners there's people who
want to get into this and that's what I
do for them you know I mean and I'm
basically it's like I'm holding their
hand through this whole process
of course for my junior developer to a
mid-level developer like I see people
skills stepping up like I see Matt's you
know project whatever he's working on on
his github and I look at his talk on my
math stepping it up like Mac came in
from the town where you know he was like
he was pretty good more advanced than
everybody else and uh you know in in the
show that I did which was like an
internship with like five six people I
was five six people I think only four
made it four or five meeting you know
what I mean and Matt was definitely one
of those people that was pretty advanced
compared to everybody else but at the
same time it's like you look at his work
now and it's like he stepped it up you
know what I mean like you could see the
progress it's been like three four
months you see the progress the people
that continue with it you'll see the
progress right so it's like right now
this whole crowd imagine like this man
I'm carrying eight thousand nine
thousand people and I'm bringing them
step by step by step by step
teaching them one thing at a time and
getting them to the next level you know
what I mean like you know I'll tell
Chris Holmes like yo man you're at a
point where you could teach guys who are
already mid levels and senior levels
cool stuff like stuff that would get us
excited like you know html/css doesn't
get me excited that's why I teach pug
cuz pug gets me excited it's like you
know is programming with HTML when you
think about it right so that gets me
excited but HTML CSS basics doesn't get
and get me excited but I know I have to
help people you know what I mean so
that's my job is I took that role and
it's fine you know what I mean so my
whole goal is you know a year from now
get everybody to a level where they'll
be like super comfortable with
JavaScript and we're really doing like
very deep stuff into JavaScript even hop
on to Crystal Lake like I'm dying to
bring all of you guys to Crystal land
guys you guys don't understand how good
that language is but the progress that
you guys are not even there you guys are
barely understanding programming now so
it's like I have to you know wing you in
and say
you know what I was like I gave he was
like a low dose everyday of like
something more hard and more harder
until you're very comfortable and then
we all gotta be just like you know
creating super cool apps here you know I
mean but it takes a little time plus
then at the same time all these courses
that we're doing is gonna be useful for
people that come in after you guys you
know what I mean like right now is eight
nine thousand people on the channel you
know a year from now it's gonna be
twenty thirty thousand people right when
it's twenty thirty thousand people the
guys took the first nine thousand those
guys are already mid-level you know
they're already to a more advanced level
in everybody else but those other 20 or
15 people that fifteen thousand people
that come in after they can enjoy those
beginner courses and come in and you
know and grow with us too by the time
the ones dark mid-level get to senior
level then the ones that was juniors
become mid levels like it's just a
process you know what I mean it's like
every every single one of you guys is
like graduating at the end of the day
from this but at least you know it's
like you get to see the whole process
you know what I mean so yeah this was
going on and you know I'm hearing I'm
here Filipe he's like yo hi Brad is fine
but jQuery is 2014 no hybrid was crying
but jQuery
yes 2015 we're having so much more
useful and I already have enough cool
stuff that people can learn from jQuery
jQuery is not something where people is
gonna come in but I hate I'm a jQuery
master it's like you know what I mean I
wonder if they have like the means for
that you know let me see you know I
think I'm like some guy looking like a
schism like you know I'm from Pokemon
you know I was like let me see somebody
has something like that
like yeah what if I tell you you don't
need jQuery you know what I mean like
people have some crazy stuff man but
yeah man going back to the topic to to
the comment from Phillipe he's like yo
hyper rap is fine but jQuery is 2015
2015 would have been so much more useful
and it can be useful but at the same
time this isn't really about like just
like hey guys we're gonna enforce just
one single thing very like if we look
into this right this right here is what
I'm working on for you guys I'm starting
hyper rap started kidding right we come
in here there's a quick look into this
thing right we go to the assets we go to
Java Square we go hyper he are you
getting a lot of different concepts
concepts of actions concepts of
components having a state right and then
inside of here you have you know
importing which is es6 export default
function all this stuff from es6 this is
from es6 what else is in here for es6
this you know JSX
i mean some will consider it it comes
with es6 so you're pretty much learning
all those things and reinforcing on what
you learned in javascript and
reinforcing what you learned and react
so because pretty much like reactant in
hybrid are like hand to hand the only
difference is hyper hyper is super light
lake you know for all the stuff that
like hyper app has you need react your
uni react dom you need redux like
there's so many things that you you need
just to do all the things the hyper app
is doing right so that's why i like
hyper app and that's why I'm helping
people you know jump on it not because
it's like oh man is my favorite this
that noise because people need to know
different tools right there's gonna be a
moment where as I hate all I want to do
is add a class and add a little thing
you could do it with JavaScript now if
you want to be super lazy with it you
know you know what there's already
jQuery on the page hey let's use jQuery
alright if I'm gonna have a forum or I'm
gonna have something simple or just a
single page app that's not gonna be like
we're not talking about Zillow which is
like twenty thousand twenty thousand
different views and and a whole bunch a
different state then user react is
overkill for no reason
when you just come in and be like hey
I'm doing it we're hyper app and super
simple it's actually fun and that's a
you know what I mean it's like this
tools for different situations so that's
what I'm teaching it sort of guys
because they need to have multiple tools
they need to be able to you know use
their brain and be like hey man this
tool is for this this tool is for that
this tool is for this
this tool is for that so people don't be
like you know I watch another youtuber
yesterday I was gonna do a video buddy I
actually did the video and they are
deleted it and it was about you know PHP
versus node and this and that and I'm
like bro is like all the things that he
were saying was like coming from the
side of somebody who's a front-end
developer and I understood him because I
was like that too when your friend and
developer you're like oh man my life is
gonna be so much easier if everything is
HTML CSS JavaScript and MongoDB yeah
your life is gonna be easier but that's
not the right tool for every single
situation now you put yourself in a
little box right you want to be in this
little box you could be in that little
box you know what I mean and not know
stuff like then when a senior developer
comes in and just makes you look bad
because don't be like hey why were you
you know for example let's say somebody
comes in and be like hey all they need
to do is like you know take a API where
I created a quick API and somebody goes
in and
stole Python and Django on a server the
senior developer is gonna come into you
and be like what the hell are you doing
you could have done that with no js' it
would have taken you two seconds right
now if you come in and you bet I hate I
want to create you know a super solid
app with you know that's gonna be for
thousands of like thousands and
thousands of users are at a time and and
all this stuff and you come in and you
but I think I'm gonna put Ruby on Rails
people is gonna look at you like you're
crazy that's not the right answer for
that right like this a right app for
every single thing as developers our job
is to know which ones are the right
tools we're not supposed to have a
favorite we're not supposed to be like
my favorite is react and I'm gonna use
react for every single thing in the
world know that is your favorite but
there's not for every single situation
you know it's like why will you go
through the whole process of installing
webpack installing go it's all a whole
bunch of stuff when you could just do
something that was super simple with
just jQuery right now if it's not the
more complicated then you would go to
the whole process of installing gulp
installing the web pack whatever like if
you need a bigger app alright now if you
like oh I need something simple you know
I also want to have state management
that's pretty legit you know immutable
pretty much hyper app is the answer is
key you know what I mean but yeah man I
feel you Philippe but at the same time
and I wish you give it a chance man
it's like you're a pretty seasoned
developer like you should know this
stuff by now there's a tool for every
single situation all right and I know
somebody else is out there it's gonna be
like hey joke but he knows like you
don't like the same thing with with you
and this and that is like you're
choosing view you should react overview
and this hanging over angular I'm like
yeah but the problem is that I already
know
angular and I already know react why
would I want to use view which is a baby
of both of them you know what I mean
like it doesn't make sense
that's not like that's not an upgrade
you know using who you is not an upgrade
for me because I already know how to do
react down already know how to do
angular you know it's like going to you
is actually a downgrade you're like wait
what I'm I'm turning back to angular one
when there's angular for out there like
when there's react 16 when there's hyper
app like you know what I mean like
that's what I'm saying kids but yeah man
I'm reading all these comments
slag our IP says you know I would love
to see a Python coins man doesn't coming
you know I'll be honest I'm not the
biggest expert in Python but at the same
time it's like I'm a seasoned developer
like pretty much anything that's out
there I can't pretty much become
comfortable with because they all do the
same thing they all all these frameworks
do the same thing jangle do the same
thing that Ruby on Rails and Clarabelle
and Adonis GS and Celsius list goes on
and on and only not other things that
they can do it they're pretty much the
same thing all right now let me see
Titus is like you know I agree if he's
considering teaching then go for it you
know I agree with you it is better to
compare the framework source codes
that's more informative and interesting
to me at least yes it could probably be
more interesting for you but you know
for more people most people people don't
really have time like you know sometimes
like you know people be like man view
does you know the virtual Dom just
a little bit different than reacting
like man okay whoop-dee-doo good for
them I think you know what I mean like
I'm not trying to spend a day and a half
looking into the source code of like be
able to see all the things that you know
that they are doing you know what I mean
let me see me it was like Joe do not
lose your motivation I'm here man
we're not losing motivation man we here
man you know this is just days I can't
come in and be like to touch it dad dad
I have like this days I'm hyper this
days I'm just like chill relax you know
I had a long weekend a shorter drink a
lot hunter weekend and and I never drink
last time I drink was like nine months
ago maybe I think December last year so
I was like my energy goes down a little
bit after I drink you know but that's
why I don't drink no more let me see who
else is in here man yeah people just
like your great channel this and that
people's like y'all clever program I
mean yeah sir his name huh I ain't
mentioned in that kid man yeah yeah the
one that's putting things together I'm
just the one saying you know stating
facts you know what I mean Angela and
Joe you know angel and cheddar angel and
cheddar oh and you and cheddar shut up
shut up she's like yo she's talking
about that you know she's she's going to
this bootcamp and she you know she's
going really hard and she's just trying
to come in and do her work and she's
like thank you for being honest and yeah
you know what I mean like I'm here I'm
here to support my you know I want all
the shorties to come in here and start
coding you know create cool stuff man
cuz we seen too many guys create create
apps and create frameworks I would like
to see the other side of what girls can
come up with you know in the next 5-10
years like it's gonna be pretty crazy
you know what I mean but yeah I think I
was just telling her like y'all you just
got a call everything if you go to a
boot camp man just thinking your head
you're going there in reality you paying
for hanging out with people people that
are like-minded you're really paying for
people who are really there to want to
learn this and that right but that
doesn't guarantee your job was gonna
guarantee your job it's the fact that
you're gonna come in and you're just
gonna work hard you're gonna work hard
those you know those whatever how many
weeks is it is 16 weeks or whatever it
is and then you go home and you work you
keep on working don't do what a lot of
people do even in school in college high
school doesn't matter where it is
anything that's in a school system this
is what people do
99% of the time they go to the school
they use schools or resources and then
they basically do only the projects that
the teacher gives them you're not
learning like that like the the teacher
is gonna give you the answer the teacher
is gonna show you things you have to
create things on your own and even for
you guys you guys are coming to me to
help you out and teach you the ropes
when it comes to programming and web
development guys yes I can do that for
you but you have to go the extra mile
you see me creating something cool
creating and then you say now I'm not
creating myself I'm gonna creating my
own way create my own style right Creole
model different layout like you know if
if the header is here there's a top
image here this you know three galleries
you know three images from a gallery
down here there's a paragraph on my
project how about you switch it up make
the the three galleries up there put at
the top image at the bottom just to mess
around with it I always tell you guys
the best way to learn something is by
breaking it you know it's like right now
we bout to look into this this hyper app
course that I'm bout to you know build
for you guys but when you come here and
you start doing this hyper app course
break it literally break it and then
ctrl Z so
you could figure out okay when I come
here and I'll be like okay this there's
where the the app is since okay this is
the index everything is being imported
okay imports the app component okay
there's a state what happen if we put in
an object here
does it break everything worked so and
you hang it okay cool so it's expecting
an object right it doesn't really matter
if the object is coming from here or
it's coming from here so now you just
broke it and you're fine you notice that
everything works right you could come
here and but I think what happens if I
put this to something else instead of an
idea of app I change it to a story right
save that story what happens on the page
it disappears all right and they're like
okay why did it disappear you come here
you look at it but at all because it has
to have an ID of app but what if I
change this to story
save that oh sure everything came back
it works you know that's how I learned
guys that's how I learned I just come
here when I'm testing something out I
use going and I just break it I'll be
like okay cool let's change this to this
you know just to figure out like it
doesn't really matter if the names our
app if it's named Abdur not just to test
it out all right
so yeah man just give it a chance try it
out and yeah man this is what I'm
talking about right this was supposed to
be quick man but yeah man like I'm just
answering comments and looking through
the comments I was thinking about doing
this like maybe late nights but yeah
releasing that total clock right now is
12:05
so I'm about to release this video right
away as soon as I can but yeah guys
listen I'll tell you guys I'm dropping
videos every single day I'm dropping a
whole bunch of content go to my website
code offense calm I know sometimes you
think like man chill hasn't added no new
videos no Joe
has added if you see me dropping videos
on YouTube imagine what I'm really
dropping on my website on my website and
dropping 6 7 8 10 11 like I've seen I
did in last weekend I did like 22 videos
in like one day and I was like whoa you
know what I mean like that's 22 videos
in one day now does everybody know that
I dropped twenty two videos in one day
no so the best way to do basically to
check in they just go to the website man
go go to career face calm you know go
register sign up you know thanks to or
was it the dev violinist I forgot his
name I'm gonna start making a email list
