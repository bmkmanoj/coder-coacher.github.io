job back at it again coding fees.com
your boys back and out and did it again
here live from the beautiful mountains
of Connecticut alright so today's topic
is why should you become a developer in
2018 you guys this video is brought to
you by viewers like you and people that
support our website coding face.com go
check it out over 20 courses in there
there's got a guy you to become a
developer from the beginning to becoming
a pro I'm gonna say this right I'm gonna
talk to the people who are blue-collar
guys who are out here trying to get in
the game who have been working you know
odd jobs for the past five to ten years
listen it's your turn right let's stop
worrying about what people might say to
you and be like oh man I don't think you
could do it all man this for smart
people all man you got to be really good
at math guys if you really want to
become something you can't become right
now let's say this you're one of the
guys who working it back
right I'm talking about the guys who
working you know in the way houses the
guys who working you know the freaking
labor type of jobs you know jobs that
you like man my back hurts when I get
home you know jobs were you you're a
retailer right you helping people out
and you're like constantly like hi sir
can I help you out
hi can I get you that that size kit oh
do you need what size really you need a
size 8 if you're tired of doing that
type of job and you feel like man you
deserve better I think you should become
a developer especially because if you
want to be able to grow in this world
right those little jobs those little odd
jobs or you know working as a waiter
working us up you know somebody in a
warehouse working UPS retail working
data-entry talking to people on the
phones like hi sir we are calling from
XYZ we're calling for
doing some surveys if you're tired of
that then you should definitely look
into becoming a developer because you
have to understand this when you become
a developer not only are you becoming
somebody who's respected right you can
become somebody who's getting money out
here meaning like hate you can provide a
better lifestyle yourself and your
family
and everybody around you like in reality
it really trickles down let's say for
example you have a kid you know your kid
can't go to private school because you
can't afford it
right but if you are a developer
yearning eighty thousand to 120 thousand
dollars a year
yeah now you can afford to send your kid
to you know that six thousand dollars
$10,000 a year type of school you get
what I'm saying okay it trickles down so
now you could help other people out your
mama hits you up like hey man Johnny man
can you lend me $200 now you actually
have that little extra money in there to
be able to help her out all right
so it's like there's a lot of things
that you know as far as money wise I
guess it's a goal okay you know if
you're one of the type of people who is
basically it I hate how I'm a problem
solver right you enjoy puzzles you enjoy
being able to find a solution or
something at the end of the day then
becoming a developer is for you okay you
know if you had any type of you know
just interest in it all right a lot of
us we probably were interested in this
back in the days geo cities MySpace
xanga you know a whole bunch of website
where we all grew up at you get what I'm
saying like the worst web sites and
applications and in games that had had
us interested in this right for whatever
reason in this world we didn't get to
gravitate to actually making our own
websites our own games our own
applications
you know life through was a different
way but that doesn't mean that you
can I become a developer now in 2018 who
cares you dirty
who cares you're 25 who cares you're 40
that's not a block that's gonna stop you
all right it's not gonna stop you to
become a developer what's gonna stop you
from becoming a developer is you you
might just come in and say hey man I'm
too old man my time has passed and give
up but that's the opposite thing that
you should do you should definitely try
to get into this industry right right
now is the best time once you're in
you're in for life have you ever heard
of like you know when you know like back
in the days like the all Italian guys
were like hey man we got little Vinnie
in and you know you know in construction
now he's good he's making $50 an hour
for the rest of his life he's in there
he's done construction he's building
stuff and you know his life is good
right that's how it is now
but for web development right as I hate
you're in you're in for life like you're
good you get what I'm saying so you
should definitely try to become a
developer and I even try just become a
developer the opportunities that you're
gonna get you can't even measure it you
can't even say hey man I will measure
this way with a ruler this how far I'm
getting like no it's like sky's the
limit right you could come up with an
application you can come up with our
website you can come up with a service
tomorrow that can change everybody's
life and only everybody's life for yours
from one moment to another you can
become you know just a regular developer
who you know codes and works at a
company for you know 60 to 120 thousand
dollars or even more right to becoming a
millionaire because now you just create
a service that everybody needs and
everybody needs to be a member of or
everybody needs to to use or you're
getting so much traffic that your
advertising is paying you millions you
get what I'm saying like
that's just how it is now a lot of
people gotta be leaving comments like
hey man this you know this video is not
technical it's not telling us the
programming languages it's not telling
me how to become a developer how to do
lists and that this video is not to be
technical this video is me talking to
the general public
somebody who's out there thinking like
man can I do this
listen yes you can you know when I came
into this you know five six years ago I
wasn't nobody special I wasn't like hey
man this guy super smartest guy is so
genius no I was just a guy with a dream
who said man you know IT is not for me
you know designing is not for me
right sometimes you tried you know to
three different careers and you realize
it's not for you and then you bump into
you know what development programming
fun applications whatever you're into
right you bump into that and you're like
wait this is actually calling for me and
I could actually changed my life so
that's what happened to me I just came
in and I said you know what I'm gonna
become a developer man I'm gonna go hard
i'ma work hard it's gonna be a lot of
hours man who wants to be in front of a
computer for 1215 hours a day that's how
I was doing it when I first started I
went super hard do you have to go that
hard no you could go in and do 3-4 hours
a day and you know about 6 months you
should be ready you know now of course
how many hours you put in if you need it
as soon as possible how I needed it at
that time how I needed to become a
developer at that moment well I went
hard I worked three times as hard as the
regular person trying to get into this
and that's fine but my only advice to
you guys is don't let nothing stop you
now
we are in 2018 you know everything that
has happened in your life you might have
had you know a kid so kids three kids
might have had you know a little run-in
with the law
you might have came in and say hey man
you went to college you decided to go to
college for a degree that doesn't pay
you anything there's no jobs don't cry
about it
hey don't cry about it just get
something done right become a developer
learn how to code and basically change
your life around you know right now a
lot of people will probably say man I
think you're trying to get the wrong or
people into this cos those guys who have
been calling the whole life this guys
who are like you know the quote-unquote
geniuses this the guys who are looking
at this like oh man is for the passion
you know some of us don't don't need the
passion right we do it because we have
to right we do because we want to change
right the passion comes in after you're
in right you might become more
passionate as you keep on learning to
code you might say hey man this is super
cool I love this right at first you
might look at it like hey it's a check
I'm just trying to change my life I'm
trying to get this money
you know you come in like that it's fine
but as soon as you start coding you
start learning a lot of different
technologies and programming languages
you start falling in love with it right
so it's like listen just get in the game
there's the opportunity and once again
why you should come in alright I'm gonna
break it down I just talked to you guys
in grill terms and just to get you
motivated and get you started with this
all right basically the money is good
benefits you also getting you know on
401ks you're getting like stuff that a
lot of companies a lot of little
dead-end jobs it's not gonna offer you
you get respect right when you're a
developer and you work at a company you
get respect yes this weird companies out
there that were you know they might look
at the developers like I tease or
whatever but 95% of the companies out
there they look at you like hey man
that's on a rock stars these are the
guys that are moving this company
forward everybody knows that the net you
know the internet the web is the future
technology is the future if you don't
have technology you don't have two guys
that are actually building this you know
you don't have a business so right now
you are the rock star of the company you
know what I'm saying so when you come
into a company they treat you with
respect
you know there's not a lot of companies
that gotta treat you like that you know
you're Johnny from warehouse they make
sure you put that in the truck kit right
that's all you're gonna get not a little
pat on the back like hey man good job
nah it's like you do your job you think
you're 12 hours good good job kick your
back just broken your neck hurts your
arm
the feels weird because you've been
holding this high low all day like this
situations like that where it's like do
you really want to end up like that yeah
rest of your life no you gotta say
something you know in this industry you
get treated with respect and you know
most of the other developers will treat
you with respect to you know so come in
give it a try 2018 and yeah I hope you
take this video and use it for
motivation I hope you take this video
and and learn as much as you can you
know you could go to any of the websites
down
all right there let you know you can use
whatever you want I currently have my
own courses on my own website coding
face.com
you can come and check it out if you
liked the style of me teaching but the
style of just the realness for me just
talking to you like a regular human
we're not here trying to sound super
smart we're not here trying to sell you
a dream we try to be realistic with
things and teach you a skill that you
can use and get higher and become
