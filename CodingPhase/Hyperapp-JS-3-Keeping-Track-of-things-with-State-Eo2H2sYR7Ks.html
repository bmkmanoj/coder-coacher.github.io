we're going to do is we're going to talk
about state and what the hell is state
ok think about state as a memory card
you know when you play a game and you
have to save like let's say you playing
an RPG game and you just finish the
level but you need to save your data
somewhere business state state is like
your memory card right so think about it
like that
right now I'm going to show you this on
general calm so Zillo calm is a single
page app now they work with react there
this whole page is made with react right
and they're using the Bing API where in
combination with Zillow and they created
it all you know no website alright so
now let's look at this let's say you're
a new user you came in automatically you
have everything clicked on basically
showing you everything that you want all
right now let's say an example
automatically shows you that there's no
limit to your your type of housing that
you're looking for a type of apartment
or house that you're looking for but
let's say you're looking for a place
from let's say two hundred and ten
thousand to six hundred thousand all
right do that automatically what a day
was sorry I clicked outside
automatically what a day a filter all
the data that was on the page and it
goes like only show me the ones that
match from 210 K so six hundred thousand
dollars right so think of it like this
somewhere on the website inside they
have a state and that state probably
says something like this like men
man house or let's say something like
this many price and then it comes in and
says two hundred and ten thousand and
then max price six hundred thousand all
right now sorry for the comma you're not
supposed to port commas because it's
just a regular number all right now you
save that okay I got saved that gets
shown on the state now another thing
that we could come here and do and say
hey we want to take off potential
listings all right
so automatically somewhere in the state
again
it saves here your information saves
what you chose and says okay let's say
for sale and if that's true and then
potential listing it says false I hope
you guys get what I'm doing right now
I'm basically showing you guys how their
state probably looks right now and then
here you will say three bedrooms right
so bear room some come in here and build
out eight three bedrooms so now as you
can see every time that we choose
something else the page re-renders not
the whole page but in reality just this
area here just a component and any other
component on the website like let's say
here if we open this up like this side
here also remembers because of the data
so if we come here we say five rooms it
shows no match nothing matches and it
takes off all the little dots off the
map automatic if we come here we say
four bedrooms there's a few of them with
four bedrooms if we have one bedroom you
see more start showing up in and
basically saying I hate this houses
available for one barrel right
now all of this stuff is done and being
tracked by the state right in the way
how hyper app works is the only way to
change the state is to actions right so
I'm going to show you guys an example of
this so let me see where is it I want to
show you guys something pretty simple so
you guys could get an idea okay try it
alive okay cool
the initial state the original state of
this app right here this component here
is count zero so the count is zero
automatically right so you have that
there so that's what we're seeing right
and then here we're basically printing
out the state that count but when we
click on a plus it adds a basically one
number more to it so it says okay zero
plus one you see here actions it says up
you click on up it goes and brings down
to the state and then we have access to
the original state that's here and then
it basically comes and says okay state
that count plus one is the new count
alright so the new count is no longer
zero is going to be one so we come here
and we just keep adding it through
actions automatically it gets changed on
the state right now it's the same thing
as we come in and press down so all of
this is done by actions so the only way
to change the state is doing it through
actions all right so that's what I want
you guys to to get to understand and see
how state works okay so there's the same
thing as here think about it like that
when you come to a website and this
things that you have here like Reina if
I click on Hart is going to say hey
you're supposed to log in you keep track
of that to state you find out what
going on throughout the whole
application and you keep track of it
through the state alright I hope this
makes sense for you guys I'm keeping it
super simple super easy something that
you guys can understand it alright I'll
see you guys later
Wow boy Joe back at it again I didn't
did it again man I came up with this new
