job back at it again man coding face.com
alright so we basically did the header
all right which is back here and now
we're going to do the body which is this
the card so right so we're gonna start
with that right so let's do this first
of all let's fix this on the header
let's make the header fixed so position
fixed all right
and then top oops top:0 left:0 and then
let's do with 100% so what that's going
to do is basically it's going to make
the header become just like this but
just in case you guys don't know about
this if we don't have with 100% this was
gonna happen to you see because what is
doing is saying hey there's only 25%
padding on this icons so the only space
that is taken is 25% up 25% to the left
20% to the right so that's only the only
space that's actually taken but what we
want to say to this and say hey the
header the container header it's
actually 100% of the screen so what we
do is we say hey give this 100% right
and now it should be working yeah see
okay now let's do this we're going to
actually put a z-index of let's say 50
pixels no matter of fact let's put a
z-index of whatever this size is so
let's say 100
25 plus 1237 now plus 12 is 49
yeah so let's say a 50 right so we say
we're gonna give this a C index of its
wedding all right
and then let's do for a body we're going
to do something like this we have two
container well we could just say
container I don't have to say body
container right so let's do something
like this
I'm gonna do a section and then we're
gonna say class and we're going to give
this container I'm sorry guys
I seriously hate this windows keyboards
I need to connect my MacBook now I might
buy my max keyboard two distinct is this
regular cables are pretty garbage I saw
anyways okay so let's say container and
then inside of it we're gonna say class
and then we're gonna call this card
yeah card
so you guys question to see what the
hell is going on we're going to do like
this put in the same window I'm going to
do like this okay so give this safe
we're going to call this card and want
to say wave 5500 pixels just so you guys
can see the difference right so we know
the container is going to be the section
that's behind it so is going to be
background size went back girls
background let's say right all right and
then card background is going to be blue
this just so you guys could see what the
hell is going on
now we definitely need to put some
height into this because as you can see
the div is not showing anything because
there's no height to it there's only a
width so now this should be saying yeah
there you go all right
and then container what isn't the
container showing anything yeah okay so
that's what it is as you can see you see
this container right here it's behind
this card so what we actually doing
right now because this thing is on fixed
is actually going on top of it so we
don't see the top of this thing this
card so what we're gonna do is say hey
container
pairing top 50 pixels see now there's
actually four hundred pixels here
because before this since this is fixed
it was on top of it and it was actually
on top of this thing but what we want is
for this container to actually start
after this this header right so we put a
low fifty pixels all right so let's say
we're gonna do something like this
margin:0 auto what that's going to do is
Center all right you see what's going on
now this container we're going to do hi
I'm going to do a like this all right
100% but what that's doing is actually
doing it from you know the full peach
size and that's not what we really want
because you see now you have an extra
space here for no reason
that little 50% that 50 pixels that we
put is actually messing it up so I'm
gonna see if this trick works with with
actually weird let me see position
absolute right and then we're gonna do
top fifty 50 pixels bottom zero hi
delete that yeah not us working all
right so it's only giving me from the
top to the bottom and then when I was I
need the extra space oh let me scroll
all right so that's exactly what we
wanted now let me the listing
who missing what was the thing I need to
do here we're 100% on the container
right now while we going to do
we'd only have to put in the padding top
my work and that's the matter of fact
yeah let's do the parents out
I love 50% now we're going to do this we
want to make the background walls to
color it
this was the color right
now let's de lewis the card background
is white you see let me see
now we wants to do a border oops
I'll put the size one pixel sadiq oops I
put on the road thing sorry guys alright
no where is the stinger this border
radius it's like a little curve at the
corner so what we do is you say okay on
the card what the hell this thing is
freezing right now okay what a radius
let's say three pixels
I don't know why this thing is acting up
maybe because I have so many windows
open you see it became a little corner
right there you just it's very subtle
but it makes a difference you know when
you have this little you know corners
like that you just give it a little
cleanness I don't know you know so all
right I'm gonna fact the little size of
it is even smaller than that so
border-radius 2 pixels all right so what
I'm doing right now is just pressing
ctrl s and it saves and it does you know
live reloaded for you all right
g-g-g-gia you already knows you put Joe
