out here grinding it's crazy I'm gonna
work your boy he put it but I just
wanted to give you guys a little I love
behind the scenes of the behind the
scenes yelling I'm saying like people be
asking Joe how you do your videos how
you do listen that guys here's the setup
man we keepin it 100 percent we got the
lights right there we got lights right
there we got lights right there we got
the Kenneth Cole reaction you know that
me Kenneth Cole box this how I know how
far I need to be away from things we got
the ghetto the ghetto spot right there
you know we got the ghetto tool somebody
needs to cut my my toenails you know I
mean don't be mad but yeah man
so this is gonna be how I'm setting
things up out here you know I'm not I'm
not doing nothing too crazy I'm
basically you know how we had we had the
ghetto the ghetto curtain we always have
something ghetto you gotta say like
right here
ghetto curtain part too you know what I
mean but yeah so this is like how the
sets coming through right now I mean is
that you're gonna say it's just how I'm
setting things up you know what I mean
I'm still thinking about painting a
couple of things here but how I'm gonna
have this is I'm gonna fill this up with
different things I might half a couple
of mac books which I have extra I might
put up right here I'm planning on
putting like some Gundams on the side
you know what I mean you know you could
never go wrong without this man this
this is not a Google device this is one
of the hood jump-offs man this is like
he goes on a 99-cent store and they give
you this makes the whole place smell
good you know what I mean then out here
we got a couple of boxes which I'm going
organize all of this stuff man well
Yammer is coming up alone man you know
little by little I keep it simple man
you know what I mean like we already got
a lot of stuff here
what I have to do is just organize
things how I really want it how you know
I want to take this channel you know we
started from the bottom and this is not
nobody it's out here Fuji we keeping it
a hundred you know I mean like we try to
make a million bucks with 10,000 you
don't on say listen but that's how you
start man this is the beginning this is
the beginning of countries calm there's
how people start you know you you never
see people come up out of nowhere and be
like man they got million-dollar studios
and this this and that
it starts somewhere you know what I mean
so this is the beginning right it
started from the first room that you
guys remember the ghetto curtain to get
up curtain still here in the house
somewhere I think is somewhere in one of
those those bags in there but we just
keeping it simple you gonna say started
from the bottom now we here started CSS
now we here started HTML HTML now we hit
yeah man we start Ernie's I mean then we
just gonna hang out hang out a little
bit I was gonna do a couple of videos
but battery battery died so pretty much
there goes the night I'm not I'm not in
the mood to put it to charge and then
come back like you know how high I am
man if I'm gonna move for something and
things go bad I'm like I'm not even
gonna do it for the day it's not meant
to be so it's like now turn the off
start to turn all this off real
quick you know one shot disconnect
things there you go
yeah we are out here we keep it simple
guys it's better to keep things simple
and do a shirt with the correct word
yeah that's crazy
20,000 subscribers now and not only that
of that what's crazy is that we did a
crazy life journey right one of the best
live streams I've had in a long time and
things got ugly
for some reason somebody got mad
somebody flagged my video and I'm like
oh man really
this one comes down to people flagging
videos yeah man it's just crazy but
what's up with you guys man yeah I'm
planning I'm planning on I'm getting you
know what I'm planning on getting I'm
planning on getting on just you know a
spin wheel or whatever I will dispense
and then put in different different
things there you know I started thinking
about that was like yeah you know what
we have that depending on whatever we
have for the day I could have a wheel
that spins with different different
things right so like let's say if we'd
be like yo let it roll cuz that's the
thing that's why we got flagged because
there were so many comments and so many
different things right that somebody who
was a hater say hey they're spamming on
the chatroom so basically I got I got in
trouble from YouTube because of that
because technically you can't do that I
didn't know that you can't
that people cannot just you know leave
comments and this dis net so what
happened people for flag some hater you
know what I mean somebody out there
hanging watching the livestream who
didn't win the shirt is like you know
what I'm basically gonna flag just do it
and that's what happened man your boy
got flag and that was some yes because
we had a very good livestream man very
very very good what you know how it is
guys when they see you winning but yeah
man Dakota face to do now man this the
start man like I'm gonna get another
spot before the I know after the end of
summer I'm gonna get another spot
like right now I'm over here Mike Craig
I'm gonna another spine will get my own
long studio so spot where we could be
like young I could invite you guys to
come down one wants to come through
could come through that's the part
that's the plan
yeah exactly I gave so much in the last
one but look at that now I can only give
to the first nine remember we had nine
original winners right which was the
people that actually were members of the
website people who were on the
livestream and then we had the people
who who I hit me up on social media like
Twitter and Instagram so now you know
what I gonna do Oh turning on the PC now
your boys out here on the PC now oh man
I feel like I feel dirty when I turn
this thing on I feel like I'm dirty for
some reason like I shouldn't be using a
Windows computer but to be honest with
you guys it's not that bad I'll be
honest it's actually not that bad yes I
have I have Linux on one hard drive
inside of this computer and then I also
have I have the regular Windows 10 all
right
and the reason why I got regular Windows
10 is I mean to support the people also
to for the video editing because I must
say I have a MacBook Pro this MacBook
Pro is maxed out well there's only so
much that I could do like all these
graphics that you guys have been seen
lately I wasn't able to do that on the
Mac because this thing is like you know
very heavy when it comes to the graphics
so you need the GPU to be be strong so I
got a diesel card in there you know so
this holds me down so I'm using the
windows for supporting like that's like
the installation of things cuz I know a
lot of people have problems for now
no js' and laravel installing my sequel
and all that stuff so basically what I'm
doing is I'm just setting it up for you
for them so like that that'll be like
okay now I know how to do it
what's today's content so these content
was just pretty much pretty much just me
coming in just these are behind the
scenes today I'm I don't know if I'm
gonna be doing you know a lot of CUNY's
if you're looking for code and stuff
like that I don't know if I'm will be
doing that this live stream it's just us
hanging out it's it's a day off you get
what I'm saying it's a day off maybe
tomorrow I'll do like a proper
livestream and I don't even know if I'm
gonna keep this monster so whoever's
here you're watching this once you're
gonna say so I feel lucky that you know
you whatever we do today I don't know
what we're doing whatever you're doing
so yeah well you actually seen this once
here what the hell I'm trying to I'm
trying to start up this game I want to
start a battle that was a battle right
yeah no I'm into all of these mobile
games like that's what I mean so
everybody be playing a whole bunch of
other stuff like to me what's that new
game that came out for tonight that
is wack what else is wack like stuff
that people play people were playing
hearthstone that is wack what else
people play I mean unless it's
NBA 2k unless is fight night unless is
UFC unless is mercy
it's like League of Legends or
battlefield Codel Call of Duty like
those type of games you know League of
Legends of course I'm not this game okay
guys if you aren't or League of Legends
or any game always add me at cotton face
always add me co2 face I'm on every game
out there you could think of sometimes
you might see me hop on that's okay if
you think that you can bust my ass come
on send me an invite yes do I play
League of Legends yes sir
that's what about to hit right now about
to hit that big a legend man real quick
I just created this new this new account
because I was like f that man like I had
another chemical anthrax OD but I used
to be cursing people out so that
freaking ban me after I after I had two
years in in this game they been
so it's crazy you ain't no so color so
calm I have heard of that in a long
time man Kevin Lopez says Joe I wasted
time learning Ruby on Rails and now I'm
an why do you think that Karen ain't you
from Boston there's a lot of jobs or
whatever in Boston's a lot of jobs for
Ruby or else what's going on you can't
find a job for Ruby and they say man you
gotta you gotta go out out your comforts
over there got a job with the merged
stack Congrats man Congrats
yeah so how people popping on that it's
good man if you got the opportunity
whatever stack you get your first job
you know be grateful enjoy it then don't
let yourself get too stressed out and
one thing that I always tell people I
came well never you feel stressed always
know that there's another job out there
waiting for you in that they're gonna
pay you way more money am i falling
asleep now not falling asleep I'm up
now falling asleep man I'm just reading
what you guys say what'd you think of
web flow I think what flow is cool but I
think what flow or bootstraps to do all
of those things are good for people that
can't code right or people that have a
lot of small clients if you have like a
whole bunch of little clients that asks
you Oh could you build me a landing page
for this and you build me a website for
this this and that like great super
simple like they don't care about what's
the stack they don't care about what's
the technology behind it they don't care
about you know they don't care about
none of that
then then basically what flow is perfect
for them but if you planning on doing
anything else besides that you're trying
to build websites then I guess it's not
good I mean it's not that it's not good
it's just the code that spits out it's
not really that good I think is great to
try it out and like I say prototype
something and maybe even like try to see
how it looks before you really go in
there and start cleaning up cleaning up
the code then it could be good for that
you know prototyping well I can let's
say you are a back-end developer right
thing all you want to focus is the
backend and you want to focus more more
on the logic something like what flow
will work for you because then you could
just build stuff by drag-and-drop real
quick and there from there just focus on
on your on your code you gonna say you
know this thing is a beautiful man you
guys gotta check this out I'm a little
review on on this and this freakin
screen I don't know if you guys can see
it man but this thing is like super
crispy I'm like maximum ultra graphics
whatever
you call it man like this thing is maxed
out man and the GPU is nothing crazy GPU
is like the one that I have is a 970 I
bought this yeah remember what I told
you I have bought this a while back yeah
I just never used it because it's a
Windows computer I didn't find no kitten
or a reason to really use it but now for
everything that I want to do with or the
website in in the YouTube videos you
know I'm finding a useful case for it
which is for editing my videos and
that's a that's why I was like doing
work I'll do that on my Mac so yeah man
yeah let's talk about cognac Oh ask me
any questions while I play right now
I'll answer it how you know I'll play
bottom me know hosting mark sites where
I do that you could go to github pages
you could go and open up your own
hosting with like a VPS so something
like namecheap.com or something like
that you know I mean so you can
definitely go like that if you want to
man I used to like have all my websites
on godaddy.com a long time ago man and
then my mom took took the credit card
wait it was I go they charging me too
much and this Desmet I'm like oh my god
because you know back in the days they
usually charge you for bandwidth man
like if you still get a lot of traffic
like they will pretty much rape you on
that now luckily you know you don't have
to deal with that now you can just go in
and pay for a cheap hosting you know for
less than even four dollars a month I've
seen hosting for $3 back in the days
that used to cost money man
even called daddy nowadays they
basically giving it away for free
because then I go right now that like
they can't really get that many people
on called that India like they used to
like developers are just hosting things
on github pages or now github pages like
github and using other services like
Heroku so it's like they lost a lot of
money
okay so nobody's really using theirs in
the services you know everybody's using
either AWS or Heroku or I think Libya
was a plain old digital ocean nobody's
really looking for GoDaddy you know
let's see what else I'm reading through
the whole thing that's my my character
gets to to the bottom lane let me see
Joe will you ever ever start your web
agency and be the CEO CTO um maybe I
might do it
I might do it it just depends depends on
the situation that I'm on you know like
right now
personally I rather I rather invest into
becoming a professor then actually
started like a digital agency because I
I just don't like the idea of managing
other people every time that I've I've
done that it just doesn't work out
because to be a manager you have to be
one of those people that just don't care
about things you're gonna say like even
here YouTube right people will be
telling me Joe why you be he's passing
out when people talk about you why
you spaz out when people to listen down
YouTube comments like you shouldn't care
like you're getting your money you're
doing this isn't that but it's like
that's not how I work I'm very
passionate so like let's say in my last
company after my partner left the
company he after he left right they
brought in a couple of people some guys
that were remote and they were not good
and basically I was responsible for the
whole company by myself and I hated it I
was like man I was stressed out every
single day like you could look up all my
videos from July from July 2017 I was
like miserable there I was like man I
hate this so and it's because number one
you have all the responsibility on you
so even owning your own digital agency
like I don't know like it doesn't really
attract me because the amount of stress
that I would have it wouldn't be worth
it for me unless it was like somebody
else manages it and like I'm the owner
you were saying like if I'm the owner
then yeah
I'm cool with it but what I'm not cool
with is me having to deal with other
people Oh me and me trying to help them
out you get what I'm saying like I don't
want to do that
as a man you need to start going to more
meetups you need to go to the big
meetups and that's where the chicks is
at but unfortunately you know
unfortunately you know fortunately and
unfortunately most of the girls who are
into coding there's a lot of girls who
are like they're just not into into guys
at all right they're not into guys
they're not into hooking up like which
is weird to me I think I think that's
weird
like you love to code you love to work
what I've to work with developers but a
lot of them would not be developers so
it's like unfortunately it's like one of
those situations where is like doesn't
make sense but you know that's how life
is
it's rare it's rare to see that you see
that most of the time like with
designers like if the girls are designer
the boyfriend or the husband is a
designer tool but it's weird to find
like a developer his wife to be a
developer so nothing that doesn't happen
by it's rape
not even I even if you pull over in the
Ferrari I don't think look I think I
think to become a developer you got to
be a special person right let's be
honest this is not for everybody
so you know the average chick what a fat
ass it's not the ones that you're gonna
find as developers that's just being
honest the ones that you're gonna find
there could be a couple of cute ones and
this doesn't that but they not looking
at you like that though you know look
like they'll respect you oh you're such
a great developer what they ain't
checking for you for that they're like
oh man he's a hot developer like I've
never met chick that's a developer that
looks good I mean to me that is like oh
my husband or my boyfriend is a
developer like they know already that
you know how the game is is like
everybody's busy everybody's constantly
learning you know this is not for
everybody not saying that I can't happen
but I just don't don't see that
happening all the time now can you get a
gold digger out there yeah of course but
then now you're simp you know what I
mean if you got a gold digger you become
a sin man those chicks were freaking you
know squeeze your pockets out man
listen before I saw the light man I wish
I was out here let yourselves out here
man
so I sort of like man I settle down
found wifey but before that I was out
here man you know hang them strip clubs
throwing money in the air even when I
was broke when I was broke it's crazy
like now that I have money to do things
that I used to do I don't do it but when
I was like broke somehow I would have
money to do it like it doesn't make
sense
you understand like it's like I know
people who live like you know projects
and got money to to go out clubbing by
the the latest Jordans you know now
everybody's on giuseppe d's and
Balenciaga
you know everybody want to be on that
high fashion right but not everybody can
afford that right and it's crazy just
now that I could afford it like I'm not
doing I'm gonna crazy stuff you know I'm
living simple but when you think about
it it's like they're like it's crazy
like why would you broke you want to
spend money that you don't have it
doesn't make sense
and then now why were you broke you want
to spend money that you don't have and
then when you have the money you don't
want to spend that money it's weird
right
you know a lot of times people don't
even think about this but even the
rappers you know the famous actors and
actresses like they use a lot of stuff
as tax write-offs you don't say like
they get a lot of those high fashion
clothes because the the companies give
it to them it's free promotion for them
it's like Jennifer Lawrence right
Jennifer Lawrence goes and gets any
Chanel or Louie or any type of clothes
that she wants but that's because the
companies give it to her you know people
think like oh yeah man I'm trying to
compete with this people but what you
don't understand is like there's people
that get it for free you know the more
money you get and the more popular you
become the less you you spend it's like
right now like Messi for example if I
come in and if I come in and I become I
don't know a super youtuber whatever
right some do is some Logan Paul type do
it right some one of those guys that got
mad subscribers right and get every time
does it come out they get bigger like
fifty to a hundred a hundred you know
subscribers and stuff like that to watch
it but if I was like one of those those
guys people would think that oh man you
know Joe's getting honest the stuff he's
balling he's buying this this and that
but what people don't take into account
that a lot of the stuff the companies is
giving it to me
or if I go and get like a whole bunch of
equipment like let's say - tech right or
the guys from unboxing therapy right if
you really think that those guys are
paying for all that stuff you gotta be
crazy more little stuff they basically
you know they get it for free
and if they don't get it for free what
they do is they basically write it off
all right I could go in and become a
tech reviewer right I buy this camera
about this camera cash then when I buy a
cash I do the review then I come back
exchange it I decide to keep a camera
what I do this camera I use it as a tax
write-off because it's part of your
business so when you think about it you
know when you broke you want to spend
money on all these things that you don't
have but especially because you're
trying to keep up with the Joneses and
keep up with people that do have it and
you're like man I want to get it just
like them I want to get the latest you
know latest graphic card or whatever and
then what they don't understand is that
those guys they get it for free or they
get an S a tax write-off which is
literally like for free like if I come
in and I spent let's say I earn a
hundred thousand dollars from you to
write for example I don't earn nothing
nothing like that right well let's say
an example I earned a hundred thousand
dollars from YouTube but I spent eighty
thousand dollars in equipment all right
all of those equipment are written off
so the money that I was gonna pay the
government has taxes all of that gets
written off
let me sing that the now's a good
question was it was it Joe and always if
somebody acts a good question somebody
asks something about Jodi your family
something can you write that again I saw
it a little bit but I couldn't really
see it can you write it again what was
the question they just went up super
quick yeah man so there's like a lot of
stuff you were like right now like you
know there's people there's boot camps
that keep hitting me up they're like oh
man we want you to we want you to go to
the boot camp for free like $20,000
worth of of stuff right then I go we
gotta pay for our brand new MacBook Pro
whichever you want the highest end we're
gonna pay for you to go over there and
we're gonna give you another $5,000 to
go to the boot camp right if I was
somebody who who was like man who was
like supporting boot camps then
basically that would be a great deal for
me you know what I'm saying make and
even for one of you guys let's say for I
said example like a lot of you guys
that's like oh yeah wanna get into this
right and if one of you guys wanted to
go to a boot camp for free hey that's
the perfect way started YouTube channel
that's just a bar code build it big
enough and then those companies are
gonna come to you so get it for free you
know what I mean so that's how things
are
but you know who else is gonna put into
work you know I mean like nobody's gonna
go there okay it says Yoda your friends
our family treats you different and
always asks for things when you mean it
no I mean yeah my mom always asks for
stuff but I don't think like the family
itself cuz I cut that off I was like
y'all don't think us I'm getting a
little something while I'm doing a
little bit better than you guys don't
mean that
I'm balling I'm not holding I'm
literally like I'm just a regular dude
right I make enough to pay for my credit
pay for my car pay for everything that I
have balling is when you have excess
money when you have money that you don't
even know what to spend it on you know
like the money that I do have I have
every single dollar County like I know
exactly what I'm gonna do with that
money
you know I wanna buy any and create a
career that I I'm gonna stay there
forever
also you know it's like I hate when
people its Opie me people I'm playing
League of Legends by the way I hate when
people been feeding somebody like the
whole game and then you're like walking
down the lane chillin and then you just
get massacred because people been
feeding this guy so whatever so yeah so
I just you know I keep thinking water
money a very financial financially
stable but I keep track of everything
that I do
like I have my mint account ID go
through my credit card accounts daily
like I don't just be out here bugging
out like I know what it is to be broke
and it's like if you make the wrong turn
you could be broke the next month like
you could pull out this month and next
month everything goes bad like let's say
for example you know this guy is like
literally like super Opie man this guy
we're two hits
I'm done like that's crazy okay so yeah
so it's like you make the wrong turn
that's it you back to being broke so for
me to not go back to being broke I have
to make sure I keep track of everything
you know me I gotta keep track of
everything that I do you know how much I
spent how much everybody that I'm with
expense
how much the baby spent how much wife he
spends how much we spend going out like
I'm one of those people I like to keep
track of everything you know because the
only way to really make a lot of money
is to have a lot of money right so for
me to make money I need to always have a
lot of money in my bank account
it sounds cliche because everybody says
it's like oh you know you need money to
get money and it's true
trust me I know cuz it's like I could
come here and have an amazing idea but
if I don't have the money you can't do
anything without it you can't do you
can't really execute that idea how you
want to like I could come here and say I
could build the best start on the best
startup in the world but if I don't have
the money it doesn't mean anything
because it was like without money you
can't do anything at all
why can't we see your play oh because I
wasn't expecting to actually play I was
just like showing people like the behind
the scenes of how you know I'm building
like my quote-unquote studio it's just
like a small set in my basement setting
it up how I want it so I just showed it
to the people I wasn't really expecting
to be here talking to you guys for like
40 minutes what are my next goals
I guess one I wanna call me face counted
grow like I wanted to grow bigger than
what it is I wanted to be able to do the
scholarships that I told you guys I want
to be able to get guys in there like
let's say people from like India
Pakistan know maybe Dominican Republic
guys who cannot afford the courses be
able to get into the website okay
because those are things that 99% of the
companies are not going to do you know
what I mean like teen treehouse is not
going to give it's not going to give
nobody nothing for free you know udemy
is not gonna do that
you know freako camp does it but it's
really more like practice is not really
nobody's really sitting down there and
teaching you know so I want to be one of
the first people to do that
to be able to delay was it Udacity
there's something like that but it was
like one course you know Rico thank you
thank you
I appreciate it
yeah so in reality this like how you
called us like
there's a lot of stuff that I want to do
but mainly just grow the channel I want
to grow the channel you know I don't
even care if we make it to a hundred
thousand takes us two years three years
I don't care I want coding face.com to
grow more than the channel itself
because the channel I can't do anything
with the channel I mean the biggest
youtubers right now can't even make
money you gonna saying something they
can't even make money and to be honest
with you like a half a lot of big dreams
so and it's not personal dream just
dreams of me being able to just help
other people you can't help people by
being just a regular dude you know what
I mean it's like some guy that that
works at a McDonald's I'm like yeah man
I want to change the world as a bro you
livin you work in a McDonald's man like
the most you gonna change is some guy
that's in front of the McDonald's you
know they by giving him a cup of coffee
like that's as much as you could change
the world you know but that's why I need
to actually make way more money than
what I'm making right now and I'll put
that pressure on myself because I want
to be able to do all those things and
improvise you know be able to say okay
how can we get kids in you know like I
was talking to my dad my dad he he
living in Dominican Republic right now
you know he lives in the Medicare
Republic and he basically he me and him
was going back and forth on on the idea
of like how did Japan become a
superpower and it's just an island you
know what I'm saying
like they're barely produce anything
besides what they made in the last you
know 78 years which is like technology
the cars building their own cars
building you know TVs computers chips
all those things
made it made it help possible so I was
like telling him like yo I don't
understand how a Dominican Republic
everybody is it's like even cousins of
Mines that I know they're like they
starting to to do marketing or they
starting to do accounting but there's no
jobs for that there's no future on that
you know counting there's gonna be money
in accounting always but what there's
not gonna be if the economy doesn't have
jobs who the hell are you gonna be an
accountant you're gonna sing like so
they gotta focus first on on doing
something that that's gonna have jobs in
the future so science and math should be
the focus of Dominican Republic but
nobody sees that as an option in
Dominican Republic they don't see that
as like a thing that's cool to be calm
it's like myself like I want more people
to be able to come in and when I go I
want to come what developer I will
become a computer science major I want
to become a developer software engineer
whatever etc right well how do you make
that happen you actually gotta make you
gotta make the career seem attractive
enough for people to want to spend the
time any you gonna say like if I see
some cornball dude if I'm like 12 years
old 12 14 years old I don't want to be
you know that cornball computer science
major geeky guy I don't want to be that
guy I want to be the guy with the girls
I want to be the guy with the money I
want to be the guy with you know the
nicest car that's in reality that's how
people really get attracted to things
right so many people want to become
doctors and lawyers it's not really
because they want to save lives and they
want to be you know be judges and and be
you know be helping people out in court
now they care about the money you gonna
say but here
in development of programming like this
isn't like an attractive career for
people people look at this as like y'all
this is like the nerdy nerdy is
like nobody wants to be in front of a
computer and that's just how it is you
know now more kids are getting more open
to it but for us to say like oh that's
not the reality that's the reality of
things like the general public don't
look at this as a as a option and that's
why so many people be crying like you
know like even all those Trump
supporters you know all those people
that are crying for jobs they're like
man you know we want Cole to come back
and discus Namek we want manufacturing
jobs as like bro like if you was into
science
you wouldn't even care about that you
like let the Chinese build everything
will be the one creating things will be
the one building the things here you
guys are saying but people are so
focused on other things that they just
don't see this as a as you know it's a
way to actually make a living
yeah and that's the thing too also like
you say government now everyone is into
science but why isn't everyone into
science it's not because science is
boring number one is that instructors
number two it's like you know you look
at science it's like the guys who teach
like a science class I like the worst I
don't know it's like the worst looking
dudes that you ever think of it's like
the nerdy is dude in the world like you
know when you are a little kid you're
not looking up to those guys you know
what I mean like it's like when you are
a little kid right what do you want to
be you want to be a cop you want to be a
firefighter you want to be astronaut you
want to become a doctor you whatever
right because those things are
attractive like you're not attractive to
attracted to like
so like guy with sunglasses on okay guys
today we're gonna talk about the atoms
like nobody cares about that
unfortunately you know it's like we live
in the age of Kim Kardashian you know
what I mean everybody wants to be Kim
Kardashian everybody wants to be famous
everybody want to be popular you know
people will do anything for it you know
you know the there's people out here
that rather be doing something
completely different then actually
they're actually becoming developers are
doing something cool like that and it's
also true because of the type of people
that that are in the field you know what
I mean it's like I always say oh got the
sauce you don't anything but listen this
is rarely any people like me and in what
development in programming in general
this like to see somebody like me in
what development is rare like I'll tell
you like who's the average average like
developer like if every developer was to
be like this person I would say like the
majority of developers are like function
function right so bias and I'm not
saying that is bad it's just saying like
some people are not going to get
attracted into the field with those type
of guys in the field you gotta say and
at the same time we don't need something
to the extreme of like you know other
developers that we've seen in the past
few days where they think taking it to
the extreme is what's gonna attract
people into the field that's not what's
going to attract people into the field
what tracks people is it's showing them
like hey man this is actually a career
you know what I'm saying
so
so yeah
while people are walling out online I
need to start banning people and you
know everything that I tell you right
now is just me being honest you know
what I mean I'm telling you from because
I look at things from the perspective of
the average person the reason why people
like my courses it's not because I'm
like yo I'm the most articulate person
now I break things down like a regular
human being you get what I'm saying I
got I'll break it down in a way where
people that is coming from any type of
field any type of class you can come in
and learn what development and move on
and get their job and it works all right
it's not because I'm like hey man and
this guy went to MIT is or he got the
best course now I can break it down in a
way where it's like anybody can learn it
you know but why can't more people do
that because they don't they don't tap
into the idea of you know just just like
listening to how people are you gave us
a like the general public like most most
developers are not in that same world
you get my saying
you know this game is horrible Reina
if Beyonce talk about stem that wouldn't
change yeah no I wouldn't it wouldn't
change anything but if let's say right
now like let's say like let's say Kanye
West right if Kanye West opens up a
startup instead of him trying to do what
he's been trying to do which is fashion
if he says hey man I'm gonna start a
startup you know kodanda which he
already did but it's mostly for design
he says I'm gonna start to start a
startup kodanda and it's gonna be about
all developers from all over the world
right that will definitely do a big
change that will do a big change in the
industry because it will attract more
people into the field and open doors
like ain't nobody checking ain't nobody
checking for Bill Gates you get what I'm
saying like Bill Gates ain't doing
nothing for nobody like that's the
reality of things like you nobody
looking into Bill Gates ain't nobody
even looking into there was this guy's
name when Steve Jobs was alive people
was hurt because when he died because
they loved the products but he wasn't
like bring your people into the field
you gonna say like those people don't
have that type of reach
like for you to start bringing in more
people it has to be like somebody has to
actually spearhead to halt the whole
system and just be like okay that's what
we're doing we're supporting new
developers we're getting this out we
started a start-up we're starting a
program that you know from jr. you know
Jimmy high school kids are learning to
code same way that they're wasting
timing and a little like you
know choir I remember going to chorus
class and and like that like
stop wasting time on that like give kids
something that they could really do and
that they can really get a job for get
okay got okay kill okay jay-z started
title and no one cares no jay-z didn't
start title jay-z bought title which was
a company that was already there and it
wasn't doing good before him and it
wasn't it's still not doing good
especially because the way how he try to
market himself you can't be rich and you
can't be a millionaire and cried to
people and tell them as the artist we
could recreate art and we need to get
paid more than sigh bro like you are a
billionaire like how much more money do
you want like yeah you know you already
got paid you don't need to get paid
again or you don't need to get paid even
more
that's how regular people look at things
the reason why a lot of startups and
ideas fail is because they don't put
themselves in other people's shoes you
got what I'm saying like they just don't
put themselves in other people's shoes
playing Jay Z failed at that because he
literally brought in a whole bunch of
artists and put him on a stage and say
oh we deserve to get more money and we
create the art and you guys should
support us and he's like nah you already
made money people don't care about
people that are
we have money yeah see the effort for
said one thing that makes sense so it's
like you know one thing I hate about non
coders is that I tell people I mean I'm
doing computer science and they're like
oh what'd you do fix computers and I'm
like nah you know what I mean like
that's not what he does
people don't understand they don't have
enough information and sadly I think
it's even worse in minority it's like
you tell people like I remember being
like 14 years old I always bring this
back I used to tell my mom all the time
like yo I want to become a developer I
want to become a programmer my mom will
be like what the hell is that like
you're gonna be a graphic designer
like they don't make no money you need
to be a stockbroker you need to go to
Wall Street you got to do this and that
you know what I mean so that's why I
switched my career like three four times
and then I talked to my friends and my
friends would tell me like oh man that's
that's not nerdy she like you like
you're not gonna get there you're not
gonna get nowhere with that you know
what I mean so I didn't do computer
science because of that cuz I was like
you know what they they're probably
right man I'm not gonna I'm not gonna do
good in computer science I will do
something else you know now it's me
being young being dumb and looking for
other people to to validate what I
wanted to do in life but nowadays I
don't care about what nobody thinks you
know but like I said to bring people
into this field and not only just into
the field just to show people like this
is an option you have to make it
accessible to people and be able to show
them like yo why this this field is
why they should become developers the
opportunities that they have you know
how many people come in and tell me all
the time is like your job you know you
motivate me you you actually made me
realize that you did it and now I could
do it like that's it
that's what I wanted to do be able to
show people like hey if I did it and I
didn't have nobody when I kid when I
started this whole this whole journey to
become a developer I basically started
at zero there was nobody that I could
relate to those nobody that I felt like
oh man
if I listen to them they're gonna save
me time and nowadays like for you guys
if you guys listen to me you learn from
my mistakes
you pretty much learn from all of the
mistakes that I did before when you are
a lot give me a second I almost forgot
about this Jesus Christ this is what
Thomas is number 36 yes so you learn
from from our mistakes man you know
people you should just like things I
tell people here it's not for everybody
right it's not now everybody's gonna
take it and and do something with it
people never listen to it and it comes
out the other year you know the majority
of people they don't take action into
things they don't come in and be like
okay I'm on the list that what they do
is they waste time
what hell is instant okay now I'm
getting navigating oh my god
yeah I'm actually doing right now my my
state taxes I totally forgot today is
the 17 I didn't look at the day on my
wall and then I look at the time I got
10 minutes I got 12 minutes so actually

information to actually file this this
