boys you're back at it again man cutting
face calm your boys backing out and did
it again yes we got the people back
we got the mentorship season two is back
we don't did it again kids yo we got
your boy Aaron we got cam we got Sam we
got your boy Robinson
we got a squad man you know one more
person was supposed to be here you know
is that person who already got cut you
know what I mean so this is how are we
doing it we switching it up this year
right this season right we coming in we
give them everybody a project right
we're giving everybody a project a
matter of fact there's gonna be three
projects that they could choose from
every single week they choose one and
say hey there's the one that I can do
right this one that's gonna be easy
this one's that's gonna be intermediate
and this one that's gonna be hard right
people get to choose which one they they
want to tackle it's undone they don't
have to finish the whole project but
they need to finish at least a minimum
of three of the sections you know three
sections you know it's gotta be a single
page or website right and then there's
multiple sections but they need to
finish at least three of them right
everything doesn't have to be perfect
but what needs to be there is just you
know the heart come in in the
determination being able to show up you
know so that's pretty much it and there
was the low twist of this right is every
week somebody's getting cut all right so
every single week somebody's getting cut
luckily for this guys somebody already
got cut so that means they good you know
what I mean they they go for next week
you know nobody gets cut so what we're
doing is we're gonna look at a couple of
things I'm gonna ask a couple of
questions to the boys see you know see
where they from give you a little
background so you guys can know who they
are you know and then we actually given
the power to you guys to decide like
y'all this is the person that's getting
cut because we're now filling him we
just we see that he's not trying
you know really work hard he could you
know his work was more advanced he could
have chosen the more advanced project
like little things like that you know
people decide who gets cut of course
aquavit Oh anything cuz you know they
gotta be trolls out there they were like
ah we don't like him he came with the
orange where everybody's voting for him
now if I know he's doing his work I'm
vetoing that it's like I'm going to the
next second option that whoever form
like you know for what everybody picked
you know what I mean
cuz you know it's the internet you know
there's a lot of trolls people might
come in here and be like you know you
know what man we don't like Sam he's not
a beer you know what I mean like that's
it that's it
so somebody gotta control the kids you
know what I mean
so anyways right now hold on before we
continue with this pull up the live chat
room to make sure I give a shout out to
the people that's in here man you know
without you guys this wouldn't be
possible without you guys this wouldn't
be here so we definitely want to give
you guys a shout out and all the
supporters and everybody that's here man
you know if you know a couple of people
that watch this show and watch this
channel go make sure you let them know
we live right now 9 p.m. Eastern Time
right now we're here we got a couple of
people in here man you know what I mean
so yo Tyler send me your email right now
so you could hop on right now the other
person that was supposed to show up and
show up come scoop that spot Samia is
even right now this how we doing is cut
through out here kids hit him with hit
him with the left
Ginobli kid you know what I mean yeah we
just gonna have fun so anyways they
started up with an introduction real
quick so the first one that we got is
Aaron Aaron go ahead son to the people
man scare people
my name's Aaron I'm from Staten Island
New York you know the program for a
little bit I'm you know I'm doing a
bachelor's program to be honest you know
I know a few things I know I'm learning
some web development
EML CSS so a beginner you know I mean
what we learn in every day so we're
trying to learn a lot right now so
that's about it cool cool cool cool cool
yo cam go ahead go ahead yeah most
people most people know about me I'm cam
I'm in the community
I'm from OKC home of the Thunder and I'm
ready to learn this stuff I even took
out a took time away from work to be on
this so I'm serious about this
nice nice the hustle you know what I
mean like he's out here he's grinding he
said I'm doing overtime tomorrow I got
you boss I'll be back
you know what I mean that's how we do it
out here man so let's go with Sam what's
good Sam are you from let the people
know who you is
okay yeah I'm from Illinois yeah I just
I've been looking at a programming you
know I mean I'm pretty familiar with PHP
vanilla JavaScript a little bit that's
about the only thing I have that I can
get to an employer's something that they
don't you know it's it's pretty it's
pretty original you know but yeah I
probably could test you know I effect
ibly yet no but I mean I can write I've
created stuff and react JavaScript oh
that's what I'm working on right now PHP
 back in languages yeah so you
comfortable HTML CSS oh yeah okay Cory
well definitely that's definitely a
requirement all right so all your boy
Robinson probably got the least
experience of all these guys English
English history degree but not for me
just decided to change what I wanted to
do I've just been grinding ever since I
mean it's been probably about six months
so I'm just you know I'm comfortable
with CSS HTML Javascript I know a bit of
vanilla and no joke with no jQuery so
just learn
banning everyday that's what we hear man
that's over here we here to test the
limits man cuz you know what I mean like
this whole thing is not really a
competition which is what I tell people
right that's how people this is not a
competition what this is basically hold
you accountable to really go hard right
because right now you can do this on
your own you but I hey I'm gonna find a
design myself I just build them out on
my own time you know what I mean I guess
it's not really you know telling you oh
man I got to do this but what this does
is holds you accountable to really come
in you know go hard the things that you
don't know you know like you might be
finding yourself trying to position
something right in in one of the designs
you be like oh man internal position
this is exactly how the design is right
but if you didn't have that design from
this show here you probably wouldn't
even try to build that on your own you
know what I mean like this is going to
help you push forward man so I wanted to
ask you guys a little bit about the
background like you know from you guys I
mean Aaron says he's in school right now
so I mean since when do you want to get
into this thing right since when do you
want to get it into since when I wanted
to get into web development I see videos
and you made a sip like simple to learn
and and I could see myself like picking
it up so I've always been into computers
and stuff like that ever since high
school you know video games and then
like the things you could do a program
and nowadays is kind of it's insane like
you could you can make actually your
phone like honestly I just want to what
the velum it's gonna be the stepping
stone because who knows what else you
can learn how that you know it means
exactly and now definitely that's
exactly what I tell everybody manda is
just the beginning you can come in here
you know what development is just the
easy easy way into the industry learning
programming then from there sky's the
limit you could be building robots next
year you know what I mean like of course
it's not gonna be easy but it's a
learning curve you know what I mean like
it starts you off easy
and at the same time you start earning
money you know what I mean like we all
have dreams you all want to accomplish a
lot of things but the same time you
can't do anything without no money
there's no point of you saying hey I'm
super smart now I'm super talented in my
house if you're not earning anything
right so in that journey of you becoming
whatever exactly isn't that you want to
be literally have this career that you
can actually be doing alright so yeah
definitely agree with you will matter so
how about you can tell the people why
you ain't here how long you been doing
this
yeah I've been doing this I think since
March you know I've joined the community
I saw your video Joe and I really love
everything you're talking about then I
really did this mentorship because I
feel like I need that extra push to get
to the next level so I can get a job
after this because I feel like I got all
the basic skills HTM HTML CSS and
JavaScript I just need it all put it all
together and be able to build websites
and stuff it's nice how about you Sam I
mean I know you were saying that you
know HTML CSS JavaScript so I mean how
long you've been doing this I just put
in like a couple hours here and there
probably for four hours a week or
something like that an hour a day four
days or something but sometimes I you
know I'm really I really you know if I
have a project or something I you know I
try to you know I spend a lot more time
on it just to yeah probably
several months five or six months okay
that's good man
I tell people man with you know I think
it's like this for me the first month is
just like you get that little tickling
feeling of like I want to do this you
know second month is like you're trying
to figure out what resources where to
learn and who to follow what's the best
book what's the best website what's the
best course and then everything from
there honest really
you know what I mean so I definitely on
that so that's pretty cool man
also too so how about you Robinson
you've been doing this for like such
been doing it for under six months I
left University but when I was in
university there was some introductory
course to like what web developmental
and we had to build a tape website from
using old-school divs and tables and I
liked it and then what actually made it
even better was I had a part-time job
when I was at university and I was
basically pushing trollies that like
saying this place for Sainsbury's and
this guy who looked you know he looked
behind his twenties got in his Porsche
and I was like know that I asked him I I
went up to him was like what do you do
then he was our I just made my own
software company and you know I've built
a couple of apps and then I was like no
ways and I think after that it's kind of
when I it was app I never knew there's a
lot of money in that at the same time
when I did my introductory course you
know it was only three months but I
liked it you know it was cool I was
excited I was building footings little
web sites to just give tags and although
we're using Dreamweaver and I know
Dreamweaver you know Big Chief but fell
into another oh yeah let me let me get
into this but I've been suffering from
learning reading learning reading
learning reading I'm not building enough
that's that's why I want to do this yeah
yeah no definitely because you can fall
into the trap of like you know I was
telling people the you know this week
was that thing this week I released a
video about our freako camp and people
is like you know the hay is like massive
it's like a wave of zombies of like
freako camp like you know it's like
people really think that I was like
going against freako camping it's not
that what I'm saying is you can fall
into this trap of you know spending all
this time learning and learning and just
learning project to project to project
so you know to do app to to do average
and this and they're like and you're
following along well you're not really
building solid projects the real things
that's gonna push you because when you
get a job your job is not to do it right
your job is not
hey could you create a little drop-down
menu if you find a job like that then
you're lucky you know what I mean your
job is gonna be like somebody come up to
you but I think how can we make this
phone fly and make this thing you know
do a 360 in the air and you know it's
like it's gonna be complicated right so
you want to be ready for situations
where people is gonna hit you up with
things that you've never done right we
could all be in a comfortable space and
be like oh all I want to do is just
follow along a project and you know go
in there and be like okay cool this is
what an array is this is whatever
multiple choices where they give you the
the the answer is they're you know it
doesn't work like that in the real world
so you definitely you came here for the
right reasons man so now like I said the
rules of this thing which I'm gonna show
it up here man you know we're gonna
bring this up I'm gonna share my screen
with you guys we got this it's got the
mentorship show guys so pretty much
requirements HTML CSS JavaScript
creativity or any when I said creativity
is just you gotta use your brain right
is that simple there's nothing that's
gonna save you from this just use your
brain that's it if you got a Google
something Google if you got a check out
on Stack Overflow check on Stack
Overflow if you gotta ask me a question
ask me a question you know that's about
it having a camera a microphone in a
decent internet connection you know no
pun intended try to stay away from you
know Verizon because I have to work
service Edler but just in case you know
you try to connect to a Wi-Fi you know
when we do this videos you know going
back again to the rules every week you
will receive a new project you don't
have to finish every single section of
the project but must do your best okay
must show interest in being here if
you're showing up and you you look like
you know you'll be here like watching TV
or you're talking to your mom or you're
you're like talking to your little sign
somewhere and your son
like Daddy controller like you know what
I mean like this is not the place for
you because people want to be here this
is not you know I'm doing this out of my
own free will and you guys too it's like
you know people actually send me over
you know over 27 emails and I chose you
guys right so you know let's let's not
spit on the faces of those people that
couldn't be here you know what I mean so
make sure you you want to really be here
and then last one is the audience will
vote for who to eliminate in if the host
feels the same as that person right will
now be part of the show the next week
right if we feel like you're just not
going hard like every week we gotta
eliminate somebody now does it mean that
you are a bad developer doesn't mean
that you're you're not supposed to be
here no it doesn't mean that it just
means like hey we just have to choose a
you know top one top tool of like people
who we feel that just really want this
bad right and like I said somebody was
supposed to be here so pretty much they
they kicked themselves out you know I
mean so didn't show up so what that
means is you guys get a free week
everybody gets a free week here so this
week you're good the next week you guys
are good the week after that we have to
go with the votes all right so what
we're going to do now is we're going to
start looking at the project all right
because there's three projects and you
guys get to choose which one you guys
want to do all right
and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna send
it to you guys after the show just so
you know so you guys can have the files
yourself and you could go over and then
you choose which one you want to pick
alright so let me see let me open this
up so the theme of this is gonna be
ecommerce okay I don't know can you guys
see this
you have to see this right yeah I could
see yeah all right all right cool
so pretty much there's the website that
you guys one of the website that you
guys can pick to choose to actually
build I mean all of these three websites
are built around ecommerce for sneakers
shoes it can be anything that you want
you guys could decide hey I don't want
to do it about sneakers I want to do it
about t-shirts I want to do it about
clothes I could you know you could
change it the images is just images the
design then that's something different
that's something that you gotta keep it
the same right now it's like we're
looking at this thing you can build all
this stuff you might think in your head
oh man I don't have the images I don't
have the background I don't know how to
do this thing here this triangle all of
the things that you're seeing can be
done through regular CSS right also like
I said you don't have to finish every
single section let's say I'm looking at
this section right here right and I say
hey you see this triangle I can't do the
triangle but I can do this part and I
can put an image here so yeah so finish
that right do it you don't have to go in
and create a background exactly how it
is all right all of this stuff is doable
all right what other stuff you could
definitely do this stuff right here
might seem complicated but it's 100%
doable like this is pretty much just one
image in the background you put a
gradient on top of it that's it this is
just text this right here is just text
that you could put all of the stuff you
could do it with z-index okay it's
pretty simple this thing this whole
section is the same thing you can do
this whole thing with z-index you don't
have to do every single thing like if
you will so be like oh all I have this
image here and four images here you
don't have to do the sneakers on the
background now if you really want to go
hard and show your hard work then you
will put that sneakers title on the
background alright see it's the same
thing like here all you have to do is
just build the sections here okay don't
you know don't drown in a
that's why I tell people all the time
you look at the design you break it down
section by section all right you got a
header up here all right after the
header you got this top top section here
then from there you have another section
for logos then you got another sections
for Jordans or whatever the limited
edition release of whatever clothes are
t-shirts whatever you decide to choose
right the images like I said you can
find images on google for all the items
that you have here like you can
literally go find them like it doesn't
have to be this glasses it doesn't have
to be the sneakers doesn't have to be
none of this stuff right just if their
sneakers find sneakers that's it
all right now we're gonna look at the
other one come here
that was one now I want you guys to
start deciding which one you guys think
you could change it later on but I want
the people to know the people the
viewers to know which one you guys are
leaning more towards - is it the first
or the second one the third one now
don't tell me right now
tell me at the end after I show you all
of them so there's the second one is a
pretty simple to me is the simplest one
like is very simple you don't have a lot
of complicated things on it all right
all of this stuff like you see like this
shadows this background so you don't
have to do that at all you just have to
do like pretty much the things that make
sense like this image here and this
image here the title all right that's it
that's what you really have to do this
one you can build this with regular CSS
background like I say it's just a
regular background with image gradient
on top of it this was the same thing
side or title this is three images a
button that's a this is a whole bunch of
images like you know Instagram styled
here
like a a section for emails and of
course the footer all right pretty
simple to me this is the simplest one
you guys can definitely choose that one
now let's see this other one I think
this one's another one that's this one's
intermediate because this one has a lot
of activity that's what I call it has a
lot of activity like this has a lot of
stuff to do like you got the header you
got breadcrumbs then from there you got
a you know you got a form here where
it's like you got the drop-down you have
buttons here to buy to sell you got
share that's a portfolio follow you got
the image different here you got product
details
then this graph you do not have to add a
graph here now if you wanted to really
go hard this distinct old charts gs you
could literally do this on charts do yes
all right that's on you if you really
want to go the extra mile you know you
want to impress me you want to impress
the people you want to impress yourself
you know to really go hard because
sometimes you know 99% of the times when
you at work they're gonna tell you hey
do this graph so now you have to do the
research on where to find a library for
grabs and you know it's all on you you
don't have to do this but this will look
nice if you do it all right now the next
thing is just like I recommend the
section for for the people related
sneakers a footer and like a copyright
section alright now that's about it kids
so I want to know which one are you guys
actually leaning on so like which one we
would you like to do what do you call it
imma go first let's see mm-hmm I'm
leaning towards the third one to be
honest I feel like I feel like I could
do that one okay that's what is a
comfortable I'm still a beginner but I
think I can really make it up not as fun
if you guys wanted to go with the
when you could do it definitely which
one will you go with camp cameras like
okay okay okay
I wasn't going with the third one but
since he went to the third one I'm gonna
go with the first one okay yeah now
that's fine I think to be honest with
you guys the third one it has a lot of
activity when I mean activity has a lot
of little things like breadcrumbs which
there's really in reality the small work
on that one
but it's easier work than every other
everything right right because
everything else is gonna deal with a lot
of positioning and a lot of you know
working with the backgrounds and and
just making everything in the right
places right
but the third one has a lot of activity
it might look easy my league like a lot
of you know it's like simple but it's a
lot of work trust me I've done websites
like that it's like breaking down into
layouts and HTML and I'm doing the CSS
it's gonna be a little work
all right now um Sam which one you try
to lean okay which one is just the
beginner or whatever but just based on
the look I like the first one cool cool
cool that's not too much do we got just
like just my preference yeah yeah no
that's fine if also too if you guys find
yourself you know you fit you like let's
say an example you go and you finish one
right and you want to go hard even like
kill you know what I finish wood and I
want to do another one you could do that
too or if you say hey you're in between
you finish one and you want to start
another one that's fine all right you
say hey I started one I started the one
that I chose here today and then I
decided I want to switch it up because I
didn't like it whatever I want to do
something else any moment you could
choose to switch it up but at the end of
the day you need to come back and pretty
much just you know come back and show me
one that you say okay there's the
project that I'm presenting for this
week all right
how about you Robinson
second one second you which one second
one second one the big boot open it up
yeah all right now that's fine that's a
good start man
you know I want you guys to really go
hard man there's you know you have a
whole week you know this is what I told
people the last season but nobody wanted
to listen to me you know people is like
man you know i'ma do this on Tuesday you
know Tuesday coming is like time goes by
you're like oh man it's Thursday night
I'm gonna start tonight don't leave her
for the last day man don't leave it for
the last two days number one is on you
you know you wanna you want to be able
to come and have time to fix it you know
like if you start this weekend if you
start today you start tomorrow
where we or whatever time it is on your
section you know wherever you live if
you start today or tomorrow you have the
whole weekend to knock it out and then
throughout the week just fixing the
little things in but I okay I want to
perfect this I want to go in there or
even for you Aaron you could go in there
and be like oh man you know what I
wasn't gonna do the graph but because I
finished everything this weekend I have
this whole week to figure out how to use
charts ts on and bring out the graph for
the the project right you know what I
mean so so just take advantage of time
man don't leave things to last minute
because this is something that happens
even in a real job people just leave it
for last minute and you know the
deadline is on Friday and Friday comes
up and you're like oh man you know we we
we left the for last minute and now we
gotta stay here so super late working on

next week we're going to basically come
in you know what I'm gonna do is on
Friday I'm gonna matter of fact probably
after the show I'm gonna talk to you
guys send you guys an email you guys
decide like a time right you could
decide a time by Friday right if you're
done before Friday and you're like yo
Joe can we do the meeting now guys I'm
open
you know what I mean like you guys
decide your time like I know Robinson
he's like in England right now so it
would be crazy to be like y'all Aaron
you gotta be Robinson you gotta be here
every day at two o'clock in the morning
like you don't have to do that you tell
me that hey there's the time that I want
to do this like you know something like
a 9:00 p.m. for you which is like things
like
we have 4:00 p.m. for me I could
definitely set it up for you and yeah
and for everybody else here too I know
cam works cam if you you know if you
gotta work on Friday and you wanna hear
I know I gotta work on Friday what I
could do is actually you know finish the
project before it it doesn't matter when
you finish it and when we do the meeting
you guys decide that but by Friday we
need to you have your project done and
we have to do a meeting want to
because the the way how I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna go in one two one look at your
project look at your code with you see
the things that you did if your code is
looking sloppy I'm gonna tell you your
code looking sloppy if there's some
things that you could have fixed I'm
gonna tell you you could have fix this
make the font a little bit smaller here
make it a little bit bigger here the
image should be a little bit to the left
whatever it is right and then from there
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take that
we're gonna record that whole meaning
that we're gonna have which most likely
is gonna be maximum 20 minutes right so
then from there I'm gonna copy it save
it you know cut it cut it up you know
and then from there put in the
highlights for the next show for next
week right now the show is not going to
be live like I said for everybody the
show is gonna be on coding phase calm
and we'll be on YouTube I will release
it on YouTube in two weeks from now
right so if APIs ode came out today here
I'm releasing it two weeks from now on
YouTube right and that's exactly how
we're going to do it it's like a
two-week delay and the reason why we're
doing this is because we want more
people to come into the website register
to the website because I'm putting in so
much content for you guys and there's
gonna be multiple shows that I'm
creating this other things that I want
to do with everybody here I'm like I
said I'm planning on going to different
events and other stuff that's gonna be
exclusive content to coding phase com
you know YouTube is just a platform for
you guys to find us but at the same time
we have our own platform we're not
dependent on YouTube or whatever it is
now the whole thing is completely free
people be freaking out they'll be like
oh my god I gotta go to coding phase a
comma I gotta pay a membership no about
50 to 60 percent of everything on the
website is free guys all you have to do
is register it's just like the same
thing as YouTube you signup to YouTube
that's it you know I mean so I'm gonna
show you guys right now
where is that we're gonna open up a
window I just want to make sure that
everybody has a right thing you go to
coding phase comm after you go to coding

till the end you know what I mean
mium I'm in-between to be honest with
you I'm in between cam and Robinson I
think I like Aaron I like Aaron I think
he he he's doing good but I feel like
kinda he kind of played it safe
picking the the third project is like a
safe project it's not really pushing
yourself right now if he comes back and
does the graph then he really pushes
himself you know but let's see let's see
how it goes let's see how it goes let's
see if everything is good
now I like all of them I like every
single one of these guys I want all of
them to you know make it to the end you
know but let's see how it goes and yeah
man make sure you vote if you have a
vote it make sure you vote who you think
is going I'm going to show up who's
going to to win to the end
why are you Joe will you survive to the
n-word you guys are crazy
yeah man we in here
50 people watching man I want you guys
you know it's funny we catching more
people the more than that we stay alive
and if you haven't seen the show you
quit actually unless you're on your
phone if you're not on your foot I mean
if you're on your phone I don't think
you can rewind it you could just watch
his life right now but if you're not on
your phone you could literally you know
rewind this and watch from the beginning
you know you could just go over here
drag this little thing and bring it all
the way to the beginning all right come
down here
this was a show started I introduced
everybody you know we are introduced
Robinson Sam your boy came Aaron you
know so let's see how it goes man word
man
kids man I'm just excited man I'm
looking at I'm looking at the chatroom
and the people's man make sure you click
here who you think will survive to the
end man all you think is going to
survive this is very important man if
you haven't I need everybody to vote man
I need everybody to vote every week I
need you guys to vote straight up man
I need you guys to vote no lie I need
you guys to vote like I want this to be
good I want everybody to have a good
chance you know because in reality is
the people that's gonna decide who's
gonna stay who's gonna go you know also
- you guys got to look at everybody's
projects and look over at what they did
you know what I mean and it's like right
now right for example right now cam is
leading the way with 68 percent right
now let's say everybody everybody here
votes for cam all right to get kicked
out all right for next week if everybody
vote for cam to get kicked out in us I
feel Robinson is the one that should get
kicked out for you know I mean it's not
really getting that was really more
getting cut so I will say hey I'm not
gonna vote for cam because cam is not
really doing you know doing something
bad I feel that he's doing a good work
cuz sometimes people vote for their
favorite person you know sometimes
people vote for people they just don't
like the but I just don't like this
person I'm gonna vote against him you
know if I see that happening then I'm
gonna be like yo you guys don't have a
real valid reason for why he should get
cut I would choose Robinson this and
that you know what I mean like I will
veto or whoever it is you know it could
be Aaron could be Sam you know what I
mean like I'm going to decide on who who
you think is going to survive till the
end but yeah man we in here we live man
yeah man that's exactly how it is man
it's not that it's not a democracy
Philippe it's just at the same time we
we have you know the Internet is a
there's a lot of people that are trolls
you know what I mean like people could
come in here and start trolling but I oh
they just let us kick came out and cam
has like the best project there's like
wait what why is people trying to you
know get him out you know what I mean so
I'm gonna also do like if I agree with
the the people's I will also say okay
you guys got it now if it's like 50/50
between one person another person I feel
like both of them are on the same level
and then the people's choose somebody
who to kick out I'll be like okay we're
gonna go with them you know what I mean
we're gonna go with what the people say
I just try I'm gonna try to make you
favor for everybody sent man you know I
mean exactly
Filipa says I know man you're right it's
about - it's about who is the hungriest
and works the hardest exactly yeah I
feel like whoever pushes themselves
because that's the whole reason why this
show is here man it's for people to go
really hard and and create cool stuff
and just like get stayed motivated right
and use this as a platform for them to
continue working hard you know what I
mean so that's what we're doing man
right now is like we hear we're doing
the the higher colas like the recap you
know what's the name of the show that
they do right after The Walking Dead
you know that's what we're doing right
now
we're man don't forget I got 50
people in here guys man come on it's 50
people in here right now and we have and
we literally have like I think like 25
27 volts man we need more than that man
come on stop being lazy guys you see
this here you see this link on the
bottom you know refresh this page if you
on this page if you're on your phone
you're on your phone you know what I
mean you can't do anything but if if
you're on the page itself listen
refresh the page you will see the link
right here to the freaking forum so to
vote for who is who you think will
survive to the end
currently the the winner for this week
that people are voting for is camp now
our people voting because they think
Cameron's going to win and survive till
the end or they're voting because they
want to see camp state I want you guys
to you know next week right now this is
for fun and giggles right but next week
when we go and we start doing the videos
man I need you guys to really like
really really go hard and and and pretty
much choose the the right person because
it will be really messed up if like man
if somebody's really doing a really good
job indistinct and you like voting for
cam just because of it you know so you
gotta vote for whoever you really think
your wind is you know who you think is

we in here we in here we in here we got
the squad you can stay till 12 I instead
listen last thing to talk like today I
got things to do kids I got a cold man I
got a project that I'm working on that I
want to release pretty soon so I got a
co2 you know what I mean so with a music
at listen man man no hot the no course
man the no courses is there man
a lot of you guys listen that's another
thing too man
a lot of you guys told me like y'all do
the node.js course I'm alright cool I
did it like five people are actually
doing it cuz everybody else is doing the
other courses so it's like I finished
that and then like nobody nobody's like
really doing the nodejs course I'm like
y'all I'm about to leave it alone for a
little bit and you start on that PHP
course cuz I feel more people wanna do
the PHP course then - no J yes so I
might just start that I don't know what
you guys think about that
yeah let me know what you guys think
about that should I just start the PHP
course put nodejs on hope yeah let me
know what you guys think the authentic
mad aggressive with PHP
[Laughter]
yeah man you gotta check the website man
I keep getting look I keep getting a lot
of people subscribing every single day I
have people coming from you to me and
they're like man I'm not I'm gonna you
to me but I like your courses I'm gonna
go subscribe to your website I literally
think with all the courses that I have
there you have a good solid three to
four months not them not three for like
three two to three months of solid
courses that you could be working on on
my website right now right in every
single day I'm building new ones right
and new tutorials and expanding on
different ones like I'm gonna expand on
the react one like if you bought the
react course you're also going to get
another project that I'm building right
now which is the reason why I wanted to
leave right now I'm building another
project and react to yes for the people
that want to continue learning more
about react all right
and this time is gonna be working with
firms okay so that's what I'm doing and
then another thing that I wanted to do
was exactly what funny but you said
right now which is no js' and using
react for you know server-side rendering
so I wanted to do that too for the
people on the react course
yeah man now
start worried about Wix and Weebly like
those those websites are for people that
people like people that are not gonna
use that I'm not gonna need like a
website for a business like that doesn't
work you know what I mean like is that
people that use Shopify people that use
Shopify that's not real businesses
that's like you know my mom selling
socks on the Internet that's what weeks
in Shopify and and all those things are
but they're not really you know they're
not really like a platform for business
it's not gonna be a business using
Shopify at all because they're not
customized you can't customize a Shopify
you could just sell products that say I
think I personally think what it has
done is it stopped like you know how
back in the days there used to be like
little businesses like people who will
have my quote-unquote digital agencies
like for local businesses that's what
wakes Squarespace or Shopify it has
stopped because now you as an
independent contractor whatever or
digital agency you can't just go out and
be like oh you have a
restaurant let me build your little
website and I'm gonna charge you $1,500
$2,000 whatever you can't do that no
more back in the days people could do
that now if it was like wait I just have
a restaurant I have a blue
restaurant and that's it that's what I
really have so because my restaurants bs
then all I really need is just a landing
page and a menu you could do that with
Shopify you could do that with whatever
right but if you have a real business
like you know if you have a real
business you you're not gonna be able to
be forgetting trying to sell stuff to
Shopify cuz you need to customize it you
can't do that
and also stop worrying about that
people's like man I'm worried yeah man
make sure you visit a website man
coating face calm and go check it out we
got a lot of courses in there man I mean
a lot a lot a lot a lot I think we've
got like 20 courses on there
alright guys you know I'm about to head
out of here I'm out because I need to
cold man my hands is itching I'm like
this itching right now I need to code
I'm out of here man can you integrate
react or hyper our sixth or Squarespace
I don't think so I don't know if you
could do that I mean you could connect
to an API if they have one but I don't
know if you could actually go in there
and put in your own JavaScript maybe you
can maybe you can't I don't know I
haven't used Squarespace I used to use
Squarespace for like my friends and like
whenever they want our website I would
charge in my $500 and get one like a
Squarespace website and that's it but
you know you know now people think that
I'm gonna play some games man nah man I
gotta actually build projects man you
know what I mean where are you now
actually I want to create I have this
project that I want to create which is a
react and then with a back end of golang
like I want to try something new and I
saw yesterday so that's what it is
that's why I really wanted to do tonight
and you know wife he's not here the
baby's not here they staying at the
mother mother-in-law's house so I'm
gonna take advantage I'm gonna try to

you know what I mean
you don't know you let me know word
you guys are crazy
now people be hating on PHP Pete is not
bad man yo
Filipa say your last time barber checked
the marking England wasn't in 1999 yeah
this guy's is crazy you see okay this is
what I'm saying
Jose some dad says I left my full-time
job in February this year to go to
galvanise in Phoenix right which I'm
guessing is a boost was it boot camp I
graduated in July still no job I've also
not worked on any projects since I
graduated Jose bro I don't know how you
plan on getting any job it's been what
July July August September October it's
been four months and four months you
telling me you haven't worked on any
projects like it's gotta be really hard
for you to to get a job I'm being honest
like you have to really work hard you
have to create projects create you know
create a solid portfolio so you could
land that job and even if you wasn't
working on this time try to reach out to
companies in your area just be like
young people or even clients like even
if you graduate it and you can't find a
job in your area there's people on
Craigslist I need people to build their
websites you could have taken that it's
not ten thousand dollars a month like
you will probably get in a company but
it could be two thousand three thousand
dollars in your pocket
cash that you don't have to report to
the IRS not I mean so you got a really
go hard man the jobs is not gonna come
to you no but why is boot camps bad
I don't think boot camps are bad what is
bad is the price that they're putting on
it I think like $20,000 is bad like I
don't know if I told you guys already I
went to a sort of boot camp when I was
around 19 19 years old well it was a
four it wasn't for this thing that IRS
high AR let's see if I chose our audio
schools calm okay I went to this school
when I was like 18 19 years old right
this is exactly what a boot camp is
right the only difference is that this
is before not anymore right now so calm
before it used to be a dot edu which
means the government says hey this is a
legit school right now it's no longer
legit school it's just a regular
Institute of audio you know order your
research you know so it's the same thing
as a boot camp it's pretty much a boot
camp but for audio engineers so I came
to this place and mind you every single
time they would give us like projects
and like they will give us projects and
things to learn that were super outdated
that's number one number two like this
likes ordering things together like you
don't need that to become an audio
engineer what
for some reason they were teaching that
they would teach us like stuff we're
like the Beatles
sessions like recording sessions like
there's so many bad things about this BS
school well I went to this school
now this school has the same system that
boot camps now have and it's the same
thing that this school has I don't know
if you guys remember this apex I missing
apex school let me see
apex technical school right or let's see
this other one called DeVry I don't know
if you guys remember this thing you know
this was like at least as a college the
right is considered a university is a
college by the government right
DeVry apex iar you know I know a lot of
people that went to this type of schools
I myself went to this school right and
when I tell you guys a boot camp is not
worth the money that you're paying for
it because in reality when you think
about it you could go to a community
college and get four years of education
with the money that you are actually
putting into a boot camp literally
twenty thousand dollars is what you're
going to get four years of college and
they charging you that in three months
for stuff that you can learn on your own
like this is not 1985 where you needed a
teacher to teach you the things that
you're learning in a boot camp or any
other schools like all this stuff you
could literally learn that online
there's no need for him no more in the
way how they make money is by bringing
like famous recording engineers and
stuff like that and then you think like
you learning from like the best and in
reality you're not you're just learning
from somebody who is no longer famous
and
pretty much they're like oh yeah we're
just gonna hire you because you you made
you know a recording what if the Beatles
in 1964 or something like that right but
those people they're not there because
they're like really good teachers they
just dare to get a check because they
don't have no money coming in right it's
the same thing as as a teacher it dies
in a boot camp a lot of those guys is
not cold steel cold steel you could tell
me he's really passionate about it he
really wants the person to learn right
they're not cold steel you're gonna get
freakin Johnny Smith you know Johnny
Schmo and and that's it that person's
gonna go in there and looks up in there
for just for a check man you know what I
mean so save that money man exactly most
instructors haven't worked on a project
in a real project in years which is
another thing to like you know when you
know there's very few guys here on on
YouTube this is the truth right like and
you could put it out there to whoever
you want there's a lot of guys who door
they're not even in the industry no more
like they give an opinion on they giving
opinions on things that they're not even
you know experts on they yeah they
haven't even done them themselves they
don't work in the industry you know I've
seen youtubers talk about nodejs
and they never worked on a project or no
js' they've never been hired as a
developer phrenologist it's like why is
he talking about if you never worth it
right you know what I mean and giving
people with opinions about it you never
work there right there's people who who
are junior developers let's be honest
out here it's people who are junior
developers giving opinions on what
frameworks you should pick and they just
got a job yesterday you get what I'm
saying like it
doesn't really make sense it doesn't
really make sense when somebody is like
yo it's like two months ago you was in
the same position it's like right now
imagine me you know not to sound like a
a-hole sometimes but imagine me right
now if I'm here on YouTube and I'm like
guys you know I'm here looking for a job
I'm trying to become a developer you
know I'm in the same position as you
right why would you take my opinion of
me telling you hey guys you guys should
definitely learn you know view Jes or
whatever something out there write some
random stuff and I never worked in a
company doing that I never worked in a
company ever in my life
but I'm telling dozens of people like oh
go learn the Harry Potter framework and
my brain almost explodes when I'm like
you you don't you don't even have a job
you don't even never worked in your life
as a developer how are you giving an
opinion on it you know what I mean
or we're like guys who haven't worked
the last some day worked was in 1997
right and they're like guys you guys
should be learning nodejs PHP this
doesn't that with no knowledge with no
knowledge of of how the industry is how
the market is you know or even where
people come in and be like listen you
gotta focus on algorithms all the time
because you know in the industry the big
companies you know they old you know
they hire people who capacitor
algorithms of on the whiteboard and what
people don't understand is that you're
talking to a minority inside of a
minority inside of our minority right
guys you guys don't get it a lot of
people won't even get a phone call from
Google right so when you come in and
tell the whole world I'm like hey guys
you gotta focus on algorithms because
companies are focused on that you just
wasted that person six months
his life focusing on algorithms and all
this stuff and it's like bro you don't
even have a college degree right so
first of all you're not gonna get hired
by Google right a second of all you're
you're just starting Google's not gonna
pick you up you're not a draft pick just
like this person is I got a free agent
in the world is like okay this guy's the
best self-taught developer in the world
we're going to hire him we're gonna give
him an interview you're not gonna get
that interview that's just being honest
look it up online you just don't get
those opportunities so my my road that I
tell people to do is build projects get
start working in companies work in small
businesses working medium businesses you
know companies like like right now let's
say if somebody wants to tell me hey go
work at Adobe I'll be like okay cool
Adobe's not that great or like let's say
canning alright somebody took a go work
at cannon Oh calm I'll go work over
there it's like a medium-sized company
right it's not Google it's not Facebook
but it's like you work yourself up there
cuz you're a self-taught developer the
idea that you're going to be going from
zero to a thousand it's not gonna happen
you know what I mean it's not gonna
happen you have to build yourself up so
it's like I see this all the time on
YouTube where people people what I
shouldn't be giving opinions or on
things and and people follow them right
and it's like wrong like you've never
worked this or people be like oh you
know you gotta you gotta learn Python
and this this and that
check out my courses on Python and it's
like bro you don't even work as a Python
developer you know what I mean like or
like there's so many things where I'm
like bro like the people that come to to
YouTube I'm being honest it's not the
people that are like how can I say this
nine let's say 90% of the people on
YouTube that's looking for this type of
channels this type of content are not
the typical in a computer science major
somebody who has worked in a
company already they're not those type
of people most of the time is people who
are trying to get into the industry who
are just getting into this right is
their first year the second year
whatever those other people are on
YouTube right the people who are like
already like been working for years
they're not looking for you to for
answers they're on Stack Overflow you
know they aren't freaking or how you
call is on on github like have you
noticed like the guys who are like
creating the like the crazy projects or
open-source they're not on YouTube those
guys that's a whole different community
they they are on another level right
so when you come here and YouTube and
you're like oh you got a do list isn't
that it's like you talking to the wrong
audience you know what I mean like I'm
not gonna tell you guys go try to learn
golang as your first language cuz you
could get a $200,000 job and it's like
bro you won't even get the interview if
you don't have something to show for
when people come in and tell me oh you
gotta learn how to rhythms yes you got
to learn algorithms that should be
something that you continue with your
career but it shouldn't be your focus
because when you make it your focus you
leave out building projects when you're
self to a developer the only thing that
gives you any credibility is the fact
that you can do the work that's it
that's the only thing that you could
literally show to somebody and be like
hey I'm a developer I taught myself in
my house I learned you to me a visit Joe
or his website I did this this isn't
this the only thing that's gonna get you
a job
it's showing like oh you you guys make
you know you guys sell sneakers oh
here's a website I have built that you
know a mock-up for a website for to
build you know sell sneakers oh you guys
sell clothes here's an e-commerce
website I built
oh you guys are real estate oh here's a
real estate website that I built oh you
guys are freaking you know whatever or
that you know you guys want me to work
on the back end and do dashboards and
you know stuff like that
oh here's my project that I've
before that is pretty much related to
what you guys is looking for that's how
you get hired somebody coming in and
telling you guys you gotta learn every
algorithm and source to trees and entry
sorting and take a little tree and build
a little another tree you are
self-taught developer man you gotta
build yourself you gotta build yourself
in this career this is not gonna have
you're not gonna go to Google on your
first year I'm leaving it out there I'm
throwing it out that you're not going to
get to go to Google right
you're just not all right you're not
gonna get that interview that for
interview because the recruiter is gonna
look at your resume but like this prison
never you were freaking worked on as a
developer this person didn't go to a
freakin four-year schools person didn't
go to MIT Harbor do you know what I mean
like that's how they look at it but if
you come in with projects and projects
and freaking resumes and you know a
history a background look for this guy
def tips look for deaf tips deaf tips is
not a dude that that I don't see him
like he freaking just went from zero to
a thousand from one day to another you
could tell there was a progress from him
he worked from smaller business to
medium-size business to digital agencies
to different businesses until he could
show and prove to somebody be like hey
here's my resume here's all my projects
is my five years of experience hire me
at Google he got hired at Google
voila that's it you know I tell people
all the time
you know I wish sometimes like people
would just listen to me because you know
I'm more of a realist I don't go I don't
come here and tell you stuff that's like
stuff that you might get alright
I don't tell you guys stuff that you
might get I tell you guys stuff that you
will get for sure
yeah exactly Dean Carson says here from
my experience setting recruitment
interviews and companies love to see
portfolios or every evidence-based work
to prove your credibility
yeah like nobody's gonna believe you if
you're going in but like hey guys I
could you know I know how to sort every
tree that you could throw at me I uh I
spent hours and hours on coal fights and
fight cold and whatever and they're
gonna be like um whiskey project
what is your resume where's your what
companies have you worked yeah like you
know what I mean I know people who are
not good with algorithms at all and
literally their portfolio Trump's all of
that because they are actual um people
who have done the projects right if I
come in and be like yo man we need a
developer who's gonna help us out in the
backend and this isn't that if the
person comes in and be like oh I could
sort any tree that you throw at me I'm
gonna look I'm like okay who would they
do what websites have you built what
companies have you done and the person
comes in like well you know I did a
couple of things from coal fight con you
could check out and it's like that's
useless to me because I'm not going to
hire you to be freakin shorting trees
and doing all the stuff I need you to be
a extra hand in the team you know that's
what I'm saying like people should
definitely be careful who they listen to
I'm not the most articulate person you
guys could tell that right I'm not the
most articulate um I don't pronounce CN
pronounce the end the words properly I'm
not the smartest person in the world I'm
a realist I'm a realist I'm the type of
person that comes in and tells you the
truth right I'll tell you how it is I'll
tell you how the real world works I tell
you the shortcuts of things your life so
you don't have to go through the
hardships right
listen to me or you just could pretty
much Skippy and be like okay cool I'm
not gonna listen to this guy this guy
got a hoodie this guy got a hat I don't
know what this guy is this guy doesn't
look like a developer you could do that
too
you know what I mean people choose that
I see you on the comments all the time
where people come in like man I just I
don't know if this guy is a real
developer there was a guy who who pretty
much left a comment one time it's like
man we don't know if you've really
worked for any companies and I'm like
listen my LinkedIn is there my history
is there the projects I work on is there
you ask me any question I can answer it
you could throw anything at me I could
build it I mean I don't know what more
proof what you want right
yeah because you see me out here like
this I don't look like a regular
developer what you know looking at Omar
Saudia video if you listened to what he
was saying is like you know he everybody
who was a his company look like the
typical developer right we don't look
like the typical developers we looked
like glitches rain is a glitch
you know it's like a low glitch on on
the matrix it's like I come and I'm like
glitch here's Joe that's what I am right
but at the same time I know what the
hell I'm talking about I come here give
my knowledge to you guys you know I just
share my opinions and try to help people
out people could listen or people who
just be like ah I'm not gonna listen I'm
just gonna do my own thing I'm gonna do
you know 60 hours of sorting trees on
freako camp you know show up with no
portfolio to an interview and then
wonder hey why didn't you get hired you
know one you know people go home and be
like it's like this careful bad blowing
your spot out here but it's like you
graduate from a boot camp you haven't
worked any projects from July to October

computer companies is gonna look at you
weird they're gonna be like yo I don't
care where you came from what school you
