files
okay our first folder is called assets
in assets is where we're gonna have all
our JavaScript or our components or our
sass right so we're gonna click on
JavaScript go to into hyper and then
inside of hyper is where everything
lives okay we're gonna start with the
first folder called actions all right
inside of its actions jes then here we
have components this is where our
components is going to be living at and
then we have state this is pretty much
where we have all our states here and
then in the index J yes this is the home
base this is where basically our app
lives and this is where everything
starts from okay so we are basically
importing hyper app we're importing
age we're importing the hyper a very
important dev tools you know have bad
redux dev tools we got actions which is
this file here we got global state which
is this file here we imported the first
component which is app dot J yes and
then here we're basically declaring
hyper app like hey we're going to start
so basically we sing happy right I'm
saying state equals to global state the
view is the first component which is app
and then from there we're saying root is
document.getelementbyid d so basically
add if on the public page as an index
dot HTML it has a diff that has the ID
of app and that's where we actually
inserting our app in right and then we
have actions so actions is basically
saying hey actions is equal to actions
which is just you know it's an object
full of functions right so that's pretty
much it
it is nothing complicated all right then
we have events events all
different the different situations that
that happens in the app like you know
load is gonna load soon as the page
loads this is the first thing that we
want to load up actions is pretty much
is like this to cancel lock every single
action that we take and this makes sense
is just to get the dev tools working
that's about it no like in when you look
at this you'll be like oh that tools
wise you know Redux that dev tools
working on on hyper app isn't that for
react like it could work for anything so
you come here and as you can see you
could just come in and change a couple
of the options and you know it's good
for development right just to debug and
understand where everything is happening
okay so the next thing that we're going
to do is look into the sass folder okay
so our sass folder is here it has all
our Styles basically we have this one
that's made that as CSS there's where
all our Styles is going to be imported
to alright basically from here is what
we gonna do changes like the say if we
wanted to change the background to red
cool just say hey background red save
that and as you can see the background
automatically reloads because we have
live reloading we have everything that
you need to be productive and like
create something cool it's all there
guys like literally everything is there
for you guys you don't have to do
anything like all you have to do is just
worry about the code you don't have to
worry about gulp you don't have to worry
about web pack you don't have to worry
about none of those stuff like
everything is already set up for you so
yeah let's get started man cool man so
this is looking - this one this one's
public files is where our sass is kind
of get compiled to regular CSS here and
we have a couple of fonts road rage just
for the hell of it I had that one there
we have another one which is Jes this
where our come
ponens is going to get sent so when
something gets changed here
automatically it gets compiled so
there's two files
you got one Co hyper which is our main
app and this one is vendor where we keep
all the vendor files all right so
everything that is like dinner with a
hyper app or any other vendor files like
you know like let's say something like
redux or or any of those they all get
sent here to the vendor that j yes all
right guys so we gotta jump to the next
