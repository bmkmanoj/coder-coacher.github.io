for web developers and software
engineers okay so we're gonna talk about
it I'm gonna let you guys start coming
into the chat room coming into the live
video hopefully you guys start getting
this the chat box is showing up right
now I'll make sure we get the right
numbers and a viewer count and yeah
let's see let's get it ready all right
so let's start the conversation so I
have a list here of different things
that I feel make a company toxic and I
also have basically information for you
guys to know where exactly I got this
topic from I was listening on my way
here from the gym and I was your boys
working out now we in here alright so I
came from the gym I was listening to the
podcast a front end happy hour okay
it's a pretty legit podcast you guys
should definitely check them out those
guys are like the best it's a whole
bunch of Engineers from from Netflix
indeed who else
I think Netflix indeed LinkedIn and I
forgot the other one but yeah so
basically a bunch of developers they
hang out they talk about different
topics so it's a pretty legit podcast
because you get to feel you know see
what they know right
ok so let's get started ok so for me
number one I will say is a company that
shames developers where mistakes are
made I've seen this done a lot of times
you know if a developer makes a mistake
you know it could be either he broke the
build or it could be like oh like he
don't know that well how to use gate
like you know now everybody knows every
single command of gate right and
sometimes you might you know rewind to
far-off or for
a reason right and people actually come
in and don't make fun of the person's
eye I can't believe a little Johnny made
this mistake or oh oh did you see what
the the junior developer did oh my god
he's horrible like I've seen stuff like
that done man and that's definitely a
toxic company right you gotta try to
stay away from companies like that
because in the long term you're gonna
get burnt out your eyes are gonna be
burnt out because of like the people
that's there or you just gonna become
one of those a-holes in there right it's
gonna change right you might go in there
but I don't man those guys are pretty
harsh well a year two years in that
company you will become one of those
guys right so that's one thing that I
definitely think makes a company toxic
you know whenever you cannot make
mistakes right everybody should be able
to make mistakes now if you're making
the same mistake constantly then that's
a problem right you should have learned
to the first time the second time is
like oh man you made the same mistake
man the third time there should never be
a third time because you should have
learned by now okay so let's move on to
the next one basically half of this I
say a company that only praises one
group right so let's say we are building
an application right and there's a
front-end guys it's the designers this
the backend guys it's the guys in the
DevOps team that's the guys that are you
know for sales the guys who are doing
marketing right any company that just
focus on one group and saying oh my god
you know thank God we have the the front
end guys or thank God we have two
back-end guys or a company that only
focus on one developer right I've seen
this done a lot of times there might be
somebody who's pretty bright right and
usually you will see this in smaller
companies so let's say somebody smart
right somebody
he's pretty bright pretty you know a big
accident
I bet big access to a big asset to the
team right but yeah a big asset to the
team and
there's companies that come in and be
like oh my god you know Vanessa
Vanessa's the man you know I was like
he's the one holding down the team he's
the one doing everything is like if we
wasn't before Vanessa
he we wouldn't even know what's going on
hey this company will be who knows where
or like whatever right this company is
out there that the only praise one
person but what they don't understand is
that that product got done because of
the whole team it wasn't just one person
who came in and they one part that's
important for for the team is like know
everybody put something in there so
everybody should get praises right
everybody should be like oh man this is
a great design
you know shout out to the designers you
know the front-end works perfectly the
animations in here are great shout out
to the front-end developers oh man
you know there's barely any bugs on the
website we just lost yesterday and you
know God bless the back end guys you
know shout-out to the sales team for
getting us new customers and new leads
shoutout to the marketing team for
making sure that we are everywhere every
time we search any type of thing on
Google our our advertising shows up
right there and we seen the Facebook ads
of work we've seen the Instagram ads
work so give a shout out to everybody
that's a healthy company where everybody
is important okay now another thing that
I will say is a company that don't let
don't let you learn on the job there's
companies out there that be like nah we
we don't pay you to learn right we don't
pay you to to come in here and you know
take the extra few minutes to go into
the documentation or even sometimes you
might just have to say hey I'm learning
something new I've never worked with
this framework and it's like they look
down upon it like hey you search on
YouTube for a second to look a tutorial
on how to do something or you can't look
at anything on how your code has come
all this stuff
I'll stackoverflow or things like that
right I had a company where I quit I
literally quit because number one the
guy who who created the whole or back
end and he was like he was a pretty
smart dude but I had searched online
like I think on Stack Overflow something
right and he was like he was on Stack
Overflow too searching for the same
things but the only difference is that I
used my name right to search for
something on Stack Overflow I don't know
when it was like something about PHP
right and he was like oh you're asking
questions on Stack Overflow it was like
I could have taught you that or like
something something dumb like that right
I was like why am I here like I can't
stand this guy like you know there's
people that they're like oh you can't
search on Google you can't search on
Stack Overflow you can't search on
YouTube like that's why is there like
you're not supposed to come in and say
I'm gonna try to remember every single
thing under the Sun it's impossible it's
impossible just like yesterday I made a
video about how many different you know
libraries and frameworks are coming out
and constantly new things get added and
then whatever work last week doesn't
work no more this week this company is
out there where there's a holes who just
pretty much be like hey it's like I'm
smart it's like if I got it somehow
understood it then you should be able to
to get it the same way as like nah bro
is like that's what Stack Overflow is
there that's what Google is day that's
what YouTube is there that's why
whatever tutorial is on whatever website
right that's what coding face.com is
there right if you had a job and you go
back into one of the tutorials that I
was teaching you something and somebody
tells you hey what you why are you
watching that video is like I'm just
referencing something and if they look
down upon that that's a toxic company
okay now let's move on to the next thing
a good work-life balance right this
companies that expect you to be working
like constantly right they they think
that they own you you know cuz you gotta
understand as developers we get paid
very well right so some companies they
look at them they're our own this guys
get paid the best out of everybody this
guy should be able to work here to seven
o'clock at night to eight o'clock at
night cuz you know they get paid the
best you know I've seen people that
they'd be like oh man is like you know
heard from my other places like
marketing or other places like you know
different sections of the company
whether it be like Amanda you know the
the dev team makes the most money is
like why do they get here early earlier
than everybody and leave earlier than
everybody or they'd be like oh why do
these guys come in and they coming late
and leave later than everybody or they
worry how many hours you put in you know
like that's not a healthy company you
know I mean that's one of the many
reasons to what I was so glad to leave
the last company because it's like I
come in I do my job I make sure to come
in and do everything that I need to do I
go through a lot of stresses when the
website goes down or something or new
bug comes up or whatever so so what I
came in 20 minutes late so what I left
20 minutes early
who cares I do my job my job is very
stressful
don't worry about what I do right this
company is out there that are constantly
looking you know is really within the
company people start worrying about what
time they Johnny get here Johnny leaves
at the same time as us but you know I
was like he put in the same hours that
we did is like you don't need to worry
about that Johnny does his job you are
marketing you are accounting you are a
customer service mind your business
that's not your business right this
companies like that you know it's like
little chatters you know the office BS
you know sometimes you see little things
like that where you be like man what the
hell is going on
no there's a people constantly worrying
about what you do what the next person
do it's kind of ridiculous you know what
I'm saying
so that can definitely make a company
pretty toxic because you like wait what
it's like I do my job I do my job very
well why are you worried about me you
know what I'm saying
so sometimes that happens and I mean
there's nothing else that you can really
do about it you just gotta take it right
or you can say hey I'm leaving this
company this company is not for me so
yeah let me see what's the next thing
let me see any company that has gender
or race bias right let's be honest here
the world is not perfect the world you
know it is what it is right sometimes
you might be a girl and you know you
might go into a team and somehow you're
trying to give your opinions and
nobody's trying to hear it you know
things like that happens for girls all
right it was like okay okay Cindy you
know we'll listen to what you want to
say but nobody really follows what
you're saying that happens right that
happens for sure you know you might be a
girl in a company where oh everybody
there's a guy right and every guy there
feels like little Cindy what does Cindy
know you got what I'm saying or
sometimes this is something too that
happened and you know like my last
company like pretty much like hey I was
doing all the work and at the same time
my other partner was doing a lot of work
too but I wasn't getting no recognition
for it right and even to the last day
people were treating me as if like I
didn't do a whole bunch of work like I
was constantly doing a whole bunch of
working even everything that we see on
the website now everything that they
followed and everything that's built on
the website was pretty much my structure
my way of doing laravel my way of
setting up everything on the website I
came in bro react I came in they order
opponents on the website alright nobody
came in and say good job Joe
right but my other you know Caucasian
partner will constantly will get praises
and and will constantly come in like oh
man you know little Billy is short such
a great great developer he's he's such a
great asset to the company and it's like
that's why it makes you think like hmm a
company full of Caucasians and then I'm
the only Spanish guy in there and then
even though I do most of the working
even though most of the things that are
here have been set up by me but I don't
get no praises nobody comes in and and
says hey good job kid that makes you
think right and I'll be honest sometimes
it's just what it is or any sometimes
you it is just normal it's human nature
where you basically you get more how you
call it's more attached to somebody who
looks like you who has more things in
common with you right but at the same
time it's like hmm is that a racist
thing or a racist or race bias or
there's something behind the veil that
nobody talks about and this things
happens all the time right
those are things that you're gonna bump
into in companies you know the best
companies are they're gonna appreciate
you no matter what doesn't matter if
you're you know you're black white
Hispanic Asian freaking whatever you're
purple right doesn't matter if you're
gay straight lesbian transgender
whatever you are right assist I don't
know what's the word of somebody who
just has no sex whatever you want to
become right that's a great company
right but you have to understand a toxic
company will have little things like
that no gender bias a little race bias a
little you know little sex
is a little bit of you know homophobia
you know so hey you're you're the gay
developer and people you know all the
other guys there kind of stay away from
you but they send you emails alright and
that goes to the next thing which is
keeping communication right staying in
contact being able to talk to each other
not just emailing each other you know
sometimes you might see this in
companies where you might go in and
nobody talks to each other you know they
do one meeting per week or one meeting
every two weeks but between the
developers between the designers between
the marketing team between whoever the
hell hey nobody talks to each other like
face-to-face nobody talks about about
what's the issues nobody talks about
what's gonna happen the next week what
the project is working on or like let's
say for example like hey there's a
deadline for something right and
marketing access is expecting for this
HTML email to be done by Thursday night
right but then because you don't have no
interaction with me right you don't know
my situation I might have my son or
daughter who pretty much they broke her
arm last week you know and then I
couldn't get it done on Thursday night
right and if we had that human
interaction you will be more acceptable
to the situation like all damn you know
little Johnny's son he broke his arm and
he had to leave early you know now it's
not just I'm emailing to IT I'm emailing
to the developers it's like oh you guys
I was expecting this by you know
Thursday night 6 p.m. is I never
received it if you would have had that
human interaction you understand better
you get what I'm saying so sometimes
that happens so communication is very
important sometimes emailing back and
forth doesn't work sometimes you just
need to talk to each other you know
sometimes you might say something on a
text
on an email that sounds like hate you're
being an a-hole but if we would have
been there face-to-face or we had any
type of conversation with each other you
will say oh wow like it's not a big deal
it's not a big a big thing or you know
it was like let's say you you type
something capitalized by mistake you had
caps lock right you put in like okay
right the next person that's reading
them I say oh he's screaming at me oh
he's saying is in a bad way you know
whatever right but it's like hey if I
would have been there in front of you
you would have been their own okay like
you know okay it's like okay it's not
really like saying like okay like you
know what I mean communication is very
important in companies man so to not
have a toxic company like you gotta just
have that communication man between
teens between developers between
designers you know everybody okay let me
see what else I have here on the list I
also have company where upper management
doesn't look down on employees okay
that's that's bad right
this times where I've been in companies
where somebody you might say okay we are
the guys that work in the office we are
the guys that work in you know develop
man we are the guys that work in
whatever the office is right but there's
people that work in manufacturing
there's people who are the janitors
there's people that are the chef's
there's people that are the mailman the
little kid that comes through in and
drops your mail you know on your desk
those are human beings too you know
sometimes
companies you'll see this where they
were like oh we're the guys that work in
the office those guys that work at
manufacturing those guys work in a
shipping those guys work at you know at
the back all right those guys do the the
drops you know those guys pick up the
things from the truck so they're like
you know they're like below us and stuff
like that like they don't go to our
meetings or you know sometimes you might
see this sometimes they will do like
company parties right and they won't
invite like people from the back meaning
like people who work in shipping people
who work in customer service people that
work in you know the lower tier jobs
that a company you know but hey don't
make a party for the guys at the office
just the developers de sitio the a CEO
or whatever aid the marketing accounting
like those guys know show up those guys
will get an invitation but nobody at the
bottom will get anything right or like
let's say a company where they might
start giving out bonuses
you know everybody gets like a nice
bonus everybody gets a nice bonus you'll
see like a CT oh my god
ten thousand dollar bonus a developer
might get a thousand dollar bonus a
seven hundred dollar bonus you know but
then the guys at the bottom the guy says
breaking her back my command
oh here's twenty five dollar bonus
here's $100 bonus
here's your Christmas gift $100
those guys work their asses off and then
nobody you know appreciates them you
know and that's the way how upper
management works and that's one thing
that is going on here in the United
States in America right now uh like I
would say like 1% is at the top and they
feel like even though we are the ones
buying all the products we are the ones
are building everything we are the ones
you know using the product right we get
looked down upon by those people that
are at the top they look down but the
comments then you know the peasants that
work down there that's not how you treat
people you know everybody's a human
being
everybody should get treated with
respect ok and that's just how it is so
yeah man all right now I'll take any
messages you guys want to tell me what
do you guys feel about this what do you
guys think about this topic have you
ever been in a toxic company either
leaving in the comments or you can put
it right here on the chat room this is
why it's good to be live you know when
you're live you actually come in putting
your ideas put in your comments and this
will show up on a live video later on
you know what I mean so take advantage
so I want to know exactly what you guys
think so I'm reading the comments from
before let me see what you guys is doing
yes I'm trying to keep keep up with my
web developer lunch breaks like how I
used to so the way I am I'm holding
myself accountable to this is every day
I'm trying to go to the gym I'm gonna
try to do this every single day for this
whole month to see if there's any
results right I'll feel better as far as
health I have a lot of I've been having
a lot of health issues which I haven't
told nobody here but basically I'm
holding myself accountable so basically
hey go to the gym work out try to get
myself in shape and myself good and then
from there come back and do a live video
every single day in the morning or like
around 12 o'clock yes so yeah man let me
see I feel like Silicon Valley is an
echo chamber yes I believe so too what
do you think of the Google culture I
don't know you gotta tell me what
exactly do you mean about Google culture
let me see Henry McCleary says I'm gonna
toxic company right now Joe it just
motivates me more to become a developer
but it's not easy yes I agree with you
so let me see I feel so angry and sad I
see how companies from well-established
countries use the development from
countries that are still trying to grow
up the economy and work for $100 $200
$1200 as developers yes I think I mean I
don't know how to how to put this it
also - depends on your high college
living conditions your you know how much
money do you really need it's like right
now if I live in the ER what the money
that I earned here in the United States
I live like a millionaire
as a developer I shouldn't be living as
a millionaire in Dominican Republic
because this it's totally different you
know what I'm saying like if I live in
Dr I'm not expecting a company to pay me
as if I'm living in the United States
right some companies might be nice and
and pay you that much but it's like the
same thing if you live
India right you live in India and you
you the average person is making $300
$300 a month right now if you get paid
$2,000 or even $2,500 you're good you
get what I'm saying sometimes I see this
online where I see people from other
countries that they'll be like oh man
in America they paint the developers you
know ten thousand dollars a month and
they're only paying us 2500 or $3,000
I'm like bro like you live in a whole
different places like you can't pay
should be according to how much the cost
of living is right and how much work do
you put in right I'm not if I live in if
I live in Ethiopia I'm not expecting to
get paid the same amount of money that
needs to be paid a developer here in the
United States
I'm just not expecting that you know so
sometimes it's hard but that's just
that's the reality of things people
should get paid according to cost of
living that's what I think right same
thing as here in the United States I
don't think for the job that people do
like I say at McDonald's or Walgreens or
Walmart I don't think that they should
be getting paid $9 an hour $10 an hour
nobody should be getting pay that much
here in the United States because the
cost of living is so high so it's like
nobody should be getting pay that right
I think pay should be set up depending
on the cost of living that's pretty much
it let me see what up Joe has Kevin
Davis says I was in a toxic company and
I quit that joint I wasn't happy at work
wasn't happy at home had to change
something I quit my job and put my all
into coal so I can change my life yes
definitely
and nah was it Shannon Smith says I
moved to South Africa eight years ago
work remotely for my same company but
took her $20 and Allah Hey
and still was able to live off half of
my salary with a much higher standard
of living then I got in New York City
yeah that could happen to our nothing
that we always sell people people always
think like amen
I can't wait to get to the United States
if you live you know abroad or you live
in another country guys living in the
United States is it doesn't mean you're
gonna get a better life right I've seen
people that work in Mexico I've seen
people that work in Brazil people that
work in Spain people that work in you
know friends Germany Italy that have way
better lives than here right the United
States is built about built around the
idea of everybody needs to work to make
this thing work
if it makes sense so everybody needs to
be working like slaves meaning you
cannot miss a day off you know you got a
goal you should be lucky if you get two
weeks off a year you know if you look up
one's the neighbors think this
documentary and I'm always bringing up
documentaries cuz I'm a huge fan of
watching documentaries to be able to
learn and make my life better by
learning from other people's so I'm
gonna tell you guys a great documentary
from what's this guy Michael Moore
documentary Michael Moore okay
where is it it says yeah
so it's coal we're to invade next okay
I'm gonna show you guys here
I'll share this with the screen so this
documentary where to invade next so it
basically talks about all the good
things that other countries have that
the United States should have right and
usually the United States invades other
countries for either oil or for
resources whatever it is right but if we
wanted to invade somewhere we should
invade for the right reasons to get the
right things so he basically talks about
how in Italy you could go in half a
three-month vacation you can have a two
month two months two months three months
vacation right and it's all on a Netflix
you go go watch that on Netflix
basically um the guy talks about all the
different things liking England is a you
know free health care this countries
that have like sex education this
countries that really cook like they
really cook like good meals for the kids
at school like little kids don't eat
like the BS that is here like here you
will have like some frozen french fries
and a fro frozen hamburger for lunch in
other countries like in France you will
have like a full meal like as if your
mom cooked for you at home you know you
know so it's like look Hairy Maclary
says joe i live in the UK I get 26 days
off holiday
however the salary is crap whether it's
depressing racism is underhand the
reality is opportunities are much more
available in the United States and yes I
I do agree with you and that there's
definitely a lot of opportunities here
but it comes with a lot of bad things
soon you know racism is it's alive here
too
the only difference is like if you just
have tonal vision if you're one of the
people there's like okay cool there's
racist people who has racist things
around me but if you have a goal you
have tunnel vision like this you're not
worried about nothing that's around you
and you just do your job and do what you
got to do you're gonna be fine if you
let anything else affect you then
you're gonna find the same things here
right now the same thing about whether
whether it's depressing out here to you
know the East Coast it could be very
depressing - if you live in Washington
state could be very depressing like it
is all the same but
the human things like you know things
that every human being should have you
know it's 26 days of like trust me this
guy's you that would give an arm and a
leg to have 26 days like people don't
people are lucky if they have two weeks
off right and usually two weeks off if
is if you work in a company for a long
time you know sometimes they'll sign you
up for a temp contract they'll sign you
up before like I've seen this thing
where they don't want to offer health
insurance for people so what they do is
instead of you working you know 30 days
whatever not 30 days I think it's 20
days out of the month what they do is
they make you work 18 days so I'll be
like two days before you you're supposed
to get full or full-time health benefits
and the whole shebang like they'll cut
your hours by like two hours just to
make sure that you don't get your health
benefits like they do that all the time
and like that's what happens out here so
there's a lot of toxic companies but I
would definitely recommend for you guys
if you live here in the United States if
you live in other parts of the world to
check out this documentary where to
invade next is a very legit documentary
because it shows you all the cool things
that they have in other companies around
the world and other jobs around the
world so what you might think here in
the US is the norm in other countries is
like wait nah that's a no-go like you
know what I really like three months all
these people that be like hey I live in
Italy and you know I'm gonna take off
three months off of the year and
sometimes you could even save your
months like you're supposed to have my
things like two months off right and if
you decide hey this year I'm not gonna
take no vacation and next year I'm gonna
take my vacation from this year you
pretty much get like four months off
there was a guy that they interview him
he was off for six months he's like oh
yeah I was saving my my vacation
two years and basically pretty much I
was like I just take six months off now
you tell that to somebody here in the
United States they're gonna look at you
like you're crazy like I was talking
through my last employer and telling him
about this documentary he said oh you
can't do that here in the US it's like
you can't do that it's like why you
can't
why because you need to make more profit
you get what I'm saying like that's how
people look at it they're like oh man we
can't we can give this guy's you know
any crazy vacations like that because
then that cuts down our profit so if I
was gonna make you know ten million
dollars last year I'm gonna make seven
and that's a no-go I need to make those
ten million dollars instead of everybody
in my company getting better vacation
you know what I'm saying so that's all
I'm saying there's a lot of toxic
companies out there so yeah man yeah
they block the day so you can't take PTO
for for mine which is is pretty brutal
tool right so it's like pay time off you
know so that's how it is man it's like
we can't be mad at it cuz it's like hey
it's part of the infrastructure of the
United States everybody's supposed to
work until you they die all right
that's why most of the people that work
in the United States they constantly
looking forward to that time when they
retire right you know most countries if
you ask people that working in companies
in like Finland you know friends like
they not so eager to get to 64 years old
when they retire then I oh yeah I want
to continue working
most companies here people are like
y'all they be by the time you get to 60
you're not even 60 by 50 you already
beat your back is messed up your foot is
messed up you never took a vacation I've
seen guys that have worked for companies
constantly you know like let's say for
example to you like let's say for
example there's another two that I have
in my other companies I hate you
supposed to get all
a vacation time and I didn't even get
the vacation time all right
so it's like hey they try to get rid of
you before you even get your vacation
time
or they won't even pay you for your
vacation time it's like hey I still have
vacation where's my money for those days
of the vacation you got what I'm saying
