Conan face.com
today we got something special okay
today we're going to create a personal v
card hey guys so now this is a couple of
changes I mean I currently I put it in
my my own name I said Joe Santos you
know since we got a girl that's put in
Jane Jean Santos Garcia that's right so
let's just put a Jane Santos Garcia
let me see saved us here okay let me see
what else and let's put Jane because we
have a girl's picture so doesn't sound
right
having you know he's putting Garcia or I
don't know we should change it to
something else and Jane say Jane Johnson
Jane Johnson of course this whole
portfolio it would change it name it to
whatever you want is up to you then use
whatever image you want to put okay
so yeah so we have Jane Johnson we got a
web developer okay let me see okay cool
all right so let's just do this buttons
all right so we have one whole primary
button another one called goals BTN okay
so let's do that now
we're going to put that in the main that
s CSS because we might use those same
buttons in other places so here makes
sense okay so we're gonna say background
let's say color - I don't know the
colors
let's see color - color three
let me see I see if this thing is
showing up I know it's not me button
that's my fault primary button okay
primary button okay let's say I like to
call everyone okay and then let me see
was the image at okay so it's primary
button and gulls bought it
okay let's say for this one for now
we're gonna do a little change we're
gonna say border
okay border say four pixels solid and
the color is going to be color one like
that okay now let's say the border
radius let's say we're gonna do a border
radius on us a border radius generator
okay so we're gonna say 20 pixels there
zero there zero there and let's copy
this then affect your nice 20 pixels all
around
so this all we really need
okay so we're gonna paste this here
let's look at the our our button we're
gonna come here and say
text-align:center color oh let me see
color color one tool I mean I know I
should rename this colors as you
definitely rename this colors and I'm
gonna do it right now right after we
finish doing this bye for now let's just
keep it like that okay let's say Oh 20
pixels alright I'm gonna say
display:inline-block now 20 pixels is a
little bit too much let's see from there
to there it's like dirty on there to
there it's like dirty
okay so let's say 30 30 pixels missing
let's say text transform the upper case
for gamma was the name of was a kerning
the CSS can't remember he let her
spacing yeah I know it by kerning
because that's our name in school letter
spacing let's see say okay three pixels
let's say 30 pixels let's do 15 pixels
inside let's bring down this this border
radius is a little bit so much are not
enough so 30 pixels I think should do it
okay so 30 30 30 save that and there you
go now let me copy this paste this here
and then the color and I say 1
now one thing to make it exactly the
same as this one what we can do is we
come - it from all the sides so instead
of doing 30 pixels let's do 27 instead
of doing 14 into 12 I see how that works
and there you go
now you're probably asking why did I do
that well as you can see the border I
mean the size of the inside of this
thing was already exactly as this but
when we added the border the border
actually added 3 pixels outside of the
button itself so to make it even as this
one all we have to do is just say minus
3 on each side on of the padding so then
it'll be exactly the same as this one
okay all right so I think we got the
buttons down let's say what else we want
to do to this want to give this like a
little space so let's say on this one
let's give this a margin right of 13
pixels okay that's pretty good for now
think it's not exactly as this cuz we
don't have to sing fonts we don't know
all the details but it's still a very
similar to it okay so I think our job is
done as far as this now what we want to
do here is
we want to create create that on a
hamburger and the icons so of course
we're gonna use font awesome okay
look I'm still waiting for fun awesome
five they got like a million dollars and
they still haven't released it I don't
know what they waiting for they're
really getting me pissed off but
whatever man if you got to get your
money you got to get your money okay so
let me see what is it Oh what was it
that we came here for
oh yeah hamburger came for the hamburger
came the hamburgers you guys remember
it's what we had here was the hamburger
icon so now we just paste this inside of
there and we come to the home that scss
but if I couldn't even go to the home
that I CSS cuz this thing is gonna be
needed in every page so let's put it
here on the main that CSS okay so I'm
put it right above primary I'm gonna say
hamburger icon hamburger icon dot F P
okay let's see so let me see so
hamburger icon font size to ram color
color one okay now the next thing that
we want to do is we want to come here
and we gotta figure this out
okay so first of all we got to bring
this font awesome
so font awesome CDN okay just copy it
from here now the next thing that we
needs to do
come here say link paste in our font
awesome okay yes you can see it
somewhere here and what we need to do is
make this icon to be floating around so
to do this we're gonna say position
positioning fixed position fixed and
then we're gonna say write 0 say if that
so you can see there you go so now it's
not taking on space now we're actually
position to the websites size now the
whole website itself has like a padding
well the design itself has a padding of
like 56 pixels all around 56 pixels here
for this expects tools here 56 pixels on
the top so let's give that to the
hamburger icon - so you're gonna say top
56 pixels right 56 pixels
save it and there you go kids
now we have our icon is exactly where it
needs to be leveled off with everything
all around it but only thing that we
want to fix this because when we click
on this icon there might be like some
issues and some mobile mobile devices so
especially for like the touch screen
because then they have to press this
thing exactly so you want to create like
a box around it just in case their
fingers are skinny or too fat whatever
and they don't get to click on on the
little icon so you want to be able to do
that it now so you want to say padding
let's say padding 20 pixels around it
okay and now what you do is you - that
20 pixels from here and you say 36 and
36 so now still perfectly aligned but we
have that padding around it so when we
click on the button even though you're
not click on anything around you know
you're thinking oh I'm clicking on this
if you click out here while trying to
click the icon is still get triggered ok
so next thing that we're gonna do is the
menu have like I don't know some nice
animation for it and we'll do let in the
next video alright see you guys later
