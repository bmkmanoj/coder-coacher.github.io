jump back at it again man : Chris calm
your boys backing out and did it again
alright so there's the winner the winner
from yesterday's poll is Python it seems
like a lot of people
let me get Python in here alright so
we're definitely gonna create a course
for Python and probably create like a
web app something simple to get you
started with and then later on we'll
probably do some more advanced stuff
okay then maybe for that you know what
let's take a step back because yesterday
when I was looking at the numbers they
were both back to back back to back back
to back so I say you know what between
object-oriented JavaScript and Python I
said you know what I'm gonna come in
create the object-oriented JavaScript
and just get it out out the wait right I
came in creating a couple of videos for
it
I'm gonna finish a project for it too
because in reality I get oriented
programming for JavaScript is so easy
it's just about knowing prototypal
inheritance right and understanding
function constructors and and the
prototype and that's it that's pretty
much it now of course you need to have
like an example of how to using when to
use it so I was thinking about creating
like a quick library maybe like some
type of library like sort of like jQuery
sort of like underscore so you go
understand like how to use
object-oriented programming with
JavaScript and when to using you know
because not every single time that
you're going to code something you're
gonna oh man I'm gonna start coding in
Hopi right you're not gonna do that
every single time cuz it's like let's
say you're doing a many you don't need
to create prototypical inheritance for a
freaking menu like you don't need that
at all right so we're gonna create like
a snow library and then from there
you're probably gonna understand even
more how to use object-oriented
programming all right and then from
there we're gonna jump - good old Python
and I don't know man I'm still s on
sailing I'm still in the air because I
feel a lot of the people want to get PHP
because there's the top three right top
number one is fight done number two is
object-oriented programming with
JavaScript and then PHP is the third one
okay
so it makes me think I'm my okay
in reality I could go in there and knock
out the PHP right away and get it done
right I've been telling you guys that
you guys should definitely learn PHP all
right because it's just an easier way to
get in the industry like you could do
WordPress you can do laravel you could
do slam you could go to a given to this
one little frameworks for PHP in like
jobs out there for PHP that to me
personally it makes more sense to learn
PHP than Python but for whatever reason
people like Python more than PHP and I
understand them 100% you know PHP is not
the best language PHP is not the most
fun language but it's the language that
could get you a job tomorrow all right
so I don't know I mean I want you guys
to let me know if you haven't voted go
ahead info I will say we need to break
the tie between this threes like I mean
they're pretty close to each other
between Python object or into JavaScript
and PHP I will say try another try to
break the break the vote right try to
break the tie that there is it's like
they're pretty close to each other
personally I will say I think I will
have to teach PHP first because it just
makes more sense and you know some
people they listen to everybody but oh
python is going fight
three python is fun but my only fear is
you might be spending too much time on
Python and then might lose a PHP
opportunity you know what I mean like
there's so many jobs out there for
junior developers that I don't know it
just it might seem like a missed
opportunity you know what I mean so I
don't know I want to leave it to you
guys I wanna leave it to you guys to let
me know on the comments let me know on
the likes let me know on on the messages
or let me know somewhere I don't know
you know my email coding phase at
gmail.com send me a message let me know
like which one you think I know this
girl said was named Stephanie Simmons I
think definitely she's constantly saying
man PHP PHP and I hear her you know what
I mean like most likely where she at
there's probably a million PHP jobs so
it makes sense for her to be like hey I
wanna learn PHP you know what I mean I
want to get that down so I definitely
understand you but I don't know man
everybody voted for Python a lot of
people want to learn Python everybody
wants to jump on the Python wagon and I
definitely understand them I mean Python
is easy PHP is easy object-oriented
programming or JavaScript it's pretty
easy like we already got through like
this was cool about it right you know
for me I feel like I go and look at
other people's courses right there's
people that come in and create a course
that's about I don't know probably like
five six hours to explain the same
topics and it's like 75% of the things
that they explain it to you you don't
need you're pretty much wasting time
right instead of you going ahead and
start coding in start seeing real-life
examples you know so a lot of times
people just scheme it you know you could
go in there and start scheming in but
hey I'm just gonna read off the
documentation from Mozilla and waste
people time and be like oh this course
is you know 14 hours 32 hours of
well you know object-oriented
programming and it's like did the person
really need you to read the
documentation for them you know what I
mean so I try to stay away from that you
know because I'm the type of person that
I hate if I'm coming here to learn
something I want to learn the things
that I need to learn and the things that
I'm going to use not just bring me
everything that's under the Sun you know
what I mean so that's what I did here
broke it down I believe it's like each
minute is about 15 to 20 minutes so this
like an hour here
I'm gonna do another project here which
is gonna be like a library like I said
it could be like a jQuery library it
could be a low - it could be something
right so I don't know I'm uh you know
I'm gonna sleep on it I'm gonna think
about it later on tonight to see well
exactly what type of library we should
make and I'll be cool cuz I'll show you
how to make your own libraries like you
guys might have ideas like oh man I want
to create the next jQuery I want to
create the next react and it's like you
know with this you can actually do it
right so of course it's like there's the
foundation of it but later on as you
grow more as a developer you come up
with your libraries the only frameworks
like you know sky's the limit
you know but you definitely need to
understand this here you know
object-oriented programming with
JavaScript so if you're a member of the
website go sign up for this if you're
not a member of the website I'm going to
create a coupon code matter of fact
let's create a coupon code if you wanted
to to buy this right now let's create a

thing alright and also here you go right
now we have the basics you know one
hours worth you know when I was wearing
full of things that's showing up and
then from there we're adding a whole
bunch of projects like small low
libraries to show you how to really use
this if you want to be part of this
community go ahead guys go sign up if
not it's fine you can just pretty much
buy right now for 750 all right guys now
the next thing like I said we jump into
Python we jump into PHP this week the
nodejs course is done I'm uploading the
videos right now so that's done that's
completely done so that's like so much
very like I'll see you guys later man
stay up man first day is the coupon code
for this alright I'll see you guys later
