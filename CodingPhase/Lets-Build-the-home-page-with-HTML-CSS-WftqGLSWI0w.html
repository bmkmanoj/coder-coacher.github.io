want to do is actually get the colors of
this image so what we're gonna do is I'm
gonna go to color
Dovie calm and basically we're going to
come here we're going to take the image
let's say dreamless this one okay so
these are all the colors in it
all right so we got this one let's put
it by order
so let's say we have this light you have
this one right here this blue what else
it's purple and then we have this little
yellow orange e-type color alright so
say does dreamless now that saves now we
can get the colors purple edit we will
come here and get all the colors so this
one's just white so let's come here
right so the project will Adam right and
then you want to come to assets we're
going to come to all over thinking we're
going to come to the main the CSS we're
going to delete everything solid so
we're going to go select this from there
the late keep the Emperor of fonts your
bottle import of reset that's what if I
have a CSS reset we'll save that let's
come back here and basically it's lonely
right now so say local those three
thousand and everything should be
working fine and come back to Adam now
that we get back in town let's just test
it's awesome you guys this work would
probably this a background right ok
it changed to red so that's fine okay
then come here let's close this off and
now we close this up soon all the stuff
like eating up memory computer alright
so let's look for the colors let's put
on there variables we're going to say
follow side white that's alright
equals one so come here three white the
issue is basically that fast it will see
the we go space to be like this alright
it should be fine all right so let's go
over the colors okay let's go ball over
let's say part more English so
right no it was like can't go sadawa
let's capitalize okay I will say these
colors yellow like that okay now listen
here pick stopper here also here and say
okay in wall blocks all right so it
should be fine okay now when else we're
doing here
so the first one you are I want to
actually get a image to be a background
so I'm going to search say 12 points
let's try to get that photo okay so I'm
gonna take this and we're going to say
ear lesson live class home communal
thank you and welcome here actually
subway home background and then come
here is say background:url QR paste or
URL from here to here and then we're
going to say Center center okay wells
library feet now repeat and then once a
vocals with the kind of salt
hi hunger to say
what's the issue should be show
something okay so any other sign
but for some reason this like become
Taiwan so I'm still so ready block why
Shawn so let me try this it's all reason
height 100% doesn't want to show our
boys fight all right okay that worked
cool
all right we move this display table and
then background size contain also color
all right so now we have a first name
and it's on that and let's do this here
please Center center this is Center the
image so as you get it bigger this
showing was the center of it all right
so let's try and look at the image again
kind of dust out a list all right so
let's see how we want this and now that
that's fine
what we're going to do is we want to
Center a little blindnesses like enter
it to the wack or something like that
we'll come up with it as we go on this
video so what this lets deliciously
display flux don't always go as always
search for something whenever you don't
remember it like the top of your head
and ass is always right there go all
right so what is it
okay cool so we have a center alright so
here I'm going to do h1 oh we're going
to say one can cast matter
alright now I want them in I want to go
I'll have a bottle throughout this whole
site so cuz I say like this one come
here is Todd's family won't say the
bottle number let's test how this or
Google Fonts self also don't go to
Google panels right here add this now so
goes also to see okay the bottle I'm
gonna have their conversation maybe is
that we have employee Nick I might be
the problem since fine there's a copy
for the holiday but I'm pretty sure
that's supposed to be fine okay it's all
corner blocks class size and pull it up
okay so that's working let's figure out
what's going on with the H ones because
technically the most of all every single
element here boy isn't it is going on it
let's try to import it through regular
HTML there might be something wrong with
importing the default should be a long
time zone and try to do this okay so I
guess I gotta put it it to the HL
somewhere the h1 game over right so so
font size is 20 pixels pods weight upon
this and then for text transform
uppercase
now let's make a container for this
clock 12 o clock
okay okay then they're all welcome back
okay yeah all right what is it okay we
want to change the back all of this
going
RGBA condemned with a zero zero zero
a while of point seven sleep or Schley
okay alright now we will say padding all
saved so the facility from top and
bottom and 15 pixels or left or right
make this a little bit doctor
right one else in little bit to this we
actually want to create a button so we
also go to class BTN and what's a beacon
we make sure this thing goes for
everything on the side which one two
three
it's for god sakes he fan now what else
it all goes off I'm here for BTN we'll
say so Dajjal side so all the padding
620 pencils 10 pieces on top 20 pixels
and left alright that's a long Center
and then here I'm going to say purple
well can get the light I just put a
light little background like look Stan a
purple
okay cool
