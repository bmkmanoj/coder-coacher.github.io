at it again man coding face.com whoa
okay listen we go alive right now man so
pretty much we're gonna talk about you
know this is a topic for today if it
works it works is that simple right
sometimes we get wrapped up in best
practices sometimes we get wrapped up in
you know es lint sometimes we get
wrapped up in a whole bunch of
that the incident tells you hey this
hyung you're your code is supposed to
look an artist and yes you have to have
clean code what but at the same time you
know when you're first you know doing a
prototype then just working on an app or
working on a new feature you have to
understand at one point you're going to
refactor the code right and that's fine
but that's later on but when you're
coding is all right to just have some
 some code that doesn't look you
know the best in the world it's ok it
doesn't have to be the best because
right now you're prototyping and if it
works it works like the most important
thing is for you to basically start
coding right and just build something
because sometimes you fall into this
trap of like hold on I gotta put it
through here slim and I gotta make sure
you know all the spacing is right and
it's you know exactly how Airbnb
tells you to make the JavaScript now you
spending more time on doing es
mi wasting a lot of time
like people used to be able to create
something you have an idea you're not
okay i'm going to code it today but now
not only do you have to spend I don't
know and now we're setting up
wetback or like let's say making your
goal work with web pack or running
webpack myself or running mpm or
by itself with WebP angle whatever you
 using right now I could be
broccoli it could be brunch it could be
whatever the hell you want to use right
not only do you have to go and spend an
hour than that then you have to go and
make the es link happy right now
you're making es link happy because
Airbnb told you that you have to call it
a certain way and it's like man you
spend like three hours just setting up a
 system instead of coding like or
making the es link happy I'm
just saying and if it works it works man
like stop worrying about what the
 industry wants you to do like
yeah you could clean up your code but if
you haven't built anything who gives a
 man who cares you start coding you
know what I mean how long about the car
I'm about to have a car accident right
now I don't know what the this
bitch is going retard
okay yeah I'm sorry I'm driving I'm
driving out here it just people
are retarded yeah man but I'm just
saying like if it works it works man
these people that just nobody wants to
be the the cold not see out here because
at the same time man it's all about
creating and building something new man
do you guys think like like creaking the
guy that was building was his name Dan
something the one that created redux you
think he were he was coding in his house
he's worried about the ears link first
no he's coding and then from there we'll
see about to release it then he starts
cleaning his coat I've seen some
today man that is just amazing like
people are worrying about the ESN
worrying about their web pack worrying
about how to set up the whole
environment and it was a two o'clock and
nobody has coated anything you know what
i mean so it's like they don't make no
sense you know and this foot for
everybody that's out here on my youtube
live you know leaving comments is like
hey what up your boys back yeah man now
i'm just sayin though man i'm just
saying though like I don't know like I
remember there was a time when he was a
front-end developer or you was just you
know creating something out here right
and all you have to do is just code
create your code and that's it now you
have to worry about some much like
oh you're gonna use grunt are you gonna
use go are you gonna just use what pack
are you just gonna use I don't
know whatever are we going with the
harry potter framework this month can we
get the telly tubby framework
together like I don't know man you know
what I mean like what the hell man
like can we just focus about the code
can we just focus on that it's like I
was watching this guy on Chris hooks
right he was talking about I think Redux
forms right people are using
redox for him right and I've seen it a
long time ago I used it one time and I
said I'm never going to use this it
was so complicated and so
convoluted that it was just like why the
hell are people even given the six stars
this is a mess like aqua
 cold this myself and have a
better experience just creating my own
 code like everybody's jumping
everybody I feel like everybody is
becoming so lazy instead of coding their
own what they're doing is like okay
I'm just going to go and get up and
search what the hell they got on get up
and see which one's the best one for
forms or which was the best one for four
 logging forms for like you know
Google Facebook land whatever social
media log in is I just code it
yourself you're gonna know exactly
what's going to happen you know exactly
what you got to do you know where
everything is at in the code and like
sometimes yes you got to use other
people's you know packages
whatever but god damn and like it feels
like you gotta spend half a day of just
setting up before you even get to
start coding i know right i'm about to
come up with my own coding
face jes man everything coding face guys
if you guys haven't checked it out yeah
i could go to the website now conan face
calm and yeah go check the podcast the
podcast page is up i'm going to keep on
putting a new page up every single day
putting new features to it i'm still
adding more stuff i'm building the back
end which for everything that i want to
add i'm not gonna make it laughs I'm not
gonna make the back end in the
the registration live yet because i want
you guys that once you register you have
something to do on the website and right
now I'm just building all the features
you know what I mean well yeah let me
see let me see who's online right now
your boy chris sean is on uh let me see
we were both christian scheming scheming
on the day of work he's like yo he's
like let me check what Joe's doing right
now man I might work but it yeah
javascript is great man but all I'm
sayin though man if it works it works
man just code it yourself stop
worrying about oh my god I gotta follow
this guy lines is getting to the point
where I don't want to hear
nobody tell me best practices I don't
want to hear nobody saying it's best
practice to do this who the made
this best practice then who the
made this shame like I'm being honest
like where the is this this
roundtable people and just
basically like okay guys we're going to
 vote it out we're going to
 do a vote today we're going to
 say that is best practice to do
insulin for every project and
it's best practice to waste half
a day of work just setting up gulp and
web packing all this other extra
who the him up with this new ideas
man like the idea of best practice I
want to know who is it that setting this
 up who is the one that saying this
is best practice there's best practices
who the is saying that out here man
like I'm just being honest man sometimes
if the co works it works man if you want
to clean it up later on yeah you clean
it up but I'm just
a man when you just prototyping let a
 prototype man let a
 find a solution and then
later on he'll clean up his code you
can't code and be cleaning up
the code at the same time you're
doing like three four different things
at the same time you're trying to come
up with your ideas your try to find a
solution to it after you come up with
the idea then from there you got a coat
it but people want you to do a
whole bunch of before you even
start coding like straight up I'm just
saying who is coming up with best
practices out here and who is the the
say so who's the gatekeeper who's the
one that that basically gives something
a stamp and say hey we're all just gonna
 say the telly tubby
framework is the best practice of 2017
I'm just sayin though man last year was
the harry potter framework this year's
the telly tubby framework who's out here
creating this I don't know man i'm
just going on for my lunch right you
know what i mean like took a little time
off to come outside real quick because
you know sometimes i see and what
development in programming I see this
all the time is situation to happen to
me when I'm like I'm coding something
and I'm like I'm setting up gulp I'm
setting up webpack i'm setting up eous
link and I'm like wait what is why it's
1130 already so i got here at nine
o'clock and i already wasted two hours
and a half and I haven't coated one
 single line of code you're
telling me that that's what development
nowadays and it's all because some
 weirdo came out with the idea is
best practices to basically follow what
Airbnb so it's like now I'm coding I'm
setting everything up and now I'm seeing
a whole bunch of red lines so
even if I'm coding now i'm
 fixing up the mistakes which are
not even mistakes because the
code works but now i'm doing it to make
the ear sling happy and why I'm making
is linked happy to make the the
internet happy so when somebody sees my
code that could be like oh you know he
has great indentation oh he he basically
you know Oh his his objects look great
oh they saw this a little comma at the
end of eyes you know his our object
properties who is coming up with this
 man who who's coming up
with these best practices if you got
tell me that man I'm just saying though
I'm not mad I'm just like having
fun right now I'm not lunch me and it's
just funny I'm like what the hell like
who's coming up with this ideas man it's
like this should be like rules like okay
we just wanted for 2017 matter if i
forget 2017 for 2018 all we want to do
is code we don't want to worry about
what we're using webpack gulp
the telly tubby framework i just want a
 code I don't want to spend half
an hour setting up I love react I
love every framework that's out
there i love you i love whatever
whatever Teletubby framework
comes out but can we just code
you know what i mean like even with
jquery man people hate on jquery but you
can't go wrong with jquery you
want to create something all you have to
do is coated that's it and go it's live
you know what I mean when you're dealing
with a whole bunch of frameworks and a
whole bunch of packages and a whole
bunch of you know web packing
was the Babel Babel whatever
 tree shaking this summer
going on man that I don't know for for
new developers man I'll be honest if you
want to have an easier life due back in
worry about database worry about
architecting databases we're worried
about working on the backend more
because if you're a trial of work in the
front end man it's all nice and fun when
you're doing HTML CSS but nowadays when
you're working with JavaScript you're
dealing with a whole bunch of
and it's not even that's making
the world easier or is making cold
better or is doing anything it's just a
couple of people who say hey I'm
gonna create my own framework oh
I'm gonna do this and that and I'm just
gonna put it up on the internet and then
every blogging every
youtubers start talking about it and now
it's a industry standard it's a
 best practices best practices to
 use the telly tubby framework
build with gulp and web pack
which is going to take you three
hours to set up the way how you want it
instead of you just spending
time coding that's what I'm saying in my
room I want you guys to leave a comment
because I know right now we all live in
and stuff but I want you guys to leave a
comment and tell me am I wrong am I
wrong for thinking like this if cold
 works it works people that don't
know what I'm talking about they
understand when I say if a works
it works dealing with the code
Nazis of es length and dealing
with a whole bunch of it's just
really taking up taking up time
I think like you just wasting time Raina
instead of building something
you know productive something that you
could be proud of him but I okay cool
the code is not great but I'm
cleaning it up but when you're worrying
about cleaning it up before you even
start coding anything you just
wasting my time yeah yeah yeah yeahs yet
what's poppin bro what's popping and I
mean it happens in all industries man
but it's just funny to me where it's
like we're just following a trend from
that somebody created and nobody's
 saying anything that about the
fact that javascript is getting
more complex and more complicated for no
 reason at all because almost
eighty percent of the that we're
doing with all these other frameworks we
could just do it with regular JavaScript
we could just do it we're jquery
but somehow somebody came up with the
idea of like hey we every two
months we gotta you know reinvent the
wheel and create a new framework
like first it was what was a backbone
than em then no backbone and angular
than amber then react then what
else um there's a couple of there and
then now is view jes and then around the
corner is something called riot jas and
then it's like okay so what the
every two months a new
framework is going to come out and just
because the vlogs is it's bored
then I okay guys everybody got to jump
into this thing we gotta jump on on the
 telly tubby framework it just
came out
it renders to milliseconds
faster than react we just gotta jump on
it come on guys like that's what I'm
saying like you just got to make your
own decision if you guys and I don't
follow change because the industry tells
you to like that's what I do like I'm
not here I'm not here to follow
every single thing that Facebook creates
every single thing that google creates
because my projects are not having
 google problems you know what I
mean like when my project gets to the
point that I'm having google problems or
Facebook problems then I'm gonna start
building my code to basically
deal with those problems but if we're
like doing so much in creating
a whole bunch of for like even the
smallest projects man we just wasting
time and that's what I wanted to make
this video button all right and I'm live
20 minutes of my lunch break man of my
 50 minute lunch break i just
gave you guys 20 minutes and i'm hungry
ass out all right guys listen make sure
you go to coding face calm every single
day even if right now there's not that
much stuff on it guys I want you to know
this is gonna be
huge like remember I told you guys I'm
gonna create a podcast i created the
podcast the podcast is trending
I'm trending on itunes on trending on
google play I'm trending on stitcher I'm
on last FM and that's just an idea that
just came up I was like I was on my
lunch hour guy said you know what today
I'm gonna make a podcast and the is
booming right now I say hey I'm gonna
create a YouTube and the is booming
every day I get like 50 to 70
different new subscribers so the channel
is growing steadily and now you know
what's the best thing about my
subscribers own about all of you guys is
that you guys are
really quality subscribers is now
there's a difference you know how you
watch a video on youtube and you know
this is cool I'll subscribe to it
and then you never come back to the
channel that's what happens to a lot of
this this other youtubers their
channels are inflated because I get the
same views as them and I only got three
thousand subscribers which means my
subscribers are real subscribers are
people that come here and watch the
videos this guys were 20,000
50,000 almost 100,000 subscribers and
their videos when they drop it they vote
ok they only get like 700 800 views and
they got 50,000 subscribers which means
the is inflated me with 3000 little
subscribers every single one of you guys
are actually like real subscribers real
people who come to my channel watch it
people who come and leave comments
people who come here for a reason which
is great because it tells me like i'm
only getting quality subscribers you
know what i mean so i'm super happy
about that so imagine what I'm gonna do
with coding face.com this thing is going
to be bigger than hash know this
thing is gonna be on the level of like
 um stack overflow I'm telling
you right now once I set my mind so do
one thing I've done it before I've had
websites that guy in four hundred
thousands of unique visitors a month
right and that was when I wasn't even
taking this serious now I'm taking
this serious I'm building this
community I'm gonna build the out
of this community I'm gonna make a
website that's gonna be just pretty much
the resource go to guide to pretty much
learning how to do web development and
program the whole idea is going to be is
that if I find a video that's good I'm
gonna put it up online and say hey this
is the best place to learn HTML or if
you find a better one then you go and
you post it up and then when da gets
posted up
people get to vote which one is actually
the best one and then of course I'm
gonna put the best videos from you know
the editor's choice so it's going to be
okay editor's choice Oh to learn HTML or
Tamara JavaScript promises or to learn
whatever es6 so it's like instead of you
spending 2-3 hours looking online
searching for videos on youtube
searching for videos through you to me
i'm gonna save you guys the time to
doing that and just be like hey
man don't waste your time since the best
video don't waste your time is the best
youtuber don't waste your time just the
best blogs don't waste your time is the
best libraries there's no you know what
i mean like i want to just create
something that's gonna save you guys
time because there's too much
here and yeah so that's why you guys
gotta check out coding face calm keep on
checking it cuz when this thing drops
this is gonna make a there's
like a meteor dropping in the
industry it's like I'm already getting
like you know known from like a
whole bunch of people who I respecting
like people hit me up another ocean man
I see you you're the guy from youtuber
my gear man it's your boy Joel you
already know dad man yeah man I'm bring
a sign freshman starting fresh fresh

joke back at it again yeah man I can't
wait for the podcast next Tuesday man
this thing is big all right guys i'ma go
east side I'm starving I'm gonna see you
guys later make sure you subscribe make
sure you like this video man if you want
to share it share it man you know what
man if you gotta already go at this
video to read it you know what man let's
go mess with them let's go drop this
video to those people whose a
best practices best practice on this
best practice on that and then they
spend hours without even coating
anything let's drop this video for them
man let's put it over there I'm ready
let's share it on Facebook let's share
it wherever the this people is at
let's just share it you know what I'm a
knight that's the face listen somebody
