fill this out you know do your little no
thanks you know actually added some new
post to to the channels a couple of
people they added you know new channels
to the website which is cool and yeah so
we got Java squared we got Visual Studio
we got react
we got PHP we got Python we got UJS Ruby
on Rails nodejs so yeah we got a couple
now I added a couple of things to it so
you guys could check it out you know a
link this is pretty interesting because
you come here and click it and get you
know pretty cool of blogs that I found
also too is like if you guys find a cool
video on YouTube man share it what
everybody come to : freeze calm and
share it it's that easy it's like right
now it's like let's say you only hear
you sorry chain you know what developer
right and search what developer right
people
out here we killing them right now boy
Chris shot cannon oh but yeah so let's
say you watched a cool video from rules
Barry right I like her she's cute she's
she seems like a good person she reminds
me I'm you know my people back in Dr
somebody say you fine
who's Barry right uh and you see okay
there's a cool video that she got so you
come here and you say hey you come to
coding freeze calm and then you realize
like there's not a video about what
developer or what development so you can
actually create that channel you can
come here and say hey I want to create
what developer right doesn't really
matter I usually like to capitalize
things or like let's say because it's a
certain topic so you come in here and
create a things essay or what the
government and then you could come here
search on lock's a web development right
take this paste it there there you go
right now me as the admin that moderator
of the website I come here took the
channels and see all the channels that
people have try to add right so I'm like
okay cool the ones that are about to get
approved so like this one let's say what
development right this the one that I
just created approved submit everything
works so they're from there
now people could come here and actually
post inside of what development and say
okay cool we could go in here let's post
a link we like Ruth Berry's video for
how to increase my salary so if we just
come here and say hey write copy and
paste this paste it in here say alright
so now when people come to web
development they can actually find this
video you know it's like instead of you
having to search online for oh man I'm
trying to find just you know cool things
about what developers or links for what
developmental libraries or whatever we
as the community we could come here and
share it like if you find a cool video
sharing if you find a channel that's
missing in you're like man there's
Python but there's no go Lane go ahead
add the channel create an account
add the channel it will be you know
improved so take advantage this website
it's although you know some beta Rana
like you guys are getting a chance to
actually be part of something there's
gonna be great like give this thing by
the end of the summer it's gonna be like
full-fledged website there's so many
features that you guys cannot see right
now like there's so many things that I'm
working on that this is the first step
channels are the first
of the website this thing's called
stacks there's also a project system
where people can communicate with each
other creating projects there's also a
you know it's like an RPG system where
pretty much depending how many posts how
many how many posts how many likes how
many views um how many projects you've
completed online like you get points and
then you level up as you go on so yeah I
think you guys should definitely take
advantage of that but yeah let me see
what's up with you guys which you guys
is up to right now you got your girl
here man I wish I could just trucking
giveaway every single day man I
wish I was on some Oprah you know
they just come in here and be like you
get a course you'll get a course you get
a course you count hey guys you get a
freaking thing I don't know where's the
merchandise coming out it's coming out
pretty soon man I got a couple of things
you know I got a couple of hats kapiel
always asking me Joe where the hats at
man I'm like you know what I'm gonna
give you guys some hats land are also
two hoodies cuz you see me I'm always in
and in a hoodie or or something
comfortable you know but yeah everybody
that registers now is definitely a
founder they get the the founder stack
so yeah man can I have you kick no you
see what episode
look where it is normal get a chat
yeah what about it yes six my brother
what about that course
yes different rider that I think that
that's how you see it of course I'm
gonna get a check I created it
I'm always in there things that I don't
always say anything because it's like if
you guys already having conversations
that have nothing to do with me
then I'm not gonna you know answer or
get into the same conversations you guys
are talking about right so what do I use
for the backend laravel you guys you
guys should definitely get this right we
see this thing here Oh Michelle right
now see this wiper lies it's called
webalizer so every website that I go to
I could see what stack they on you come
here and download that the application
is called whack eliezer that application
is an extension so you come to
extensions you see this webalizer what
that does is it analyzes a website and
when it analyzes the website it'll tell
you what stack they're using so you come
here and see okay Apache Google font
also Google Analytics laravel Twitter
bootstrap on jQuery PHP the programming
language so yeah you can notice that
like I could go to the same reflects
right Netflix you should see on ojs and
react so you see react Twitter they also
use Twitter bootstrap rxjs which
is another framework I see so you can
actually analyze a lot of websites
well this on websites like Facebook that
blocks it they block that they
don't let you see what they have from
their stack because they're assholes or
movie actually I think Google chosen
uber just shows you okay
a Google web server that's a but it
doesn't show you exactly what they have
sometimes it shows up angular sometimes
it shows up little things like that
you
pretty cool extension yeah I should do a
video about that I should do a video of
um you know Chrome extensions that
developers should be using it's been a
while I haven't created a technical a
very technical video or like you know
giving any tips in a while man but I'll
get at it web Eliezer
like you know sometimes like sometimes I
look in that's one of the reasons why I
created Conan face calm because
sometimes I look at videos Omar you know
over here or the that they're
telling me to watch next and I'm like
they're not that good now like not
saying that anybody here and
specifically but they're people that I
don't want to see like there's people
here that I don't care about you know
this videos I just don't care about so
that's why I have coding Fink's calm
where I'm like you know what man I'm
just gonna have it where people go
actually come here and find videos of
exactly of what they want to see not
just off like hey man here's a
cat or hey man here's Tai Lopez
and his you know school it's a
couple of cool articles tool like this
one will view JSF pass angular react
like a lot of you guys don't know about
this blogs alright but they're pretty
good so it's like that's why I go out of
my way and add it to that's why I want
you guys to like you know whenever you
find a cool I don't know cool link a
cold website or a cool something that
people need to see and that you want to
share to the community man come to
coding phase comm share it guys and I'm
not talking about like words there's a
there's a thing whereas like FinTech
came in and say hello like really look a
really breath like you came here wasted
space to say hello
and then Colin Walker dev came in said
hello at least people came in and you
see and started total game but and come
on guys
just make it questions right like right
now somebody acts don't up somebody came
in here right on the chat room and asked
us was a stack alright who acts did
somebody acts there and somebody
accident
okay what's the stack in somewhere okay
Casey Brinegar X was a stack right so
that's a good question that you could
ask over there Kody freeze calm and then
from there I'll answer it myself and I'm
about to start making videos directly
from questions that are made on the
website if they're not on the website
I'm not going to make the video I think
it's gonna be better off like that
because then I'm gonna be answering to
the people who are part of the community
and it'll be so much better so if you
got any questions for me find the topic
come to the channels find the topic if
you don't have the topic here create it
create the channel right and then from
there you know just be like just add it
and I'll basically uh once you add the
question I'll answer and I'll make a
video about you know what I mean so yeah
FinTech nice okay I know I'm gonna add
that feature to today so you could
delete it if if you don't want to you
know male there I didn't reject it I
just haven't had the time to go over
there and actually check so your
channels is there the channel that you
create it let's say angular for let's
see let me check if the logo works yes
that's fine and approved now angularjs
one I don't think that you need to put
any json' just more like angularjs okay
that's fine
approved so there you go
your channel should be there all right
let's see okay cool
now you see this this is what we call a
bug this is what we call a bargain
that's why I want you guys to add more
content because right now you guys are
like the beta I got told you guys you
guys are beta and pretty much of
whatever you add that's where we find
out when there's bugs so we need as much
content and as much people to you know
as many people to be adding stuff to the
website so we could actually find those
bugs and fix it right so this is a bug
which is gonna get fixed right now and
the reason what this bug is happening is
because this was it has three lines
to learn the code of knuckled to neither
of text if we remove this I want see
something then everything is fine now to
fix this best way to do it will be to
basically say hey I'd rather limit the
size of the text or I can actually make
this to have a margin so if it has a
margin bottom or maybe I just use
flexbox for this just make sure that if
that bug gets fixed all right so Missy
but for now what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna rename that that channel fixing
products not all right cool worlds yeah
Madison that's why I need you guys start
posting more in here and just we gotta
go the community in this bitch no matter
what cuz you know me you know how I do
um you know I don't even
you guys sent a little sign man yo
thanks a lot man I really appreciate it
you know that money right there is going
straight to the website I really
appreciate it I don't even know about
you guys
donated anything oh yeah man thank you
no smell $10 $20 that left sure helps
out for me to give out other stuff to
people here feel free to so when you
guys helped me I was like you helping
out the whole community so I really
appreciate it let me see a proof C++ the
only needs up to C++
all right let's see
c-sharp approved let's see what else
react PHP and PHP is already in there
yeah let's see what I'll see sharp it's
already in there tits
somebody added tits when you guys are
mandatory
let me soon proved okay let's see okay
so you see now we got we got a couple of
channels for in here obvious cold we got
C sharp angular angular Java react
JavaScript what
Lucia's Rumia rail and UJS PHP Python so
yeah guys whenever you find a cool video
and youtuber any website that you find
 any tutorial that you think that
the community should know about go ahead
add to the website guys fire like stop
slacking well like this how starts
growing man so it's like you guys are
part of this thing it's not just me as
all of you guys like yeah how about and
at the same time it's like the more
content there is and the more people
that are active on the website the more
I could say hey I see other websites
these are like other websites gonna have
that I generate a little money from what
I see so we got out of session rang up
on Thursday we have a lot of people in
there that was cool let's see from today
and yesterday
so go on state 87 Thursday 379 then
today 161 like is getting there guys
like this a lot of users coming in and
now people are registering and that's
like woo that's what the most important
part of it right but it has to get
interesting
so the only way that this is gonna work
is if we start adding more content right
we find content let's share it
let's show it to the people here let's
see
well huge box
this is cool tool because it's like
there's another bundler like webpack
which is actually easier like I think
you guys should definitely look into
this if you like intermedium with
javascript and you like ready to start
making your own bundles and get all tax
managing system like go ahead check this
out
fuse box definitely JIT send me an email
KC is there any books on react worth
buying um I don't know I don't know if
I'm ready I like books I don't know I
don't know what books are out there I
never learned from books
and the problem for me from books is
like most of the time they outdated as
is like I'm also of the authors it takes
them like a year to write the book and
then next thing you know by the time
they release it is already old
hey man send me an email

this whole week l-like is crazy I
was at work I wanted to work another
cracking horn and then around 11 o'clock
um my partner came in we was like
chopping it up talking about um what we
got to do throughout the week cuz we
just released the website and then right
after we doing that dog the owners of
the companies came in and we're talking
to them and soon as we're talking to
them my girlfriend calls me up like hey
man like hurry up my water broke I was
like what so it's pretty crazy it wasn't
pretty crazy week went well yeah man and
then from there I got this whole week
this whole week off rent and then next
week I'm gonna take off to a mighty go
for my work from home dog um get some
parental leave I don't know paternal
leave her alone I mean we kind of talked
about it me and my you know one of the
companies and everything I don't know
it's like it's more for for women right
so women when they have a kid they they
got like three months of it they could
come back later on before man is weird
is you can't just be like hey man I just
had a son I'm gonna disappear for three
months all right so what I'm doing is
I'm taking this week off and next week
I'm gonna work from home and then the
week after that I'm gonna go back in
like on Tuesday or Wednesday so but they
cool man yeah I think so too man I think
as man we also me you know
Equal Rights really you definitely need
those equal rights cos women fight for
it they fight for their right
but as men we don't have rights for kids
we don't have rights as a father we
don't have rights for so and also
it's like even for you guys man oh you
you young guys you guys gotta be careful
man you get caught in the wrong
situation a woman can tell you hey he
raped me and I say your for life
that doesn't mean to be no proof or body
you just get right now if a woman
comes to you and I be like yo she gets
into a fight or anything happens to her
she could just literally come to you and
be like hey man he hit me next thing you
know you're for life friend or
another situation if a woman decides to
be like hey I'm putting your ass on
child support man your for life so
right so it's like as men we don't have
certain records it's kind of up
no baby models for you Randy that's why
you can't have baby mamas man you gotta
have the mothers on your your kids
there's a big difference like you see
like the you know the mother of my kids
like you've been together five years
we've been good for a long time you know
but even if we want to break up one day
I don't think like they'll be like drama
like that I consent that I think
somebody already made they kind of made
an app for that I think they already
made it because of situations like that
so in especially college campuses and
stuff like that I don't know
a girl this is this girl this girl right
so which is kind of ridiculous
right I don't know you guys got to look
up the story this girl she pretty much
she pretty much like ruining some kid's
life and she didn't get rid lake I mean
I know this video is going to a very
dark place right now I like to just tell
you guys what rights do men have right
so this is kind of ridiculous
that this girl this girl she
basically claimed that some kid raped uh
um and he never did he never raped her
they have sex and then the next day she
regretted it and from there she says
that he raped her I don't believe if you
regret something the next day rape is
when somebody's out like they're
unconscious and they can't
defend themselves that's rape rape is
when somebody comes in and grabs you in
the middle of the night and raves you
that's rape you have sex
with a guy and then you send to him you
know pictures of your and
all this crazy and doing a whole
bunch of crazy
and then telling him I hey I wanna have
sex with you I want anal sex and all
this crazy that she said to him on
text and then she walks around Colombia
the next Auto for the next two three
years with a mattress saying hey
this guy raped me and the guy didn't
 rape you because if the guy
 has
switches and you regret it the next day
that's on you MA nobody told you to have
sex with a guy like I don't know when
she's to me this is like the poster
child to like a bitch like to me
she's a bitch Oh like look up the story
guys search girl Columbia mattress male
victim of Matt yeah a mattress girl
harassment victimized again by
close-minded judge so this girl
decides to become famous for some
that never happened like it's
ridiculous way amen sorry I went I went
into a dark place yeah when
yes you faked the whole shake so use a
 retard how are you I think that
it takes me to get a job like that I
mean it could be pretty hard like you go
to one of those interviews I've been
interviews guys that is like you know
120k once you get to like anything above
120,000 like they expecting so much
so much from you guys it's not even
funny
they ask you like oh are you part
of the community uh how long have you
been using react have you
 sucked off Mark Zuckerberg like
they actually so much that is kind
of ridiculous I guess the difference
between hey I could do your job
and I could do it good then to just be
pretty much they want you to be like
 Dan Abramov like you know
like that happens guys it's hot it's
 hard to to get one of those
180,000 job you know hungry eighty
