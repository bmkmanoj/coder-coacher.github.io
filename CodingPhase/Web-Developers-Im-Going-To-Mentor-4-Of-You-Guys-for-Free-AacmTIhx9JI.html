I'm love you let me know all right guys
listen I just thought of this man cuz i
always get
SI you like can you do this and this for
me I'm only gonna do this for three
people everything but I could really get
you up to speed man I go up to where you
need to be and probably a month or even
less okay the four people well maybe
three maybe four but I really wanted to
do three a minimum right so three of you
guys or 4 i'm gonna choose all right you
guys gotta email me and basically this
is something serious it's not
around this is not playing around
because if you're not gonna take this
serious don't email me because other
people here you're gonna take their spot
all right so don't waste my time
or their time right so pretty much this
is the plan right I got a mentor you I'm
gonna give you projects to do on a
weekly basis and I'm gonna check to see
where you at as far as progress right
I'm gonna help you build your portfolio
build your resume just get you up to
speed right now this is gonna be
completely free a lot of people charge
for this to be honest with you this
 people pay for it when you
go to a boot camp that's pretty much
what you're paying for for getting the
hands-on with somebody that is already
in the industry or really have a lot of
experience in this right and that's ma
you know that's me so um the plan is
you're gonna send me an email send me an
email with writing at least two three
lines of why you should be picked all
right tell me how long have you been
watching my videos
and tell me which one was your favorite
video and I don't know just share
something with me tell me but you gotta
tell me which one was your favorite
video of mines that you liked or
whichever was the one that made you
actually subscribe right so take
advantage i'm gonna do is completely
free i'm gonna mentor three of you guys
or maybe four and basically also to you
you must agree to basically record the
meetings that we're going to do so i'm
gonna do group meetings once a week on
Thursdays all right and today is the
first day so you have I don't know maybe
today or maybe two next thursday might
be the first day that we do a meeting
and we basically got to do a meeting for
one hour I'm gonna give I'm gonna look
out and what love what you guys are at
individually because I can't give a
project to you know for all three of you
guys the same project if you guys are
not on the same level so for one month
right so this is going to be four
meetings we're going to do right and
we're gonna show the people the
improvement that you get from this you
know this little mentor mentorship
heights elementary your mentorship I
don't notice it but what it means
is just I'm just going to help you out
for one month right so every week on a
Thursday we already know tuesdays i
usually do my podcast thursdays is going
to be something like you know doing them
the meet up with you guys and you must
agree to basically have this public so
don't worry about it don't worry about
if this thing is you know you're not up
to par and you're like oh man I don't
have no skills right now or my website
is gonna look like shim people's gonna
look at it that is the point of the
 video
it's like basically is going to show
your improvement and show people how
much you can learn on your own that's
the goal right because I'm not going to
give you guys nothing that's extremely
difficult stuff that I know takes years
to to build I'm not gonna tell you build
something with just the knowledge of one
week I'm gonna tell you guys build
something that I know you guys could
build in one weekend I could give you
the resources where to get it or where
to learn it but you have to really be
motivated you have to be basically say
hey I'm gonna do this don't
waste nobody's time because if I choose
you I'm really gonna be pissed
off if any of you guys slack and don't
do the the project that you're supposed
to do by thirsty all right so if today
we do a little meeting basically you
know we do a little meeting and then
from there I'll give you a project and
then from there by next Thursday it has
to be done completely completed now
throughout the whole week you
could send me man you know emails or
messages and I will answer any questions
that you might have throughout this week
right I don't know maybe I didn't
explain this perfectly or whatever
because I just thought about this later
you know how I am guys like I just come
up with an idea I'm like you know what
 it let's do it like no planning no
no nothing is just like okay this is
organic that she came out from the left
side of my brain let's
do it and let's get it popping right I
mean if somebody gave me that
opportunity in the beginning when I
first started I will take it all right
somebody that's going to help you out
most people don't do that they
don't try to help nobody out so that's
my goal here to help you guys out and I
want to show the other people that are
here on this channel to see like hey man
that's what you could do in one month in
the type of level that you you get to
you know if you bust your ass and I know
you guys are a really serious about this
so that's that's the plan i just want to
show people that you could do the share
on your own man i'm gonna show you show
you guys and teach you guys the easiest
way to basically learn how to do web
development right away all right so yeah
let me see who's interested in here let
me see who actually in here and
throughout the messages is actually
interested okay let's see the Neil what
up what up what up Lisa what up Tommy
nine Barbara yeah it's breaking up for
you there sorry you guys know how this
thing is let me see honestly that will
be legit so yeah Tommy meant sign up man
send me an email so I could put you in
yeah exactly what's my email or coding
face @ gmail.com well calling friends ya
konan face at gmail com yeah
yeah because you know it is a great idea
like I thought about it my way like I
can't help every single person here
right on this channel that comes to my
channel and watches me it's almost
impossible I get thousands of people
that that watch me this you know at
least 20 to 30 people that send me
emails constantly now I can't help every
single person but what i can do is take
this as a as a high call it's like a
 test of just like take three to
four people teach them and then at the
same time record the sessions that we do
so then the thousands of people that get
to watch my channel who also follow
those instructions on their own time and
like you know some of you guys might be
a little bit more advanced than the
other so that whoever relates to the
other person like let's say if I know
nothing and I got into this internship
and I'll be like okay I get in this and
then I see somebody who doesn't know
anything tool on the video then I could
be like okay I get it I see what I gotta
work on now if I'm a little bit more
advanced than everybody else and I see
somebody who's more events in the video
then I'll be like okay cool I'll get it
I'm more like him i'm already up to his
level I already know JavaScript I
already know whatever you know and yeah
that's it so what do you guys think
about that
yeah so sign up Daniel let's do it let's
do it Lisa you know be cool man i'll be
honest i would love to have two guys and
two girls if we if we could get it today
man i mean you have to be available to
start today or next thursday it's up to
you guys send me an email Jose song was
it coding face I gmail com sorry I got
so many emails i'm bout to start giving
you my work email and like like every
every freaking thing like so much yeah
exactly yeah Igor that's exactly what I
just said depending I'm gonna you know I
want to do it today i want to start
today do i meet him today if now if I
can't do a meeting today I want to start
it by next Thursday and what the meaning
is gonna be about is to see exactly what
level you guys are at I want to see what
have you guys made yet what has have you
taken before on what level you're
actually at the moment that's the most
important thing for me you know for the
first meeting so there's got to be four
meetings right for meetings and I'm
gonna give you a project so for meetings
three projects for each one right
no no no no it's not just for people who
live in New York but there's the thing
the meetings is gonna be on basically I
have to do it at least eight o'clock a
minimum of eight o'clock 8pm sorry this
thing's going crazy yeah APM it has to
be at least a p.m. at night for me here
in the United States so the problem with
international viewers is that you guys
are like five seven hours away well
ahead of time from me right so then the
time it wouldn't make sense for you guys
you know what I mean like you guys will
be at like what like four o'clock in the
morning or something like that you know
like it wouldn't make sense because you
know you're probably gonna be so tired
and this and that you know what I mean
is this our online mentoring yeah I'm
gonna mentor for people yeah I thought
about it's for people automatically
hopefully it's two guys two girls but if
there's now another you know if now I'm
gonna do three guys and at least one
girl because I want my girls over here
man you know I love the girls man I love
girls who code I have to support them
you know what I mean but yeah i just
want to show that anybody could
do this i was want this thing to be
just like a how you call it like
a test case or oh no i'll be forgetting
words but i just want people to look at
this video and look at this for sessions
there's going to be four sessions
completely free nobody has to pay
anything all i want you guys is that
after the mentoring right
 remember that i did this
for you right and you're going to tell
your friend like oh if i can go watch
this guy like literally that's all I ask
like go watch this channel or at
least help out somebody
you know like once you really get up to
the a certain level like help other
people out that's all I really want out
of this thing but the main goal is to
show people what you could do in one
month right I want to take people from
different for people from four different
levels one that's a little bit more
advanced a loved one that's like
completely that knows nothing somebody
who is intermediate you know what I mean
like in the middle 8 p.m. new york time
I'm gonna do this it's gonna be one
month I'm gonna dedicate myself to those
four people's where they're gonna have
direct contact with me right and then
not only that that i'ma give them three
projects to do each one if they're on
the same level they could do the same
project now if there are completely
different levels i'm a given completely
different projects all right but
remember this you have to be able to be
on camera you have to be able to to be
on an audio at least google hangout
because there's no way i could do the
same I don't know through the phone it
has to be at least or google
hangout plus you know the meeting is
going to be between all four of us at
the same time so it's only gonna be one
hour one hour a week and then throughout
the week you guys can message me and
email me whatever problems you guys my
my fine and then I will help you out to
get through that
I don't I guess you two got a new
feature that if you pinch on your phone
it just does a major zoom in I don't
know why they added that who needed that
that feature but maybe
PewDiePie doing like that or some
but I don't know yeah man it's crazy I
guess a lot of people are are really
really interested yeah man I know I know
it really sucks it really really such
that a lot of people can make it a PM
man but I have to do it at a time that I
am comfortable with you know what I mean
like I get home by five-thirty from
there I gotta cook I gotta eat from
there I got a chill with the
family a little bit so from eight to
nine p.m. i could give you that time you
know anything besides that I can't do it
you know but that's another thing too
don't send me an email unless you're
you're able to make it every thursday at
8pm because then I don't want to be
there I don't want to be going to the
you know during the meeting and then
it's supposed to be for people and only
two people show up or three people show
up like you have to be dedicated to the
 because I'm put it in my
time in this like I don't got time
to be waiting nobody time and
plus you're gonna take the opportunity
of somebody here on the channel who
could have really used this and would it
being able to be here every day you know
every frickin thursday so
let's do it let's do it let's do it papi
Shakur yeah apples in but no knows the
own both y'all girls send me an email
right now man get on this man stop
slacking I've got a mental you
for free man like for a whole
month like people pay money for
this like you get anything for free
and that's what I got I'm gonna get you
to the next level if you're a beginner
in this month I'm gonna get you to a
intermediate level if you are into many
level and will get you to the advanced
level guarantee for free like come on
come on mark come on ma sign up man send
me that email coding face @ gmail.com
and for the guys come on man listen if
this girls don't want it and freaking
know girls get to sign up well too bad
so then we're just going to have a
sausage fest and it's going to be just
for guys doing this and
also still send me an email man guys
because I'm gonna choose the right one
how will they choose to three peoples
i'm gonna read through everybody's thing
and not alarm just gotta go randomly
people that like I know could because
you know could really take advantage of
this
nice nice Mohammed
oh you know you know he would be taxing
you know he's gonna be taxing you know
there's some people out here on YouTube
man they don't lift a finger without
getting paid me I don't care man cuz we
already making money there's the thing
that's why I love you too because i'm
more of a youtuber than a developer
meaning when I come to you too I come
here to have fun and help people out I'm
not here to be like hey cashing in it's
like yo I'm gonna cash in on
every little dime like some other clown
that's out here charging five hundred
dollars for for the same thing
that I'm offering you you guys right now
you know what I don't know man 500 hours
is a lot of money man like if
somebody asks me five hundred dollars
when I first started I wouldn't be like
oh like what the four hundred
dollars I can't afford that cuz i
was earning freakin twelve dollars an
hour what the hell was I gonna be able
to pay 500 for you know for freaking for
meetings like it'll make no sense so
that's what I'm delicious for free man
plus I want to chill with you guys I
wanna you know like look the the people

making people pay like come on I don't
make no sense you don't have to pay to
be a nice person like all it takes is
you can't help out every single person

basically get to the next level then you
know everything I think people
appreciate that more then you just be
