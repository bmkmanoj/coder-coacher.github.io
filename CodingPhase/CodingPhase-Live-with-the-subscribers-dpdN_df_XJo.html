know so what is good sign was this huh
how's everything how's life you can hear
me good yeah yeah hey we got hit we I
hiked up in this bitch you dig yeah I
can hear you man damn people's like you
know why your channel better than this
other people guys listening I do what I
do you know the swag is there there's a
lot of children out there popping up and
I'm happy to you know to be the first
one in here I'm happy to be the first
one to come in and bring all this new or
developers in I'm happy for it you know
what I mean yo yo yo
mmm damn corny face man you're like the
truth man I try to be man I try to be a
try too I'm just a motivational do it
man I'm just a regular dude I'm Joe from
the blog I'm from down the corner you
know right now right next to the to the
swap meet
I'm right there in the corner like yeah
what up got ya got that mixtape what up
yo hey whoa I mean whoa
this is a great time to actually ask you
the question but you know the the
portfolio project right I had sent you a
message on IG about it mm-hmm and you
know you know how we did like the the
projects or the portfolio
Paige right and then the images weren't
showing up right what uh what an
annoying as bug right what any ideal in
what in the world that could be I mean
it works on desktop but on mobile images
go away you know I tried like I told you
uh jg PNG resizing the images none of
that works so I'm just kind of like
scratching my head like what in the
world could it be listen my best advice
would be try putting it through the what
developer starter kit because it could
be something wave parcel Jes the way how
it works
because in reality you're you're
importing everything but it's like like
this is a JavaScript the bundle that
that parcel or releases and compiles it
kind of does like the imports for you so
it could be something like on your phone
it could be like a version behind or it
could be your Android or your iPhone
it's like could be just a browser right
because on Windows it works perfectly my
advice is to put it through all the code
that you have you literally could put it
through the web developer starter kit
and everything will work like this now I
you know that's kind of my fault
I should have just done it with my own
what developer starter capable I said
you know what this thing is easy parse
ljs you don't have to set up anything
and it's like as it's blowing up and
everybody keeps telling me hey Joe use
parse ojs and then when I use them like
okay cool this is fine for like react
but then after a while you start
noticing on my way there's bugs here
this thing doesn't even give me the
errors right it doesn't even tell me
where did the the JavaScript got my
stuff back or what I guess you can't
customize it it's like some Shea is like
you know it's like you you getting
something that technically is gonna be
easier for your integrity is gonna be
better for you boys like some BS anyways
yeah hey wait well how about we do
something like completely like original
out of the blue you know you do your uh
your uh your portfolio reviews why not
do one right now on the fly you could do
mine
yeah go ahead go ahead and hit it up
it's gonna be a burns code calm let me
see burns cold oh the only thing that
that I definitely need to implement on
the site as of right now is you know one
major thing that you always talk about
and emphasize and I totally agree with
you which is you have to have linkable
projects you know like so when somebody
sees the project on the portfolio page
they should be able to click on it and
be directed to a website right mm-hmm
so I mean I got all the domains all that
stuff the only thing is that you know
I'm juggling you know projects here
projects there but hopefully in the next
like week or two I'm trying to have
everything all linkable you know what I
mean that's pretty much the only thing
that I could say that I definitely need
to you know work it out so okay let me
see
okay so here you know this burns code
alright let's see so burns : looks
pretty cool
okay scroll down got the burn resume I
like the colors of it so yeah thanks the
fonts a nice the icons are good pretty
clean so this floor right here are your
projects or so the the top one right
there burn is just about me then you got
the resume then you got the portfolio
and burns blog but I you know I've been
so busy developing stuff haven't really
had time to write anything up in there
so nice so how you did this thing you
basically this right here is basically
what I originally had set it up and it
is a template you know what I mean
I do remember even watching your videos
early on how you would say you know you
can use a template for how you're trying
to showcase your stuff as long as they
can have
like as long as you can actually put
like your twist on it and at the same
time you know try and show the way I see
it is trying to show where you're trying
to get to you know it him so to me it
was kind of just like well a place to
showcase my work it definitely has to be
a site that you know is is very clean
and maybe steps ahead of where I can
currently develop at you know what I
mean mm-hmm
but but at the same time it just gives
me something to still aspire for and I
think that's always been something that
that uh that's really big to me another
major thing is the fact that I see you
know a lot of guys that you know that
they'll be questioning like oh should I
do you know just original work from
scratch you know using your web
developers kit right or or using a
applets and stuff like that the more and
more I start messing around with stuff
messing around with code the more I
realize you know some people can do from
scratch and some people can't even mess
around with templates you know being in
my front-end web engineering course at
the University right now you know what
are the major things that popped up was
a lot of people not knowing how to even
work with templates you know working
with frameworks you know a lot of people
that'll hop right into the CSS start
trying to you know change values change
this change that when in reality you
should be changing just classes on the
HTML you know what I mean yeah but but
you know when when you have no prior
like a proper training some of those
things can you know they go by paths and
they just passed you up and you're like
I had no idea that was even the case you
know so I think it was just really
important to show that you know I can do
projects in a template form and then I
can do projects from scratch and then
you know what I mean I can do projects
with other people in a group you know
what I mean so ya know I feel your fill
you in that you know I think the the
website itself looks legit I like the
holidays I wish more of your your
projects I could click on them and yeah
be able to go in there or as far as like
the presentation of the the page itself
is legit you know it's like you have a
bank
you know you have your landing page it's
like you tell them to scroll yeah it's
like you got your resume you got your
portfolio you got all of your projects
in here so to me you know it looks very
professional so as far as that it looks
like Jay the projects that you have I'll
see you got the virtual virtual business
card the early on time I don't know
which one is this one that's uh that's
actually the the task manager that that
you have in your in your website as well
partner oh yeah you see that's what
that's what I'm saying that you did
right because it's like it's a project
data you know I was like wait which one
is down I was like okay so you changed
it up that's exactly what you're
supposed to do cuz I tell people all the
time is like if I come to your your your
website and even though we did a project
together you supposed to tweak it and
make it your own you know so it's like
you make it you know because even that
that like there's nobody out that I can
say hey everything that they do is
original it's always inspired by
somebody else or somebody else somewhere
already did it subconsciously you
already you know you saw it once and you
got inspired by it
you know I mean but the whole idea
behind is that you got to make it your
own you know so it's like I doubt that's
how because I don't even notice I was
like yo what project is that like oh my
god oh alright yeah most definitely that
that's that's really the way that I see
it you know and I think everybody should
just see it that way but I think I think
for some people maybe they just feel a
little bit like to you know
self-conscious maybe maybe they're like
oh I don't know if my style is good or
what have you so they try and stay close
to home I guess you could say they try
and stay close to the course or whatever
but you know yeah I mean hopefully this
video would just maybe inspire people to
just try and switch ideas up I mean also
right there on the bottom you can see
the social media one that you did I just
called it a burn blend and and you know
yeah just try to just try to tweak as
many little things as I could you know
nice nice
yeah man and where you from you from
your lady right yeah I'm from LA man I'm
still waiting for you to come down yeah
hey how does that come out the
the freakin spa I'm in there like a
pretty walk-in doing my man those
know who I'll be out there man when I
touch down it's like yo what out we are
here in the swap meet
what are we out here by about a palm
trees man it's like yo my whole lingual
changes up it's like what up cuz you
already know we here we on the block you
did a 1400 you did so anyways man
yes bracket you filling out but yeah man
I'm dying to go back to honey I haven't
been here lately like I don't know when
man it's been a while it's been like
under like five years probably yeah last
time I went was before I even met my my
wife he's always like we've been
together for five years so it's been a
while now okay okay congrats bro yeah
man what once I touch now man is a wrap
I will be like yo Chris so we outside
come on we got the belly we out here man
we ain't a fish I'll be hit me up what
IG I already told the bear meet you Cody
faces roll out yeah what are the
dispensaries real quick hey hold on got
that broccoli yeh it's like that out
here right now oh yeah I mean most
definitely man you know just I think
everybody everybody in here I think
would agree man but you definitely you
know what I liked about you right off
the bat you know just like you always
like to say you you're not you're not
the you're a typical you know you're not
the typical cat coming in here trying to
you know sound all nerdy and trying to
like do this and do that I remember I
remember I did one one video on my
youtube channel I have no videos on my
channel you know what I mean I just did
one one time because I was just like I
wanted to explain what was its selection
sort the selection sort algorithm you
know what I mean and I just saw no
resources online for just like a guy
like me a guy like you and me you know
what I mean that just look man this how
it works it's not complicated it's not
crazy you know what I mean and I'll tell
you one thing bro I mean I'm a kid
came from remedial math you know what I
mean when I went back to college I
started in what right here in Cerritos
College and what's called like math 60
math 80 which is basically basic algebra
hmm I basically had a work my way just
just to you know just to get myself into
a CS program at university you know when
you think about the the logic and I want
this to like go out to everybody that
really thinks about this you know so
they can analyze it but it's basically
about defying the odds you know
statistically in any class and I mean I
know you have mentioned both of your
teachers on both of your parents or
teachers you know what I mean so you're
part know this very well but you know
typically 50% of students pass on to the
next class right so when you think about
it like that
math 80 to go on to geometry which would
be the next class a 40 class you know a
size of 40 students in a class right
only 20 make it onto that next class
from there to make it onto trigonometry
only 50% more so that's 10 people right
there so make it some pre count not as
five people right there to make it to
calc one now that's two and a half
people right there to make it's a cow -
well now that's a person and 3/4 of a
person so it's like you know and then to
ultimately pass that the person don't
even exist anymore
you know what I'm saying long story
short all the people and I'm being dead
honest Oh most of the people if not all
the people in my program they don't see
things like I do they don't visualize
things like I do they don't have an eye
for design like I think I do
you know so I can't relate to any of
them yeah yeah I mean not not the least
of which I'm 32 years old and I've
worked in management and I've worked in
insurance and I've worked in sales and
some of these cats have never even had
one job you know what I'm saying you
know we definitely have nothing to talk
about
yeah yeah I see somebody like you and
it's just refreshing you know yeah no
that's that's exactly why I created the
channel when I came in here man if you
see my very first video I'm like a
little bit stiff I'm like oh I can't
lose I couldn't loosen up too much it's
like we're talking about code but
they're not the same time like you're
like I just want people to see me as
just some regular dude is
just having regular conversations like
you know I feel like coding programming
math in general is boring and people
don't want to admit that a lot of times
yeah right but it's a teacher who makes
it fun it's that person who comes in and
breaks it down for you and we're oh this
is cool like you know I used to always
say math until probably like eighth
grade so hope my whole life I hated math
and then I liked math grade and I was
like oh this is cool
and then what was cool about it was like
there is like it's whatever you return
at the end so it's like no matter what
two plus two is four you can't come in
and be like maybe it's like a four and a
half no bro it's four so even if you
don't know English even if you don't
know anything like you could be from
whatever like great one of the best
professors that I had as far as math was
calculus to it was like ah there's this
African dude um I think he was like from
Kenny or something
he was real Africa somewhere you know
somewhere under the tree so the dude was
like you know he couldn't speak he
couldn't sing nothing but everything
that he taught us it was like he made
calculus seem easy right so it's always
the person that that's teaching you that
makes it easy and then at the end of the
day is just like you know there's a
solution to everything and there's a you
know even though we all might be
thinking differently and we all might
look differently at the end of the day
two plus two is gonna be four you know I
mean so that's why I liked it and I feel
like for me here on YouTube is just more
like I just want people to come in here
and be like oh I don't even know if I
could do it is I don't even know if I
should be in this soon as they see me oh
this dude is in here man is like Joe's
in here you know what I mean it's like
we got Joe from the block out here you
know what I mean so as soon as they see
that then I okay I'm comfortable get to
be myself I get to feel comfortable with
who I am and you know what I mean like
that's what I want for people you know
so especially in this industry you know
when you think about it
like let's say Google write the numbers
of Google is like 30% Asians most of
them are Indians and in some Asian East
Asians some right so it's less way less
or East Asians than Indians in GU and
then from there there's like 4%
Hispanics and 2% black and it's like
that's that tells you everything right
that tells you everything how the
industry is you know whatever whatever I
go to a company I probably be the only
Spanish doing there right probably the
first ones to get hired you know what
I'm saying so it's like I'm in there I'm
the Rosa Park of the office you know
what I mean I'm in there like yo I'm not
sitting in the back you know I mean like
I'm in there putting the flag so it's
like here it was the same thing yeah
I'll come in put in the flag you know
it's like now was watching or was this
key how you call this out this kid the
dreaded death right I'm not saying that
I love that guy yeah I love his show -
it's like it's just comfortable you
remind me of me when I just first came
in here I was I just saying walling out
and I was like yo I feel like I don't
know if he was inspired by me or he has
seen my show or anything but at the same
time I feel like I opened the door for
people to just be themselves make fun of
like coding and make have fun with it
you gotta say like before me there was
nobody doing this everybody was in here
like here's a function guys this
argument boy and argument you and then
from there we just return this and
return that as like I don't know who
talks like that in real life you know
what I mean a lot of people do I mean
the majority of my college and so I mean
it's just it's just the fact I mean put
it to you like this and the engineering
and computer science college at my
school I think it's what I mean that I
know of that I know what I mean
Latinos I think it's like maybe like six
of us yeah and then and then my home
would Devante gotta be the only black
yeah so holding down holding down the
statistics
mean that 1% out here you know is like
yeah I mean and it's a sad reality but
you know I hope that like you know
channels like like like yours and you're
right I didn't see one like yours before
you so you definitely had to be a
trailblazer and it's just I mean if
anything I think it shows the sign of
the times right before it was like
people would tell you oh we gonna have
flying cars or we go and do this we're
gonna do that people now have like yeah
yeah you kept talking all that mess now
we'd be trying to tell the youngsters yo
learn coding five to ten years from now
you're gonna need it one way or another
mm-hmm but it's very hard for people to
trying you know cap that when they've
never had a job I mean I hate to say it
but if you've never had a job then you
just don't really understand how for
example if I'm I'm your boss I wouldn't
pay you to do something repetitiously
I'm sorry I just wouldn't I wouldn't pay
you
hour after hour for you to just keep
doing the same thing over and over again
I'll give you a good example when I went
to school for computer computer
numerical programming right control
programming which is basically like
programming for manufacturing parts and
everybody in this country right now
talks about manufacturing and where are
the jobs and where they go they're in
the same spot same spot Joe the only
difference is that for example in that
case it was me and I showed up to the
company where I was you know at at that
time ended up replacing thirty people
bro thirty people I walked through the
door they just looked at me like damn
this is it like I was the Grim Reaper
yeah just came and I just killed all the
job so you know but it's like but it's
not me you know I mean I hate to say it
but people had been telling these people
for a decade maybe more get ready get
ready dude you know but I mean this how
it is is like is a back in the days you
know I always bring it back cuz you know
it's like back into these you know the
the guy that just came out and was like
man we got them horses out here man he's
at the corner he's like this is
thoroughbred I feed this horse nothing
but but chicken you know I mean so it's
like these grass horse it's like oh this
is gonna be the best money making horse
right here we get any type of little
horse out here we mix them together and
we get the best horse
right that guy was spending all his
money into that horse now realizing that
just around the block there was some
dude putting a little part together
another little part together came back
with a little car that could drive for
the tractor for five miles per hour he's
like that's not going nowhere
two years later the guys over here
driving a Ferrari in 1901 or whatever
right so it's like now now I was like
hey man you that's the industry there
goes that industry the horse industry
done for you know when was the last time
you seen a horse outside besides a
freaking cop or something like that you
gonna say absolutely
hey we got somebody else in here without
without without without what I would I
was going Kevin Kevin Kevin say say hey
what it do what it do what's up Kevin
hey keV would you firm away from a man
I'm from Phoenix bro hey let's go were
Union right now hey Z up top sir yes sir
so yeah so yeah mr. Oh what we were
saying like you know like industries
change and people got understand at some
point the industry is gonna change no
matter what so if you was trying to Bank
in on like oh we're always gonna have
manufacturing jobs it's like yeah
there's gotta be manufacturing jobs but
now is different now is the guys that
maintaining the robots the guy that's
going in put him in that little extra
grease on a man like a you know putting
down you know what I mean I
that's the jobs that's coming in it's
like right now the people that talk
about all you and gas and this and then
they're like man you know some point
it's like there's gonna be guys just
putting up you know solar panels on
every corner don't be mad at them when
you know there's no more jobs for the
guys dropping the you know the oil and
the gas and this and everything's gonna
be from solar panels you know what I
mean so if you didn't think ahead and
say hey
I'm gonna start you know studying into
something goes to my local community
college get you know I've seen so many
different programs where it's all around
technology and people don't take
advantage this this place is that they
give free courses to people there's like
three boot camps out there it's like
free meetup saying you know it's like
people haven't really thought about
these things in to really say hey I'm
just gonna switch it up you know what I
mean like they think that thing is gonna
be there forever you gonna say let's
like when people now is like bring coal
back in as I bro like ain't nobody going
in there man those is outside those is
outside the coal mine like I don't know
if i'ma go in there man I've seen that
movie from the Chile people the peruvian
chilean it's like i seen my dad do that
i don't know bro you like that he died
at 40 i don't see this is what I was
talking about though I seriously think
like like this like this beautiful
discussion right now like I mean this is
definitely a sign of the times you know
what I mean when when when it's no
longer you know the demographics that it
used to be when it comes to developing
and and software when we can finally
like say you know what we here yo you
know what I mean us as minorities we're
here that's a beautiful thing and and
you know I just think that like this is
the definition of it right here you know
what I mean like for the youngsters that
are watching this video right now this
should be the wake-up call this should
be letting them know that this is
already happening you know for real now
you talking to some folks that are you
know saying like you know my boy Hector
he's 32 I'm 31
Jose 30 so it's like we've been through
this already you don't know saying like
we've been through the other way or how
society wants us to be you know so now
we're things different you got to take a
chance and put yourself out there and do
something different because the way that
society has is going it ain't work you
know Sam right now I think
it doesn't matter what career it is as
long as the surrounding technology you
could be your you were UI UX designer
you could be you know somebody who is an
engineer focusing on renewable energies
because if you're trying to become
engineer and you're like hey man I'm
trying to build radios and saying bro
like yeah that time passed man you got
on sound like you your timing is done
you know you you want to be doing
something that is for the future you
know like I was I put this video up
today for the crystal Lang right crystal
lane right now it's not popular
crystalling is not something that's big
right now but is literally beating every
other programming language out there so
as a developer got it and see what it is
because a year from now two years from
now this thing is gonna blow up you know
what I'm saying like let's keep an eye
on it you gotta keep an eye on it you
know what I mean cuz so how long people
is gonna be oh well we're let's do no
js' let's do PHP let's do this and that
there's gotta be a point where it's like
hey we gotta be working with other stuff
like hey we need a programming language
that can handle way more requests and
just the stuff that we've been doing
lately because especially now because
everything is all connected like right
now when you get home you know it's like
you're fun you got your phone let's say
ten years from now you're gonna get home
everything in your house is gonna be
connected to the Internet well most
people got Smart TVs you feel like you
know that's the entry point you gave us
and so it's like they're from there it's
like I've seen our Samson fridge that's
connected to the Internet
your car is already connected to the
Internet so all of this stuff right if
you wanted to get notifications on six
for example you want it to get
notification from the you know the Harry
Potter comm right and you get in that
little notification if every single
device out there is connected swing
constantly getting uh you know
notifications and getting you know back
and forth requests between both the
whatever the device and the
at some point we're gonna need something
that's way more powerful than what is
out there right so that's where
something like crystalline comes into
the picture whereas I hey man the people
even going back a little bit like a year
two years ago when people are talking
about golang people are all going yeah
some say that some guy at Google built
and and this and that is cool but it
looks ugly a lot of people that live in
pain tomorrow you check a whiteboard on
me I got like three of them yourself
somebody in a chat my bad yeah so
there's like they they just you know
they didn't even pay attention to it but
now look at it and you look at the jobs
guys is getting a 180 K for golang 250 K
because nobody knows how to use it right
but those guys man those guys that came
in at first I was like wait hold on
let's try this Alice this put in some
little work let's create some little you
know a little algorithm and with this
thing it's doing Oh rest api
with the golang now those guys is gonna
pay man money because they already have
two years in under their belt you're
gonna say this is the same thing with
something like Chris was about to pop
off man so there's like if you smart you
want to really just focus on that this
like world I consider this thing like
the Bitcoin of programming right now
because it's like one of those things
was like oh yeah
Bitcoin a few years ago is all you some
 online and then some guys came
in and say you what if I spend $1,000 a
of bitcoins and all those bitcoins were
like 10 cents something slept on it got
like 50 K or whatever it was you know
like them big connect scheme folks
exactly those guys got money these guys
definitely did people dirty those guys
scheme did they say I did this a man
we're gonna put a couple of guys on
YouTube and it this goes back to the
idea where I always tell people don't
believe every profit that's out there
right there's a huge difference between
somebody that's telling you what you
need then somebody was telling you what
you should get right if you need
something like right now I could come in
and tell you hey
guys just focus on let's focus just on
nodejs focus on or you know you know I
don't know the freaky Harry Potter
framework right that's something that I
love right that's something that I'm
invested on something that I care about
and I tell you to go do that but what
you really need was somebody to tell you
hey man go study some PHP because the
jobs are there and your junior developer
those are the companies that gonna give
you that opportunity right answer no js'
developer is gonna be rare that a
company is gonna come in and say hey we
have a whole bunch of developers from
php.net and Java that have like 10 years
under their belt and now they want to
switch over to no js' are they gonna
spend their money on you who never had a
job or those guys that have like you
know 10 years under their belt you get
what I'm saying so it's like what you
really need is PHP you know so it's like
online is the same thing people come in
you're constantly looking for the right
research the right resource a lot of
times people are like false prophets
people come in and say oh this is what
you need this is what you got to do it
it's like they're not being honest with
you they either getting paid by somebody
you know it's like every youtuber out
there that it's like that has a boss
let's say 50,000 subscribers right they
all have done or was it definitely right
for example to put them out there right
oh definitely
everybody that has promoted them they've
gotten paid right somehow they was
trying to get me before I was was 10,000
subscribers in for a reason because it
was like hey if we get visiting it's
like if we get this guy behind our back
is like let's say we won and it's like
nah I'm more of a realist I'm like hey
if I did it on my own why do you need to
go pay $20,000 get yourself in debt and
pay for a three-month program that you
could have done that in your house if
you have $20,000 that you could throw in
the air and say hey I'm gonna I'm not
gonna work I'm not gonna go to school
I'm not gonna do anything I'm just gonna
go to this boot camp if you have that
luxury to say I'm gonna
up everything you can actually do it in
a month and a half because you could do
it at your own pace in your own house
without having to do it with anybody
else they're like there's you know some
people like to be spoon-fed so exactly
that's the thing that's where it comes
in with these companies and everybody
that's out there it's an industry you
know what I mean like I the reason why
I'm so against boot camps because I know
that industry I know the industry of
selling something that's hot at the
moment and then disappearing I know that
because I actually went to like a
quote-unquote like a Institute when I
was 19 years old I went to I uh was I
are which is a Institute of audio
research to become an audio engineer
right I went to I went to the school and
they just constantly everything was
super fast the teachers didn't care if
you understood it they just cares okay I
taught my lesson that said we move on to
the next step move on to the next thing
next thing you know you graduate and
you're like wait I'm not up to par the
professionals but now I'm in a $14,000
debt you know what I mean like I already
went through that so it's like I'm not
gonna tell people hey go do this when a
reality is like they're not gonna teach
you nothing that you can't get for free
then I'm gonna teach you anything that
you can't get for 10 15 bucks on on
udemy or even on my website you for $10
you get in one month you come and you
get the whole basics of what for $10
literally so it's like people don't know
these things in this type of Industry
they take advantage of that this is like
oh yeah there's so many opportunities
yes there's opportunities out there but
you gotta understand like when you come
into one of those boot camps you are a
dollar sign
you're not Oh little Bernie's coming in
where you know a little brainy a little
chemin hi Kevin
we're gonna make sure you get you know
you get hired that's our goal here is
like bro is like once your financial aid
gets e'en up your whatever your freaking
your loan comes through you're like I
sign got him we had in the back like
time you know what I mean like yeah what
keeps me
or those degrees aunt got no job so many
times it happens to people all the time
man and I just wish like you know more
people will be more outspoken to people
that have failed in boot camps cuz does
the problem is like nobody wants to look
stupid on the Internet this only way
this is stupid nowhere nowhere so
there's only one or two guys in there on
YouTube that you could actually see that
they were honest with it that I gave man
I went to a boot camp here in Memphis
it's been a year and a half I'm still
looking for a job and like bro you know
the young uns should know though the
young uns should know like you know real
caste like like us three right now we
can see right through all your BS anyway
so we'll fit we'll put two and two
together earlier you were talking about
you know these false prophets that are
like oh yeah we're gonna teach you
Python or we're gonna you know like a
notable example is the sin how relaxed
we are were yapping about our nonsense
yeah when you when you go onto one of
those other youtube channels were hey
guys you want to learn Python you want
anybody that comes to like that on the
street or online that's a person with
low self-esteem every all they can do is
just try and put up a side yeah that's
that's what they're depending on yeah
you know what I mean now that's a that's
like somebody you know you know when you
go to like let's say Macy's right and
it'll be the maddest it'll be the
baddest chick that comes out of nowhere
she comes with like a low low piece of
paper and she's like hey you wanna smell
this
it's like he's like yeah a brand new
brand new cologne is like you sure you
don't want to smell it it's like come on
you could get this he's like she's super
being super nice to you I was like oh my
god I love your jacket is like I know
what you're doing MA like I know you are
here trying to sell that that cologne so
it's the same thing as a lot of people
dance that's out here you know what I
mean like they
so dreams when I come in here I just be
honest with it I just be like yo guys
listen I'm self-taught I'm literally
what everybody's out there that's
looking at me through the computer their
phone wherever you see me right now I'm
just like you yes some regular do that
somehow figure this thing out on his own
save myself with a whole bunch of money
I was actually smart I never really
spent more money than than what I need
to you know there's another thing
there's a very good topic that I want to
get into you know later on maybe another
video where I just break down how to be
successful as a developer because you
could be a developer you could work out
Google you could work out whatever
company you think that you're successful
at and then you actually spending more
money than what you earn a lot of those
guys living and literally freaking the
size of this room this this is their
apartment that's it
like a lot of them those guys that you
think oh man he works at Google he works
at the YMCA right so freaking you look
into their finances you start notice
romantic it's how much you say yeah how
much money you really got in your pocket
you know what I mean like mama said you
know a lot of those guys they came and
pull out anything and you know they
messed up credit you know you can't get
a loan like all those things now can get
a car because all that money is wrapped
up in that rent
that's why they taking a motor all the
time but that's what I say like that's
that's another part of it but it's like
you could come in here right and you
could say hey I'm gonna come in as a
developer become successful we work for
XYZ company and then the next thing you
know is like you're spending more money
than what you needed to write you'd
think like oh I got great benefits what
benefits when in reality you you spend
man money or every freaking month you
got to spend on housing you got to spend
on buying food you gotta spend on going
out you know I was like now everybody
wants you to pay for things so it's like
nobody really talks about real life
topics of like you know just this career
you know this field or even your life in
general like most people don't talk
about you bring up a good point and I
think one of those may
your problems also I think I don't mean
I don't know if it's you know I guess I
can only speak from experience I don't
know if it's just minorities or what but
man parents do a horrible job about
explaining what really matters and we
really don't matter you know what I mean
I think that like and this goes whether
your parents are making good money or
whether they weren't making good money
but it's like a lot of times I mean I
hate to say it like in my case I mean my
parents are all all good but there's
some parents you know though they'll do
something they'll mess something up or
whatever and just like you said they're
scared of looking stupid
yeah but but to your kids you should let
them know you should tell them like hey
look man like this is it and it was a
you know but I think that like you know
that's one major issue you know with us
as minorities it's kind of like you know
you got like the the arrogant father
that just like walks in doesn't want to
say a thing about what he does whatever
and there's just no direction you know
what I mean there's a reason the word
that were for example going into
software and technology you know what I
mean
more than likely is because you know we
didn't have parents that said hey you
know what
maybe we should do what people were
doing hundreds of years ago and building
a state you know build something for the
whole family
you know and that's what people don't do
here in Americana everything's about oh
you grew up you're 18 okay go buy a
house oh you're 18 go buy a house oh
you're 18 go buy a house and it's like
you know that that's like the the worst
type of way of living right because in
reality you're not setting any actual
legacy you know what I mean if that
makes any sense yeah no no that's that's
how I basically I lived my life in the
sense of like hey man I'm already I'm a
I'm a negative right when I started I
was negative I was like okay there's
nothing behind me I have no pillow
behind me I can't be like hey I'm
looking you can you let me fight I was
another sort to start my own like nah
man I was in I was in the Train
literally like this in New York City
coming out of 14th Street which is Union
Square waiting outside like on the
turnstile waiting for someone you can
you can you swipe me in like that's the
lowest I've ever been in my life and
that was around like 20 years old I said
you know what I gotta change my life I
got to do something right I went to
school did the whole
thing the whole college and I
was like yo this isn't what I wanted to
do went back to my first love which is
coding and you know here we are you know
what I mean but I know already that
everything that I'm doing is actually
for my son like now he's gonna have the
opportunity I didn't have you know I was
like you know what I mean but yeah let's
welcome Jenna in here Jenna what I would
I would up yo what up Jenna what's going
on um I literally just signed up for the
website and I was kind of curious like
what do you recommend to take first like
master JavaScript um what I will say
look at the timeline right so if you
already have HTML CSS I know I did some
changes so I don't want to give you
something that I changed how much time
you think you you're gonna put in per
week so I'm like really looking hard so
okay so let's say 40 40 hours per week
all right
so let's say you already know HTML CSS
you're comfortable with that basically I
will say are you comfortable with CSS
grids yeah I would say so I took a basic
course on that but it's pretty easy so
okay hmm right now I'm probably just
gonna focus on JavaScript
I finished the UM JavaScript section of
the web developer bootcamp in cold steel
and I felt like I was understanding it
better like I'm finally starting to get
this mmm and I moved on right away
yes sex with Steven Grider don't thank
me and I got pretty lost okay yeah so
what I will say is just to revise things
right go and check out future proof
JavaScript start with that one right you
start with that one so basically go
we're the fundamentals of JavaScript
right then from there after you're done
with that then do the gold web developer
starter kit right which is gonna just
seat you how to build your own starter
kit and how to use gulp all right then
from there if you want to if you wanted
to do like the side project build the
static site portfolio you can do that
that's more for practice but definitely
I will say learn pug template engine
because it's useful if you're gonna
learn nodejs or you're gonna learn any
type of template engine out there is
gonna introduce you how to how to work
with template engines if you want I
don't know how comfortable you are with
jQuery so you can also just look go over
write the things that you know already
you could go skip through it right and
then I will say definitely check out
object-oriented programming with
JavaScript and then try learning the es6
well learn is next with me in my course
because I know Stephen Grider the way
how he did it it was cool but I feel
like it can also be confusing right so I
feel like I broke it down way better
than him in the sense of like you know
just making it more relatable to to your
code so you're gonna be able to
understand them more so take the es6 and
then from there jump - I will say jump
to the hyper app application and the
reason why I tell people to join to
learn hyper out before react is because
hyper app teaches you a whole bunch of
concepts that react teaches you but it
makes it seem more difficult than what
it is as a side note to that I had to
hit up joke because I didn't know
about props in state that was confusing
the hell out of me and I went and did a
hyper app course like Joe said over my
eyes right away cuz I went straight to
react so yeah definitely do the hyper
wrap course I was out for that cosine
huge time should learn like yes
that's pretty much like master the other
things before going into yes x4 yeah a
focus or look the first thing you want
to do is like I said the future-proof
JavaScript which is just the basics of
JavaScript you gotta make sure you
understand that and then just scheme
through it because you already did the
what developer boot camp so pretty much
um Coast you went over the basics of it
what I do is I go over the basics and
teach you a little bit more of things
that is gonna be relatable to you by
building the website plus you have the
notification application you have the
pokemon game which it might seem some
people like oh this is too easy but it's
like it challenges you you know to
understand how everything works and how
to put things together okay um then from
there like I said do the jQuery because
the jQuery that's where I really go in
more deeper on Ajax and how to do a crud
with your JavaScript you know doing a
get request doing a post request saving
data so you learned that with jQuery so
by the time you joined object-oriented
programming with JavaScript it's it's
like you understand all the concepts you
understand all the basics now
object-oriented programming it just
teaches you how JavaScript does
object-oriented programming with the
prototype and then from there do es6
because es6 is is JavaScript but if like
if you don't understand JavaScript then
you wouldn't understand how es6 is
saving you time or like the new
functions that is doing what exactly is
actually doing behind the scenes right
because es6 is just really really like
sugarcoating javascript it's like adding
a little extra sense yeah exactly
simplifying the syntax but if you don't
know how the real syntax in JavaScript
look you wouldn't know be able to
understand it or appreciate es6 so yeah
yeah so definitely check those out and
and yeah man I've actually got a go guys
this is great that we we got to do this
today we got to hang out I plan on doing
this on all my live streams where I'm
gonna give out the link the same link
that you got right now this is the same
link that I'm going to be using for my
live stream so whenever I'm live you
guys could literally come in and join
the chat you know I mean I'm playing I'm
planning on doing that from now on you
know to give a voice to the people you
know whoever wants to come in here come
chill you know we're gonna be and do a
little dab you know just chill hang out
yeah you already know man there's dope
man's open I appreciate everything you
do I'm sure we all do bro and keep doing
your thing so yeah man that was all your
boy Hector your girl Jenna your boy
Kevin and yeah we got a squad man guys
if you're seeing this right now if you
seen this in the future that's why you
gotta keep on checking your phone man
check your notifications and just
randomly going to the YouTube app
sometimes they don't give you a
notification you'll see on the home page
of the YouTube app it'll show you hey
Joe is live coding phase is live so you
already know it's your boy Joe back at
it again coding phase dot-com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
