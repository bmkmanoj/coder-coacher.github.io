it again man : freeze calm your boys
backing out and did it again guys we
here to answer your boy Matt he left a
good comment about you know just
basically him becoming a developer so
and it was let me read it for you guys
so he says hey John I've been following
your videos on on and on for a while now
long story short I'm a designer at heart
turn fed I'm a Fed for like Federal Rule
you know I'm working for the feds so I
don't know right for the past six years
I feel constantly like I'm struggling
just to switch my headaches over to deaf
mode especially when it involves
complicated logic like forms and such
all right first of all verbs should be
easy it don't let that Brown okay but
whatever let's move on I'm really
struggling how do you gain confidence to
stick through the rough challenges and
things like JavaScript I need some
motivation courage brother right on the
other hand I can move the hell out of
some HTML CSS and s CSS so pretty much
man you already got the hardest thing
done right which is hey if you're
comfortable with HTML CSS you got the
first part done you know Congrats right
now the next thing is you're probably
thinking in your head man JavaScript the
Dom you know
fourarms Ajax and all of the stuff that
that comes with JavaScript you're
thinking man this is hard this is
difficult
trust me bro this is not difficult now
it might seem like I'm being an a-hole
from coming from this side which I've
already learned this stuff and you're
like man up I'm getting there but when
you say hey Joe
you know I'm trying to get this done and
then ice tell you like oh it's easy
some people take like oh man he just
don't know it's like I dunno guys I went
through the whole thing that you guys
are going through right now listen I
want you guys to really understand
there's no developers that are geniuses
right that's the first thing
the second thing that I will say is that
you have to understand everybody's just
regular people right that's all you need
to really worry about all right
you gotta think in your head hey I'm
just a regular person learning this
stuff I'm not a genius nobody that's
here is a genius what happens is people
put in more time than others into a
certain topic and they become really
really good you know you look at
basketball and you think of a guy who
has never missed a free throw you know
how many free throws that guy throws all
night right a guy that never misses a
dunk is because he constantly Duncan
right and it's the same thing that's
over here with what development learning
how to program you have to understand
the things that are hard right now a
month from now right you're gonna look
back and you'll be like oh my god why
did I think this was so hard this is
easy don't give up already that's the
first thing that you gotta do you cannot
give up not understand you just gotta
keep going at it even if you keep
failing you know you keep getting errors
console.log it figure it out right now
you know you're having the same problems
keep doing them again right you you
don't understand how loops work create
loops constantly so you can get
comfortable with it well you know
functions and creating small little
functions like you know like hey prick
my name or hey multiply two numbers you
know a little simple like that like you
don't need to create this this great big
project for you to say hey I know
JavaScript now you start from the bottom
you start building yourself up every
single day right I know a lot of times
especially if you like you say you work
full time you've been doing this
full-time as a job then I know as far
sometimes it's hard you come home you're
tired you're like man and the last thing
that you want to do is deal with a half
an hour to an hour of debugging or
trying to figure out something you're
like man why isn't this working it still
happens to me till this day I'll be
working on something and I come in
and I bump into a war McMahon what the
hell like I've done this a million times
why today is not working right
could be a semicolon could be you forgot
a variable could be like I say a
variable is yeah camel case you put it
capitalized or let's say you put it on
you missed a letter sometimes it's like
little things like that you realize that
those are really the mistakes that that
are happening to you you know so when
you bumping into this wall of like
JavaScript like man this is difficult
this is difficult know start from
scratch start from the beginning
go slow take your time understand
variables functions loops understand all
those things they're from they jump to
the Dom how to add a class that's what
you need to know for at first how to add
a class to elevate how to remove a class
from your element
how to delete an element from the the
page how to add an element to the page
how to you know they use templates turn
on template strings to to change
something on the page like for example
like you have a variable called name how
do you print out the variable name in
the HTML tag but then when it's on the
HTML tag it prints out your name little
things like that I don't know some
people probably like man this is like
super easy super basic but those are the
concepts in JavaScript that we come hard
for people write a lot of things that
people hit a wall don't like man I'm
trying to print something to the screen
and nothing's working I'm looping
through this thing I'm getting an
infinite infinite loop dot it up you
know I cetera et cetera they feel like
they the hand in that wall don't worry
about that man oh don't worry about it
you're gonna get it right well you went
right now you're gonna realize that a
month from now you're already in the
study a week from now something I said
you a month like a month from now you're
gonna look back in black man how was I
like you know thinking
this was so hard it's just time it's the
time that you put in you have to put
into extra time you know even if like
the same example right now you're
calling for two hours one hour a day try
to go to sleep later right say hey if I
call it go from nine o'clock to ten
o'clock be like man tonight I'm gonna
sacrifice it I'm gonna go from 9 o'clock
to 1 o'clock in the morning and go to
sleep
the next day to work tired but you
knocked out those four hours in those
four hours you should be able to find
the answer that you was having trouble
with right now when you say hey like
what is it that's gonna give you
motivation courage it's the fact that
you want to do this there's really no
way to nobody hold your hand and be like
hey this is how you you don't this how
you gonna go hard and become a developer
nobody can do that for you only you can
do that for yourself all right those
guys that go to the army that go to the
Navy you know the Marines you know
nobody there their mom loves them their
dad loves them their sister loves them
their brothers that loves them hey
everybody's like oh we're rooting for
you but only a few people are gonna make
it to the whole training people just
give up right
I mean how bad do you want it you know
it's bad enough to say hey this you know
one problem that I have an issues with
and it's gonna take me five to six hours
to figure it out or you're gonna be like
add the one hour you're like ah there's
too hard I'm I'm leaving you don't
understand everything in JavaScript is
related to each other all right
like you can't create a function you
can't work with function properly unless
you know how to work properly or
variables right there's really no point
of you understanding other things in the
Dom if you don't know how to run loops
like this things are depending on each
other you know sometimes it's hard even
to teach something like programming to
people because everything is depending
on each other
it's like the first thing you gotta
start as variables and everybody start
winning people in because
like everything that you teach is
depending on each other or sometimes
there's times that you like you try to
teach somebody somebody something and
the thing that you trying to teach them
has something that you have even told
them yet right and then you guys come
back and explain what was that other
thing that was in there and like wait we
were talking about functions was this
thing here happening inside of this
function you got to go back a bit I owe
this hosting and now you gotta come back
and explain it there's so many things
start depending on each other right but
all you have to do is keep pushing
understanding that you're going to get
it nobody special that's my number one
rule for everybody so honestly nobody
special doesn't matter if it was this
guy's name Dan Abramov it doesn't matter
if this was the guy that created Ruby on
Rails it doesn't matter if it's the
creator of Python it doesn't matter if
it's the creator of Linux none of those
guys are special what happens is that
they put in more hours than me they put
in more hours they knew into this that's
it it's that simple it's not like oh
that these people are the smartest
people in the world know these people
put in way more work than us that's it
but it doesn't mean that you can achieve
that you can definitely achieve that all
you have to do is put in those hours how
bad do you want it how bad are you
really gonna be in front of a computer
coding all day that's about it that's
the only thing that I can tell you about
motivation you know and at the end you
know one see you get all of the stuff
done this huh you know a nice little
paycheck at the end of the day like that
you know say how they used to have to
carry in front of like the you know dung
keys and and what was it like the Bugs
Bunny the pull-up camera in front of
them like that's it that's about it
that's not really motivation I can give
you right but what I can't help you out
with is the fact that you know just
keep going stop thinking like that the
end of the world is here because you
can't figure something out at this
moment this moment is like a little blip
in your life you're gonna go past this
thing it's like when people used to
learn how to ride a bike
I mean people remember they for a couple
of times but they remember the times
that they were riding the bike
they don't really focus on the time that
they fell right you know how many times
I fell on JavaScript I many times I
tried to learn it I understand it took
me a long time I'll be honest it took me
a long time to get to their level where
I'm at it took me years but did I give
up no you just keep going you keep
creating you keep creating more projects
and learning from other people right
there's things that I know that somebody
else don't know out there and then but
that person might have something that
they have acknowledged from like Java or
C sharp or c plus plus that they're
coming in to JavaScript and they're
using that knowledge that they brought
from over there and I learned that from
done right and vice versa so it's like
you're constantly learning so don't give
up just keep going at it and I say you
already know simple job back at it again
coding phillies.com
your boys backing out and did it again
and guys listen I told you guys you go
to my website coding face comm I
literally go over all this stuff like
the way how I teach things is in a way
to explain things for somebody who's
self-taught right there's a big
difference between somebody who's
teaching you because they have a
computer science background they have
far but you know how cool is like a
background teaching they teach a whole
different way because they're not
self-taught when you're self-taught you
understand the things that give you
problems so you're like man I can't
learn this I can't teach them this
because when I was trying to learn this
I didn't understand this other concepts
before it and then everybody always
teach you this this thing first well as
itself
developer you hit the wall because this
thing that people are teaching you first
was not the thing that you need to learn
so that's what I do in my website I come
in and break it down for regular people
like me and you who have no history in
programming and just we just learned
that way that's it all right so check
out the description the links below you
should be good and I'll see you guys
later
and Matt whatever you need man holla at
me let me know I'll try to help you out
if look give this a chance I will say go
to my website sign up give it a chance
it's like I believe it's ten bucks if
you feel like you don't learn anything
you cancel right that's it it's ten
bucks it's like pretty much is like the
least amount of money that you're gonna
have to invest into something you could
go and find out a million courses out
there but nobody is going to really
break it down to you in a way of like
somebody who's trying to you know teach
themselves at home how to learn how to
coach so you don't take advantage all
right
email me send me questions guys and I
love when I see comments like this you
know I love seeing comments where people
ask me questions where people leave
something that's related to the topic
where something positive even when it's
negative I like to see it you know so
long as it's respectful we definitely
want to answer it back all right I'll
see you guys later
