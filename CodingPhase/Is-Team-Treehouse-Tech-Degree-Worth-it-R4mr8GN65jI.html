that you're about to see now just make
sure that you subscribe and click on the
little bell because that's the only way
to get notifications Dennis jr. was good
Joe why are your thoughts on team
treehouse Tech degree disregarding the
price do you think the treehouse Tech
degree will make you a more attractive
candidate on the job market let's look
at it let's do a live right so team
treehouse Tech degree let's go live kids
so let's share the screen let's see
same treehouse Tech degree okay let's
see what exactly do they offer
okay front end okay you can go from
beginning in just three to twelve months
with a tech degree like okay in that
project review professional portfolio I
mean this you could do it on your own
and def project review I mean I don't
know to be honest I don't see anything
that catches my attention you know what
I mean like look at this like this and
you say price is not that important but
to me price is important because most
people can't afford $200 a month like
this is like your phone bill your
internet bill or any gas bill put
together in one $200 you get what I'm
saying now does that make sense to you
you know for something that you can go
and pretty much learn everything on your
own like on my website alone and even if
you wanted to discredit my website you
say hey Joel your website is your
website or could you please review
plural cycle you please review team
treehouse will you please review uh uh
other sites and your own guys it doesn't
matter what website it is
if you go to my website and you go say
the timeline look at the timeline if you
want all you have to do is follow that
timeline and then from there you go
you buy the courses on udemy $10 all
right you buy separately you don't even
have to sign up to my website my website
is $10 I'm offering basically everything
that they offering for $200 a month
you're probably going to my website get
it for 20 or $10 a month
very like there's a huge difference
between both of them right $210 it's
like you know it's like if we put this
on programming saying if parentheses
team treehouse is greater than Joe's
coding phase which one should you choose
I don't know it's up to you right if
money's not a problem for you then go
ahead choose thin tree house for
something that pretty much is way
cheaper than that right now what's the
difference in tree house and any other
website block io Udacity all these
websites they all doing the same thing
so be honest with you guys you don't
need somebody to come in and tell you on
your project you know you're you're
missing a couple of pixels to the left
like you don't need that right if you
need somebody to come in every view your
portfolio you get it here for free I'm
calling face.com you get what I'm saying
this communities you go to a freakin
Meetup
you show it to other developers and say
hey man what do you think about my
portfolio hey man you look at this
project what do you think I should do
with this should I fix it up should I
add a couple of new features in the
backend right you know what I mean like
I don't know to me it doesn't make sense
to spend $200 or something that
you can learn on your own for 1020
dollars right and somebody safe mad I
just don't want to go to no Meetup I
just want to come home and do it on my
own and isn't that then in reality you
really don't want it that bad you know
it could be successful for some people
and some people might be blinded to say
hey team tree house was the one that
made me successful or Pluralsight made
me successful or even people might come
in and saying you know five years from
now saying coding face.com made me
successful it's not really coding phase
dot-com team tree house none of these
websites that's gonna make you
successful it's how much work you put in
yourself it's like right now I'm going
to the gym you know I mean I'm going to
the gym I'm working out all this stuff
if I slack if I eat unhealthy if I do
whatever you know then that's on me you
get what I'm saying like at the end of
the month when you see there's no
results you're like damn man you know I
I didn't lose weight I didn't learn how
to go at the end of the month that's on
me you got what I'm saying so is it
worth it is choosing a tech degree like
this isn't it I don't even know what's
what so cold is like this is more like
you know it's like online boot camp
slash let's just grade your your
portfolios and your little projects that
we give you you get what I say like to
me it doesn't make sense you know like
you could pay that to a regular
developer who's gonna come in put listen
put this on Craigslist right now instead
of you spending $200 put on Craigslist
looking to pay $40 $50 a month to a
developer to come in and grade my
projects trust me there's a developer
out there that will grade it for you you
know what I'm saying like you gotta be
smart you know sometimes we we think
like hey man like it has a beautiful
site you know it's a company is this and
dad this is legit guys it's not the
company that's gonna make you a
developer is you you know it's the same
thing that I tell people all the time
the biggest I guess beef that people
think and they have with me when I say
freak Oh campus it could be a trap for
people is because people think like hey
this one location is gonna have all the
answers it doesn't work like that it's
how much work you put in right like when
you go to my website I'll come in and
teach you all the basics teach you
everything that you need to learn to
become a developer right but then from
there you come in and you follow all my
projects right but now if you say hey I
watched one video and they'll keep
watching another video if you're
watching another video and jumping from
projects to projects and you never take
the time to build a project on your own
for months later
don't tell me hey how come I went
through your website and I still don't
know how to code it's like nah you had
to put in your time you have to put in
your own work you get what I'm saying
some esteemed treehouse tech degree
worth it no Udacity degree no this
things are not even degrees like it
should be to me personally I think it
should be even your legal so we would
call it a degree because what what it
does it tells people like oh this is
like Jade like I don't even know what
are the rules of like calling a
university or something like that you
never know sound like wasn't Donald
Trump being sued because he called you
know real estate university or something
like that Trump University or something
like that
you can't do that you get what I'm
saying because is it's lying to the
people it's like people think like oh
yeah I'm getting a degree I've seen
people send me in like their resumes
like Oh Joe could you please check my
resume and SS tink treehouse Tech degree
broom that's not even a degree you get
what I'm saying I hope people understand
that you guys this video is brought to
you by viewers like you and people that
support our website coding face.com go
check it out over twenty courses in
there there's got a guy you to become a
developer from the beginning to becoming
a pro</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
