calling face that comment I'm just
trying to give you guys a little preview
of what you're gonna get in the future
man all right so we're gonna start with
going back to what we was doing before
you know working on this Netflix app
right this clone of Netflix so we're
supposed to have this you know look like
this but right now it looks like this
it's just text so how do we put colors
and how do we change you know the
location of you know certain things like
you know how do we put the logo on the
laugh and how do we put the right menu
all the way to the right well the way
how you do this is with CSS right so in
your head there is a way to basically
put CSS into the file right so you say
style and then here you put in the code
for your CSS so like let's say an
example we wanted to change the color of
the header right and we want to change
the color of all the fonts inside of it
so we'll see
hashtag header which means the hashtag
is actually is basically calling to that
ID right
so when you say hashtag you're saying
okay that's an ID I want the ID name
header and I want to change it to
background let's say for now let's start
with it with letters right black
so you said background black
color color is to change the color of
the fonts inside of it so then you say
okay click run
see now they changed the color of it
right change the color of the background
and the color of every single div inside
of it all the letters inside of it
because this basically this div are
inside of header so anything that's
inside of the header it gets touched by
there's no styles that we put in right
so like let's say now let's break this
down and say okay let's name this a
class instead of using and ID let's use
a class so let's say no go
and then let's copy and paste this right
alright so here we go so so actually be
able to interact with the classes
instead of a hash we use a dot so
instead of the house we use a dot right
so we say okay let's do logo background
go left menu curly bracket remember it
has to be the same name so whatever you
have here for you to change the color or
the size or anything you want to do it
you have to name the same way so then
you go right menu now let's click run
see what happens you see now you
basically you affected all of them right
now you might ask why does it eat go all
the way from you know from left to right
the full width of the page why is it
like that
well the div is a black element I know
this must be crazy to you you might say
what the hell is a black alone well
basically every div every div text it's
actually singing in your styles it's
actually saying like this block alright
but if we wanted to have this to be
aligning next to each other we will have
to say display:inline-block so now you
will go like this
and you will say okay copy and paste
copy and paste copy and paste now let's
remove this from here now you see now
they're next to each other right let's
change the color on this right now we
can read what it says all right now
let's say we wanted to send this right
menu all the way to the right right the
way to do this is by floating it
you see float and then you say right now
you see it goes all the way to the right
and if you want it to send this to the
left you would just say float to the
left well by default is float to the
left all right
so technically right now even though you
know you have a Rory it already says
float to the left
sorry I messed up see right now it's
floating to the left now they both
floating to the left but now we lost the
background right so to basically fix
that the best way to do is just sing
overflow now what it's doing is saying
okay now is looking around and saying
okay now I know where everything is that
even though when you click flow to the
left or float to the right basically the
the parent div which is the header
thinks that okay this elements are not
here now so
when you click overflow:auto it realizes
okay there's something aside of me and
let me just you know put an extra space
there for it alright so that's a simple
way
no that's to learn you know position and
you know how to change things so I'm
Brenda I'm just giving you a small taste
of what CSS can do it so pretty much
right now we're gonna continue breaking
this down okay we have logo left menu
right menu all right so let's give this
you see the space here that's called a
margin right so you can say okay I want
to give this a margin or I want to give
this a patty I'm gonna give you an
example so like let's say if I wanted to
give a padding padding means inside so
let's say padding left and 25 pixels now
inside of the the header there's a
little pattern for 25 pixels to the left
pretty much right there right if I want
to do the same thing over they I will
see padding right 25 pixels now I want
to separate this door I want to say I
want to give this two things a patty so
how can I do that how can I separate
this two elements together what I would
do instead of using a padding because
padding means inside of the box inside
of whatever tag or class that you are
actually you know trying to get so like
let's say
for a logo instead of using padding I
will use margin so margin to the right
let's say marching right 25 pixels you
see so now what you're doing is you're
seeing outside of this box I want 25
pixels to the right so now you have that
space you know we're almost getting
there
we're just working on the header right
now so like let's say let's see exactly
what we have in the header you have the
logo let's look at the left menu let's
remove this so inside of the Left menu
we have one two three links right there
is a submenu that we're gonna do it
later on and right here we have three
links for now which is gonna keep three
things right links are actually you know
like let's say right now I wanted to
click on this video right this right
here is a link this is gonna link me to
the next page you click that in that
sense move to the next page all right
I click here in this image and it's a
link to it takes me to the next page so
that's exactly the same thing that we're
doing right now we're gonna create three
links basically browse you see what it
says browse kids and DVD right so we say
ok inside of this left menu we're gonna
create we're gonna create a list
on order lists right so you got saying
you well so this is an unordered list
and inside of the list we're gonna
create a list element and we don't see
inside of the list element there's a
link links are called anchor tags right
so you say a and then you put an H ref
which actually gives you the link so
let's say kids let's say King studies
tml you say okay kids and then break
that down and you say okay was it brown
kids DVD so we have those three things
see inside of it even though right now
you can't see you have three three links
brows kids DVD right now
I slowly messed up here because this
links is supposed to be inside of one
less each so like let's say right now
let's copy this paste this three times
and that's the lead
let's just put only one at a time now it
looks like this an unordered list so a
non odorless means you just have regular
dots you know data list but our order
list would be instead of ul it would be
what oh oh oh L and then you have
numbers or you could say you could have
our list type of a ABC or Roman numerals
whatever you want it alright so for now
cuz there's a whole order list
it basically showing you know one two
three
so anyways let's press on to come back
turn it back to this right now for us to
basically take out you know the the
dotted line and the dotted lines on it
basically what we do is we say okay
let's go to left menu right so the UL is
inside of the left menu so you see left
menu space you will and then you say you
start a new list right there you say
okay
less that removes the style it takes out
the list the house now from the NSA this
down on this like a patio Saturday so
you see padding:0 margin:0 now you don't
have no no padding or anything right now
inside of the left menu and inside of w
well you have to ally text now you wanna
start the tax which is this we already
styled this we already style yeah we
start the left menu style double you are
now the styled this right here the list
so when I say let's put this tool
display:inline really one like this one
two three
so how we do this before
display:inline-block
now we have just like that all right now
let's say inside of this boxes we want
to give this space so what we gonna do
we're gonna say okay we've got since
right now we we basically we targeting
every single list list item that's
inside the left menu
so we'll say okay for each one let's put
a padding of 20 pixels so basically
saying 20 pixels on top 20 pixels to the
right 20 pixels to bone bottom and 20
pixels to the left so my shortcut
instead of you having to write it for
every single side you will say okay just
give me 20 pixels and that's what
happens you see now you have that space
around it it's an even space this is the
same thing as this you see now let's
build this like this break it down break
it down let's see what else don't be
doing okay you have that logo let's do
the same thing to the logo take this
padding
out of here let's put the shortcut in
just regular 20 pixels now we have to
love all right man let's see what does
the right man you have it's the same
thing three basically three links so
what we gonna do we're going to
basically do the same thing so for the
right menu you're gonna say we're gonna
copy this you gotta say come and see
not for master yeah come and see who and
Mac and basically say okay put this
under here turn this into right now
alright so we have menu let's see what
happens we still gotta copy this copy
this on all the list command C and put
inside of it say okay
all right so it's always good to indent
things in salary so like that you can
say okay this is the parent this is the
child this is the child and this is a
child so then from there you can say
okay now you have things in older let's
see what happens
okay now let's turn this back and see
what it says okay we got a search we got
a notification and the username search
Bell okay so now we have that right you
see we almost get in there we just
basically put in the basics right now
this how you break down and you start
building websites it takes time and
there's not something that you could do
in five seconds like it's going to take
a little while and I hope you understand
that right now I'm giving you pretty
much a preview of what you will will be
doing and how you gotta break things
down all right so we have two header
yeah if you guys don't know level touch
he's pretty cool let's see what else
what else we doing are we up to here
with that logo we got the menus okay I
think we could leave this for now and
we'll continue to the next part which is
the body the content alright see you in
a little bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
