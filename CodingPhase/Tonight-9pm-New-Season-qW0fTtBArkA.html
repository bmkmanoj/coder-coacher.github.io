you guys got to get all this way yeah
this is ridiculous I'm being on this

yup Long Island traffic man this is
ridiculous man
this is going to be live here tonight is
going to be live here on YouTube you
know the first first introduction to
order the contestants or the mentees or
the students is gonna be live tonight
right then from there what we're going
to do is we're going to pre record the
videos and then release them all my
website coding phase comm right it's
going to be pre-recorded it's shown
there
you know what nice animation is nice
editing you know something legit
do I plan on bringing out a book about
web development maybe not
I don't you know unless it's an audio
book I don't think I'm going to to write
a book I would like to write a book
about my life I'll be honest that I
would do
I would like to definitely make a book
and then have somebody else write it for
me
chit chit chit chit we in here kids live
with the swag now it's gonna be live in
times of life and times of the sauce
something like that
oh sorry guys I'm yawning right in front
of your face
without without my people from Vegas you
know we got people everywhere man like
you know sometimes I'll be like man I'll
look at the website this is pretty legit
guys like I go to my website and I look
at the Google Analytics to see who's
online and there's always people all
over the world it's always like 30 40
people all over the world on the website
you know what I mean like the
satisfaction that I get from now like
from my website you guys don't
understand it right like I've always
loved to teach people things and help
them out and help them succeed and I
think I get that from my father my
father is the same way my father's a
teacher he was a college professor my
mom was I mean she is a teacher you know
she's been a teacher in Diaz she's been
a teacher here in the US so I get it
from them right you know my father he
had a school where he was 14 years old
in Dominican Republic he created his own
little school and used to bring in all
the kids from the neighborhood and teach
them English right he was 14 years old
right when he first started doing that
and I feel like I get that for him you
know you know I think about that
sometimes I'm like man like I always
like to teach people so now having my
own website my own place where I could
help people achieve things that they
felt that they couldn't do before
it feels really got it and it's so much
but I'll be honest it's so much better
than than YouTube in the sense of like I
love creating tutorials are not creating
you know projects for people and showing
them how you do it
but here on YouTube I don't get the same
satisfaction because here YouTube I know
people see it and I could tell the
retention of it which will be like one
minute out of 15-20 minutes for each
video for every tutorial so people come
in they see it and then they don't do it
on my website people come in and they do
the whole course
right and then they they learn and then
they send me an email be like oh thank
you man you broke it down is so easy to
end like now it's now I can understand
how to do this now I can build my own
site now I can work with react now I can
work with nodejs you know which is
pretty cool man sounds like it gives you
like it gives you like this feeling I
don't know how to explain it
I'm like accomplishment you know so it
definitely feels good man for sure when
would the mentorship video be on YouTube
is gone it's gonna be tonight man
tonight is gonna be live is the first
episode think about it like this tonight
is the first episode it's the first time
you're gonna meet all all the
contestants is the first night that
you're gonna meet the people where they
came from why they you know why they got
into what development how long they've
been doing this you know etc right then
we gotta give them a project the project
you guys if you guys want to be
challenged and you want to do the
project you can do the project yourself
too but they're gonna do a project and
come back the next week with that
project done completed
alright then the second week is going to
be something similar then the third week
which is ADA final the final project I'm
gonna give up something something more
difficult to do so yeah man
hopefully they could do it man hopefully
people don't give up people don't
disappear because I hate that I'll be
honest I hate that like if you come over
here please
show up every Friday man you know show
up man cuz don't waste the time for the
viewers like most of these viewers have
want to see people you know who are in
the industry who are trying to get in
the industry right most of the viewers
here in YouTube want to see that so if
you come in and you disappear and you
don't show up on the second week on the
third week that's discouraging that
means that person who was watching the
show will look at him be like oh man he
quit why he quit you know it's like
maybe it's hard maybe I shouldn't do it
you know like people are self doubting
each other they're like man I don't know
if I should do this I don't know if I
should make this and then when you go
and you start seeing this show and like
on the second the third week somebody
quits that gives them an excuse and be
like oh he quit if he quit
I don't think I could do it I'm gonna
quit - I don't want nobody quitting guys
I want all of you guys to be here man so
if you if you signed up for it you
better show up because if now I'm gonna
put you on blast
a man
trying to do it as kids
we in here kicks coding face.com yo
y'all better tell everybody on this
court let everybody know tonight 9:00
p.m. Eastern Time New York time the real
time you know show up
Henry Vasquez without what I without
Henry
- chitter-chatter
tip tip tip tip literature to check to
check to the trajectory to check
juncture
word man I was even thinking about doing
like a point system so see like you know
even though this is not really a
competition but to make like a point
system to see who has the most points
right points that I give them and points
that you know other maybe other
youtubers might give them or maybe tight
corners half other youtubers show up on
the show have like you know a couple of
people man like I don't know I'm still
in the air I'm still in the air and I'm
thinking about this man I'm thinking
about doing this I'm gonna try to hit up

Christian I'm gonna try to hit up on
Chris Hawkes I'm gonna try to hit up a
couple of people see if anybody is
interested just being like a judge it's
not really like a judge but just giving
them points right
it's gotta be a pretty cool man I'm
still in the air I have so many good
ideas for this this season that it's
gonna be pretty legit man
Oh
who's got to be the Simon
word
I think I'll probably be the assignment
because I have to be like the most hard
on people because you know when you're
nice all the time to somebody you can't
grow like that right that's like people
will get awards they get trophies for
being number two or number three like
you're number two and number three
you don't deserve a trophy you know what

no-no-no
word
sorry I'm so sleepy went to sleep late
last night kids I was like preparing
everything for today I was editing
videos for the website you know you know
what's crazy right I'm working so hard
on the nodejs course and I feel like
nobody's doing them on the website I'm
looking at the analytics and like maybe
10 people are doing the nodejs course
everybody is on the beginner courses
which is great which means I have a lot
of beginners a lot of you know junior
developers people who are just getting
into the industry which is cool because
then that means they gotta go through
the whole process of learning HTML CSS
learning sass learning a pug learning
JavaScript learning jQuery which means
they're gonna be here for a month you
know each course and it's great it's
great because it means they're gonna be
around for a while but at the same time
I'm like man I'm working so hard and
there's no js' course and nobody's doing
it I mean I'm almost done to it now that
I got finished doing the blog I'm no I'm
like 80% off the block having the block
done and then from there I should be
jumping to something else oh my god man
look at this there's like nobody's
moving I guess we're gonna have a long
long session on this phone today there's
gonna be a long live stream guys cuz I'm
still not even halfway to my house look
now FinTech is like you know Jes is 2012
you know when I was telling you guys
saying I asked everybody I say what do
you guys want to learn PHP laravel oh
yeah I want to learn nodejs
so many people were like oh we want to
learn no Jia's and
you guys all wanted to know Jas so I
said you know what let me finish
no Jas first and get it done and then
now nobody's doing nobody's doing it
that's hilarious to me that's why I
think we wanted to know J's I mean no no
Jas is good because if you already know
JavaScript you could continue it but I
was gonna do PHP and people were like oh
- no Jes first and this and that and
then look now nobody's doing it so and
that's like the longest course so far so
far I think I'm like 10 hours in or
nodejs because there's a full stack
there's a full stack course I got you
know building your portfolio
it has deploying it to your website it
also has dealing with databases you know
using databases like MongoDB II then
also to creating a blog then after
creating a blog then creating a CMS for
your for your projects then on top of
that creating an admin section you know
user authentication there's so much to
it and then now nobody's doing it I mean
I know all the people that signed up to
the website they're gonna get to that
that course at some point but it's like
now I'm looking at I'm like man I'm
about to put it on hold I'm about to
finish the section that I'm in I'm gonna
finish the blog and then I'm gonna put
it on hold for a while because nobody's
doing it it's only ten people ten people
are actually working on it
that's big
which tells me that I should focus more
on other stuff you know I keep getting
emails about PHP people want to learn
PHP and I'm like man that's tough that's
the one that I was gonna do first but
everybody was telling me to no js' no
two years no J's PHP is dead but then
everybody wants to learn PHP word
weeks develop you know Barbara you need
to start working too you need to start
doing projects I'm looking at your
account I haven't seen you doing no
projects I haven't seen you watch any
videos come on before like don't you
gonna become a developer Baris like nah
I'm just here to chill you should try to
get into this man you should practice I
want to see you you know you should have
came on Barbara you should have signed
up for for a mentorship program you
should have came in so we could get your
skills up man
Wow Barbara's excuses like yo I was in
County for three months man like yes I
know but you could still use a laptop in
Cali you just to get your skills back up
I'm camera shy
come on stopping you're scared man
Barbara season three in April season
three is gonna be like around April
March around there
I wanna be the very best oh my god this
traffic is driving me crazy
ya know we definitely want to get
Barbara in this game man we want Barbara
to really step her game
as a developer I mean where you up so
Barbara I mean you know html/css
where you up to you know HTML CSS and
JavaScript do you are you up to that why
do so many companies want angular
developers in my area well you got to
think about it like this angular is made
by Google angular is very safe angular
is the full stack framework right it
really it's not a full stack frame but
it has everything that you need as a
front-end developer like it has a router
it has different ways to you know create
applications you know it's pretty good
in that sense like you don't have to go
outside to to get what you want
angular like something like react the
problem with react is like the downfall
and the cons of reactors for react
pretty much react as a library right and
then react by itself is nothing because
it's only the view it reacts to whatever
data comes in it changes the view but
react needs a lot of different libraries
to work like you need something like
Redux you need something like fetch or
you could use the fetch API or you could
use what's the other one
Axios to do a request like let's say you
want to do a post request I'll get
requests so use Ajax you need something
like Axios even though you don't need it
but most people use it right so there's
so many different libraries that you
will use with react that sometimes you
know I could go to one company the way
how they use react is not the same way
that they use react in another company
all right it is very flexible now when
you work for a big corporation they
don't they don't want to have to be
choosing different options
every single time they're gonna start a
new project they don't want to be
dealing with
hey we got to look at the open source
community for certain certain things
like they want everything to be inside
of that framework so most companies use
angular like most sort of like corporate
companies all right like let's say
you're going to Time Warner comm right
Time Warner or Comcast or stuff like
that right
companies are corporations let's say con
Edison or I don't know any major company
that's a corporation right
they gotta use angular right because it
just makes their lives easier it's less
choices and they can focus more on the
code and react there's too many choices
you know this times that you could spend
the whole day without having to code up
on line just looking at the libraries
that you're going to use for the project
that you're going to build you know it's
like there's so much research to weigh
like you got to do a setup and a whole
bunch of stuff with angular is like
everything is in there it has all those
things already for you
now the problem for me with angular is
just it's too bloated it's too heavy
it's like if you're building something
simple you're walking around with like a
one megabyte library you know I mean
and that's how that's not angular is and
that's like super annoying because it's
like if I want to build something light
I'll use jQuery or something like that
you know what I mean yeah but yeah guys
I think I'm about to start heading out
I'm gonna see you guys tonight
remember 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time please
come through we want to get as many
people as we can more people than we
ever had I think I will record has been
74 people the most at one time we
wouldn't have more than that we want to
get a hundred people at a time watching
the show tonight so please let everybody
know leave a comment or whatever video
you seen from me just leave a comment
but I hey guys
9:00 p.m. check it out you know like let
people know you know I mean okay guys so
I'll see you guys later
I'm about to start figuring out how to
get home because this is ridiculous I've
been here for literally two hours
I left at 2:20 from New York and now I'm
in Long Island at 4:16 I'm still like
half an hour away from my house so I
gotta figure it out alright so I'll see
