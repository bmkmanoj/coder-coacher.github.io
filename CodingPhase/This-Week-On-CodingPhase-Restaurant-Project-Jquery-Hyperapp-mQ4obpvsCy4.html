announcement guys you already know it's
your boy Joe back at it again man coding
face.com your boy is backing out and did
it again alright so we got the perfect
layout we got the perfect site for one
of our projects remember I told you guys
need a restaurant project well we got it
right here kids this is design that
we're gonna use and this is not gonna be
exactly like this design but it's gonna
be inspired by this design right it's
pretty clean pretty nice it's nice and
pretty you know and it's just gonna make
our lives easier to use this design
especially for what we want to do all
right now one of the big parts of this
announcement is that is gonna be
completely free I'm gonna release it
here on YouTube right now this is gonna
be like a you know it's like a freebie
for everybody at the same time I'm gonna
be releasing all the videos first on my
website but I will release a video form
or well for this project one every two
days here on YouTube for those of you
guys who are on my website and yeah
subscribe to my website you're gonna get
it automatically right it's like I'm
gonna be doing like five six videos per
day on this project and then you guys
get it first right so if if it takes me
let's say 15 videos to complete this
whole whole project basically you guys
is gonna get it in like three days I
mean everybody else who's here on
YouTube is gonna have to wait it's one
video every two days but at least you
guys gotta get it for free at some point
right
complete but what's cool about this is
that we're going to be doing it in hyper
app I know somebody's out there
screaming out their lungs like why are
we doing it hype
we could do this and react we can do
this in you know just known we can do
this in PHP we can do it this and a
whole bunch of different frameworks and
yes you are right but one thing that
somebody made it clear was you know you
want to have diversity when it comes to
your portfolio you want to be able to
say hey I can come in and do whatever
you want me to do right you give me
angular I can building angular you give
me react I can build and react it was
good about hyper app which is something
that I've been telling you I keep
reinforcing it it's the same thing as as
react right it's the fact that it's just
JavaScript we're not doing anything out
of the ordinary or like something that's
completely different we're not learning
a brand new framework in reality all
we're doing it's just plain JavaScript
and that's what makes this project is
really good because in reality this is
more of a continuation to future-proof
javascript then it is too hyper app in
reality we using hyper app but we could
use jQuery we could use a react we could
use angular you could use anything right
because it's really more of like hey
expanding on your skills of JavaScript
you know this is why I've been telling
you guys the guy's gotta check out hyper
app you guys gotta check out react
because if you're you started from
scratch right you do HTML CSS now you
know how to create a layout right cool
you take the future-proof JavaScript
course right you know Java Script you
know the syntax but you still need to
practice certain things that you could
only get by building certain type of
apps right like dealing with a lot of
objects dealing with a lot of data how
to move things around how the Dom works
you know manipulating the Dom like you
need to do that with projects so I
decided you know what we're gonna do
this in hyper app at the same time it's
gonna help a lot of people the people
who are interested in hyper app
people who are interested in learning
more JavaScript right guys so yeah man
we're gonna start this off today I'm
gonna release the videos today here on
YouTube the first video I'm probably
gonna do the first two videos to get you
guys excited today and maybe tomorrow
here on YouTube although the rest of the
videos aren't releasing it on the
website you know today I'm gonna do a
couple of videos I'm gonna probably do
like three to four or maybe five or even
six videos right I gotta go directly on
my website and then everything else will
fall to you too accordingly you know
once every two days or once every once a
day or once every two days depends on
how I decide to do at the end but yeah I
hope you guys are excited we get to do
this we get to knock out this this
project and at the same time we finished
a real estate app which is in react for
those of you guys don't want to take
that course we also do a the local
basically the portfolio which is done in
no js' that's still being done that's
gonna take a little while guys like it
or not it's a very long course because
right now we got everything done for the
views then we did the deployment now we
gotta jump into databases you know I
still don't know if I should do it in
MongoDB or my sequel or I might just do
it in both of them you know so you guys
could add your own projects dynamically
who had a blog dynamically so currently
right now everything is all static for
no GS this week I'm gonna continue
working on the nodejs course which we're
gonna finish finish the parts where are
gonna be dynamically pulled from the
database then from there we were at some
point maybe next week or the week after
we will do the other projects you know
we still gotta finish what was it the
e-commerce website which
was the bait store we have what we have
so far we got portfolio real estate
restaurant we're missing two more which
is ecommerce and the digital agency
website so those two we're gonna do it
somewhere in the next two weeks
all right and then we're gonna be
finished with the five projects then
from there my my next thing that I'm
gonna jump into I'm debating between
doing Ruby Python or if you guys want a
a basic PHP course so it's up to you
