things you know I'm trying to give you
guys better quality right trying to give
you guys the best of the best so let's
see let's see how it goes man all right
we definitely step in the game up man

me up the other day like hey if I could
help you out with that you know I'm
trying to help you out Brandon but at
the same time I can't do the job for you
you get what I'm saying like you gotta
you gotta go out there and figure it out
there's a whole bunch of stuff that you
can do I mean I don't even know why you
want to do just with JavaScript like you
you could do it with a back-end language
so much easier but yeah I'm trying to
get
chat in I don't know what a chats not
showing up okay you got the chat okay
let me sit Missy we got the the chat in
here see we make this okay OBS studio
what the hell's going on then we lost

bring you back up right now
so anyways man let me know let me see
what you guys is up to me
let me see where is he I want to bring
back the chat cuz I want to chat to be
shown you know I mean like one people
that when they see the livestream they
they get to see what's going on
so let's see all right I think I figured
it out okay let's see where is it pop-up
chat alright let's add this to the
screen okay there you go
alright that's what I'm talking about
yeah man oh we in here we are officially
in here all right let me see how can I
come in I want to fix this chat room a
little bit just a little bit just you
know fix it up just a little bit
see what are we gonna put this at when I
have it like somewhere where you know we
have everything there and we have to
chat we get to see our chat people in
here you know what I mean so let me say
bring this up maybe a little bit more
like that there you go there you go now
we now we got the community in here you
get what I'm saying
now we got the community in here and
that's exactly what I want I want you
guys to be part of this I want you guys
to part of all my videos you know even
when people drop some hey whenever
people show some good stuff
I want everything to show up you know
what I mean so definitely wanted to show
up man
a wiing here yo try not to make the the
comments or the message is super long
because as you can see is being cut off
so yeah Wow
okay any questions anything you guys
want to talk about let's talk about it
man let's see let's see what he says in
here says do you have any preferences so
it's JWT JSON web tokens bearer tokens
cookie sessions what do I think I don't
really have a prescient preference of it
at all so any other question what's your
opinion of up work I think
up work is cool I think of work is it is
what it is you know what I mean like
you're gonna find stuff in there where
you're gonna be like what the hell
people are working for three dollars and
it's gonna piss you off but you gotta
understand if you live in and you know
Zimbabwe right and you earning five
dollars an hour and that's that's enough
for you to be good then you know what I
mean like you're good but for here in
the US it could definitely get you
pissed off you're gonna be like oh man
what the hell
here man let me get the link okay I
think this one might be a little bit
better
it's chat box I'm trying to bring the
chat box to be a little bit better for
us
 let me see see what else people
talking about in here see what's going
on in the world of YouTube so let me see
what website is best to start
freelancing I think personally I still
liked Craigslist you know to be honest
with you guys I still like Craigslist
for one simple reason that I can come in
in charge whatever the hell I want on
Craigslist and I have more control like
I could meet with the person and be like
hey man there's how much I charge this
is what I do and if they they accepted
then you know we keep it moving from
there they give me half the money up
front and then I'll finish the rest of
the job you know what I mean so to me
Craigslist is still good to me
Craigslist is still golden you know but
every area is different I've seen that
in some areas in you know Craigslist is
not popping at all like out here I was
looking in Connecticut there's barely
anybody on Craigslist so I was like New
York is poppin New York you find clients
all the time on Craigslist
yeah so it all depends man - yeah yeah
here we live right now man we live right
now you know what I'm saying like that's
what I'm talking about
I mean would you guys think about that
about the setup like that having the
chatroom on the side you know having a
chat room on the side and then like that
you know you guys get some get some
shine - you know what I'm saying
let me see if I could use this one
better see which one you guys like more
you guys like this chat room like this
or we come in and we put in this other
chat room
let me see if it shows up Stream labs
come on man show up show up show up it's
a little bit too much
I don't know why the backgrounds not
showing up on this day let me see if I
figure it out
background
background should be white let me see if
we start making this a little bit
smaller no today we tried things out
kids trying things out in this
livestream you know you can't be mad you
can't get pissed off can be like god
dammit joke it's like we trying to set
things up the proper way you don't say
okay let me see if I could do this I've
got the people's things here but you
know what if that man we're gonna bring
back the other one I'll figure it out
late on the chat box with this one I'm
gonna bring back the one from Google let
me see where is it
bring this one Oh from Google it's a
little bit better cuz that Lisa shows
your faces alright so only thing is that
I wish I could like set up the size of
it
set up the size and see live chat
sending this up okay let's see what it
says
any other questions man you guys talking
about freelancing man
JC rob was a robbery says why CSS looks
so difficult CSS is not difficult Nancy
is that's pretty easy man CSS is just
like different properties think of it
like this it's like okay you know how to
deal with a class you know how to deal
with an element you know how to deal
with HTML tag okay cool
so you understand that then what CSS all
you have to do is just say hey I want to
change the background so you use
background color hey I want to change
the border radius which is like the
around the edges of
a box hey I want to make that into a
little circle you go in there and you
change it to like four or five pixels
and now it's like a low around it if you
want to make a perfect set of perfect
circle out of a out of a freaking square
what you do is you say 50% and when you
do 50% what it does is 50% of the width
and 50% of the the height so what it
does is it Masek alee it basically just
makes everything into a perfect circle
so I mean it's not really that hard at
all man okay let me see let's see let's
see let's see let me see if I can make
this a little bit smaller wave 600
pixels let's see how that that looks
okay so that's a perfect circle perfect
circle perfect squared let's see I come
in here make this a little bit smaller
say 400 pixels okay this is exactly what
I wanted there you go that's what I'm
talking about
okay let me see Missy where ma I must
set this up
there you go that's what I'm talking
about
we got it poppin kids so now we
basically we're gonna read off all your
comments all your messages straight from
from the live screen so like that
everybody could see exactly what the
person said you know so yeah let's see
man you guys Shane says check your email
man what you want me to do man send me
send me an email man coating face at
gmail.com
if you sending it to Joe Santos Garcia
at gmail.com that's the wrong place to
be sending emails cuz I would never see
it
there's too much spam in there let me
see what else yeah I mean pretty much
CSS is the whole website when you think
about it
HTML is where you structure things right
that's where you separate things and you
say okay think of it everything is boxes
on the website so you say okay this is
the header this is the menu on the side
this is the content area and this is the
footer and then inside of the content
area you have a heading you have a
paragraph you have an image right so all
of those things get set up by HTML you
basically use structure in a certain way
now all of the styles or the colors all
the way how the fonts look you deal with
a were CSS s CSS is a beyotch when
adding too many elements I don't know
about that 84 it depends how you set it
up man that's why you got to start
setting things up into a modular section
so you gotta start making things into
high colors multiple files don't do
everything one file or like four or five
five
like break it down says Joe I figured
out how to link the pages on parcel
portfolio you add the links in the head
where at least is like that with Windows
yeah I don't know I feel like parse out
Jes is cool for what it is but it's good
for like doing stuff like react or like
doing stuff with you or angular but I
can't see myself using parcel for every
single situation like if it's if it's
other I'm building something quick and I
just need something I don't want to deal
with the setup I'll use parse out but
it's like I have my own developer
starter kit is like I have way more
control man let me see I need help
understanding JavaScript functions and
how I use most often raise low end it's
pretty simple man think about it like
this functions are a block of code okay
so let's say you wanted to add two
numbers right you wanted to add two plus
two and it's four right you want to get
back four
so you were gonna do is you're gonna
create a function that's gonna say the
name of it is gonna be called adding
okay
you say you're adding in this function
so that's the name of it then you take
two parameters which is the two things
star inside the space inside of the
parenthesis alright the little two
little parenthesis right you say a and B
okay and then now what you do is you say
hey when I go inside of this I'm gonna
return inside of this function I'm gonna
return a plus B and whatever that's
equal to that's what this function is
going to return back okay so the reason
why you use a function is because if
you're going to be adding a bunch of
numbers
constantly why would you want to be
using let's say you're gonna have to
write a plus B every single time all
right
a yeah a plus B every single time so
instead of you doing that you just
create a function which is a block code
and then now that same thing that you
was gonna do multiple or multiple times
you only do it one time and like let's
say later on instead of you returning
the number that is the result of the two
numbers let's say you wanted to return
back a string so whenever you say adding
a number and you put it in 11 in 11 and
then you're putting 9 on the other side
of the arguments right and then you want
to return back
hey your total is 20 now you can do that
instead of you having to go in there and
rewrite that every single time you know
so I mean it's better to see it visually
but let me see let me see if I can set
up a little section in here man let me
see if I can set up a section well we
could actually come in and have some
Cole show up in the screen I want to
have this this livestreams legit now
like I'm not playing around no more I'm
trying to take this to the next level
kids like we're taking it up up a notch
now you know we got the we got the
lights right now your boys looking you
know what I mean looking spiffy way
until your boy gets a little shape up
you know what I mean come in here just
dab on them real quick you know maybe I
start wearing some chains yo what if I
just start wearing change like Y all
right I got a couple a diamond chains
I'm like yo just here shining you know
what I mean the only developer out he's
shining like that you gotta sing put on
my two earrings you know 2 carrots 1
carry on each ear you know what I mean
like come in here just like that again
without we in here
yeah you know people's gonna be like yo
they won't even believe it they'll be
like man this kid this kid is not a
developer they'll be like this guy
cannot be a developer man this guy comes
in here with earrings a big-ass chain
shining you know somebody will be tight
all right let me see what I wasn't
missing so yeah let me see if I could
bring up I could bring up some a window
sorry I got hiccups damn it hiccups let
me see yeah you guys gotta use a ripple
that IT man I love that website man
because sometimes when you just want to
run some code you just like you good you
don't have to go in there and set up a
whole environment it's like it's already
set up for you so let's see ripple the
IT let's see practical let's see es6
okay let me see if I can share this DEP
DEP DEP DEP that windows capture alright
so let's see if we can come in here make
it a little bit bigger okay so here we
go
alright so like I was telling you before
kit you coming here let's say you wanted
to create a function all right let me
see if I can make this a little bit
bigger okay there you go okay so you
want to deal with functions right why
should you do a function and why will
you use it so pretty simple let's say
you wanted to create a function and you
say like I was showing you before you
see function adding numbers and then you
the parentheses there and then from
there you say a which is number a the
first number and then B which is your
next number okay so now we created this
function we have the curly bracket so
anything that's inside of this this
inside of this code alright anything
doesn't sound of this curly bracket all
right that's what you're gonna run your
code so you
easily come here and say something like
this a plus B all right now this is
gonna run the function when you say
adding numbers and then you pass in two
and two okay you run that well as you
can see the function is not returning
anything so it's undefined which means
you're not returning anything okay it
doesn't have a value okay but if you
come here and you add the keyword of
return and you click run this this all
function actually means the number four
when you see it here and says adding
numbers the value of this function is
the number four okay
now you can also use console.log what
console.log is only for like debugging
it's not really doing anything for us is
gonna show number four here which is
going to the console if we look here you
see the console it says number four but
if you wanted to actually equal to
something this function you have to use
return and then run this so now as you
can see the function itself the value of
it is four and if I wanted to come here
and do something like this where I'm
like hey instead of using return a plus
B I want to return a string so I could
come here and do this okay now this is
called interpolation
ok Sokka say hey your total is a plus B
which is gonna equals to 4 whenever I
run this adding numbers 2 &amp;amp; 2 so now the
actual value of this string is the
string of a your total is that's wrong
it it should give you I don't know
I think this thing is not running es6 or
something yeah it's not running es6
maybe I just put the regular JavaScript
technically in es6 you could do that
smart for back ticks I'm so used to
that's sometimes you know sometimes you
get so used to like different languages
like I've been like so much in in Ruby
world right now as you guys can see I
was trying to do it with a string and
es6 you do it with the ticks in Ruby if
you wanted to do the same thing what you
would do is you would use double quotes
and you would do the same thing but
instead of a dollar sign you would use a
hash tag you know everybody makes
mistakes that's how the world is man
yeah man of course is with the tick you
know I'm sorry sorry I've been doing too
much Ruby for the past week and a half
two weeks this is the first time I
touched JavaScript in a whole week
yeah man now for those of you guys who
are interesting good old Ruby which I
don't know I love Ruby man like I feel
like as a language itself is so much
better in like so much cleaner
you come in here do something like this
like yo I could come here and say define
and then put it the name to put the name
of the method and say adding numbers and
then I could use parentheses if I want
to or I could just say space and then
everything that's after that is actually
considered as an argument so I could
just say a and B and then I don't have
to do no curly brackets all I have to do
is just go like that and say I don't
even have to say return I do all I have
to do is just put at the end whatever is
the last thing of Ruby in a method like
that's consider returned so you could
literally just come in and say a plus B
and then run that says other respect a
what the hell keyword and okay
sometimes repple the ID for some reason
sometimes it be messing up man
maybe pissing me off because it's like
some things it works and some things it
doesn't work is like it wants you to do
it its own way like that's annoying
sometimes like what if I don't want to
use freaking parentheses like why are
you forcing me to use parentheses that's
annoying okay so whatever
come here and I can say adding numbers
and say tool and to say expecting like
why are you forcing me to use
parentheses that's annoying it's a good
question so let me take this off for
this stuff from here
let's see let's go back to the questions
okay
so let's see it's Ruby the best language
to build simple page apps
I think Ruby is great for what it is
it's like you want to build something
quick you want to get it out
I mean Ruby's there is it's a lovely
language it's fun to use it's like you
know how you you'll be using javascript
and sometimes people like wanna just
like bang your head against the keyboard
like I've never felt that with Ruby I
just like I'm having fun I don't know
how to explain it like I use Ruby and it
feels like you're having fun when I'm
using javascript like there's situations
where you know a number in a string of a
number is the same thing so I was like
you get errors you like there's so many
things like you could look it up all the
type of errors that you get on runtime
with JavaScript and like it makes your
life harder because it's like not only
do you have to know how to code good on
your own but now you got to remember oh
yeah I got a think about order errors
that that JavaScript has to you know
what I mean
so that's annoying but Ruby on Rails
though this the framework is is legit
and that's what I'm doing a course right
now on on my website and it's just
a life so much easier like you could
build like a full application probably
like in a day like you can't say that
about a lot of frameworks like with Ruby
on Rails you could build like a fool
let's say nabbing a full-featured
Facebook but everything that you want
from Facebook you could build it in one
single day only one developer can do it
you know it's like it's just a
Productivity level on it it's just crazy
okay let's say then I say you said a few
videos ago future proof JavaScript it's
pretty much all the basics of JavaScript
what's the difference between regular
JavaScript and future proof JavaScript
well when I meant to say is with future
proof JavaScript you're taking all the
things that you need to know about
JavaScript like yes you could go deeper
and deeper and deeper into JavaScript
but to get a job and to do things that
90% of the jobs is gonna want you to do
all you need to know is the basics and
once you know the basics as a developer
you start learning more and more
advanced things later on this different
techniques there's different ways of
doing things these things that you're
gonna notice is gonna save you time you
know you gotta figure it out on your own
like which ways is the things that's
gonna be better for your workflow you
know so it's all up to you you know what
I'm saying but as far as JavaScript once
you know the basics you good you don't
need to be like an expert on it like you
just need to know how the Dom works how
everything is an object how to change
things in the elements how to change CSS
from JavaScript how to go in and add a
class to an element you know how to
target a certain element by an ID class
you know get element by ID you know the
basics how to
had event listeners if you want to do it
that way there's multiple ways of doing
doing things and that's another thing
too where it's like you might see my
course in the way I do it somebody else
might do it totally different another
person's gonna do it totally different
another person's gonna do it totally
different like to me that's the biggest
problem with JavaScript because
javascript is like so open that you
could go in there and code however to
how you want you know I've seen people
that call totally different for me you
know it's like it's all about how you
decide to code at the end of the day and
does it get the job done does it have
the minimal amount of errors or like
bugs that you're gonna have in your
application you get what I'm saying
something yeah
968 yeah man I've been live man Jan 16
what you been at man like I'm always
live you know what I mean people know me
people know I'm always live in here man
so let me see what else I have a
question do I need to know vanilla
JavaScript the Dom only knows how to use
jQuery Joe you need your backticks bro
yeah it's funny when people people that
make the same mistakes as me it's like
and they're like yo man you need to to
do it this way
wrong like people calm down I'm doing a
whole bunch of Ruby courses when you
come in and you like your mind is on a
completely different language when you
understand how that works and then you
come in and you know yeah let me just do
some little quick JavaScript he's like
you're still thinking your head is still
thinking in a completely different
language like little things like that is
gonna happen like you know if I'm doing
it myself it looks crazy because I'm
doing it live with you guys but I don't
care you know like I do mistakes like
that like constantly I know like seven
different programming languages this
times that you mix up certain things and
you're like oh wait yeah I'm doing it on
this language is different like this you
know it's it's not dollar signs it's not
hashtags that's in Ruby data science is
on on JavaScript it's like you know what
I mean my people is kind of ridiculous
let me see what else one thing I wish I
did was after learning JavaScript you
just learn you know instead of PHP let
me see
let me see what else um yeah I guess
thanks a lot for a reply you know what's
your twitch I have a twitch but I don't
even know how to connect the twitch you
know what I mean
like I don't know how to do it I set it
up and as you can see there's the number
zero on twitch because people are
supposed to be able to see my my twitch
but I just don't know how to do it yeah
now people's man that's nothing to man
like you know you gotta understand man
like web development programming in
general is full of like errors mistakes
on this time that you're gonna be using
PHP like let's say for example in
JavaScript JavaScript I don't like to
use semicolons right when I switch out
from JavaScript to work with PHP
sometimes I leave the semicolon out and
then there's an error on it right
because in PHP you need that semicolon
so you go in there and you're like oh
man then you figure out oh yeah I'm
doing this thing in PHP like you know
already although the basis you know the
programming language is like but is
that's just how it is man you know a lot
of times people be like man yeah I just
seen this this guy come in and do it
perfectly this isn't that guy's a lot of
people edit the out of all of their
videos like constantly you know you go
to the best the best freaking
conventions right you know you go to
react the f8 from Facebook guys make
mistake they leave a semicolon are they
freaking putting a single code they
forget the tick instead of using tick
because they you are usually use on our
Python they do it they usually do it in
a different way or like less
you come in and this I whole bunch of
stuff man like people that's just how it
is man if you guys act like you guys be
like I'm perfect I never leave a
semicolon now I never leave a or quote
out man you freaking lying to yourself
man that's the thing sometimes I'd be
like yo people expecting people to just
be like perfectly it doesn't work like
that man so anyways man any other
questions hit me up what do you think
about the YouTube monetization is
problems I don't know man I'm not
worried about it I like I know people
losing money but I don't I don't
consider YouTube like a place to make
money I consider a youtuber place for me
to come hang out come talk you know talk
some with you guys and and just
talk about different you know different
frameworks languages or jobs how to get
a job how your first interview is going
to be this dissing net you know what I
mean so you know but yeah so let me see
what else you know the chat room leave a
sign
I got shut down a sign on the machine
what is the best way to learn react
should I learn it from official Docs or
should i watch some courses I think
watching the course is the best way like
react the documentation to me person and
I think they're not horrible but they
could be better
let's see there see you have a bunch of
tutorials how to get it started I have a
page on my website called
the timeline so if you really wanted to
get into it like look at the timeline
follow it along and just go in you know
course by course you know start from the
basics learn how to use a text editor
learn how to use the terminal you know
there's people that want to skip the
terminal I do not know why like they
don't know how to use the terminal but
some for some reason they want to skip
it then I oh no I don't need the
terminal I want to start coding right
away and as I bro if you don't
understand the terminal don't even start
coding because the problem is that when
you go to the web developer starter kit
then you're gonna be freaking wasting
time let's see what else what other
questions you got I was just looking
into bat Dennis I don't know who's that
gaming Gobles I'm making sure I
understand guy ashens
but the question again cycle I could
answer it that's the best way to invest
$1,000 if you're looking for long term
and you just want to keep it there I
will say look into betterment and just
put your money in there it's more safer
than doing Bitcoin or anything like that
because you look at Bitcoin just the
other day it touched $10,000 like it was
$20,000 so imagine if you would have
bought at 20 you would have lost half of
your money in one shot like you know
let me see is Ruby easier to learn than
react is really easier learn to easier
to learn then react I think as a
programming language as your first
programming language Ruby is so much
easier than JavaScript to learn it now
to learn react if you already know
JavaScript and you already know react
all you need to know is just how things
work it's like a a way to start thinking
about things when it comes to react it's
not really like you're learning react
like when you learn angular you have to
really learn angular like it's not like
you're just gonna show up you know I
want to get into angular know it's like
you're gonna have to learn a million ng
this ng that is the same thing as view
view has a whole bunch of different
jargons like V vine there's rebind that
V scope this freaking compute this like
this is too much jargon that is kind of
ridiculous man now you got you guys
Shannon says can you explain what
real-time PHP frameworks are I'm
guessing they're using WebSockets cuz
every time that I use anything that that
says real time people are talking about
WebSockets which have been around for a
long time so if that's what you're
talking about yeah I just googled it
it's pretty much the same I was
just saying is pretty much frameworks
that are set up with WebSockets already
yeah nothing crazy
I mean most of the modern programming
languages they're all using WebSockets
nowadays so you don't even need a
framework for that let's see
wrecking wall says coding phase what do
you think of JavaScript 30 by west boss
are the concept in there
advance for what I need to get into web
development I think he he's good I mean
West bosses how can I say he's he's
legit but he's mostly like Anna like
he's more of a guy who has connections
in the sense of like he knows a lot of
people in the industry cuz he goes to
like all the meetups he goes to all the
conventions he goes to all of those
things so people know him and the guy's
a pretty nice guy so you know but the
things that he has in there is the same
things that you're gonna learn
everywhere else you know if you look
into it let me see if I could show it
javascript 30 there's a bird on build 30
things with javascript in 30 days now
what are the things that yes CSS clock
playing with CSS variables are a cardio
array the local storage event delegation
tally strings sorting bang sorting bad
names without articles follow along
links speech sentences sticky nav even
capture propagation bubbling and ones
whack-a-mole game I mean it's cool seems
cool
you know it is that's more like a thing
to practice you know what I mean so it's
if you want to practice the JavaScript
it seems pretty good yeah so seems
pretty legit
let's see what else I don't want to miss
this this question that this person had
the Joan says hey Joe I loved how I
loved how how what developers make money
of course yeah it's pretty legit I just
try to give people like real examples
and how to make money how to you know I
mean that's how I make money to be
honest with you guys
like I have multiple websites that I
just create like small services in a
small generators things that I did back
in the days with like backbone that even
to this day they're like three four
years old but people still search for it
right and then I already have high
placements on Google so when they search
a certain thing my website show up and
then people are come in I get paid from
the advertising so if they click on the
advertising I make usually like $2 to $7
per click now does it happen like 30,000
times a day no it happens like 3-4 times
a day that people click on the ads
alright so at the end of the month it's
like extra you know $2,000 you know I
have another website it's like an extra
$700 I have another thing there's I got
extra $500 even here YouTube just every
time that I come here and talk to you
guys I make like 20 dollars per day an
average
all right so in average I make $20 on
YouTube a day right now that's when he
dollars I make it either I come in and
talk to you guys or not but at the end
of the month
that's an extra $600 you don't saying
like my whole thing about is about like
making money as a developer is using the
skills that you have and make it work
for you so you don't have to be working
for somebody else so
be able to survive you go you got my sin
so like you don't have to be like one of
those people be like oh man I got fired
man
I can't pay my mortgage I can't do this
and that no you want to make money on
your own so when that does happen cuz it
will happen you either gonna get fired
or you're gonna get let go or the
company is gonna go under at some point
you know jobs are not forever you know
this is not the 1950s where you're like
hey I work for GM and i'ma work too till
the day I die and I have no more
kneecaps no like those days are over you
know a company you work for a company
for a year two three years and Max and
then from there you move on let me see
Hey Joe can you briefly summarize react
just break it down and simple
explanation I mean I did this yesterday
it's just think of it components
everything on the page is components
everything that is is a say like
everything that you see on a page is a
component okay when you click a menu and
you click on like let's say on the top
right for your notifications for Gmail
when you click on that that's a a
component that's a component and that
component has a state now the state
keeps track of everything that the user
does if the state gets changed then the
page rear Enders itself so things move
around accordingly so let's say for
example if I wanted to say something
like this when duh I have a button right
that I click on and I come in I say okay
whenever this button is clicked 20 times
I want the background to turn red okay
all of that stuff gets gets tracked by
inside of the state okay so in your
state you keep track of all those things
and the state is just really in a
JavaScript object where you come in and
you put in your different values so when
a value inside of that object has
changed react itself
reacts to it depending on how you set it
up looking to brave browser yes I use
brave browser sometimes but you know
brave browser stops hi colas
advertising and I don't like that
because if people use things like ad
blockers I don't make no money and then
other people don't make no money
like I think ads are there for a reason
right because you can't expect people to
be creating content or creating articles
and creating videos and creating stuff
for you if you think you're gonna get it
for free that's the same thing with the
net neutrality where I was like man I'm
just not worried about it cuz you gotta
I also understand people have been
making so much money of things in their
head like people think like everything
should be free and in the world like it
doesn't work like that because somebody
got a building so somebody that building
got to get paid you get insane some
things like brave browsers I don't
really use it I like the idea of what
they have they have this idea of like
having people pay for like let's say the
browser instead of you you seeing
advertising you pay your subscription so
you say hey I don't want to see no
advertising no more on the Internet
alright but brave the brave browser
company is gonna pay the the creators a
set amount of money according to how
many times that user visits that web
site if that that web site gets visited
or let's say 20% at a time of of the
user users time on a computer then they
basically gonna pay them let's say if
they paying $10 they're gonna make $2 $2
per month okay from just that user we
at the same time I don't know it's hard
because like even two dollars is like
somebody comes in and like yeah I make
two dollars from somebody but that
person comes in and uses their website
like a million times per per freaking
month you know what I mean like it's
hard man I don't use ad blockers I don't
use any programs that that block ads
because that's how people survive you
know what I mean like if people don't
don't make no money and they don't know
they can't survive then you won't be
able to see like that content anymore
you know that's what happens with a lot
of good movies there's good movies out
there but what happens is not enough
people want to go see them so now those
directors that were legit or those
actors that were really good now they
don't get no work because they say oh
this person they don't bring no money in
but the actor or the director is really
good but they don't get no no more
chances so that's why I was like when I
see a good movie I go and make sure I go
watch it let me see what's the email
let's see what's the email okay you keep
telling me to go check out the email let
me go check it out what is it
you
for you guy a shiny you guys shine wants
to create like a community to sell games
online and and be able to chat with
other people win the best way that I
will say try to build it with either PHP
laravel or if you want if you're the
only person that's gonna be working on
this thing for a long time like I said
any like we could consider your idea as
a startup what you should want to do is
use something like Ruby on Rails because
it gives you so many tools that it makes
you as a single developer count for
twenty developers you know so all the
ideas that you want to build you can
build it with Ruby on Rails easier
because you don't have a team you know
when you have a team is different when
you have a team you could be like hey
man well let's build everything in scala
and everybody has one section of the
application but when you're doing things
on your own are you doing it in small
teams the best thing to do is is use
something like Ruby on Rails Chris Shawn
without without without without without
was kick I see you man I see you you out
there man that's it
Krishan is officially or is officially
part of team treehouse let's say your
boys out there man you boy and game
trips man game them trips paid and you
know Hotelling all of that man yo keep a
lookout for Chris Shawn sex tape coming
out soon oregon trails the sex tape
oregon trails i love you man you know we
need to definitely chill man oh man now
but that's what's up man how was it man
they you see do you see the hi Calista
the Frog the you get to meet the Frog
over there there's a they used to be
back in the days there used to be a frog
the team treehouse frog let me see if I
could find it I don't know if they still
use him let me see if I can find him
right now this used to be when I want
used to be on team treehouse I don't
think they have him anymore Mike the
Frog yeah that was the name Mike the
Frog man let me see if I can share the
screen
there you go my
the Frog right there man if I woulda
went to team treehouse I'm like yo
where's Mike the Frog man where he at
Mike the Frog outside smoking a
cigarette like yo what up welcome to
team treehouse yeah you imagine that
like you go in there you're like y'all
freakin you see the whole squad you see
everybody in there man
you know people is in there is legit the
studio looks legit man you go in there
and they're like introducing everybody
to Chris on and Chris Shawn goes in
there and then there's like a back room
and there's like some frog in the back
smoking a blunt like yo welcome to team
treehouse I got you Kate
I know I know the Kinect Christian is
the man you know grinding out here man
yo man for real
spliffy the Frog word Hey Joe I'm about
to be doing final project for my coding
boot camp it's the last of five I really
want to make this one count
make this the coop the grass okay so
check your most proficient in our rails
and angular any ideas build a real um a
real how you call this ecommerce website
you can't go wrong
I mean I don't even know look what's the
difference the difference between view
and react then this is this is it the
difference is react is the originator
right things actually work better with
react all the things that you have and
in view are in react now if you come
with the mentality of hey I don't want
to write HTML in my JavaScript I don't
want to do this I want to do it my
angular way then you're gonna like view
right if you're somebody who says hey
man I'm already building this whole
application in JavaScript I might as
well write the HTML and have control of
the HTML inside of my own JavaScript
then react this for you and that's it
that's the only difference I mean all of
them are doing the same thing nowadays
like they all copy from each other you
know so you know it all depends Kelvin
Davis what up
yeah I think I think team treehouse they
got they got a lot of good stuff they
have good things and bad things just
like every single website out there no
website is perfect guys and no website
is gonna be like the answer for
everybody right it's somebody that might
come into my website and be like I can't
I can't deal with this I want to do
something else right you know some
people might come in about oh I wanna
have all my stuff structured in a way
where it's like one video per section
meaning like if we're talking about
background color we have a whole video
on background color and then the next
video we have about border-radius my
videos are not like that
because those things are so simple in my
head is I hate I'm not gonna waste
somebody's time by breaking down every
single thing into multiple videos I
rather just have everything that I need
to know in one shot right so some people
you know they work differently you know
some people they a they might go to a
frico campaign and that might work for
them some people might go to Kok Adam II
and that might work for them some people
might go to a boot camp and they might
think that work for them you know like
you know I don't know boot camps are
cool and stuff in my head is if you
don't know anything okay a boot camp
might be alright
but if you like already a computer
science major you are engineering major
like what are you doing going to a a
boot camp like you don't need that like
you know what I mean
Pluralsight item Pluralsight is cool
Floris I got a whole bunch of courses
and a whole bunch of people but to be
honest I think the problem with pro on
Pluralsight is a lot of the guys that
are on Pluralsight are like super
corporate all right they're like super
corporate their websites look like
the applications that they work on are
they look like like
every time that I've gone to Pluralsight
I'm bored by the instructors because the
application that they working on I don't
even want to build them like bro this is
super boring they overdo it sometimes
they like you know sometimes this is a
thing sometimes instructors might come
in and start talking about things that
you're not going to be doing in the
first five to ten years of your career
you get what I'm saying
so there's a junior developer you over
here is like you're taking a course that
it's trying to be so broad and give you
like every single thing from the
beginning to the super advanced stuff
and it's like this person did not need
all that information because you get
overwhelmed there's things that you're
going to learn with time is gonna take
you time to learn JavaScript is
something that you're gonna take time to
learn you're not gonna learn JavaScript
in one day in two weeks you're not gonna
learn JavaScript you gonna learn all the
basics but to like really really learn
JavaScript and know how everything works
that's gonna take you years the person
who comes in and tells you all um
already mastered javascript in six
months they're lying to you there's so
many things about JavaScript that it
like it's gonna take you years like you
won't even know that these things that
existed in JavaScript until the day that
you need it right so if you are a brand
new developer like you go to a plural
site floor site they the instructors
there they don't know they don't know
how people are when they begin that's
the my biggest problem with Pluralsight
it's like most of those people they
think like everybody says a computer
science major everybody is coming from a
technical background and and it's like
nah man like people are just regular
people trying to get into this if you
come in and you hit him over the head
with a truck full of freaking stuff like
you going it's like going into a
a store right and then the guy you go to
a guy in but I hey man I'm trying to buy
my son you know a little toy you know
something like this and then the guy
goes like this is a baby and start
bringing a truck and you're just there
you're like wait what and they just
slammed the whole load of the truck on
top of you you're gonna be overwhelmed
you like what the hell I just came in
here for one little toy why are you
giving me the whole store
that's how floor reciting a lot of those
those courses feel like oh yeah man I'll
be doing that sometimes I mean but I
don't understand why people say Adam is
slow and their computer like what type
of computers you guys have like my
computer's not even that crazy like yeah
it is from last year but like how slow
can your computer be like I understand
if you live in a third-world country
I understand you have no money you do
try to get into the gaming but it's like
how slow is your computer that that you
know what I mean like that's crazy
I've never had a slowdown Adam I've had
glitches that could happen because of
different BS packages sometimes people
create packages and don't know how to
close it properly or they do stuff that
mess up the the runtime of JavaScript in
JavaScript or freezes or something like
that then you have to close it but
that's it
yeah the ESCO might be good for some
people you know I just feel vias cold
there's so many packages that vias coach
just doesn't have like at all like it's
so limited because most people don't
want to deal with Microsoft I feel like
a lot of people have been pushing vs
cold lately the past year and it's
really not now because they need vias
code is because literally people just
want to jump on whatever's new I'll be
honest with you guys you know when I was
using brackets
I used to use brackets right and then I
switched up to sublime brackets worked
perfectly for me there was no reason for
me to jump to sublime no reason at all
and I jumped on to it right when I
jumped on to Adam there was no reason
for me to jump to Adam at all but I
jumped to it because it was new and it's
the same thing with our vs Co I even
jumped on vs code and then I realized on
my way a backpedal because vehicle did
not have all the packages that Adam had
at all
it was so limited it's kind of hilarious
cuz you would think like for a big
company you would think like they will
have a lot of packages but it just
doesn't
no I don't think vias I don't even think
via skull atom or any of those are here
to stay I'll be honest with you guys
there's a couple of other editors are
pretty legit there are coming out I mean
even the Komodo this one called Komodo
IDE which is they have a free version to
have a paid version and it seems like it
has a lot of more features than vyas
code so it's just a matter of time for
people to come in and be like hey
whatever is new you know 2018 is around
the corner from what I'm seeing a lot of
people are starting to code on the
browser they're not even using vs code
or atom you know if you go to coal
sandbox that il you will see that se was
a cold sandbox Taiyo a lot of people are
using this now too and then what's cool
about it is like you already have
everything set up for you if you want to
open up like our react let's say more
examples click in there you got a whole
bunch of stuff I'm gonna see if they got
hi Brad
so it's like it's just a matter of time
and simple react router C is super fast
everything gets transpiled quick so it's
like it's only a matter of time before
people be like oh there's a new thing
now
I mean that's how the industry is man
you know you come in you think like you
know everything and then it's like Oh
something new came out and yeah like
look cloud 9 now as part of Amazon so
phpstorm I think all of those IDs from
was it what's that company forgot the
name of them they're they're the
creators of Kotlin the people that
create a phpstorm are webstorm like
those guys that freakin idea is too too
heavy it's like they got too much
features that you don't even need at all
and it's like it's retarded
yeah JetBrains JetBrains they they have
like a whole bunch of different editors
like and to be honest they like too much
stuff man I have a
Peter Joe as my computer is pretty fast
man my computer is a MacBook Pro latest
version never had a hiccup of anything
only time that I've had a hiccup is when
usually it'll be like a program or
something on the browser that is like
like filling up the the RAM for whatever
reason and that's because people people
have a shitty code on their programs so
but yeah man I'm outta here kids I'm
starving right now I'm about to pass out
so I'm gonna see you guys later
let me know if it sounds legit let me
know if the setup is legit we in here
man yes I would definitely do source
tree tutorial I would definitely do a
github tutorial I would do all of that
you know once I finished the cool stuff
cuz you know most of the people don't
want to deal with github in in
sourcetree like that's boring for them
you know what I mean like I've created a
whole bunch of courses that are legit
but people are not using it right cuz
they want to use the cool stuff like you
know they want to be able to build
things so I'm giving them what they want
you know is it what they need I don't
know but I'll give them what they want
you know I mean like they want to build
applications as soon as possible without
knowing I think understanding github you
know like fine I'll do that too you know
what I mean all right guys man I love
you guys stay up boy joke back at
it again coding face.com
yeah we in here bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
