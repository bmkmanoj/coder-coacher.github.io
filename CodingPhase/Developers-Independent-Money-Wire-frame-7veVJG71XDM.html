now we're gonna continue with the third
part of this series okay so now what
we're going to do is do a little you
know prototype of you know just
wireframes of what the website is going
to look like okay so pretty much we need
an area where it's going to be like a
menu right a header so we're gonna have
let me fill this up I say just like that
of course the colors doesn't matter okay
doesn't really matter what the colors
are because at the end of the day we are
actually going to come in and create a
design laid out for the website itself
but pretty much there's gonna be a
header right it's gonna be the landing
page we're going to put in let's say a
large image of cryptocurrency so let's
say Bitcoin logo okay Bitcoin logo let's
put here manual or let's say site name
I'm gonna have the site name we're gonna
have menu okay and then we're going to
have a form for this we basically puts
in a date how much they spent okay so
here we're gonna say something like
let's say for example enter transaction
okay
all right its transaction and then we're
going to have some fields here price
that's gonna be like a text field so let
me see come here
like I said does it really matter how it
looks okay you know before this video is
over I'm gonna clean it up a little bit
now currently I'm using Photoshop you
guys can literally find a whole bunch of
different software out there that are
actually free that you can actually do
this in even Microsoft Paint like
literally like this is just a prototype
you know sometimes people think like you
gotta spend so much money to get all
this fancy software or sign up for
Adobe's master suite the only reason I
have Adobe master suite is for video
editing but besides that like I wouldn't
even use this thing I will use this out
here where is it
Oh grab it designer to actually do this
and this is 100% free you can go
download this application and you could
create your prototypes and your designs
for your websites okay now let's say
like this hold on sorry guys I'm a
little bit sick okay so keep those two
things group it together let's say text
field
okay now duplicate that okay
and then here we will have something
like date okay so pretty much just like
that yeah I mean it doesn't look great
right now currently because it has no
colors it has no no details to it but
it's just an idea right when you
building this type of websites this
prototypes you start with something very
very simple you know and then from there
you start worrying about colors you
start worrying about how the website is
going to look how it's going to stack up
and you know when is a responsive worry
about those things later on don't worry
about it in the beginning at all okay
oops yeah so don't worry about that at
all just so let me see right there
that's fine
now we need like a button okay and this
button is gonna say check profits now
I don't know should I be say check
profits or should I just say submit save
whatever you can figure that out later
on alright now before this website is
gonna be very simple very easy for
somebody to come in and but okay I want
to check my my transaction see how much
my Bitcoin how much money I made from my
Bitcoin or how much money I made from
buying a quarter of a Bitcoin in 2015
till now so all of this stuff is gonna
be very easy okay now the next thing
that we're gonna do is okay create that
next page so what we're going to do is
I'm going to come here I'm gonna group
all of these you know I could actually
create new compositions I believe this
layer comes as the layer comes yeah I
believe layer comps I forgot the name of
it how I really use Photoshop in a
minute
but I believe is layer comes where you
could create different on different
pages still keep the original one so let
me see for now let me just group all of
these together okay so this is gonna be
the home page
okay alright let me duplicate this this
is results okay so after the click
submit' basically or check profits
whatever they click on the button after
they click on this button is gonna take
them to the next page the next page is
going to give them the results right and
then we also gonna have advertising
there because think about it like this
like this whole thing is gonna be free
we're paying for the the hosting we're
paying for the servers but all of this
is free so
for the user the way that they pay us is
really just by having to see the ads
that say they saw our ads cool from
there we made our money it's usually
it's gonna be like somewhere around you
know maybe 20 cents per view every time
that they come in to view it and if they
click on the the link it could be up to
20 20 dollars if they click on the link
I mean right now let me check this out
oh you know what I'll talk about this
later
sorry about that so I'll talk about that
later on let's focus on this topic which
is just pretty much just the design the
prototype of it how things are going to
be stacked up there's really no colors
behind it it's just pretty much
bare-bones
okay so we got the results page which is
gonna be this one so now what I'm going
to do is I'm going to select this how
long see into transaction okay okay this
is fine I should have actually how long
delete this whole thing delete the
groups and everything so let me just
group the stuff in order here okay so
okay there's the header name this header
put this all that all the way at the top
okay prove this ass like that grew up
all of these ass body okay now what I'm
going to do is I'm going to duplicate
this and in reality you really don't
have to watch this video of me actually
building this reason those videos here
is just to show you how simple it is
that you can just prototype of page with
some simple software like Photoshop or
grab a or Microsoft Paint and just
basically create the website before you
even build it because you don't want to
build something you know spend time
coding it when in reality you just
needed to just move a couple of boxes
around and some text around to see if
things is gonna work alright so this is
just building a super prototype okay so
this right here we're gonna call it
results and this is actually going to be
the page where people land on whenever
let me create a new group okay there's
gonna be the page where people land on
when they click Submit on the farm okay
so here we're gonna come in and put in
something like this like your let me put
this here here let's say for example
you're a twelve hundred dollar
investment confess investment
it's now it's now let's say here we put
in something like two $100 investment is
now seven thousand three hundred and
four dollars all right okay so let's put
this in make this big because this their
profits you want it that they could see
this and get out oh wow this is what I
mean you know what I mean and then down
investments now seven thousand three
hundred four dollars and then you say
something here like you made a 200%
profit I don't know I don't know because
this thing is not two hundred percent is
a four hundred percent profit
my father percent you may fall on the
percent profit okay so you put that
there okay something like that give it
to them very simple very easy that you
know any mom and pops could see this I'm
gonna oh wow I mean by you know seventy
three hundred dollars and four hundred
percent in profits this was great you
know so make it real simple real easy
now as far as the advertising we're
going to make one here like that okay
put that there alright because
some people might be like oh man this
sucks you got to put advertising yeah
unfortunately you're gonna be paying for
hosting you're gonna be paying for all
of this stuff who's gonna pay for that
you are all right now are you gonna do
this out of your own kindness in this
world to be like hey I'm gonna do this
out of my own kindness I'm gonna pay all
this money and just for for no reason
right
spend time coating it spend time doing
all of this work just to be nice no it's
just not gonna work you know what I mean
so okay advertising and of course it's
not gonna be this big the advertising is
usually way smaller than this
but I'm making it nice and big so it
could be easy to just just look at and
understand like where things are going
to be put at okay so let's say ad I'm
just grouping this stuff together so I
could literally just copy and paste it
okay and then there you go so let's say
something like that
okay now let's move in this text here
something like that and then here now
give them basic button where basically
we just say hey keep create an account
to keep track of all your your your
profit right now that we just made it so
easy for them to see the profit of just
one time that they bought anything now
they could keep track of all their
profit and later on you know we could
have to sign up or you know etc right
for us we already want the moment that
they put in the transaction in the
moment that they came in and they came
to this page and they actually just
submitted and spent any time on the
website we already won alright the
reason why we won is because we
basically came in we got their attention
we gave them what they wanted super
easily now anytime that they want to get
their profits they gotta come back to
this page and every time they come back
to this page there's gonna be
advertising here advertising here now of
course because the name of the website
or you know we're gonna have keywords
somewhere here like in a paragraph or
information somewhere well we talked
about crypto currencies this
advertisings
and what this advertisements are both
going to be about you know crypto
currencies most likely they're going to
be coinbase
okay like if you search coinbase on
google you're going to get flooded with
a whole bunch of companies that want you
to sign up with them okay
so now for this one we're gonna come in
when I do this let's say something like
that and okay we're gonna put in
put it here okay now let me see
of course this thing can be named
something else later on and so be honest
with you guys we're not gonna go that
deep into creating the next pages of
like hey create the account
so track your profits listen all that
stuff can be added later on this is just
like a super you know prototype that
you're going to create something simple
right like I said from the beginning
automatically because you have to speech
online is making the life easier of the
user right they're going to come back to
this page just like I do for you know
CSS generator border-radius right
basically every time that I want to do
border-radius I go back to the website
every time I go back to the website the
guy makes 5 10 cents from me now is the
same thing as people that gonna be using
this website they're gonna come back
here every time they come here we're
gonna make 20 cents from them all right
and that's what each add so that's like
40 cents per person you know and you
might say hey this is nothing but you
got to think about it like this all that
stuff start adding up right all those
little visits all those little clicks
they start adding up and when they add
up at the end of the morphus 700 800 900
now when you start seeing that your
website starts growing bigger than what
you do is you basically come in and you
you expand it you Skelly you say okay
this website is actually coming in and
it's really hot right now let me scale
this but what happens if I come in and
our star adding you know the create a
count section
what happens if I come in and I create a
whole bunch of other stuff right you
know like you could add a whole bunch of
other features and stuff that makes
people come back to the website even
more okay so pretty much we are done on
this this section of this whole website
we got two sections we got this one and
we got the home page very simple very
easy anybody that comes here can
literally see this okay this is Bitcoin
profits calm right they come in to put
into the price of the whatever they
bought that you know at that date put in
their date check the profits we
calculate that for them they come here
they get their two $100 investment
7300 for you made four hundred percent
profits create an account and then from
there we create other parts to the
website all right like I said we're not
going that deep but this is just the
very first step to catch people
attention and be able to catch them and
you know make some money out of it no
type of people guys there's the people
that we want to become a salaryman
salary rent is somebody that comes into
work works for a company 10 20 years you
know one day they get laid off and then
they don't know what they got to do
after that
and they lost a lot of times it happens
to people now that's the other person
who is entrepreneur who says hey you
know what I'm gonna create a business
out there all right and they take that
risk but what happens is when you come
and you take a risk like that it can be
profitable and it could definitely fail
right but in a situation like this this
is just side income you could be a
salary man and still have side income
coming in you know you could come in and
work for a company and make six thousand
dollars after the taxes right but what
if after taxes you're making another
$1,500 right on the side for a website
that you barely go on you barely check
this out this was just a very simple
application that you built for some you
know some type of user some type of knee
in that same now all of this stuff is
like you know you start making money
with you know over time like I told you
guys the goal is to have five to ten
different websites like this you don't
have to be making $5,000 from each one
if you make $800 from each one
you're good you're making you know eight
thousand dollars extra per month right
now if you want to say hey I want to
quit my job and I want to go to Thailand
and relax you could do that a lot of
guys do that all right but if you say
yeah I like my job and I enjoy what I'm
doing and I have some exercise income
you can also do that too you know people
always ask me Joe how do you make you
know your money how is it that you
survive you you know when you was
working and now you left your job and
guys I've been doing this for years like
I have money stacked up from you know a
whole bunch of different applications
like this like this is not that's
nothing new to me like I've been doing
this for four years all right so it's
just side income that was there you know
what I mean so that's what I'm telling
you guys it's like I want you guys to
succeed in it's just you have that
freedom of like man if you ever lose
your job or if you ever decide to move
to another state or if you ever decide
to leave the country or for whatever
reason you always have money on you
because you set yourself up in a way
where you're now dependent on the job
it's more of like hey you go to the job
because you like to code not because you
need the money you get what I'm saying
so I'll see you guys in the next video
it's your boy Joe back at it again
coding phase comm I hope you enjoyed
this video and yeah I'll see you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
