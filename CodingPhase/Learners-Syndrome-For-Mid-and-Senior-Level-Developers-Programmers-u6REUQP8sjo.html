at it again man coding face.com your boy
is back and I didn't did it again yeah
we here kids listen we're gonna start
talking about this article there's a
massive article it's actually small but
it says a lot of good gems here right it
gives you a lot of gems all right so
let's look at this this guy said do you
have the learner syndrome learner
syndrome is when you're constantly
learning now this is for the guys who
have been doing this for a while right
we're not talking about beginners you
guys are supposed to be learning you
guys are learning how to do this right
but I'm talking about guys who have been
here 3 4 5 years 6 7 10 years in and
we're constantly learning and learning
and learning and learning and at the
same time we just keep learning new
frameworks as if they were a badge of
honor there's exactly what he says
somewhere on here
he says I've also noticed that what
developers are expected to know a number
of these frameworks as it seems to be a
badge of honor
and why right and what he means is like
you know one time you know let's say I'm
gonna wanna say you know backbone you
know whatever framework is popular at
the moment right when you work at a
company and you're let's say example you
came in in 2000 and let's say 2012 and
you was working on backbone your company
is still on backbone but then at some
point you guys switched to angular and
then you guys switched to angular and
I've been using angular for a couple of
years but you yourself in reality you
look man there's a whole bunch of
frameworks coming out man I have to keep
up man because you know what if one day
I had to come out there and try to get a
job and you know it's like I'm left
behind and there's another part where he
says it here now another point that I
think is very important in this is the
fact that sometimes we just keep
learning and learning and learning and
doing to do
perhaps like a million different to do
apps I'm guilty of that myself like I've
been doing you know there's a thing
where he says hey the list truly goes on
I've built a large number of to do apps
more than I'm willing to admit it right
like you know how many to do apps I've
built I've done an angular backbone
hyper app let's see Marco what's the
other one react did a wave amber didn't
wave was the other oh my god the list
whatever list there is of like
frameworks I've done them like I've done
the to do apps and I'm like man like I
could actually be building projects
right you know with the whole thing that
I said yesterday about when I say tbh to
be honest that app like those guys build
that pretty I don't say shitty shitty
happen can I say shitty on youtuber
anymore
but yeah it's a really bad app and it's
very simple
but they built it right when you think
about it you're like hey what am i
building and then you start thinking
about it you're like am I just learning
and learning and learning and learning
but what exactly is it that I'm building
out here what is it that I'm doing and
that really made me think about this
like I was like man I'm reading this
article I feel exactly how this guy is
you know it's like he you know people
want you to do two different stacks they
want you to do the front end they want
you to do the back end and we call a
full stack it sounds like a way to get
one person to do twice the work and not
really specialize in one of them the two
areas like alright like it seems like
that's where we going now in the
industry everybody is supposed to be
full stack you know so instead of having
people specialize in something like back
in the days now it's like hey you don't
have to be good with anything just do
both of them or do everything do a
little bit of everything you don't have
to be a master because in reality nobody
here's if you're a master in any
technology all they care is can you you
know somehow help out the team you know
it's very rare that there's a company
that'll say hey we want the specialist
on you know JavaScript we want a
specialist on my sequel we want a
specialist just for MongoDB no most
people just care about is like oh we
need an extra hand and can we just get
this person in here um but yeah and I'm
like man this made me really realize a
lot of things I'm like man I need to
start building more stuff and this is
something that I'm gonna start bringing
into my channel so like I'm going to be
building more projects not only the ones
down building on coding phase calm for
the members I'm also going to start
building personal projects projects to
make more money and the reason why I'm
saying that is because I'm like wait I
spent so much time learning new
frameworks learning new technologies and
I'm supposed to do that because later on
I'm supposed to teach it to you guys and
you guys decide which one is your
favorite one do you want angular 5 do
you want react 16 do you want high prep
next do you want yes 80s 9 like you know
I mean like I'm supposed to learn all of
this stuff but I haven't been building
anything you guys remember I was
building the coding phase calm where it
was gonna be like sort of like a social
network this doesn't that but in reality
I noticed that a lot of people wasn't
using it right so then that kind of made
me shut down I said you know what I'm
just not gonna spend the time to create
you know a brand new social network for
people because in reality nobody was
using it so I say you know what I'm
gonna shut that down I'm just gonna do
the courses which is which was what I
wanted to do from the beginning right
but at the same time I wanted to have
that that app something that could say
hey I build this from scratch you guys
use it this doesn't that and then I
realized I'm like man I don't
be doing it right if nobody's gonna use
it I'm not gonna I'm not gonna basically
build it but at the same time I need to
start building projects myself not just
projects that I'm gonna teach you guys I
want to build my own side projects like
you know like right now I'm working on
this game you know something simple you
know this is the starter kit kids this
is just me starting a tile Maps you know
send something simple but all of this
stuff is it's gonna look so much better
at the end but it's a it's a personal
project right now this personal project
I'm gonna put it on on the iOS store I'm
gonna put it on the Android store it's
gonna generate let's say in the
beginning fifty two hundred two hundred
dollars a month right it's just
generating money but at the same time I
want to build other projects like I have
stuff that I want to build for high
schools and you know for teachers like
there's things that I I noticed from my
wife that you know when she was teaching
to her kids
I'm like you know what like maybe I
could create a website where teachers
who are like an essay for kindergartens
to let's say pre-k to first grade right
there's really not a website for those
teachers or even for daycares right
there's really not a website for those
people so I was thinking about creating
something for them where kids will have
games you know little stuff like that I
learned their ABCs like you know right
now you're probably thinking in your
head I'm like oh man this is whack this
is gonna be boring for Joe and it's like
man that's a that's a service right
there you know what I mean like I have a
lot of skills I know what I'm doing so
it's like instead of me spending so many
time I want so much time looking on you
to me like I'm constantly buying courses
from you to me that's what you guys
don't know I'm like hoarding courses on
you to me I'm buying courses every
single day and I'm like man instead of
me buying so many
is on udemy let me start building
projects let me start getting small
little projects seeing there there's
this guy I don't know if I mention it to
you guys there's like what I consider
like one of my mentors for whatever that
means you know I hate when people call
him mentors as like as if like
somebody's holding your hand but um I
could say more like a inspiration this
guy his name is levels
the IO that's how people know him he
basically he he does like small apps
right
like there so this article where he did
a long time ago let me see if I could
maybe find it where he said hey I'm
gonna build 12 startups in a year so
it's one started but per month right in
the first two to three months he crema
he came up with like two three different
apps that people used and nobody cared
about and then on the fourth month right
he created this thing called let me see
I believe is remote cities I'm gonna
tell you right now you know I'm gonna
tell you right now give me give me one
second remote is every mo tops I won't
tell you right now cuz this is really
important remote ICO is it this one this
is one of the websites that he built but
let me see where is it I want to make
sure that you guys get to see it was
this website remote oh yeah
nomad list alright he's at your hog I'm
I started to be number one product con
and hacker knows by accident now there's
when he was doing his website man like
this thing just became like huge like
every single person who was like a nomad
digital nomads they know about this
website so let me show it to you guys
right now and it's so simple it's so
easy but so many people come to this
website per day it's not even funny a
lot of people come here to find out
which which city they should actually go
to and then people could come in and
submit like their own reviews of it and
be like all cost of living how much it
costs for apartment how much is it for
single person co-working space you know
like there's so many things that they
have that's so cool right now he built
this with I believe he started with PHP
laravel let me see what he's using now
he might have jumped - no I think he did
either Larry ball or Ruby on Rails and
then as the website started growing he
upgraded - no Jay yes I believe or
elixir one of those - but what's crazy
is that there's a website that freaking
makes him a lot of money like he just
did this out of nowhere you know and
going back to the article where this
guy's saying hey do you have to Lerner
syndrome like I feel like a lot of us
are going through this where we already
have jobs like great we already have
jobs you're we're already getting money
out here we already have been successful
developers we are mid-level senior level
developers right and we already in
reality we don't need to try to keep up
constantly with people like you know be
like oh I want to learn every single
framework out there like we don't need
it but something inside of us keeps us
trying to learn every single thing out
there
so instead of us building projects we
actually spend more time learning than
building you know I was like let me see
going back to this thing where he says
if I start building something and
investing time in it I feel like I'm
missing out
on learning the new cool technologies in
half fear of being left behind everybody
goes through this day I think everybody
who cares you know because they they are
developers who pretty much like I got a
job
I'm never learning anything else and
they stay there and they're like oh yeah
I'm using Java spring of like you know
20 you know 2001 2001 or like people who
be like oh yeah like we use asp.net and
it's like asp.net from like 2006 and
it's like oh they never upgraded their
skills they're like oh I got a job
that's it you know you can't be like
that either right you got at some point
you gotta try to update your skills but
you should be creating projects you
should be trying to have you know new
new projects that you can say hey I
built this hey I have a website that's
pretty successful you know what I mean
like I'm very proud of you know coding
phase comm I'll be honest this isn't a
website that I built from scratch but
what I've done here between YouTube and
this website is pretty legit like I have
over 2,000 subscribers on this website
alone all right paying subscribers right
and then what I consider 2000
subscribers I consider 1,000 subscribers
aren't no you subscribers because you
know people come in sign up and then
they leave this I've seen people come
and sign up and now even do any of the
courses like they'll just come in and
just sign up and never come back
you know I've seen that happen but I
will say this like a thousand members
who are pretty low you pretty low you're
pretty comfortable with the website
right now to be transparent to be
completely open most of those people
were from when we were doing the five
dollar special but now new people are
coming in people are finding this
website from on YouTube
and they find out for you to decide
from google.com and I'm very proud of
this all right I'm very proud of this
website because this a stream of income
and then not only that is a community of
people that can help out okay and at the
same time we have 2,000 paying members
but at the same time we have about
another I think it's like another 2,500
people who have subscribed who I just
subscribed to the free courses who are
people who are who somehow found me and
they still want to get the content right
so even if I was to create another
project right where I will say hey guys
this is a website called checklist I
don't know right checklist that I oh
right a place where developers go in and
they have that as a checklist of the
skills that they have right that's
something that I was thinking about
coming up with right checklist at i/o
probably someone's gonna steal it out
but it's okay
you know or whatever like I could reach
out this site there's a community of
developers doc and say hey guys check
out my project what I built
rady check out my project look what I
did tell me what you guys think right so
now when I'm looking at this I'm like
man like I think this is the time for me
for me to start coming up with real
projects you know me start it up start
to startups up I might take this man I
might do what he what he did like two
three years ago no I think he did he
started this one on three years ago now
this is from three years ago I'm gonna
tell you right now how long I've been
following this kid like okay twelve
startups in 12 months all right now
let's look back this is like going in a
time machine 2014 okay that's three
years ago hey this guy he is II's like I
forgot what he's former things from
Sweden or somewhere around there right
in like he started this thing he has
like a whole bunch of different things
like look he even had a youtube channel
which he sold for a couple of thousand
dollars like it sounds so similar to
like my story you know what I mean
when I first started this this thing
where I was like man will become a
developer and I'm gonna start doing this
thing like I was like following this guy
I started in 2012 and then I found him
in 2013 from 2013 to now I've been
following his career and following the
things that he's done but to me is
extremely important to look at the fact
that he built projects you know what I
mean like it's not just okay here's a
website here I got it from a client you
got a look into what type of problems
are there and then try to solve them
right because it's like we keep falling
to this thing man you know like this
this video I'll be honest this videos
not really for for beginners I mean in
reality this is for people who have been
in the industry for a while and they can
understand this because when you're a
beginner you're supposed to learn all
the new frameworks in the things because
you're looking for a job right you're
looking for a job you want to be
prepared you want to be able to say hey
somebody tells you oh you do you know
view yes I know I've taken a little bit
of you online I'm not an expert but I
know what it is hey do you know react
yes I know react hey can you build this
yes okay it's like do you know that
reactance is similar to angular
you know angular 4 or whatever right
it's like they both use components so
maybe you could get hired even though we
use and get a four here or angular five
whatever we still hire you right or vice
versa the person might come in and be
like oh I use angular 5 and gonna four
and but the company uses react so
because you're you know you're you're
used to the idea of using components
they'll still say hey we're gonna hire
you we're gonna trust you to bring you
in so as a junior developer like that's
great you need to know
as much as you can you know you don't
need to be an expert on any of them but
know them man but what happens once you
already have a job you've been working
on this for years already
do you just continue falling into this
trend of like keep on learning keep on
learning keep on learning I mean there's
different goals in life right there's
people who have the goals of hey I just
want to work I just want to you know
show up to the meetups and you know say
wow you know have people saying WOW to
to the things that I know like me I
could care less about that all right
I personally I don't care about the
gratification of like having people come
up to me like oh you're super smart oh
wow you call you know you you did this
you did that no I don't care about that
right I already got all that stuff when
I was like in high school and like you
know I don't care about that by now now
I'm in another stage where I'm like hey
I want to be successful and create
startups create projects that people
really enjoy projects and products that
solve problems in the world that's what
I want to be doing all right working in
a company doesn't really do it for me
because there's like what what am I
gonna be doing will be solving the
problems for the company for somebody
who already created his company and he's
happy with a smile or do I say you know
F that um I'm gonna create my own
company you know what I mean so that's
where I'm at right now so when I saw
this article I was like man this is like
speaking right to me man
like I need to you know go hard you know
like after I'm gonna start to be honest
I'm gonna start creating just ideas I'm
gonna get a notebook imma start looking
and doing research at at different
industries and see what they're working
with see how I can improve it you know I
think education is really important and
this like so much room to grow in there
I like the idea of like things for tea
ain't like you know like tv8 I know a
million people's gonna be trying to hit
that audience now because of tbh but I
think there's so many other ideas that I
have stuffed I used to do when I was in
high school right but now rocking
actually Skelly right so I'm thinking
about just writing down the ideas and
start creating more stuff and then keep
you guys with me on this journey because
then just update you guys on what I'm
doing like if you guys check this guy
out man go to level style
literally like this guy and read his
articles from the beginning like what he
does now is like the success right
that's the success of of being a
developer and you're like oh yeah this
is you know this guy's is doing so good
he has so much money he's traveling the
world he you know he don't even have to
work in a company like that's the easy
part that's like now he made it right
the ones that you want to look at is the
ones in the beginning man the worlds
were he just like see he said hey I'm
gonna leave my country I'm gonna go to
travel in Asia and somehow I'm going to
create you know twelve startups in one
year
he didn't even get to get to the twelve
he got selecting to like the fourth of
the fifth and that's a he became
successful after that like people if you
go out and you start creating stuff then
you're gonna be successful right and
it's just like there's an article in
here that he has well he says man it's
not about you know having one that's
gonna take you you know like people come
in and create a project right they're
like well I'm gonna build the next
Facebook the next Facebook is gonna take
you five years to build right or you say
hey I'm gonna create a game that's gonna
compete with Call of Duty that game
might take you 15 years to do it by
yourself right but what if you just come
in and wave small ideas and then you
just try them out
which mistakes and then you Skelly right
you come up with an idea and you say
okay I'm gonna do this and then once
this it becomes popular then our scaling
right it's like throwing you know
spitballs at the wall right and see
which one sticks right which was the one
who's gonna stick there and then from
that you say okay this one stick this
one stick this one stick so now I got
these three great projects that I can
scale and put money behind it all right
now I'm telling you guys I feel like
this year this new 2018 is the year to
just go hard you know 2017 was a year of
like finding myself and for a lot of
developers I feel like it was more like
me finding myself and figuring out how
to survive in this world and it was
gonna make me happy right now 2018 is a
whole different ballgame 2018 is about
hey how we can become more successful
than what we did before yeah we got jobs
yeah we got offers from major companies
yeah we did this yeah we did that but
what about creating our own product hey
something that people can use and really
enjoy and I'm gonna leave you guys with
that and yeah I met so you know to sum
this whole thing up is look at this
article read it if you're one of those
that is falling into this trap of just
learn is syndrome and just continuing
learning learning learning without
building anything without saying hey
this is my you know how you see it it's
like people come in and they're like man
this is my life's work
right what's going to be your life's
work is it gonna be a bunch of to do
laps or you're going to have projects in
and you know in companies you know those
are the things that you're gonna be able
to say and tell your grandkids is like
hey man I had you know I had you know
two companies by the time I was you know
35
to three companies right do you wanna
say hey man I spent most of my life
working for a company and I could say I
built every to-do app that's Under the
Sun I mean it's up to you which one do
you want to be right for me myself I
want to just start building companies
right
I feel like coding face.com is already a
company by itself I'm creating a lot of
good content here but at the same time I
want to start building other projects
you know like other projects that is
gonna be something that we could all be
proud of
reni something that was a black hole
sure you remember when Joe was talking
about this in 2017 now Summer 2018 like
all the high schools are using it
although you know college students are
using this thing and you know you get
something viral working out there even
something for hospitals I don't know
imma do the research I want you guys to
do the research so you know this is for
all of you guys it's like you know
Felipe and a couple other guys friend
Zach oh the other guys that have been
doing this for a while either from Java
have been doing in web design have been
doing it and whatever you use right this
time it's time for you to start building
real projects and real products it's our
time you know what I mean so yeah man
like I said guys check the description
below this coding phase calm your voice
back I'm sorry the camera's not on
basically I got a gallows something I
gotta restart the computer for some
reason the camera wasn't working but I
didn't want to do it but go to coding
phase calm listen I love you guys check
my website out man somebody sent me a
message and they asked me you know why
should they sign up to my website what
makes my website different right and my
website the only thing that makes it
different is that we're building real
projects that's it you know what I mean
like I'm going to make a video about
this and I'm going to compare
a lot of websites that I've seen and I'm
gonna compare it to mines all right guys
I'll see you guys later it's your boy
Joe : face calm your boy is backing out
and did it again yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
