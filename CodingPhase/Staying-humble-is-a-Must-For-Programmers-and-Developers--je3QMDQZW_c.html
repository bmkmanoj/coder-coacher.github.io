back at it again man Cody face calm man
listen your boys back i'm out here man I
so this will be going to do right I'm
gonna say my video and then from there
somewhere in between the middle of the
video I'm gonna actually give out a
freak or somebody right maybe one or two
peoples gonna get free quest on this
video alright and we're gonna do it
straight from here random generator well
you know number generator right there's
200 people who signed up you know and
then now I'm just gonna let Google
figure it out who's gonna win because
it's too many people those are gonna be
like you know a couple of people and
maybe I could help out but now to be
fair we just kind of do a super random
let Google handle it you know what I
mean all right so anyway so people been
asking Joe how do you stay real how do
you stay just you know grounded and
focused well very simple guide number
one I don't act like I know everything
like that's the first thing that you
gotta know because you're gonna bump
into people who are in this industry who
they swear they are geniuses
like they think they are the second you
know coming of Christ they think that
they they're the smartest person like
they figure it out like they figure
something out that nobody else figure it
out and I'm like come on bro like stop
acting like a freaking asshole right so
yeah man for me what I do is I just
stayed grounded I act like I don't know
anything like I'll be honest with you i
mean i cain't that's what i do like this
is situation currently that I'm going
with theirs are all the developer who's
been around for way longer than me and
but this person doesn't know everything
that I know about laravel and you know
other frameworks right because they've
been around for a long time but what do
I do I try to tell them hey listen let's
try to follow the narrow way that's
trying to do things you know how to
framework want you to do it well
this person was to do it the PHP way
which means gets hacking it yes you know
PHP yes you've been doing this for a
long time but you're not following the
things that the net you know the
framework is telling me laravel already
has a lot of things built in you don't
need to freaking recreate the wheel
right so what do i do right I'm trying
to tell this person to do this and
follow the way this person doesn't want
to listen to me so what do I do I'm like
okay cool you're smarter than me I just
leave it at that you know what I mean
like I'm not gonna be arguing with this
person and keep on telling them hey man
let's do this way come on this is going
to be better it's gonna be easier I'm
just gonna let them trip on themselves
you know let them trip on their own
you know and that's how I am I'm super
humble I don't act like I know
everything guys I really don't like if I
know something I found out a shortcut to
something and I give you an advice
listen to me because when I give an
advice I mean I went through something I
went through a mistake and basically
when I tell you to do it a certain way
is because I already went through that
mistake and I already know already been
through it you know what i mean so
that's how i stayed humble man I don't
act like I know everything I don't act
like I'm the smartest person in the
world I don't act like I'm the best
programmer I just want to be you know
somebody who just cool somebody who you
know it's a good co-workers somebody who
is able to work with anybody somebody
that you know I could just be in
a good mood all the time even when I'm
feeling sick and tired I still show her
face I was like hey let's get it on man
this let's get height you know what I
mean because that's what type of person
that I am and for you guys my advice
will be is listen when you work in a
certain environment guys don't even you
should know more than the other person
don't act like you know more than the
other person be humble you know just be
yourself but be humble you know
don't try to another person because
you just look like an asshole know what
I mean like you look a little guys you
know Elon Musk you look at dhh you look
at Mark Zuckerberg look african a whole
bunch of developers who who pretty much
have made it really big they never
really showed up this skill they just go
into work and do they think that's it
you know what I mean like they don't
have to show off an act like they're the
best they just they do the work quietly
get it done and let the work speak for
themselves you know all right but
anyways man I know you guys don't weigh
in for this man you gotta wait to find
out who's gonna win out of the 200
people who signed up right well very
simple we gotta lose like pretty crazy
right now we gotta search random number
generator right and pretty much let's
see what it gives us number six all
right no I'm joking guys yeah don't get
scared I know how to do this man go get
skid all right so the minimum is going
to be a 1 and the maximum is going to be
200 right so let's see what it gives us
all right I hope it's somebody who
always comments yeah I really do
number 10 81 okay so 1081 one more
110 all right turn lady 1 110 that's the
winners and I would tell you right now
because I have the list but I cannot
show it because if I show it then
everybody else's names and emails is
going to come up i'm pretty sure that
you guys don't want that information to
be out there because if you signed up
for my you know my gift to you guys i'm
pretty sure you guys but what your email
roaming around the internet itself right
so let's get it holy and all right
so Alan and guy uh he won but I'm
amazing right now my boy Joseph and this
is not like nobody cheated nobody did
anything this was straight to be honest
with you guys you saw it it was
completely random I cannot show you the
list because you know I don't know
everybody's emails to be on the internet
but listen this house this all
real it is right on man this how real
this thing is man this kid joe said been
around someplace when I had less than a
hundred subscribers and you see how
karma is the first time that started
giving this out he's one of the winners
and I I'm not even lying I know people
is going to be mad this and that but the
truth is that's how karma is due only
show me love over here been around since
the beginning and look how God just
comes in and sprinkles a little
something on it you know what I mean
listen I'm just happy for him because
like guilt you know what it is to be
here from when it's under a hundred
subscribers and then now we're up to
2,000 and then you freaking win you know
it's crazy and then you got your voice
Simon Yam you know Ron's L I don't know
