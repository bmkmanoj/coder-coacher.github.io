joke back at it again man listen today
we're gonna basically start learning how
to use a a program to prototype our
websites right and I'm actually gonna
prototype the website that I'm gonna
build for coding face.com for you guys
alright so if you guys haven't heard of
this Adobe XD right now it's on beta so
it's free and all you have to do is just
pretty much go to adobe.com and
basically sign up you know sign up
register alright and then once you sign
up search for Adobe XD alright and then
just download it listen and pretty much
you're gonna get this this program that
lets you prototype a website before you
start coding it alright so let's get to
it ok I started you know let's see and
then from there then I start web alright
so you got the art board which is this
here you can make multiple ones you can
duplicate it all right now you have
multiple artboards alright for now I
just want one yeah so let's start so I
actually want to make this a little bit
bigger
all right so let's start um yeah okay
this annoying but yeah so pretty much
like I say something like this there's a
rectangle and I want to say make this
from here to here I'm going to make it
like this so you could control this the
fill color does the border you know the
blue shadows you could put you could
learn the background like the you know
like the iPhone does so like my same
example right now what I want to do is
so man sorry guys I'm gonna I'm on a
laptop in psych pretty horrible to do
this in the laptop because it's so small
especially I got a 13-inch so does how
I'm thinking I want the website
right now I'm just coming out with the
stuff like straight out of my head
you know I haven't planned it and this
is not a planned video at all this is
just something that you know I'm gonna
start making and you know you guys might
as well see the process go from here
make it bigger
of course this is just prototyping yeah
right
I'm not building this thing so be
exactly how I won on the website for now
I'm just putting prototype
so I'm gonna say here I'm gonna put a
image
alright let's say what else gets a
little annoying yeah oh yeah so you're
gonna pull like you know list the
features
so that's all we got so far so it's
gonna be sign-off updates for people to
put in their email this off for a moment
then what else maybe make this thing
smaller
eco-center here like this is Center
vertically and then this on Center
horizontally I could put it to the right
laughs but I right in the middle put it
to the top well to the bottom to the top
now gonna put it right in the middle so
let's see who knows when I should I put
for this I'm gonna also to make a
section where I'm gonna have all the
latest videos so let me see how I'm
gonna do it
now I could press command G this groups
it together so now I should have moved
this whole thing myself right because I
put them inside a folder let me see what
this I go for like this I like that one
what I'm pressing right now is I click
it and hold shift so I got on this
 from that so like this like that so
like that so now basically this another
you guys don't know purple is my
favorite color
that's why I always use it everywhere
let me see what else so let's say
something like this so I'm gonna put the
video you press T basically gives you
text okay so like I'm new to this guys I
usually use something called sketch
which is this one but we bear it and
basically learning together if you guys
are following me on this like there's
just like a prototype in it giving you
an idea how things are made
so if I click here and I click the box
around it and I say hey Centuri what it
does is centers around this box but I
have to select the box and the text
together alright and then I say like
this alright put that right in the
middle
and press command-d it duplicates
this so now bascially crap all of them
like that from the corner now I select
all of them either just grab from the
corner and they grow as much as I wanted
to which is cool to see it stays the
same aspect ratio which is pretty great
trust me guys
like this I got a game-changer all right
go back here back to the artwork
all right see
you
all right let me see what else so this
is gonna be like the footer
all right let me check what else should
I do to this thing of course listen what
else can I do this thing I don't know I
mean for now that's all the ideas that I
have for it but yeah so pretty much is
just gonna be like okay people land here
if you know you want to keep updating
you know sign up here basically put in
your email
this is gonna be a menu on here there's
gonna be the video here at the latest
video probably put the top three videos
here I'm gonna put an image here I don't
know maybe I got a phone or something
and then I put a list of the features
that I'm gonna have like you know it's
gonna get better but this what I have
right now there's just a simple
prototype and you already know let's see
boy make sure you go follow the kid make
sure you sign up on you know online and
just show me some love guys like
straight up drop off a comment something
and make sure you go to Adobe X you know
adobe.com and search Photoshop not
Photoshop sorry search Adobe XD alright
so remember it's Adobe comp
slash and then search XD Adobe
experience design you click there you
download it and basically just you know
play around with it of course right now
this is just literally my first time
playing with this
you know as I get better I'm also going
to teach you guys any tricks that are
fine but this is cool because then you
could just prototype your website real
quick without having to you know do any
code and I think this is great all right
guys I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
