back at it again back ok coding face.com
man top ten frameworks man for nodejs
look at the swag alright so we back at
it right alright so we have you know
we're gonna start from the top man we're
gonna start from the top man this is in
no order there's no order to this thing
man
cuz I know people's gonna be like oh my
god you got meat here all the way at the
bottom but it's like the number one with
github stars and this and that
listen that's your opinion that's the
opinion of a lot of people we cannot go
by stars you know why because stars is
like a favorites whenever you go to a
website you click favorites like you
could go and add it to your favorites or
to your how you call that shake
your address book or bookmarks whatever
you could add any website to
your bookmarks but that doesn't mean
that it's the best framework out
there at all plus you gotta understand a
lot of people have been
promoting their for frameworks whatever
but it doesn't mean that they're the
best do you know what I mean alright so
anyways this mindless ad so we're gonna
start with darkness a darkness is pretty
much like how you call it it's like it's
like a clone of laravel so if you ever
mess around with PHP laravel you're
gonna feel at home
pretty much everything about a darkness
is is like a a copy of laravel pretty
much right now if you guys remember that
laravel was a copy of Ruby on Rails so
we I don't know if you guys know that
right
so Larry will copy Rubio who well Rubio
really came out Larry will came out
after and became a copy of that now the
next generation is Adonis GS and now
Adonis GS has taken the best things that
Ruby on Rails and Darvill came out with
and pretty much this guy just coming up
with an amazing framework okay so you
know a guy
Oh RM Scott everything that you want
from a full stack you know there's a lot
of that you don't want to do it
yourself you don't want to do what tenth
occasion you don't want to deal with the
you know the database which one you're
gonna choose whatever this already
handles everything for you right then
from that we have total total je s
alright so this was the same thing you
could use no sequel you could use a
regular sequel or databases with this
it's like a full package and one thing
you're gonna notice about me is that
when I use a framework I like to use it
for the full package I don't want to be
able to go in there and start deciding
oh now I gotta get a dependency for this
or now I gotta go and get you know for
 whatever whatever it is like you
have to keep adding dependencies
and more require like that
you don't need I will if I'm using a
framework I'm just gonna want
the whole man give me the whole
 man don't make me start
adding extra to it like I don't
want to add or what's this
 Axios and all this extra
 like give me your whole
full package man all right so you guys
probably like what the this guy
cursing when he's bugging out
well I this how I end this I speak I'm
speaking to you guys like yeah what's my
boy you know what I mean so yeah so um
total yes another one that has the full
package there's my number two no don't
which is another one which copy from
rails
it has models has routing migration
tasks Oh authorize those controllers or
M's metal where it has a CLI tool like
so it's a pretty big framework and
 like to be honest with you guys
it pisses me off like when I see there's
like only 3,000 stars
I know we we're not supposed to you know
who act like the stars is that important
but when our framework is really pop
it's like really really good and then
nobody gives it no stars and doesn't
promote it like it's a really let down
because what happens is that other
developers who are really talented don't
go and start creating you no matter
where for this or you know different
plugins I'm sorry I'm keeping alive out
here alright so you know like other
developers don't create anything new for
it so then the the frameworks they die
even though they were actually better
than other frameworks that you know are
mostly popular right so then from there
we have you know the gulp you know if
you you know the goatman you know the
goal a lot of these freakin frameworks
are are built on top of express this is
like the gold is like the originator of
nodejs frameworks it's super simple it
just pretty much is like you get to
decide what you want to do it with your
server right you basically get
bare-bones right you get routing you gay
you know a couple of different little
bullshit's just for you know use a
meadow where you could do debugging
error handling whatever templating you
get the basics but it's not a full phone
you know full fledged framework and
that's why I don't mess with it like I
will not mess around with expresses like
if I want do something simple but if I'm
gonna do a build something like a large
application I need a full fledged
framework that has everything I don't
want to be spending time looking for
plugins or looking online how should I
do this how should I you know give me
the whole man you know what I mean
now sales cells is the next one right so
I'll put sales at number five right a
lot of people like sales because they
think like this like one of the only
ones that you could properly use my
sequel for some reason people think that
there's not only one for my sequel right
a lot of famous companies are using
sales
and you know what sales is not that
great because sales all is doing is just
pretty much making a super bloated it's
like an Express app and then it's super
bloated that's all he's really doing and
then getting a whole bunch of
dependencies it's not that great guys
like I don't know why you guys keep
giving in so many stars like it's not
that great all right now let's say you
got co-op this Express and there's
another one that's like super simple
it's not a full fledged framework you
got happy Jay a switch it's like super
popular we're like you know major
companies you got may see you see that
Walmart you got PayPal by the way the
Walmart website or nodejs is pretty much
BS all right yeah but yeah you got
PayPal you got all this you know famous
companies that are actually supporting
them and and using their their
technology you know there's another one
that is pretty cool I haven't had the
time to really invest into it so I just
put the eyes one of the last ones
because I haven't put enough time into
that one so I can't really tell you if
that's the best one but I guess it's the
best one from you know all all the
simple ones like Express and Cola right
now then you got mene mene is just
pretty much is Mongo Express angular and
no I guess yeah I guess that's what it
means all right so I don't know man I
remember a few years ago when mean came
out and everybody was talking about Oh
the mean stack the mean stack the mean
stack and I'm like mm-hmm
there's something about it I don't like
and you know just the fact that a lot of
people like angular and it's not but to
me it's not that great it's just an
express ah like you could do that
yourself you don't need a framework foot
for that at all so I don't know then you
got flat iron which
it tells you already like hey their
website is down and like you know this
one of those frameworks that people were
talking about a lot a few years ago and
like now it kind of fell off the map so
yeah man so those yeah pretty much it
doesn't even exist the website is not
even working on one nobody cares about
that you know flat iron j s but yeah
those are the top ten frameworks you
know for nodejs in 2017 man I would
personally will say hey either go with
Donna's Jas or go with happy jazz a
diamond CSS is pretty much different in
the future there's plenty of people who
work with rails and work with laravel
and then now a lot of companies are
they're gonna notice Adonis GS this year
so goodbye sales goodbye Express I'm
telling you guys Adonis GS is the mother
 creature I don't even want to curse
man but ya got me out here cursing man
listen anyways man just make sure you
subscribe and make sure you you know
like this video man if you watched it
all the way to the end right now make
sure you at least watch any other other
videos that's here and like show some
love man you already know it's your boy
Joe back at it again bow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
