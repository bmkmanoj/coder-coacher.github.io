back at it again man coding phase comm
web developers lunch break alright so
today's topic is how to deal with other
people's attitudes right especially when
it's crunch time as a developer a lot of
people are going to come to you if you
have to ask to everything as if you can
make magic happen as if everything
that's going on is your fault
because you're the developer everything
supposed to work perfectly the reality
of things is life is not perfect
nothing is wrong on this project and
unfortunately when it comes to web
development it also can be unfortunate
in person
get in perfect because like let's say an
example you working on something and
somebody pushes something on the code
that can break your part of the code so
and yeah you think oh I finished this a
while back and you push it to the live
site and it's broken so people come to
you and be like hey man I thought you
fixed it can you fix this thing or then
you wasn't you wanna charge a piston or
whatever component it is the website
what we will charge it and then you'll
again I finished it
everything is fine then you look
somebody did it change somewhere in the
site I go to the API or whatever JSON
data you was expecting in the tin job of
migration we're getting a refactor
throughout the whole site so now you
that created your component now is your
foot even though somebody else broke it
somebody else bidding so how do you deal
with that especially when you didn't
with management or
coworkers who might come with you with
attitudes or different problems right
they go out I like this man just take it
easy don't let it stress you don't worry
about it everybody makes mistakes if
they can't understand that then don't
pay no mind to them and then when they
make a mistake
bring it on but I owe you did a mistake
on this you're going to mistake on that
you put a mistake on this you did a
mistake on that all right because a lot
of people like to subdue things and and
basically the like to take
responsibility but when it's either your
fault or you're connected to a certain
problem the respect you take the
responsibility no matter what even
though you had nothing to do with it
right so that's one of the issues as
being a web developer and how do you
deal with that like I told you like just
take it easy relax don't worry your body
it's not your fault and if it is your
fault just be like hey it's fine I can
fix it
don't let it ruin your day don't let it
stress you out just chill all right guys
but yeah man so this is a quick advice
for you guys who are either working at a
company right now or on your way to get
hired you know whether you get to one of
those situations where it's either your
fault or not your fault but people are
putting blame on you take it easy don't
panic just relax take a breather and
explain to the person break it down to
them tell them hey this what happened
dah dah dah you know somebody pushed
this the change that they didn't
refactor or the variable so that's why I
broke and then just fix it you know
don't let it ruin your day but I Oh God
you know it's not my fault they should
have put blame on me just take it easy
all right guys anyways man you already
know simple job back at it again man
