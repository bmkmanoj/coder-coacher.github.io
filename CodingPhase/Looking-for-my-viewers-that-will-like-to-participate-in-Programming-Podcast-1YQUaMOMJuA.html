it again man calling face.com guys yeah
alright so I have an idea that I want
you guys to send me a message and
basically whoever is available well is
actually interested in becoming a
panelist and my new idea which is going
to be a podcast alright so what I want
to do is I want to have you know two or
three guys from here from my viewers
that pretty much although I gotta put on
the seat but that pretty much has on a
laptop with a camera and can do a google
hang up and then we'll figure it out
what day is the perfect day for us to do
the Hangout but I just want to know who
who here is actually interested
it could be a beginner could be somebody
who has some experience it doesn't
matter like I just want to have a couple
of the people who are interesting in
web development or programmer in general
and basically we got to go over topics
you know just talk about talk about
things about web development is
basically cold and how it is to actually
come on a web designer / programmer or
so for engineer whatever it is right but
I just want to know from my viewers
who's interested in becoming a parent
all you need is a laptop or a webcam and
microphone like come on guys the losses
opportunities because I'm telling you
this thing we're going to blow up + this
is really good for you guys as junior
developers to basically be part of
something like this because you can use
that as your you know for your resume
where people who actually hate like how
are you involved in the community you
who pretty much say hey I'm part of our
podcast
on part of a YouTube channel basically I
come in in a panel and we talk about
code my company's love that they love to
see somebody who's actually invested in
the community and it's not just you know
like somebody who's just trying to get
into the industry just to get some money
people like it when people know that you
could actually that you actually use you
know you have some code in your own time
or you actually use your knowledge that
you have to help others like they love
that people love open source let me
tell somebody in the coming right hey I
have a open source project that has 1000
scholars trust me you will get hired
because they know that pretty much you
you're very involved in the industry and
you know even if you're just the
beginning you can never have a job like
that's just how it is so it's up to you
guys you guys let me know what I want to
do there's a new idea that I came up
with I want to come up with my own
podcast and pretty much it's just going
to be like another video here on my
youtube channel but at the same time
what I'm going to do with that the audio
of that video that we're going to make
is I'm gonna promote it through itunes
I'm a promoted through stitcher I'm a
promoter to all the the podcast apps
because you know that's what I do I know
how to promote things right so yeah man
it's a new idea that I just came up with
and yeah I'm gonna try to get krishan in
here I'm gonna try to get quoting
tutorials 360ml try to get eric i'm
gonna try to get milk stars i'm gonna
try to get everybody who's in here i'm
gonna try to get a Chris Hawks
I'm gonna try to get him you know you
know what I work in the beginning I feel
like now we could we could work
something out man we do it on his
schedule I want to get him on it you
know I want to get a couple of peoples
you know
deftly ish I want to get level up cuts I
want to get learn code Academy a bunch
of the guys who are here I'm gonna try
to get the moneys once a week you know
for for this podcast and at the same
time I want to have other developers who
are viewers for my channel on the
podcast itself so it's not just like you
know the professional guy is talking
about code it's also people who are
pretty much just learning you know and
then their actions questions or they
could tell us how you know what things
they have an issues way what's making it
difficult for them to learn whatever it
is and yeah that's my idea that i have
for this podcast hopefully nobody steals
it you know how the internet is and you
know how some channels here on
YouTube are you know who I'm talking
about alright anyways guys oh yeah man
