Joe back at it again man we live out
here calling face.com man your boys back
we're gonna talk about view Jas man so
what is view Jas right is uh basically a
framework you know it's pretty much a
copy of angular and you know some parts
of me copying react right so pretty much
what can I say about this like I feel
like I should make a review about this
this framework after you know trying it
out and and learning pretty decent
amount of content from it pretty much
I've already put in about five hours
into it and it seems pretty cool it's
you know it's not like nothing new which
is which I think that's my biggest
problem with view Jas Rana that is not
bringing anything new at all like all
the day was pretty much say hey we're
gonna take this parts from angular and
we're gonna take this parts from react
like I'm not a fan of you know putting
JavaScript basically putting too much of
the code inside the HTML I'm really not
a fan of that you know why because if
I'm working in JavaScript I don't want
to have to learn something else like you
know now I have to learn V bind and
doing all this extra that makes no
 sense like for me as a
JavaScript developer having to learn
something else so let me say where's our
examples contrasting examples
okay so you see like now you're gonna
have to remember a whole bunch of
basically of properties like you know V
HTML what the hell is this value away
what else like this a lot of in
there that I feel like with react like
once you know JavaScript like you go
what react like you who pick up react
right away and like you could start
making you know making something new in
like a couple of minutes it doesn't take
that long to understand react if you
know JavaScript but something like this
is like now you're gonna have to learn
how the framework works like like you
know v4 user so this is like a for loop
so pretty much is saying okay user and
users right so it's gonna print it out
it uses the same thing curly brackets
you know of angular it uses directives
that it took from angular and I'm like I
thought we was over with angular like am
I the only one who thought that we was
done with like angular stuff like you
know am I the only one that feels like
like that like once we we got react it's
like okay that's like getting clean
water for the first time you're not
gonna go back to that dirty well you
know from Africa with the little kid
with full of parasites you're
not gonna drink water from there right
so why do how are we going back to this
type of coding this type of framework
like why because the people from laravel
decided that they want to support view
j/s and that people now want to follow
the trends link like they always do like
I don't understand why would I want to
spend more time learning view j/s like
this literally nothing new that's worth
mentioning at all
there's nothing new
everything else like okay for us who've
been developing for you know as far as
front end for the past you know five six
years I don't know if you remember two
three years ago angular was hot and
angular was pretty much this you know
you put all your your code in the HTML
tag
okay people moved on from that and
figure out you know hey the way of react
and JSX is better and yes you could do
JSX
and vue.js or even do the that view
files whatever and use webpack but i
don't know why but I still feel like hey
it's like we're going back into time
like you know if I were if I want to do
something like this like why would I
choose view j/s like this
ember there's you know this angular one
there's was it the back of about
I forgot the other one the original but
something break back or some like
that I don't know I don't remember but
there's like so many frameworks
you okay you got knockout you got all
this other frame was just for templating
like why would I want to come back to
view J yes man like I don't understand
you know I don't understand why why even
create a framework that is pretty much
the same that other frameworks have
like it's not bringing anything new to
the table like I don't even know what
more to say because I will say hey try
it out try it out yourself play around
with it but to be honest with you if you
already know react or you already know
angular there's no need for you to pick
up view at all it's not bringing
anything new it's more of a framework
that's a copy of two good frameworks so
what did they just copy the best parts
of it and put it into one but now it's
like why would I wanna learn
view if I already know angular are
already not react
like if I want to use something for
angular user for angular if now I just
used to react why would I want to use
something that has both of them I don't
know that's just my way of thinking I
don't think it's it's definitely worth
you even pick an odd one I'll try to
learn it like I don't know like I'm just
being honest I guess cool is reactive
but I'm telling you it's like if you
already know react or angular don't
waste your time on this man like I'm
being honest like people are gonna say
oh that's too negative about you know
learning new new programming languages
any new frameworks no I like learning
new frameworks I already learned a few
GS and I put in five hours and probably
yeah I could put in more hours into it
well I I already know what to doing it
like I could come in and create a
component if I want to and like you know
even use the router I already know
everything that I need to know from this
framework to be productive so I could
actually give me a pretty quick honest
review about it
so but what I've recommended for
somebody not really if you look at the
documentation it's pretty cool I like I
like the documentation is pretty pretty
simple to pick up like that's one thing
that I was saying it's super simple to
pick up and I think for a beginner and
maybe instead of learning angular like
somebody who's brand-new I would say hey
learn view Jas and then after view js9
react because it's so much easier just
for you to get your you know your feet
wet with the framework but as a you know
a developer who knows already reacting
angular there's no need to waste time
with this thang plus at the same time
it's not a popular framework I don't
like most companies start hiring you
tell them few GS and they're gonna look
at you like like you're crazy
they're gonna be like hey this is not
testing there's me by some Chinese guy
by himself why would we invest into that
when we have Facebook and Google putting
into reacting and you know
angular right that's how you know that's
how the employer is gonna be or your CTO
is gonna be so I don't know it's up to
you guys but me personally I would say
hey there's no need for you tonight
react all right well now react sorry
about that UJ s I don't all right guys
you already know make sure you subscribe
and and you know give me a like give me
a dislike I don't care I just need some
love man show me some love will show me
some hate whatever you want to do in the
comments I answer every single comment
the only youtuber out here that does
tutorials and talk about you know web
development that actually answers every
single comment so make sure you leave a
comment Wow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
