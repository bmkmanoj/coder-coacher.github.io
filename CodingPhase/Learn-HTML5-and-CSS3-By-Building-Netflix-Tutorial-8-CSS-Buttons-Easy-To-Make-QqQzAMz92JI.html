phrase man the Netflix project man this
just for you guys
you know learn a little bit HTML CSS man
you already know it's your boy I sure
you know what we're gonna start with the
buttons man buttons are super important
because that's the call to action for
people you know they see a button and
then they we just want to click it you
know whatever you want to get to the
next page that you want to start the app
where you want to start a video you need
a button because people are used to
seeing a button and then they click it
and then whatever they get to the next
page or starts pretty much all right so
let's start with this thing okay so we
named this thing button one right so
this is gonna be the first one and let's
name this one by epsilon and button now
let's go here to the CSS and work with
it right so we want this thing to
display next to each other so the way to
do that is basically by doing
display:inline-block alright so I'm
gonna teach you okay now about padding
right padding on the button so on
to give you that little box like let's
say you're gonna have the text inside of
it you need a space around it so you see
maybe you have like 15 pixels up and
then 20 pixels to the right and left
okay so we're gonna do this let's say
200 pixels and then 20 pixels right in
left 12 pixels top and bottom 20 pixels
right in left right
se and then they put a background
background of let's say black
zero zero zero is black and FFF is white
just in case alright now let's do color
why see now we got a button also to make
sure that people know that you gotta
click it we have to change the cursor
the curse is this little thing that's
you know the pointer that's going around
you know when you see this you go like
that you know that you highlight when
you come here and you go over things and
you see the little head that means you
wanna click on it and that's like a boy
well that's the link so people are used
to that so for you to change this from
being something that you could highlight
you pretty much change the cursor right
you come here and you say cursor oh yeah
pretty much Spain now now people know
it's a bunny you know what I mean now
they know ok if I click here it's gonna
take me somewhere right now we don't
have it as a link for the moment but we
will delay it a little bit now let's say
for Ubuntu let's just copy this what
into we're gonna do the opposite we're
gonna remove the background but we're
going to put a border we're gonna say
border two pixels solid and then black
oops
what a fine day though now you see sizes
are not the same so what we want to do
if you're gonna say okay let's bring
this down you could do that bring it
down like that and they'll both be the
same size so you know the two pictures
that you add it you just subtract it you
say okay pretty much now they both have
it you know what I mean
now let's make margin you know to give
some space between this thing so let's
put it matter of fact on the paragraph
let's see margin zero top zero right but
50 pixels on bottom zero to the left no
yeah you see the difference now the page
is actually guess you know it's getting
summary you started to look a little
slow like sorry man you know what I mean
creating buttons you know fixing it up
you know what I mean starting to look
like sigh you know what I mean all right
so anyways that's how you create a
button man
all right I'm gonna see you around make
sure you subscribe and stop playing man
subscribe trust me this thing is gonna
look amazing
trust me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
