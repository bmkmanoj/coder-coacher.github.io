that you're about to see now just make
sure that you subscribe and click on the
little bell because that's the only way
to get notifications did you know Matt
you see on you to promote travel but
don't really tell you 100% of truthful
about what they do there could be some
in drugs yeah I mean now people there's
a thing there's a a big scheme you know
I'm asking the teachers or nomads of
YouTube I'm putting this gonna be the
section where we are mask digital nomads
there's a lot of digital nomads
out there that are poppy and mommy's
kids meaning like hey little Sean and
got a freaking trash fine and every
month you know it's like he got a
$400,000 trust fund and every month he
get you know eight hundred nine hundred
dollars per month back you gotta say and
he gets a little money extra on the side
and if things go bad mommy says hey
little Sean are you okay are you in
Thailand right now here's some money for
you little Sean right so let's unmask it
right taking off the mask for for the
fake that you don't know Matt's guys who
be faking it hard right so what happens
is I don't know if you heard of that
term which says fake it till you make it
this happens a lot with digital nomads
on YouTube they talk about hey man I've
got an amazing course on how to travel
the world how to travel for free how to
make money from blogs you look at their
Alexa nobody visits their website they
barely get any traffic which doesn't
make sense cuz it's like if you're
traveling to work you need you need to
be making money but it's like now they
don't make money some people they just
ski me right so they fake it till they
make it right they end up with 50,000
subscribers they end up where a hundred
thousand subscribers so now money is
coming in now they got our audience but
in the beginning they faked it right it
took them
whole time to fake it until they made it
you gotta say and even for youtubers or
what developers out here there's guys
who just they pay for or you know they
pay for subscribers
you know people pay for advertising on
Facebook they pay for a whole bunch of
stuff and like let's say they go to
India right India Philippines even
Dominican Republic and get a whole bunch
of subscribers from there that is super
cheap to get those subscribers to get an
American subscribe cause a lot of money
but to get a subscriber from those
countries are you know up incoming
countries third world countries whatever
you want to call them right they
basically are very cheap right you pay
for the advertising is it costs almost
nothing right so I might come in I might
be a legit developer out here right or a
legit did you don't know man but I only
have a thousand five hundred subscribers
right
little Johnny from the side has a
hundred thousand subscribers so now an
American sees that and says oh man the
guy that has a hundred thousand
subscribers
he's the legit one but what they don't
know is that people bought those
subscribers right people bought those
views so now they faked it until they
made it was they faked it right and
again 200,000 subscribers three hundred
thousand subscribers now those extra two
hundred three hundred thousand
subscribers on top of their fake a
hundred thousand subscribers three
hundred thousand dollars 300,000 square
are legit so those people now give them
money you got I'm saying I don't know if
you understand how it is it's like
people fake it at first and then once
they on and people see like oh this
person has 100 thousand subscribers now
those new subscribers are quality
subscribers so now they really make the
money that they tell people that are you
know that they're like oh I'm traveling
for the world for fries again now you
bring for from the YouTube ads and now
you're paying for it from the traffic
but at first he faked it he wasn't
getting no money
you wasn't popping out here you got on
saying so that's what happens right guys
