everything today we are here chillin
kids web developers lunch break are back
I know you missed me stop acting like I
ain't miss me yo one day I don't do a
video y'all be like sending me emails
like Joe are you okay last video we
heard you something suicidal I'm like
what unless it was people get tired of
coding I say I'm about to kill my son
as it was there was a couple of snakes
and we have to cut the grass right
that's what I said my life is good don't
worry about me I'm chilling people start
going like oh my god it's it's Joe okay
- did he jump off the bridge today we
haven't heard from him
what is he him a web developer lunch
break that he going to work
then he get fired they like so much
man calm down
I was just lazy yesterday that's it
nothing happened to your boy your boy
still here I'm still here saucony
killing them killing it with the H&amp;amp;M
shirt real quick
goddamn hmm young you buy a
shirt hmm the start fading quick
that cheap man
but yeah man let's go with you guys man
what's up
coding fees.com
got buddy out here what's good buddy you
okay buddy you chillin be careful
crossing the street buddy I'll be out
here with people man
what is my advice to become a full-stack
developer doing JavaScript well right
now I will say check out the course that
your boy got your boy cold steel is on
my description if you want to check that
out now if you want to be on the edge of
technology you want to get the latest
and greatest and you want to be able to
find a job quick this is new course that
Steven Grider came out with I'm doing a
review on it right now I'm going through
it I'm gonna see how good it is so he
just released it I didn't want to say it
here and be like Oh guys check out cold
Steel's course I gotta check it out I
gotta test it out myself see if it's
good no even though I know everything he
drops is good but leaves I want to go
through it before I even recommend it to
one of you guys right cuz there's a
radio you know cold Steel's course is
already great it's amazing it's an
amazing course you get a lot of a lot of
content for ten dollars but coal steel
is not stiff and Grider cold steel will
give you like the basics of the basics
and get you up and running but if you're
like somebody who already have some type
of knowledge of web development there's
this new course by Steven Grider who I
think it's one of the best cold Steel's
also one of the best out here but Steven
Grider when it comes to so JavaScript
left he's the man he got this on
lock you know I'm trying to catch up but
my course is also good too
my course is strictly for beginners
all right I see you left I hope you went
through through my links man and gave me
a low side that's cool
yeah knowled was react best of course
but one thing that I will tell people is
if you have no knowledge of react don't
buy it because you is better for you to
go through modern react with redux first
and then jumped it up
yeah man
make sure you go through the links mall
through your boy through your boy dollar
if your boy a dollar for Lane you know
what it is it's hot it's hot up in his
bitch now it's fine man if you didn't
use the language school school school
but the people that are watching this
video that ya gonna go check it out make
sure you go through the links in the
description and then find the course
stephen gratis killing it man he's doing
his thing you know I wish I could do
what he does just stay home and create
amazing courses and just do that
24/7 he's like right now
I did yesterday three new videos I'm
like man if I could just stay home all
day work on it I would have been done
with a bunch of courses by then but yeah
man
he's definitely connect killing it right
now than attending courses personally J
because you know a lot of people talk
about the mean stack the mean stack this
means like that but the mean stack is
pretty much over like people are not
 with angular like that like
angular one like yeah you might use it
once in a blue moon if you're doing like
your editing like somebody else's code
that create an application to three
years ago then yeah you're gonna have to
know the mean stack but right now it's
all about react man it's that myrn word
Mongo Express yak no Jesus good ol
murder
I wouldn't say by all the courses from
Stephen Grabill not all of them I'll be
honest with you guys this one I do not
like with just I think it's the MongoDB
course that was boring as hell
MongoDB is not that hard to learn and
that course was extremely boring so I
know for you guys you guys gonna lose
interest in that course now if you want
to go adventurous and you want to try
certain you also to check out the react
native course the react native and the
advanced react native those two courses
are a legit I could come in but I yell
those are the courses that made me into
a I've developer yeah because
without Steven Grider I wouldn't even
 put no time into react native I
only started messing around with it
after I watch this course I was like
okay I'll mess around with it
yet the es6 course is legit the essence
scores in the react course is legit
what is the hardest language to learn to
become a full stack web developer I
would say maybe in between C sharp C or
even Java right to learn like to do full
stack development because their
frameworks are pretty much even the
asp.net is pretty you know
you gotta learn so much that to
me is just not working
especially when you got so many open
source frameworks are legit like
you got Adonis GS for for nodejs then
you have from larva for PHP and then you
have Django for Python then you have
Ruby on Rails laravel for PHP right so
those frameworks are open source and
they're easy to use and they constantly
updating and creating new new cool
man
yeah man I'm not even gonna talk about
you I feel like people people trying to
bait me in to talk about it like I
already know how I feel about it he's a
waste of time it's like right now
the whole thing about everybody was
talking about how fast it was look I
told you guys there's really no point of
 learning it if you already know
angular or you don't react right and if
you're talking about speed look at
 hyper at literally one kilobyte
you know what it is one kilobyte like
that loads up like this it's that
quick
you know what I mean so exactly even
Udacity jumping on the the dick of
 react but that's the thing you
see how late they are like Udacity super
late um team treehouse is beyond me like
those guys are extremely neat like they
teach that's why I go to Univision
because every time somebody comes out
with something you are there's a new way
a new paradigm or a new pattern
to coding like people come in and create
courses on udemy right away all right
but when you're dealing with something
like coke Adam II or I was the
other one team treehouse freak old camp
like they're so behind that is not even
funny it's not even worth it it's not
worth it at all kids what languages do I
know this the language is dying these
are not languages but this is my first
ones I'm going in order the ones that I
learned HTML CSS JavaScript right I will
say I know JavaScript es6 I also know
Ruby I know crystal I know what else
Ruby crystal I know CoffeeScript I know
what's down
that was what else I know PHP I said
Ruby already right so how many did I
write HTML CSS JavaScript es6 PHP Ruby
crystal CoffeeScript
I'm trying to get really comfortable
with typescript so I'm on my way there
what else
C++ boy I haven't done C++ in years so I
might be rusty so that's about nine nine
different ones
oh yes equal and then if we wanted to
say MongoDB with us are those considered
languages I don't know I don't think so
maybe those are skills CSS isn't a
language but it is is not a programming
language it is the language were not a
programming language
word has like yo you set that right
like this that's like the first thing I
said I say go back on the video man if
you own your computer right now you can
actually rewind I said the first thing I
say they're not languages they're not
programming languages but I know HTML
CSS and the first thing that do cycles
like yo hTML is not a language
I just said that exactly like
literally the first thing I said yo word
man that was like somebody sentence I
mean I don't know who it was sent me a
comment like oh my god you was just
talking about a hater love you because
how fast it wasn't how this and that and
I'm like 1/2 I said that
I don't hate you because of how fast it
is and because it's new it's because
it's a copy of two frameworks
that I already known like why am I gonna
waste my time you know what I mean like
why am I gonna waste my time
but then the guy didn't then he goes and
rewinds the video and then he realizes
what I said he's not oh okay I'm sorry
and I'm like yeah bro I never said I was
hang on it you know he's like oh but it
was it hypocritical of you for
saying that hyper app is great because
it's fast I'm like I didn't say that you
guys are saying that you guys are
choosing frameworks because how
fast they are I'm choosing them how
 good they are that's a big
difference I choose a framework
depending on you know what it does for
me you know like when I learn react
I love react because I could do so much
with it I could come in and create apps
I can also come in and and do
you know a whole bunch of in the
front end and then just worry about
JavaScript and even have my HTML inside
of the JavaScript so I don't have to
worry about oh I have my JavaScript here
and then I have I have my templates here
like I'm sorry but to me that is
retarded because if you're working with
HTML if you're working with JavaScript
right and you're coding something from
scratch then let's say you're creating
elements with JavaScript you should have
your elements in JavaScript not
create them in HTML and then somehow
connect them to you know to your
to your JavaScript by doing free buying
this rebound that now I don't need to do
no feedback I go in I created my own
 enemies I can do it in vanilla
JavaScript not a lot of people can
 say that and that's why I
created my course my JavaScript course
guys check it out man
this Pokemon game is late man
I'm telling you guys we creating some
amazing you know and then from
there we're gonna do four validations
with vanilla JavaScript and you know
what's good to know the vanilla
JavaScript is because number one you get
to understand what's going on when you
use the framework and then you get to
appreciate a framework like there's
really no point of somebody going
directly to jQuery because then they
think that's what JavaScript is then
they don't appreciate jQuery for what it
is
jQuery may easy because when you
write something in JavaScript it's
 mad long like you have to write
like ten pages not some pages or ten
cell lines just to write something in
jQuery that you could do in jQuery for
like two lines or one line right but in
regular vanilla JavaScript you have to
do that and code all of that that's
what a framework in the library does for
you a library and a framework what it
does it just saves you that time if you
happen to code
all that or thinking your hand like
I said if you wanted to create a filter
right like how you call it about to hit
my car all right
like let's say you create a filter like
underscore right you use underscores to
use filter now filter is being using in
JavaScript and just regular JavaScript
on all the new modern frameworks and not
monitoring modern browsers right but
when they created that you know back in
the days people will have to loop
through a whole array to find which one
matches to something now because of
underscore underscore said nah don't do
that man just come in take your rate put
it in a dot and put filter and then from
there put a function inside of it and
return only the thing that you want to
get matched with right back in this you
will have to do a loop create like
 there's seven eight lines of
code so that's what the framework does
for you it just saves you that time but
if you don't know JavaScript and you
don't know how long it takes to write in
vanilla JavaScript you don't appreciate
a framework you don't appreciate jQuery
you don't appreciate an angular or react
or even view or any of this other
that's out there what I mean like you
gotta learn the basics for you to
actually understand inclined or shape
so any ideas or projects to build was
reacted the same projects that I told
you guys from the beginning for your
restaurant what real estate to our
 digital agency the way ecommerce
website and then just transfer
everything to react and then now that
you've got all that stuff in HTML CSS
definitely and react and they'll say
well if that practice you gotta be good
barbra without mine let's go Barbara
how's everything man
I'm bringing all of that next the next
thing that I'm gonna do is this no man
this is a it's hard that's what some
people like you know check out the
course is a half below right
my website is you're getting courses and
you're getting videos every single day
brand-new was right but the same time
you got understand I'm building them
right now if you're like really in a
rush and you're like young
I need this right now right go
ahead
this course is right there on my
description that's the es6 way for
steven Grider this the cold steel this
modern reactive redux by steven rider -
that's the PHP my sequel you know
there's a couple of courses there if you
need something right now right now let's
say you finish cold steel's course right
a lot of people finished those courses
and then they come to me and be like Joe
what project that I do I do now what
what do I do now do to practice or to
get better come back to my website if
you haven't bought a subscription or you
haven't put a course come back to my
website by the course that you want to
practice with that's it right now for
the people that are starting from
scratch and they want to you know get
something now they want to learn from
somebody's gonna teach them the easiest
way
check out my website right now for you
Zachary because right now I don't have
no react course I'm gonna create it
right but at this moment I would say hey
to not waste your time on waiting on me
to finish my course I would say hey just
check out the model or react with Redux
that's on my description now say you
can't go wrong
nyan what else what up what up what I
would I would I would up
yeah man so that's my advice to you guys
for you guys that want to get into this
web development game man yeah nah don't
worry man keep keep doing the cold steel
man I'll tell people this all the time
guys I'm not here trying to
trying to milk you guys that's not
that's not my idea of coming here and
start milking people my idea of this is
to teach you guys right
you could either come for me learn it
for me you could learn it from Steven
Grider you can learn it from whoever you
can learn it from whoever even here on
YouTube you could check out traversing
media he got some cool cool videos doll
free and he also has some cool videos
that are are paid he got his own courses
right so it's up to you and you choose
who you want to learn with and at the
same time you don't have to learn from
just one person you can learn for
multiple people because a lot of times
it's like you have no idea for type of
projects to do it right so it's good to
say hey today I'm doing a project with
Joe right like let's take the the
JavaScript pokemon game right you're
gonna learn a lot like as far as
vanilla JavaScript like you're gonna
learn a lot right now
then from there you're like okay cool I
just finished this Joe still working on
some other on another course before
while he's doing that I could go in and
go and do something else with Steve
and Grider's course you know I mean I
just you want to keep yourself busy guys
this is gonna take you some some time to
become a developer right some people are
lucky to find it in two three months
that's not the reality the reality is it
takes time I'm not talking about years
I'm talking about at the maximum a year
at the maximum and that's depending how
much hours you put in if you put in a
lot of hours then you're gonna get as
soon as possible if you put in just two
hours
week you better expect that at the
end of the year you're gonna become a
web developer but if you come in and you
do it like eight hours on the weekends
then you can expect that you might take
six months if you do it every single day
to three hours then that's different
that you you're gonna get it done in
like four months now if you're a beast
and you're like yo I'm living at home
with my mom's or I'm I got wife you
taking care of me like you know someone
some guys are lucky like that they have
their wifey you know taking care of them
you know wife he's working and you home
with the kids
man bus your eyes or even for the girls
your husband is working and you home
with the kids cool bus your ass and and
learn something why are you home you
know
yeah man doesn't same exact like I feel
like I got a different sauce man I'm
bringing something different I'm
bringing a more realistic approach to
courses and I think a lot of people
gonna get a lot of good out of it
because the problem is that sometimes
you take a course and you see everything
is perfect meaning the guy doesn't do a
lot of research on on the
JavaScript references or the guy doesn't
even look up the methods and you're like
man how the he does it how the
he knows so much and it's like his whole
project is already done on the other
screen that you're not seeing right so
in your head you're thinking oh this guy
so much better than me and it's like nah
man is just he already finished the
project me I don't do it like that I
don't I don't come in and and and pre
record the pre do the projects I do the
project wait for you so we both go in
when we get stuck on something we both
find it and then that teaches you how to
do it because that's how you're gonna
learn nobody's gonna be holding your
hand and be like oh here's the finished
project none they're gonna teach you and
they're gonna be like yo where's the
project you gonna be like okay I gotta
look through Mozilla so
documentation on JavaScript and like
there's so much that you could do
come on I mean so that's how I'm
teaching people I'm not I'm not giving
you a full finished project and I'm just
copying and pasting no I'm doing it with
you and actually teaching you how to
find ass
yeah man
 crazy
yeah
here live the turkey man out here live
with your boy
Gill's man got your boy out here say
without people they live right now but
no he's just chillin right out without
working I bought juice already not yet
so so so so get back in the gym got a
couple of dots or computer function yeah
we just it now all of them but
you know we just it say what up
to to the turkey man you didn't take
scare me everyday
alright I will see you later
I gotta go wash my car today
focus charge kids got eating up my
battery yo so who is annoying you
Barbara
a little local barrio was soaking
who was so negative trying to go back
into
listen man every time somebody tells me
Oh jobs are being outsourced this isn't
that all right I don't believe in that
 that's like the boogeyman that's
like the boogeyman they tell you oh man
the boogeyman is gonna come out that
 doesn't exist only thing that
people are losing jobs to is in China
but that's like if urine if you're
actually building things like you know
building products like you're building
phones or building whatever any type of
materials that are being built
everybody's losing their jobs well
that's not new news
I said everybody all of you guys know
that but when it comes to web
development man there's a bunch of jobs
on it's like you never think about it
somebody told me to like oh man
everybody's jumping to web development
and I'm like yeah everybody's jumping to
it but do you know how many
people are actually doing it not that
many it's like look right now not to
diss anybody none of my subscribers but
let's think about it who out of all I
have like 7,000 people out a little
7,000 people who do you always see here
on the chat room who do you always see
here talking about all they doing
projects right it's less than 15
people here all right less than 15
people that are always working but you
got mad you got 84 you're not a couple
of people there that are constantly
working and learning new right well
there's 7000 subscribers
so you telling me out of 7,000 only
probably like walling 300-400 are are
constantly doing projects I mean better
example there's a better example to give
you the numbers alright I got about 800
people that signed up for my website
right out of those 800 people about 300
having started not even one project and
I love you guys the guys that signed up
and you haven't even started a project I
love you guys one day you will start a
project right but at the same time this
tells people and tells you guys like hey
not everybody that's gonna start is
gonna finish it a lot of people is gonna
try it and they're not gonna finish it
and that's how it is when it comes to
web development or programming in
general yes a million people are gonna
 get in but none of them are not
none of them but the majority will
finish learning how to become a web
developer and then even less than that
less than the ones that actually finish
only half of them are actually gonna go
for jobs because a lot of people be
scared they'd be like oh I'm not ready
oh I don't know enough so they stay home
still trying to study and still trying
to learn without going for a job
interview so for you the person that's
working hard that's busting your ass and
doing the projects when you go to
interview you prepared you know
what I mean so there's a job for you out
there
so Barbara don't listen to nobody trust
me I'm telling you ahead of time you
good
if you want to get into the you're
gonna be good
alright guys I'm out of here I gave you
guys watch give you guys 40 minutes Stan
man there goes my lunch break man I keep
doing this I keep giving my yo man
everybody make sure you check out of
this Court
all right guys let's add the description
it should be at the description the disc
or link if you want to become a web
developer check out the courses there
man become a developer man don't be a
quitter don't give up trust me you're
gonna be like so thankful when you
become a developer you see your knife
I'm tellin ya right now so lot of money
in this game a lot of money in this game
and you can actually become on you know
somebody with a career damn I almost
thought I thought I almost lock myself
out the car oh but car alright guys I'll
