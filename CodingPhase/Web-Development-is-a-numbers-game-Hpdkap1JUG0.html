back at it again man I had to do this
astray on the fold you know just because
I want to keep you guys updated man over
everything that's going on and like
every day we want to give you a new
concept right
so yeah what's up did somebody you know
on my Instagram and basically I was just
giving her some pointers on on you know
how long does it take to actually become
a developer like this is actually just a
numbers game people like this is not
something that you're gonna you know
you're gonna be able to do this in one
hour two hours a day it doesn't work
like that guys you know it's like even
if you want to a boot camp boot camp is
those guys they're doing nine to ten
hours right which basically you could do
that on yourself in your house you know
what I mean like instead of you paying
for a boot camp but like I said it's
just a numbers game you know if you put
it to three hours a day that's not gonna
really do much you gotta put in you know
for one month the world move through
that challenge if you if you could
actually stay home or you know you're
just a college student over here like
through high school or whatever try to
do eight hours in one day you know eight
hours a day that's like 40 hours a week
do that for a month you know what I
mean do that for a month and you're
gonna see you're gonna get everything
right away
and I would love you're gonna be glory
vesting a lot of people
because most people just they just do
this like once in a blue moon like they
think they gotta become what developers
think come on guys I cannot understand
it's a numbers game if you don't put in
those hours you're not gonna be able to
be ready as soon as you want you know it
takes time you know I was like before I
got a job
it took me about like you know I was
ready probably at the 3-4 months Clark
but I'm not telling you a goal so you
don't start applying for jobs until like
I think like a year more because I was
insecure at the moment I was like you
know what man I'm not ready I don't know
the terminology it's like I know how to
build websites but I don't know what the
hell they're gonna ask me I thought that
was gonna be asking me a whole bunch of
algorithms there are a whole bunch of
 which I didn't have no background
in computer science I was like man I'm
coming from a design degree how the hell
am I gonna be able to you know pass a
test because you think oh they doing
this at Google they doing this I'm
whatever Facebook they make you write a
whole bunch of algorithms but listen 99%
of these jobs out here they don't last
you for no algorithms they're
like hey can you build a website can you
deal with databases can you deal with
JavaScript that's what they care about
they're not looking for like a can this
person do algorithms thing nobody cares
about that trust me guys
like for junior developer nobody's gonna
be asking you that now it's different
everyone for a software developer so for
engineer that's different they looking
for more than just somebody who makes
websites you know but for what
development is different once you see
that on a job title web developer they
looking for somebody that knows the web
HTML CSS and JavaScript and some my
sequel and probably PHP that's what they
care about it you know what I mean so
for you guys all you have to do is just
put in that work man don't slack don't
just be like hey I'm gonna do one hour
today and an hour tomorrow in the
weekend I'm gonna to three hours nah man
do eight hours through six to eight
hours a day right so if you come from
work or from where where you come from
at five o'clock right you got five let's
say far to eleven five to eleven every
day for a month you know every single
day maybe take off all the weekends but
do Monday to Friday five o'clock to
eleven o'clock at night of just what
development
and I just doing little to do a
slur doing tutorials on YouTube
bail for websites meaning
final design online copy that made it
into HTML CSS and then from there make
some interaction with JavaScript jQuery
whatever you want to use react angular
voj s whatever you decide to use but you
have to put in that work guys don't
think this is gonna come in easy
it's not gonna be easy like you know you
might see me getting you don't get money
if I see the next person getting money
my see those developers that's making a
$100,000 plus those guys they've been
doing this for like almost ten years and
there's people out there who are
developers that they don't even touch
seventy thousand dollars like they've
never they've been working for ten years
in the industry and they don't even know
what $70,000 tastes like they don't even
know what that tastes like you know what
I mean
and that's because number one it could
be the city that I work in number two it
could be the type of work that they put
in there's people that like let's say an
example right now if I'm a developer and
somehow I got a job after college and I
stated this company and all they work on
is Perl something like Perl and my
sequel so I never kept up with what's
happening in JavaScript I never kept up
with you know the new frameworks of PHP
or nor Jas or whatever frameworks out
there and I stood in that company for 10
years and I'm still earning fifty sixty
thousand dollars
that's your fault because you didn't put
in that work you didn't put in those
hours all you did was like you was
complacent
he was a hey I got a job and I'm not
gonna put in the work after work yeah
I'm not gonna put any no no extra hours
after work a lot of people do that you
know me like right now imma go home I
will spend an hour on Golan and that's
because I already put in you know five
six hours every single day working on
stuff tell us I work in the industry
already so you can't compare yourself to
me because I work in an industry I've
been doing this already for five years
it's gonna be five years now and in July
so
you can't compare yourself to me because
I've been known as for man long so it's
like I already picked the four five six
seven eight nine ten hours a day time
type of days you know what I mean like I
did those already so now I already got
all the basic concepts of programming
and web development and I can learn any
language that I want and all I have to
do is just put in an hour to any and
then I'm gonna you know I'm gonna
learning but for you guys that just
started come on guys get up there man
put in that work and stop playing with
yourself and understand that you know if
you if you want to take this thing
serious man like you know I already told
you I already told you guys I already
told you exactly what you got to learn
man I told you what course is really
work because you got to think about it
like this man I already went through it
and I'm teaching you guys what to do and
where to get the resources you know the
resources that really work is going to
give you the skills that you need
so it's like they right there in the
description there's a courses that help
me just freaking take it man it's
frickin $10
stop playing yourself man we're writing
right now that I $10 each you could buy
all 500 of the five courses for 50 bucks
man and just keep it moving man
just keep it moving just take your
courses learn PHP I will say learn PHP
first before you even try to learn
anything else learn the PHP and my
sequel because listen when I went to a
job interview there was so much
that I did not know man there was so
much things that I do not know about
databases and in the backend it's like
if you don't know the backend like how
the hell are you gonna do a post request
how are you gonna do Ajax like it
doesn't make sense you know what I mean
plus they're gonna ask you questions
that if you know the backend first
you're gonna be ready you know like most
companies they need more back-end guys
than front-end guys think about it like
that there's a whole bunch of designers
who you know over a weekend decided to
start learning HTML CSS and now they're
calling themselves front-end developers
they come in with a nice design and
pretty much state what they do is they
learn inside of the job because that's
what everybody does they learn this out
of the job you know they act like oh I
know everything I know this dis and this
but then in reality they learn it while
they're at the job but for you guys if
you guys want to be more prepared than
those guys paint know the backend man
alright so you already lost your boy job
back at it again man Coenen face.com
I'm out here had to do this through the
phone already have my camera I didn't
have my my professional like um
yeah man like this hard do it she a boy
joke back at it again bow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
