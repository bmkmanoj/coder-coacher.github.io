all right guys listen you guys already
know me I know how I do man once every
week once every two weeks you know start
getting burnt out you know because not
only do I come here to you to talk about
code I help other people's you know work
their own code and then on top of that I
got a do you know eight to nine hours I
work of just coding and like the past
week well the past few days it has been
like very complex JavaScript that I've
been dealing with and oh my god is like
so annoying it really burns you out man
like you know you guys are lucky that
you guys are in a stage where you guys
do like you know little simple projects
you know and you're like oh yeah this
this is cool you know what development
is cooling and you're like oh yeah I'm
just gonna work on this and I'm gonna
switch my career and everything is gonna
be lovely the money is gonna be great
but at the same time guys like this
could get complicated this thing once
you work for a large company it could be
a really complex and you got to think
about it as I imagine this it's like
somebody giving you ten thousand pieces
10,000 piece puzzle right and
then they're like oh yeah here try to
figure it out every day every single day
you gotta come in come into work and
figure out 10,000 piece or
puzzling and it's like oh man
sometimes you just get tired you know
you start getting burned out you start
feeling a certain way you're like oh man
is this really the right wait for me the
right route
okay it just gets crazy so yeah man
that's where I'm at right now
 Park this car back in my turkey
spot lunch break you're ready muster
lunch break chronicles I know a lot of
people's like what the hell man this guy
again talking what he drives
oh yeah man that's what I do but like I
said guys it just gets complicated you
know it's not like that it's super hard
it's just really annoying because this
every day you got to come in and figure
out something that's complicated
and you're like oh man it's like I know
this is what I signed up for this why
I'm getting the big bucks but at the
same time it's like can I just get
like one simple day of just like
building a regular HTML CSS page you
know whoo and then on top of that I
didn't get no sleep last night because
I'm over here working on my own personal
project you know doing the coding phase
dot-com website which I haven't touched
in like almost a week and everybody
keeps leaving me messages like hey man
where's coding phase com coming up when
it's coming out and it's like oh
man I still haven't finished it it
hard it's like I want to do tutorials
and I want to do the website you know so
I really wish man if I could do this
 full-time man that would be the
dream just to be able to help people out
and get to build coding phase calm how I
want it to be full-time it'll be a dream
you know so that's why I tell you guys
man help help me out you know if you
guys know laravel if you guys know a
very good decent amount of HTML CSS you
don't even have to know that much
JavaScript if you want to be part of
this project man and help me out build
this website let me know man
there's a lot of pages that need to get
done so you know I might tell Matt to
holla at me so we could build this this
page I think he's pretty
I think Matt I'm surprised you know like
I always see him here and in the chat
room I would see him on the comments and
I was like surprised you know the last
project that he did and I was an
ocean-like he's really good he knows
already what to do you know and it's
cool that he's also helping out other
you know other mentees you know so
that's pretty cool and also I might have
him you know help me out and you know
probably throw him some money on you
know his pocket real quick cuz I do need
the extra help man I need somebody else
to help me out and build this you
know I know this website is gonna make a
lot of money in the long run from
advertising so you you know whoever
helps me out I'm definitely gonna
remember you guys and when profits start
coming in out throw something at you for
sure but yeah man I'm gonna see maybe
I'll talk to Matt later on tonight see
if he he's with it see if he wants to
help our in we build this together and
you know let's just make some money you
know
yes
community be able to serve the community
like 100% like working a full-time job
look for a hour a week or two hours a
week and I'm seeing that there's there's
a need for that in the community so I
was thinking about making that part of
coding phase com2 of me finding like
Grilli legit what developers who pretty
much you could pay them whatever amount
an hour whatever they charge an hour to
basically help you out for one hour you
know what I mean but like grilled legit
developer so I was thinking about adding
that as a service for coding phase calm
because I'm seeing it I went to what was
this website I think a block that IO is
like a online boot camp but they charge
people like 2000 even nanodegrees from
with a Coursera or whatever or wasn't
you to me you know so I think yeah I
think was a commenter dial has something
like that and I still think that's a lot
of money that's way too much that's way
too much money for somebody to come in
and mentor you for an hour I think
that's way too much I think I hon drah
dollars an hour is is a pretty good or
even less than that
you know like 75 65 75 dollars an hour
I think they'll be fine
and also that's what I think you know
because it's just people are paying way
too much for this they charge 200 a
month right so then if the guy meets
with you once a week so that's $50 okay
that's not bad
$50 an hour that's not that bad you know
so I think that's not that bad but yeah
yeah like you know like Matt said guys
look all my on my description or you
could go to coding phase comm /resources
there's the courses that I recommend
that you know made me into a developer
right now you have it in my description
my video description too so I think by
the 28th 29:28 they gonna cancel the
last you know $10 courses so what
they're gonna be doing is it's charging
people by different prices depending on
where they live and depending if they
ever bought courses before so for you
guys that actually have bought courses
before I will recommend to buy a course
now for $10 because I think the meant
the the minimum that they're gonna do it
is gonna be like 15 or 20 bucks every
month for now on so I think that's like
the last chance to get any courses for
$10 I already bought for courses that I
wanted so I'm good I'm good for the next
six months of all the courses that I
really want you know so I'm good I'm
good man but for you guys like take
advantage man $10 man with 30 bucks you
know you buy three courses you're good
for literally like three three to four
months you're gonna be good so yeah
you know George I know man you know I
know a lot of people tell me they want
to help out with the website and they
wanna you know they want to be part of
this and like I said guys there's a lot
of things that you guys can help out
like you know you could go into the code
it's right down on my github you go to
github.com slash slash on j SG j a y SG
and you search the one that says coding
face comm go in there man and just
create the about page or create the
privacy page or create whatever page you
want to create
go ahead create it send it to me and I
will include it into it and now you're
part of the community now you're a
contributor you know what I mean so take
the time do your thing and also to have
this under your belt will you be like
hell oh yeah I used to work for coding
phase dark karma I was part of the
contributors thing you know cuz this
thing is gonna be bigger than what you
think guys like I'm not a bullshitter
like I'm the type of person when I set
my mind for saying I just go in and get
it done like I already set my mind that
I'm gonna make this thing into a
business and I'm already writing down
the business model already know exactly
how I'm gonna uh basically make money
from advertising I already know that I
don't want to charge a membership to
people because people hate that they
hate when they go to a page and they're
like oh man I gotta pay five dollars ten
dollars a month like I don't want to do
that to people so what I'm gonna do
is there's gonna be advertising and
whoever doesn't want to see the
advertising then you pay five dollars to
not see any advertising plus you know
you'll get like you know you got a
sticker you got a hook a hoodie or
something something that you know you're
part of the community and you're helping
out the coding phase com2 get bigger you
know so but for everybody else here man
like I'm telling you guys like this is
gonna be huge
because I saw I saw when the Creator
freako camp came out right I remember
when it was like you know like 10
projects not even 10 projects 10 10
small Co projects that he had and I saw
how then and it that really doesn't make
any money out of it he makes money from
donations and stuff like that but he
doesn't have for a business model behind
it and that's where I come in
like I know how to make money out here
like I know how to flip those people
that make fifty thousand a hundred
thousand subscribers so it's like once I
get to that point like I already told
you guys from the beginning what's the
goal here and the goal is not for me to
be like hey I want to become a
millionaire no the goal is to be like
hey how can we start giving our free
MacBooks how can we start giving out all
free hosting like how can we make things
that are expensive for some people like
you know if you live in a um you
know South America you live in Asia
somewhere you live somewhere in Africa
it's hard for you to be like oh I'm
gonna pay $10 a month for hosting how
can we make that cheap how can we
make that $2 how can we make it for
free and yeah this there's a Heroku this
github this a whole bunch of other
places but I know there's other ways
that we could help people out because
this is where technology is going to
take people to the future like you know
so we just got to help each other out
that's my goal my goal is not to come
here but like hey I'm gonna make I'm
gonna come in here and be the
next tire crew with the tire
cruise or whatever tire Lopes I'm not
trying to be no tire Lopes I'm
trying to just come in here and just
help people out and I know there's
better ways to help people out then to
just be like hey here's you know here's
a hundred dollars in your pocket a
hundred dollars in your pocket is not
going to help you out you know in the
long term I'd rather teach you something
that's gonna be able you
to be able to get a job you're going to
be able to make a career out of it so
that's how I want to help people out you
know
yeah ma'am
yo send me some music son I actually do
need some music man I definitely need
some music like I I make my own beats
but I need some music I mean something
else I need another flavor you know okay
so somebody sent me a question nigma TV
that's what's up man I haven't seen you
here in a chatroom so that means we get
more new people that's what's up okay so
Nick my TV says hello : face I have a
question
I know html5 css3 and JavaScript
learning in PHP in my sequel can I get a
job in let's say a year of 19 PHP how
here you could get a job of like as far
as PHP and like three three to four
months like that's for sure because
there's plenty of jobs online right just
to work remotely or even work on on
stuff like on fiber comm or somebody
wants you to edit their website like you
could go and make a good living from
that right now if you want to work in a
company yes there's a lot of companies
that they're gonna look at you and
they're gonna say okay
this guy knows PHP we need somebody for
no js' so we need somebody from Ruby but
this guy he already knows the backend he
already knows how to deal with databases
so they're going to hire you and most
likely train you for a month or two you
know it's not something different like
it's not something that that people
might say like oh you need to know every
technology inside of a job post you
don't need every single one all you need
to know is the concepts it's like okay
this person knows HTML CSS that means
the person knows how to style page now
does this person know a Lobel JavaScript
that means he knows how to interact with
the Dom and basically create different
actions on the page either for slider or
connecting to an API now when you say I
know PHP in my sequel what that tells
somebody is okay this person understands
how um you know the backend works so if
he wants to work on on you know on the
database so we want him to work on the
backend code it could be Ruby it could
be whatever language it is
alright this person is going to be able
to learn it quick because he already has
experience in the backend so yeah
definitely
keep on learning PHP so yeah or you
might just find a place where they need
a wordpress developer and it's like hey
your first year you could spend it
learning on PHP at the job like somebody
might just want you to just play around
with their WordPress and it's like okay
cool now you're getting paid while you
learn you know so yeah go ahead keep
doing your thing yeah man make sure you
like this video man get this video like
man for sure
stop playing give us a little like this
helps out the channel so other people
could watching and you know YouTube
could actually start giving out
notifications to everybody else you know
so
should I get a treehouse membership or
buy udemy course now thus that's a good
question I would say like this
a treehouse membership is cool for the
first month you could try it out I would
say try it out right but you have to
understand treehouse is not going to
teach you how to build the website
treehouse teaches you pieces by pieces
but they don't go and create a website
for you they don't go and create a whole
website with you they don't do that what
they do is teach you little pieces by
you know little pieces so they'll be
like okay here's a Ajax video this is
how you do Ajax but if you know how okay
you learn how to do Ajax but then now
how do you put that into a page how is
it that you're going to implement Ajax
you know so that's just how it is
but a udemy course is gonna teach you
it's like somebody with you teaching you
how they build their website you know so
they'll be like okay we're going to
create a ecommerce website and then
they'll teach you every single thing
that you need to know on how to build
the whole website not just like okay
here's HTML this what HTML tag is it's
like for me I can learn like that like
it's cool but I can't learn like that
because what happens is most of the
people that are on team treehouse what
they do is they be on the forums a lot
they'd be like oh how do you do this how
do you do that how do you um create this
page how do I you know connect the CSS
with this page how do I collect this
JavaScript with this page so now you're
paying $10 for the community you're not
really paying $10 because other videos
cuz you what you could get on coke Adam
EECOM where you get on - on treatment in
treehouse for $10 a month you get it for
free on coke Adam II you know what I
mean so that's the thing now you know me
if you want to
or how to build something from scratch
that's where you gotta go survey that
kill okay kill okay
the lag on YouTube is the worst I know
guys I know it's lagging but you know
YouTube is where is that man it's mostly
the problem is is the internet
connection like I have horizon and for
whatever reason out here in Long Island
the Verizon connection is not that good
and I'm in this parking lot every time I
come to the parking lot there's no
connection yeah man if you're gonna send
me send it to my my email coding face at
gmail.com send me the music man send me
a couple of links of your music and
let's get it poppin and then you just
gotta give me the right to put it on my
videos man you know a year from now
don't go and try to pull my
videos because it has your music on it
you know because that happens to
people all the time like somebody get
some music for free and then they put on
their video and then a year from now
then I okay the videos making is making
money I'm gonna pull it out from YouTube
and then now I lose my youtube video
because I added your song so hopefully
you don't do that to me you know but I
trust you
your boy got that swag do I use Ableton
to make beats no I use fruity loops or
reason do you think you can make money
coding even though I'm just 15 hell yeah
listen start going on Craigslist man if
you live in the United States gold
Craigslist and find people who are
looking for that need a website right
just look at gigs look at gigs and
search website or search HTML and you're
going to see a whole bunch of different
little jobs that people want you know
that I all can somebody make me a
website for $100 you're 15 years old you
don't got a job if somebody gives you
$100 go build the website you're
basically building something that you
want to learn and at the same time
you're getting paid learn oh Christ
how do you position your resume for
front-end development when you don't
have put in the jobs that you've worked
on now of course if you work that
 I think speaks area and looks like
that you're gonna work for the company
that you're gonna work for it the
website has not yeah man yeah udemy
definitely rocks man
you don't means legit it's like I will
not be talking like yeah if legit trust
me you need me change my life
like I'm not even gonna lie to you guys
like I was thinking about the with
my girl the other day I'm like I'm
looking at her I'm looking at all the
stuff that we're buying for the baby
like if I didn't find you to me if I
didn't find this courses that help me
become a great developer and if I didn't
put in the time like I can't imagine
myself being able to afford any other
 at all like that's just being
honest there's no way I couldn't afford
you know 600 $700 baby crib like I
wouldn't be able to afford that
because that would have been 2 weeks of
pay back then it's 2 weeks
what are taking me 2 weeks to get that
money now I'll get that every 2
days you know it's crazy you know when I
think about it my cure how the hell am I
making money now it's like now like even
everything from cotton face everything
from you to me everything from YouTube
everything from all my other websites
that I have to I make money from and
that helped me out to get to where I'm
at all of this stuff is possible because
I know web development you guys will not
be listening to me here if I didn't know
what development you know what I mean so
me going to you to me that changed my
life and it helped me so much like the
first place I went to was team tree
house I was there for one month and I
was like you know what this is cool but
I don't know how to build a page yet and
then I'm like
how can I find somebody that is going to
teach me from you know from zero to a
hundred on how to build the page how to
build a website how to build a back-end
and I was a man I got to go to the
 YouTube I got to go through
every video on YouTube and try to find
the best one and sometimes people they
do half-assed
tutorials or they don't even complete it
or they make one part of the tutorial
once a week and then you're like what
the man but on udemy is like you
have the whole course you have the whole
example and then you learn from that and
I'm like yo if it wasn't because of you
to me I wouldn't be where I'm at you
know so especially for Steven Grider
because all my my jobs that I've gotten
you know highest paid has been thanks to
him because I learned react for him you
know I learned es6 from him so all the
money that really made is thanks to them
yeah man
that's the thing that's why it's like
you get what you pay for you know if you
go and try to get something for free
then that's what you're going to get
you're going to get free quality but if
you go on you pay $10 $15 $20 the most I
will pay $30 like I always say but if
you're paying for it you know somebody
stood there
you know
YouTube is like okay let's see if
somebody's nice and depending on the
people like people keep telling me oh I
should make a course to to you to mean
whatever and I'm like I'm not I know I'm
not ready to make a course on you to me
because I'm not gonna be able to put in
the time like Stephen Ryder like that's
what I've talked to him personally and
that's what he does he stays at home for
like two to three months creating a
course stays in the crib working on the
course only on that one course and then
he releases him and then for the next
three months he goes and answers
people's questions on when they sent him
a message when they stuck like that's
not easy you know what I mean
like I want to be able to do that
so I will I'm not gonna create a course
on udemy
unless I'm a hundred percent dedicated
to it because if I have somebody giving
me money like when you guys come in and
this kid bit coding and everybody in
this other girl Samantha um when they
come in and they give a donation that
makes me like you
I gotta put in the work I gotta
help people out I got a you know bust my
ass and create this videos for YouTube
because these people are putting their
money in their trust in me this
they're not throwing money in
the air like oh yeah I got $10 I gotta
find out his extra let me throw it in
the air no it's because they believe on
what I'm doing and then I okay imma go
to : face that comment Tony so it's like
when they donate is like that makes me
feel a certain weight like yo I gotta
give as much as I can you know even if
I'm tired you know what I mean so that's
why I wanna finish Scarface calm because
you guys deserve it you guys have given
me enough you know enough for me to say
okay people are really want or waiting
on this date they want me to finish this
website so they could get as much as
they can out of it
I'm starting a cake started to get Joe
out of horizon man I swear I think it's
not I don't even think it's revising I
think it's me sitting on this parking
lot I'm gonna try to start doing my
lunch breaks somewhere else because
that's I think that's the issue but yeah
man I'm out of here guys I'm gonna see
you guys later
I gotta eat some food and oh my god and
then at two o'clock I got a meeting with
another company and we gotta do another
meeting for like an hour and a half
talking about deployment or so huh
life is not easy being a
developer trust me you know it's easier
to learn how to code then when you're at
the job trust me guys especially when
you have a lot of responsible
sorry responsibilities all right guys
I'm gonna see you later
you already know guys make sure you go
to the Gator man stop playing around
and also go to the description going by
a course man this is literally the last
month when they do in 10 down of courses
they send me a email already talking
about they're not doing send down the
courses no more they're gonna do $15 $20
and 25% of the original price that's how
the pricing is going to be for you to me
from now on so take advantage guys
there's the last month for $10 courses
and then they just gotta give out
different prices for different people
depending if you're brand new buyer or a
branding user so it's like for us who
have been already buying courses now she
is going to be more expensive now if
you're a brand new user then yeah you
might get a $15.00 course for everybody
else is gonna be $20 $25 $30 and
25% of you know choices are $175 so 25%
of that you
do the math you know what I mean so take
a rest I'm out of here guys in your data
we starting a Kickstarter to get me off
horizon you did that's a joke I'll see
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
