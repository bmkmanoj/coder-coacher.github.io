of the game encoding fees.com your boys
backing out and did it again
gia alright guys so today I have a very
good question from Hakeem Harris he says
Joe do you think Edwin Diaz 33 our PHP
course is too long your course comes out
to about six and a half hours if I'm
adding correctly now first of all I want
to say this I'm basically going to merge
both courses between PHP and laravel and
also slim so there's gonna be like a
complete course on PHP where I'm gonna
come in and give you not only all the
things that you need to know about PHP
but also I want to give you the most
popular frameworks that you're going to
bump into you know in different jobs I
might even throw WordPress in here I'm
still deciding to see how I'm gonna do
it cuz then the course is going to be
extremely massive right I don't know if
I really want to make it super long like
you know 30-something hours 40 hours
long right
it depends all right so let's see how it
goes I'm gonna start off from the first
thing that I'm gonna do is I already did
one project was just a very simple
website you know for those of you that
want to just create a website put it out
there and you know want to learn how to
deal with PHP and how to actually work
with PHP and make your pages a little
bit more dynamic instead of having plain
HTML I just finished that project right
now right there from there we're gonna
do the the lerigot I don't know if
Clarabelle or slim give me to the end of
the day today to figure out which one
I'm gonna choose right now I'm basically
writing down the projects that I'm gonna
create and then what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna do either one in slim first or the
other one with lerigot right so slim is
a it's a framework that is just like
nodejs like express right it's very
bare-bones this just gives you routing
in a little
identification but that's about it then
you have control of everything and then
laravel is a more full-fledged framework
so it's more for a bigger project so I'm
trying to see which project is going to
go for which one right now so continue
with his question where he says hey do
you think 33 our course is too long your
course comes out to six and a half if
I'm mad incorrectly and I'll be honest I
think this course that I'm building
might be like 20-something hours okay
might be like 20-something hours
complete right now one thing that I will
say is something that I wrote to him is
like we have different styles me and
other Indians have different styles
every developer out there has different
styles right everybody does something
different they teach you a different way
me I actually come from the school of
udemy in the sense of I've actually
taken courses from all the best
instructors on udemy I've also worked in
you know companies over the past five
six years right so what I'm doing is
creating a project creating courses for
you guys that I wish I would have had
right because I have the experience as a
self-taught developer and working in the
industry but at the same time I remember
when I was learning these things from
all of those guys to are the best
instructors out there right I learned
from them but at the same time I know
they was taking way too long like this
you know I was like I tell people like
the understanding was a JavaScript
understanding the weird parts that's the
course that I wouldn't recommend to
people to just be like hey just focus on
this course for you know 20 30 hours
straight and then it's like it's too
deep I don't know if you you get what
I'm saying
that course is too deep right for the
things that you need to get a job you
don't need to go that deep into
JavaScript all right and it's the same
thing as this this course that I'm
building right there are certain things
in PHP that a lot instructors
full ink right they start you know
freaking explaining every single little
thing on the language pretty much
reading off the documentation and I try
to stay away from that because as a
self-taught developer my whole goal is
to get a job as soon as possible and
start working start creating projects I
don't want to spend you know 40 hours on
a project like right now let me see
calculator where is it let's do the math
let's say you are somebody who could
only learn three times well two hours
two three hours a day right so forty
divided by three
you know thirteen days right now let's
say you could only do that out of let's
say three days per week so how many
weeks is that you know what I mean like
you're gonna be there like trying to
learn this stuff for months right
for no reason something that you could
have learned it in maybe two weeks to
three weeks learn the syntax stop
wasting time just you know start
building real projects because you don't
learn by following somebody explaining
you things from the documentation you
learn by building things and it keeps
you engaged to actually come back
because if you come in here somebody
comes in and starts giving you an
explanation of everything that's on the
documentation right you go one by one
one by one one by one and you're like
man I'm just this is boring right I
could do this on solo learn dot-com I
could do this on coke Adam e-comm I
could do this on whatever right and fill
in the blanks right I can do it on any
of those websites but what makes a a gun
instructor to me especially when you're
dealing with people who are self-taught
it's different right it's totally
different because number one you got to
keep them engaged number two they want
to build something they want to get that
gratification if you come in and you
spend two three hours you want to see
something happen you don't want to see a
loop and be like okay we count it from
one to twenty that's not really what you
want to do you want to start building
something so you can say okay
I am becoming a developer right I am
building stuff right so you have to have
a process of teaching the people and
also keeping them engaged to continue
learning all right
my my way of teaching is I'm not trying
to teach you every single thing of the
documentation I'm teaching you the
things that you need to get any job
right the things that you need to get a
job once you are more experienced right
there will be situations where you're
going to find like I don't know like
there could be a way I don't know even
right now I can't even think of it but
there could be a function right that I
haven't taught you in PHP right what is
your job as a developer your job as a
developer is to find the answer you
don't need me to come in and read to you
the documentation because once you know
how Auto concepts work in how the
programming language works how you know
you got classes you got functions you
got variables you got objects you got
all of these things once you understand
how all these things work when you are
at the job and they give you something
that's not on the tutorials that you
learned your job is to search it through
the documentation right and you're going
to if I'm a good instructor you're going
to find the answer on your own right
there's one of the main reasons why in
all of my courses I pull up w3 schools I
pull up the documentation I pull up you
know I even do Google searches I know
the answer right but I want to show you
guys how to find the answer right
because the idea is not for me to read
you the documentation but I hey guys my
course is 77 hours long yeah I read you
the documentation a lot of people do
that but how can I get you guys to learn
to find the answers yourself how can I
get you guys to learn the concepts and
be able to continue you know expanding
on that on your own my job is not to
bore
you to death my job is not to keep you
here hey hey guys I'm gonna make sure
that you're here for 172 hours
wait what what's the point of that right
I'd rather have you building projects
right so that's the difference between
me and a lot of instructors out there
you know and I noticed that that's why I
started doing the courses the people
that see me from the beginning even I
myself was like man I don't want to be
milking people I don't want to be doing
this you know courses for people but
then I saw a void right I'm constantly
telling people hey go check out this
other courses from a lot of people like
you know Stephen greider which is great
cold steel which is great you know
there's so many people out there that
have great courses but I know a lot of
people that are here on this channel who
are still doing cold steel course you
know months later people who still don't
you know react from Stephen Rider months
later how can we instead of us come in
and spend so much time on following a
course how can i as a self-taught
developer who also knows this thing how
can I break it down for people for them
to learn and then continue building
projects I don't want people to stay on
my course on one of my courses staying
there for you know 72 hours and but I
hate I got the longest course on PHP I
got the longest course on on this this
and that the idea is not for you to
spend time with me the idea is for you
to start building things on your own I
don't want you to spend you know 90,000
hours on my website you're supposed to
come in here soak it up learn everything
that you need to learn follow the
projects that I did then from there do
the same projects that I did with you
and then build it yourself to really see
how much you you you got out of the
course and then from there start
building projects to put into your
portfolio as soon as you get fire
projects 5-6 projects start applying
jobs that is my goal you know what I
mean I don't want people to be here you
know and say hey man I got so much value
from Joe's cars because it took me 72
hours to to complete it that's not
that's not value value is when you leave
out of here and you're able to build
things on your own when you say hey man
Joe came in he broke it down think'st
out I see other people that take them
hours and hours and hours to do Joe came
in he broke it down in two three hours
something that I started looking at
other people's courses and sections and
people that I even recommended the
courses he's like man I think we could
break that down even to less less time
because there's certain concepts once
you learn to learn the concepts you're
not supposed to stay there you know what
I mean like you're not supposed to stay
just on a course just following alone
this is not Netflix you're not trying to
binge watch something right you have a
goal your goal is to work your goal is
to find that job your goal is to really
make money you know I don't know if
anybody here is is looking for every
single javascript method that's out
there if that's what you're here for
all my courses on my channel this is not
the place for you
because what you're looking for is
somebody who's gonna come in and give
you you know a whole bunch of
explanations of like let's say an
example like if I was to come in and
look at it into the Dom right and we go
into every single object that's on a Dom
on a page what is that going to do for
you you get what I'm saying like it's
not really gonna do anything for you
it's like okay we weren't over it it
took us a good two hours we wasted two
hours once you understand the concepts
which take about five minutes you don't
need to go back into the the DOM and try
to understand every single thing in it
until you get to that point you get what
I'm saying
like it's right it's like right now it's
like let me see I'm trying to bring it
up to a more
lower lower level somewhere where let me
see how can I put this the the idea that
I have in my head so to explain this to
people okay let's say you're you're
building something all right
and I'm built yeah perfect
let's say we we are building a house
okay and you're my my student and I'm
teaching you how to build a house right
you don't need me to tell you where the
pipes came from you don't need me to
tell you
hey they build this pipes then freakin
in San Francisco they brought this steel
from a Pittsburgh they brought this this
little pieces from China you don't need
those details what you're here to do is
learn to build a house all right now
later on in your career
you might decide hey I already know Auto
Constance I already could build my own
house but you know what I want to be
able to save money inside of those those
pipes I could figure out you know I'm
gonna try to figure out where do they
make those pipes in so I could get it
cheaper right so that goes to like
JavaScript in a sense of like hey we
learn how to build something with
JavaScript how can we optimize it to the
maximum and be like you know instead of
using a map you could build your own for
loop in a way where you just I don't
know you know it's like you create your
own algorithm all right that's good way
deeper than what you need to get the job
you get what I'm saying it's like your
job is to build a house your your job is
not to go in there and figure out where
did this this on this little piece
that's on the wall where where they made
it how how long ago you don't need that
detail right now that's what I'm saying
as a developer somebody who's
self-taught you want to be able to to
learn but you don't need certain things
a lot of instructors go into deeper
things like let's say they go sue
we're deep into a topic that takes them
one hour right
on one topic that could literally take
somebody ten minutes to explain but they
go into what year it was created you
know like somebody comes in and gives
you a whole history on JavaScript like
JavaScript was created in 1992 in by Sun
flare the company and you know from
there we came to Netscape and this this
and that and it's like okay cool you
could have told me that in you know two
sentences I didn't need to have a
documentary about JavaScript to learn
how to build you know websites I don't
write and I'm I do that because I stay
away from that because when I was
learning I spent more time learning them
building things so I noticed that that
was a problem I noticed that you know
that was one of the main reasons why in
reality I was ready to start working
probably in two months
right after I switch and say hey I'm
gonna become a developer I really worked
hard I really went in they order courses
you know I was doing like probably like
12 hours a day I will wake up at 9
o'clock for nine o'clock I will be on to
like two o'clock in the morning yeah I
was really going hard right and I was
doing that constantly for a good month
and a half right then from that started
building websites on my own I could have
literally came in and probably started
applying for jobs as soon as I was done
with all of that and I had a couple of
websites but what happened I wasn't
secure enough in myself where I'm like
man I don't know if I'm ready
I gotta keep learning man I gotta I
gotta go deeper into this I gotta you
know spend a whole bunch of times
learning algorithms I gotta spend a
whole bunch of times taking multiple
frameworks and then in reality it's
certainly like almost a year to get that
first job but boy it wasn't because I
didn't freaking
I went to interviews I was gonna turn
down and isn't that I just didn't go
because I wasn't sure I was like oh I
don't know if man I don't know if I'm
ready yet
you know what I mean and that happens
because a lot of times when you're
taking this courses and you go deeper
you need to be you need to you know you
spend so much time and on courses that
you don't need to spend that much time
in you know what I mean so don't think
about value when you tell when you take
a course and you learning something
value is not measured by time this is
something that's wrong with you to me
it's like we could go to you to me right
now and we're gonna see something
there's a trend there's a trend that
I've noticed a lot of times so let's see
what development okay let me see I'm
trying to see okay Rob Percival's the
complete web developer course this
course is 30 hours long
okay this was 43 hours long okay this
was 27 that's a decent amount whiting
angular angular 4 5 whatever can be
shorter than that this was 17 hours this
is the sweet spot right right
the what developer boot camp I
understand it why is this long because
in reality were cold steel day he merged
a whole bunch of courses into one and
that's how he sells it right he makes
his money like that that's a smart thing
to do
right see basically he had other courses
by by itself and he noticed that he
wasn't selling not much so what did he
do he decided to say hey you know what
I'm gonna take you know like 10
different topics 10 different courses
and put them into one and sell them and
pretty much everybody else out there
right because in reality all of this
courses take time and people should pay
for per course but you know cold steel
after game up so it's like now it's like
you get all like 20 courses in one
course right but that's a different
story but you see like this one the
complete JavaScript build a real-world
project this is the sweet this is the
sweet spot right he's over here teaching
you you know let's look into this
because I haven't really taken a course
to me that's a sweet spot 17 hours for
JavaScript damning sense you know
anything between 12 and 17 it makes
sense you know as I see all of this
stuff this is what I'm saying
this is exactly what I'm talking about
this is a perfect course right this
course comes in talks to you about the
basics of JavaScript three hours
javascript in the browser Dom two hours
event objects and functions so now it's
like object-oriented so that's another
tool and a half hours put it together he
creates a project takes him like about
five hours that's a little bit too long
but get ready for the future
es 2000 so basically now he had es6 to
to the course so now it's another three
hours and then from there he has like a
final 30 questions that takes like a
minute right and then like a conclusion
whatever so the whole course itself is
like 17 hours right he had he has a lot
of topics in here but all about
JavaScript right there's people who have
stuff where we're teaching you PHP right
but at the same time we're also teaching
you HTML we're also teaching CSS we're
also teaching you JavaScript we're also
teaching you PHP I'm reading through the
whole documentation of PHP and this
isn't that and then now if the course is
like sixty two hours long
right they did I need to go into a
course for sixty two hours to learn what
I needed to learn I'm gonna give you a
very good example of a course which I
haven't recommended for a reason I'm
gonna give you a very good course I
haven't recommended for a very good
reason let me see where is it there is a
course
man I can't I can't find it but it used
to be here that kid who does it
I believe he's he's also a youtuber and
he's a good person everything and and
this is not no-knock to him but I can't
find a man I want to show it to you guys
there's a course that's like literally
like 55 hours of Python and a while back
people thought that that was like really
good value you're like oh man I'm
getting 55 hours but now this guy Jose
Portilla came out with this one which is
actually selling better because it's 13
hours right you don't need to have
somebody come in and read you the
documentation of every function inside
of Python so I just wanted to explain
that to people because I feel like there
is a disconnect between what's good
value for your money and was really
value for your career I hope you
understand the difference value for your
money is like hey 10 bucks
I'm gonna get 60 to 72 hours of of
content 10 bucks I'm winning right now
value for your career is hey I'm coming
in I'm gonna learn the things that I
need to learn this person's gonna break
it down in a way where it's gonna be an
easier route for me as a self-taught
developer to learn on my own and then
from there once I know all the concepts
I could say thank you to this person and
move on and start building my own
projects right you should never be
depending on the instructor or the
developer to come in and be like hey I
just want you guys to come back 24/7 now
my whole idea of this whole thing of
coding phrase comments how can we make
things easier for people how can we make
people learn the things that they need
instead of dumb wasting time 50 60 hours
on courses and they still don't know how
to build
their own website why do you need to get
to the end of the course which is 50
hours long for you to learn that hey I
still need to build a couple of projects
for me to be able to learn how to build
websites right you get what I mean
like there's people who go in finish you
know 60 hours
course all right sexy out of course and
then come out and then be like mmm I
still don't know how to build my own
website
I followed along and I did everything
but I still don't know how to build it
all right so my job as an instructor is
to make sure that people learn and also
people don't have to spend too much time
with me instead I want them to spend
spend more time building things like my
hope my whole job is to get you to
understand the concepts get you to
understand where to find the answers and
get you to understand how to read the
documentation this is not the Bible you
know I mean documentation is not the
Bible and you know the 1200s 1,400 swear
only the priest could read you the book
and you know you always needed to come
back to the priest and please can you
please read us what the Word of God says
is enough I teach you how to read so you
could read the Bible on your own and you
could go and follow your own steps you
know that's the job of the instructor
the job of an instructor is just to come
and teach you the concepts get you
projects to our real life projects
something that is gonna get you prepared
for the real world and then from there
that's on you you get what I mean
I hope you understand that don't like I
said bring it back value for your money
and value for your career is two
different things all right anyways guys
if you like the way how I speak on this
topics if you like the way how my
channel is if you enjoy my videos here
on YouTube if you enjoy my advices guys
check out my website coding face.com
literally the best way that I've seen
out there you know there's definitely
great courses on udemy that you could
check out on the links below in my
description but if you want to say hey
man I wanna give this a chance I want
give this a try you could literally come
to my website you sign up ten bucks it's
as if you bought one course on udemy but
you get all of my courses for free for
that whole month and it's the same thing
you could come in and cancel it at any
time right you come in you say oh this
is not for me fine you could cancel it
this even a 30 month what is a 30 day
money-back guarantee you know I mean I
guess all on you but do understand that
my job is to make life easier for you if
you feel like hey that's not really what
you're looking for then this website is
not for you if you're looking for
somebody who is going to go into every
single thing of the documentation that's
not what I'm here for I'm here to get
you up and going get you ready to become
a developer and teach you the concepts
that's gonna make you into developer
developer is not somebody who who needs
somebody else to to basically read the
documentation for them a developer is
somebody who needs someone to break it
down for them on how to create things
indifferent there once you have those
concepts you could read the
documentation and find the answers - it
doesn't matter - whatever its subject
whatever topic out there somebody could
tell me right now hey Joe build this I
want you to build this iPhone app that
connects to an API and I want to build
in nodejs and then I want it to be sent
to a Python and they're from Python I
wanted to be sent to my my C go on a PHP
server I can do that right because I
know the concepts of everything as far
as like those language all the kind of
languages that I teach here I know order
the concepts of all of them and I know
how to find the answer right and how to
read through the documentation what I
want to do is get you guys to this same
point where I'm at instead of you having
to spend five years to get to this point
I want you guys to get through it
quicker than me faster than me look a
lot of you guys are probably smarter
than me you know and I'm not afraid to
say that because while taking me this
long to do you guys could probably with
somebody like me guiding you giving you
right choices in the right places where
to go you could probably do this in less
time than me you get what I'm saying
like that's that's all that's gonna make
me happier you know I mean to keep you
guys there and a year from now two years
from now you guys getting you know
really good jobs and you're like man you
know Joe show me the way then now he
pass it on to somebody else that's
that's what I really care about you know
what I mean some yeah man I'll see you
guys later check out my website : face
calm your boys backing out and did it
again
