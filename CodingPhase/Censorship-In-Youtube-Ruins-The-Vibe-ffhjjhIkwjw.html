it again man coating fees.com your boys
back in I didn't did it again alright so
let's get to it
pretty much the censorship here in
YouTube it's killing my vibe thank God I
have my own platform my own website
which I'm going to be making more videos
in and I've been saying this I've been
doing tutorials and you know it's going
pretty well but I'm also going to create
a section that's gonna be called coding
face raw variant calling face raw where
you're gonna get like the best of me
just going in just like going like no
commercials no fancy intro no nothing
just me talking about a topic not
holding back you know cause it's like it
really sucks right now
literally all the videos I made the past
week have been flagged pretty much where
I can't earn anything out of them right
automatically they all have like this
little yellow dollar sign you know and
our people be like oh why would we care
about that but even though we only get
in like ten dollars out of every video
that we make which is almost nothing for
all the work that I put in
it's still motivation because that's
money that I used to buy free courses to
poor people basically buy courses for
people and yeah so now we're not gonna
be able to do that so what I'm gonna do
is I'm definitely not gonna curse no
more on this videos definitely gonna
keep this you know squeaky clean I'm
gonna be careful of what I put on the
titles I don't know we gotta try to
please YouTube for what it is right
understand they gotta have rules you
know but what to me what sucks is if you
can curse or say anything crazy on your
videos you get flagged but if there's a
music video that has a million curses
nobody cares about that you know what I
mean like if you're gonna censor the
content creators censor everybody you
know what I mean so that's the thing
that sucks so now what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna actually create a section of
my or my website Kolkata
you know coding face raw there's pretty
much me talking about topics without
holding back you know same way I've been
doing it here with you guys but and just
topics that I want to talk about but
what I hold them back their anchors here
on YouTube we got we getting censored so
since we're getting censored you're
gonna get like the washdown
sauce right you know the watered-down
sauced if you want the the real sauce
you're gonna have to come to the website
which sucks you know what I mean like to
me that sucks
so now gotta be be careful with what I
say be careful with what I do and you
if now I get flagged that's not cool
like that's not cool but yeah man just
wondering how you guys doing today I'm
on my way back to Long Island about to
skiddly right now it's so much traffic I
hate this like you can't come to New
York City in the daytime like it's crazy
so I came to drop off my girlfriend and
the baby and my mother-in-law
I saw drop them off my mother-in-law's
house now I'm heading back home which
sucks because the traffic it's a little
ridiculous right now see it's like
bumper-to-bumper I got people right
behind me I got people right in front of
me bumper-to-bumper all right say yeah
but it's okay it's not that bad I'm
comfortable you know what I mean like I
got the the sunroof out it's a beautiful
day that the shades on got the fini
it's an old shirt but I'm comfortable
you know what I mean I got the shorts I
got the chunk let us know I'm not even
wearing shoes I got John Curtis right
now right so I'm comfortable that I
actually get to see the fight yes
finally it was enough you know I tried a
million different ways to watch the
fight yesterday but the only way to
actually watch it was the one that you
sent me cam was a BMC or something I be
a max assumption something like that
damn and I can't curse I can't say even
the S word I can't even say that because
I get banned
I get flagged
like this is crazy
you see I'm a 13 year old and next year
we'll know what we need to decide what
middle school work would I go to should
I go to a programming school or
something else if I ever give up
I mean I've never heard of a program in
middle school or programming high school
but if you are going to go to a program
in high school if there is any yeah go
to it why not
and also by the time you like 17 18 20
years old you already prepare you've
been programming for years what's up
Jerry what up
yes I was watching the fight yesterday
man I think that was a really messed up
fight man you know why because they
shouldn't let him get knocked up cuz
that's the thing he made a clear he also
said it too late
he wasn't hurt people acting like he was
hurt he was on hurt
he was tired he's never fought at that
time you know like fighting for you know
25 minutes is one thing then fighting
for like two thirty forty forty minutes
almost an hour it's different the you
know the referee was a complete idiot he
shouldn't have done that he messed up
the fight that's for sure
yeah man
it was pretty crazy though I enjoyed it
it was cool would have been better if I
would I would have been drunk or
something like that's every time I watch
a fight I feel like that I should be
drunk or something you know like
drinking some alcohol I wanna see if I
can make this good this time right here
and the traffic is crazy look at that
traffic's not going no way right there
at all
oh yeah man so what's everybody doing
today man what you guys working on I'm
actually gonna be doing my portfolio and
continuing doing my portfolio today so

fees on YouTube it's like I can't be
myself I can't really sauce it out how I
want so
we're gonna have to play the system and
I have to play the the YouTube system to
continue reaching out new peoples but at
the same time it's not something that
I'm excited for not excited for you too
because I'm being censored and that's
not you know I mean I don't even know
does the word suck if is it a bad word
enough for me to get you know flagged or
whatever so I don't even know if that's
even a good word for me
so yeah go to the website man : freeze
calm register just so you could get all
the new content i'm putting in there
like there's gonna be so many videos
that i'm gonna be recording just like
coding phase raw like and tutorials and
sake I'm just being honest like YouTube
is not gonna be like the main place for
me and it's already as you guys can see
like I come here and drop a video once a
day but at the same time if you go to my
website you will see I dropped way more
videos on my website and my market was

that you know right here you're getting
the water down Joe you know what I mean
there's like like you buy a beer and
then you get the beer and then you put
water on it and then you split one beer
into two and the rest of it you just mix

getting here on YouTube so I would
