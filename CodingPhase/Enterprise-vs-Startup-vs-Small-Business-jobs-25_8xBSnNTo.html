choked back at it again man corn face
comment listen your boy is back man
alright so today we got a copy break the
top is going to be about pretty much you
know working corporation a large
business at surprise right working and a
start-up up-and-coming company pretty
young or working with small businesses
right what's the difference right
alright so let's say enterprise right
let's say a company like Macy's all arts
google even Google right number one you
got an upset you're only a number and
reality dislike 5,000 developers so
pretty much if you're not the other day
you won't be missed nobody's going to be
looking for you of course maybe your
project manager is going to be by hate
what happened to Jerusalem come in today
and do this presentation but most likely
in the big picture nobody gives a damn
so that's a large corporation Plus also
to lean on your ballot situations when I
they keep track of you they gives us an
ID card they keep track of what time you
get to work what time do you leave how
long does it take for you to take a
lunch break what time do you come back
to lunch you know most of the time you
gotta wear assu me I'm not a type of
person I've worked in those type of
environments and I don't feel
comfortable I don't want to come into
the office custody what a shoo-in at I
would stick up my you know what like I
don't want to be that guy you know I
rather just be myself and be more
comfortable and you know coming to work
hard way I feel like it because they're
too just cold programs i say that's what
I'm really do it does a reality of
things right let's talk about I've
started a start-up is good but a problem
that it has is that is a start of pain
we're going to hire you and we want you
to work here for six to twelve months
and in 12 months we gotta renew your
contract next thing you know the company
goes under in three months now you don't
have enough money to pay rent you're not
have enough money to feed your family do
you really know
between two like that right the positive
sorry it might gives you stuff or
they'll tell you they gotta give you
some stocks you know once the company
becomes big but it's like a gamble man
they sometimes you just gambling and be
like hey let's see what the dice kiss
it's the company gotta be around for 12
months do you really believe in the
project or the product that they try to
sell sometimes you have to choose what
exactly do you really want I mean for me
one of the process that started most of
the time people come in just like this
of course without the fit but this is
just business casual and you come and do
your work nobody bothers you and that's
everything sweet most of the time is
young people in the company one of the
worst things is when you work in a
company it's like a whole bunch of old
guys that don't know what's going on but
they want to tell you what to do it like
Berlocq you're still trying to call them
at pascal and be language and we'll see
like who does that anymore anyways yeah
so you say to yourself from those
situations in and started and a lot of
times you people a lot of money they
might come in and be like hey we got a
hundred-thousand-dollar sweet you know
money makes the world go round you gotta
decide to see what's that in person you
are you know I me like if you're
actually more of an enterprise where you
know you have had a more secure which is
something that then talk about
enterprise you actually have a security
behind pretty much say hey i know this
company has been around for 50 years I
know they're gonna pay me $80,000 I got
full benefits I got the whole shebang
right and I know that if I'm stay here
and do my job uncle I shouldn't be here
for the rest of my life you know that's
what happens a lot of time when you
choose the enterprise right now let's
talk about small businesses small
businesses is you know your mom and pop
shop so I'm cleaning but let's say
somebody has a ebay store right and now
they're realizing that the ebay store is
actually sending a lot a lot of products
and they're like you know what how about
we create our world ecommerce website so
then that's where you come in you get
hired for that
probably not going to get paid as much
as you will get paid in an enterprise
company also the time you're not going
to get paid as much as you would get in
a start-up in a small business you're
more snow friendlier like you know what
I mean like you could actually go to
dinner with the order if you have kids
your kids play together whenever
something happens like you know they
take care but the cars of it there's a
big cock gets how much money for it also
true you don't get no benefit most of
the companies can't afford benefits so
what they do is they tell you think this
one we're going to you know give you a
little more extra money but you have to
get your own benefits on your own time
for some people that's good some people
as bad if you have any type of
sicknesses or diseases or any history
and your family it's not good for you
because now you have no benefits no
health insurance no actual sharing
nothing well it's up to you everybody is
totally different me personally I prefer
startups are the startups for small
business I don't like working in and a
price company because you're just a
number I rather just be ourselves and
get to be joe santos instead of number
ID 2344 is 17 I don't want to be that
guy yes it's secure but is it really
worth nah you tell me that anyways leave
a comment let me know what you got
senior make sure you subscribe you boy
is back man leave a comment man I want
to know what do you guys actually prefer
you know I love enterprise startup or
small businesses let me know your point
Joe back at it again
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
