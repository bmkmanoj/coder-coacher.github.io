back at it again man : v calm listen the
boy is back and I didn't did it again or
again
listen man somebody sent me a message
today right asking me man I'm 70 years
old I don't know what to do I don't want
to go to school and now because I don't
want to go to school is because I just
don't feel like there's nothing out
there for me
like there is no locational or system
that I can go to and feel like I'm I'm
learning the latest things right and I
kind of told them I mean finish high
school first right finish high school
finish what you're doing don't drop out
because the worst thing that that can
happen is like you drop out you get a G
B is something that you're not going to
be proud of it's pretty much the same
thing a GED and a high school diploma is
the same thing it means you pass your
test but at the same time it's like it's
something you're not going to be proud
of something that you're going to look
back on it and going to be like hey man
I got a GED Pentagon my high school
diploma alright so you don't want to go
to college that's fine College is not
for everybody
College is going to open doors for you
if you're somebody who can work the
system lane you know for certain careers
you need to go to college
but if you just like programmer like
coding
I don't think college is the best way to
go you know nowadays like is what 2017
unit I see that most people that work as
developers they for never being a day in
college like there's a lot of them who
you know they're like so for engineers
or how you call this like you know
regular engineers or electrical
engineering like they want to school
foot for that right but somehow they're
in the same place as somebody who never
bring in school well being school but
never been to college so in that sense
it's kind of weird so for me I will say
go go for college
test it out if you don't like it leave
the style hurt you to say hey I'm going
to go in for you know one semester it's
actually going to be good because you're
going to get your writing better you
know you're going to learn the you know
a couple of things in math which are
always going to be useful you know most
likely if you're in college if you
didn't get to do this in high school
like calculus you're going to learn some
calculus so that first semester is going
to help you out to understand do you
really want to grow a college but as a
high school student you can't decide if
you know if you're not going to go to
school or now and like you got to give
yourself some time let yourself grow you
know like experience life like college
is an experience man
you know I'll be out of an the best the
best times of our lives work you know
when I was in college early years man
hanging out really cool people you know
it was good about colleges that it it
puts you with people that you would have
never met on your own
you know there's going to be people from
other states just getting people from
different classes you know different
economic classes then you and then
you're going to get that exposure and
also go to college if you want for you
know the first semester see if you like
if not let's start learning it's code
online like this thing is not it's not
going anywhere you know learning you
know how to code learning how to program
learning and skills and technology I
know people who are studying right now
to basically work with you know setting
up solar panels right those guys are
making like 80 90 K you can't complain
to go on the roof you're if you're like
one of those people that like to get
your hands dirty and like to do things
where you have less solar panels and
installing solar panels it sounds great
you know so I think right now anything
that has to do with technology any type
of career any move that you want to do
it's the right way alright so well give
yourself a little time and don't drop
out of high school don't don't make
decisions that you might regret later on
like give yourself some time like just
because you see sometimes like oh you
don't need a degree doesn't mean that at
the same time you can get something out
of college you know what like college is
an experienced college you go to college
not for the degree you don't go to
college for the knowledge you don't go
over there for the case in most schools
are they're going to give you the same
 that you're going to get in a
Community College havaianas going to a
four-year school unless you're going to
like MIT Harvard like you're going to
get the same that someone's going
to get a community college
but the experience that you're going to
get out of it is priceless
nobody else is going to be able to give
you that so don't drop out of high
school you know finish high school
finish what you're doing and then from
there you know continue learning how to
code your Kolb has come to me I'll help
you out I'll guide you to what resources
I know what resources my friends have
taken like and all under there
keep it moving all right you already
know simple job back at it again man :
face calm your boys out here make sure
you subscribe make sure you like this
video and yeah okay you already knows
you put Joe back at it again man listen
make sure you subscribe and make sure
you like this video man by the way if
you want to know exactly what questions
I took to become a web developer they
right there in the description it's no
secret it's nothing crazy as no secret
gifts that I had it's just pretty much I
took the courses they're pretty cheap
that I could send dollars each on
specials and just whistle man change
your life change your lifestyle do
something fun - something cool that you
could call a career</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
