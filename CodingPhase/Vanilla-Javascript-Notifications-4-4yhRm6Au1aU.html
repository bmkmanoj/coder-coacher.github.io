to do is we're going to loop through
every single element here and we're
going to add a function of unclick so
before we start that let's do something
else we're gonna create an array and
we're going to call it far albums select
it right I will select it and I'm going
to say it's just an empty array so two
brackets right and then we're gonna
declare of our I equals 0 or R equals 0
and then now we're gonna do I will buy a
loop so what we're going to say is while
I is less than we gotta get albums right
I was length so we could actually know
how many albums are there so i whoops
lengths right so while i is nothing else
left console.log i and then i plus plus
alright let's see if that one's and
we'll have any problem okay go 0 1 2 3
all right so it comes to lock the I so
for every single one here it basically
it has an index hope you guys remember
what the index is
it's just a place inside of dollar rate
like right now J Z is 0 1 2 3 all right
so if we wanted to get information from
let's say Kanye West comments drop out
we will say albums right and then we
come here and say something like this
albums and then let's say albums one and
then I was born and that will have the
information of college dropout which is
currently without alright so to receive
this cool so now we have this here what
we're going to say is you're going to do
something like this we never say albums
all right and we're gonna say brackets
I'm going to put I and then we're going
to say all click equals function then
here gonna say console.log click an hour
alright so we come here and we click
console alright come back click on the
album now say click the now go alright
we just added that function right to
every single element whenever we click
it on anyone any of these right
automatically this function that we
added to that element is going to see
console.log click that out now we can
put anything here we can make an alert
we can make another styles or like
changes the whole background or whatever
we want but for now what we're going to
do is we're going to do is we're gonna
actually come here can say bar albums
Italian
say this the query selector right and
then we're going to look at the title
which is here in the album that says tie
a little class title right so inside of
this element of you know the album this
actually another div with the class
title so we want to target that so we're
gonna say query selector title and then
we're gonna want the text content
alright so what we're doing is we're
basically we have two div
remember this all right remember the box
model right we have two div and then
inside of it
we have other information here you have
an image we have a div with a class we
have a div with the class artist so now
when we say this we're actually talking
about this element whatever element we
actually clicked on so when we click on
something we're not talking about all
the other ones we just talking about
this one when we click it right so
that's what's happening we're saying hey
this element right inside of it search
for another query selector that has
title basically another bit of inside of
it that has title and then give me the
text content inside of that so we have
the album right we have the title and
then we have the text content so that's
the information that we're getting right
now okay so let's run that but let's
actually display it here - the album
title sorry
this
all right now when we the left let's go
to console log everything should be fine
click here click the now sometimes the
thing be acting up so make sure you save
and then run come back here click there
