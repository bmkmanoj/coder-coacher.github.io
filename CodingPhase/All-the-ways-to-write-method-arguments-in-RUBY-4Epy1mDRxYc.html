like you and people that support our
website coding phase comm go check it
out over 20 courses in there there's got
a guy you to become a developer from the
beginning to become an approach so now
let's talk about basically method
arguments okay because there's so many
different ways that you could use them
and what I'm showing you from the
beginning was the easiest way and the
reason why I left us for later on is for
you guys to actually decide which way
you guys wanted to use it okay
we could define a method and say define
my name and then here we could passing
the arguments of a name I say my name is
name okay and then here we can end it
all right and we could say my name is
Joe all right I'm going to put in a
comment here and then we're gonna say
example one alright you could have your
method and this will you met the will
return my name is Joe alright now if you
wanted to have a default I'm gonna copy
this and you wanted to have a default
you can come here but I'm sorry you can
say example tool with default you can
come here and say name and then pass in
the name of the person and let's just
say we're not passing in no argument if
we come down here I'm gonna put the
number two just so you could know SS my
name is Joe and this is example two all
right so what we did was we didn't have
no argument there
so if the user didn't put an argument
when I say another developer that are
putting argument then impasse anything
basically our default is the name of Joe
okay if I come back down here and I
change it I'll say Charlie then it goes
back to normal and says my name is
Charlie all right so I will delete this
this is the example two with default now
let's come down here example three let's
say you want it to passing an argument
you can come here and instead of using
parenthesis all you have to do is just
put in a space and put in the name of
your argument so then here all you have
to do let's say my name is I'm gonna put
in the number so we could actually see
which ones are are being called all
right so I name three name three you can
actually come here and basically just
pass it down like that
so says wrong number of arguments given
zero expected what I believe it does
because of the name ins so we're gonna
basically name each method with a number
so we say define me and my name one my
name too all right and Sharon there you
go
so example 3 is basically you had
defined the name of the method right and
then from there you have your argument
if I want to declare other arguments all
I have to do is put in a comma and a
space and say age and I could put here
like this age is put in this
and put an age I'm gonna put an ax on
all of these so we know that that number
is coming from the example alright so we
come here put in the age of 23 and how
long sorry
it's not supposed to be dollar sign it's
hash tag so data so there's the third
one
so we're saying my name is Joe H is 23
and this is example 3 so as you can see
instead of us using parentheses we could
just literally just say hey put a space
and then put in to age all right if we
want to put in the default we can come
in and just say default let's say 21 and
then if we don't put any age
automatically 21 is the default all
right so that's how you do it that's one
way of doing it all right and then
alright so what we're gonna do is we're
gonna copy this here we're gonna paste
it here we're gonna say example for
change it to mining for we're gonna put
in mining for and then what's
interesting is we're going to say name
and then like that with a colon and then
here we're going to say name we'll call
in and then age or a colon alright now
to basically be able to pass in
arguments to this new method that we
created we have to also use the same
names that we use here okay so we're
gonna say name and we're passing in the
name of that argument so here we're
gonna have to put in Joe and then here
we're gonna say dirty right so if we do
that we basically make sure this is for
says my name is Joe age is 30 example
for all right
now what's cool about this having named
arguments it's very simple if we gonna
copy this we're gonna put it down here
say example five and then we're gonna
say with default and mixed order okay so
what we're going to do is we're going to
put in 5 here 5 here we're gonna put in
example 5 here and then instead of how
we have a here where you see how we have
one argument here and we have to put in
Joe there okay
or in this example we say ok my name 3
then we have to put a name and then we
have to put in the age and is usually
right next to each other all right
because we're using named arguments we
can actually mix match this we could
come here and say something like this
like I could put in here and I live and
I live and let's say location for
example all right
so instead of us having it in order I
could mix match this I could come here
and put in location here and put in New
York City
all right I'm in a comma and I could
pass in like this and say location all
right and this will still work so you
say my name is Joe and age is starting
and I live in NYC I can also move this
thing here from this area put it all the
way into further oops
put it all the way in the front so
that's the beauty of having named
arguments ok because now you could come
in and say hey I want to pass in this
arguments but now you don't have to put
it in order
you don't have to come in and but oh
yeah how was the order of this method
it's like nah it's like if you remember
you have to put in location and you
remove that you have to put in the age
let me put this all right okay so yeah
so you don't have to put this thing in
order where you say okay I passed in the
first argument of name then I pass in
the second argument of age and then the
third argument of location like you
don't have to keep in that order you can
literally say hey location age and then
the name it's like as if you know if you
forgot what was the order named
arguments is the best way all right guys
so you decide which way you want to do
it if you're like one of those guys
that's used to doing it with parentheses
because you use functions and other
languages is very easy you're like okay
cool I just got to do it like this if
you decide hey I'm gonna do it basically
my default variables here you could do
it like that
now if you want to try the Ruby way you
will use it more like this okay if you
wanna make your life easier because you
don't want to remember the order of your
arguments you will use something like
this like named arguments okay so I'll
see you guys in the next video
