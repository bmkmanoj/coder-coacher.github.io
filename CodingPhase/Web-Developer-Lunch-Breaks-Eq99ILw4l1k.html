it again man coding fees.com your boys
backing out and did it again alright
kids was good was poppin was really
really good we here man we recording
this videos for the nodejs course we're
pretty far now man we did the database
is setting up MongoDB understanding how
MongoDB works now we're basically
setting up the blog post for your
portfolio for those of you that want to
get your portfolio and want to create
like a CMS for your portfolio that's the
perfect course for you guys guys so yeah
let me know now I want to you know put
this out there I don't wanna
it's not like I'm dissing you guys it's
not like I'm disrespecting you guys it's
not like saying anything bad but some of
yeah yeah yeah acting real small minded
guys I'll be honest people keep hitting
me up like oh man like that I didn't
want to do the hyper app guys you don't
have to do high prep right like go for
the restaurant to build a restaurant at
the course that I created and people is
just like man you know it's like I want
to learn something that you know like
react I want to learn angular I want to
do this and that
and what people don't understand is a
lot of you guys don't even know
JavaScript that well right so there's a
project that's gonna step your game up
for the next steps in your career right
because it's like okay we have to HTML
CSS we have future-proof JavaScript
which is just like a super beginner
course it just introduces you to you
know the DOM and troduce is you to
variables functions right never there
you have
jQuery right so jQuery comes in and
shows you how to use a library right to
make your life easier
but then you know different day I have
this restaurant website where it's a
single page app we could have done this
in jQuery we could have done this in
react we've done this in angular we
could have done this on ember we could
have done this on it doesn't matter on
what all right we're gonna done it with
another JavaScript it would have been
the exact same thing right we still
would have to put in through a element
on a page right we would I say hey get
element by ID and put this app inside of
there
that's it that's all that hyper app is
doing for you guys right people are
acting like as if we're we're like going
on the deep end trying to learn
something that is never gonna be useful
guys if you plan on learning react
actually hyper app makes it easier for
you to understand it right because let's
be honest if you jump who here has has
learned react Redux together who here
hasn't learned it all right react by
itself it's a library that is gonna take
a little while to learn right but then
learning Redux it's a whole different
ballgame
right so what hyper app does is like it
combines both of them and makes it
easier for the user so it's like a
reality is winning you in to the world
of react and redux because it doesn't
make sense for you to just hey you just
took the future-proof JavaScript you
just took a jquery course and then from
there jump to react and you have no
projects in between which means you
haven't practiced on your JavaScript
right so for you to just say hey I just
learned the basics of JavaScript and
i'ma jump to react it doesn't make sense
so that's why hyper app is like the
bridge between vanilla JavaScript little
libraries like jQuery
till something more bigger like you know
react or angular four or angular five
that's coming out soon um so when you
see that people go with this idea of
like man if I'm gonna learn something
from JavaScript it has to be react or it
has to be angular what you guys don't
understand is when you go to that job
interview they don't really care about
which library you using right which one
you know right what they care about is
hey if we tomorrow decide to switch from
angular 5 to the Harry Potter framework
or the telly telly framework can you
learn and can you keep up do you know
the concepts of JavaScript that's what
our company cares about nobody cares
that you could do it only on react on
only on angular you're supposed to be
able to learn anything out there right
you're not supposed to stay stuck in one
little thing and be like hey I've seen
this done if you guys look it up this
design this podcast called front-end
it's like it's like a front and hang out
a front end happy hour right and they
talked about this where people will show
up to Netflix right because the guys
that created that podcast day most of
them work at Netflix they were saying
that a lot of people will show up and
will say hey they will tell them hey can
you build this can you look through this
this things and you know display and the
DOM and most people were like oh can I
use angular can I use our Ember and they
were like you could use whatever you
want but why do you want to specifically
use it on angular and then once they
hire them they realize this person only
knows the angular framework they don't
know this concepts of JavaScript they
don't know the concepts of like hey you
could literally do this with another
JavaScript where you could come in and
look through everything
you know it's like people just got a I'm
not saying it and in a bad way man but
it doesn't matter what it is you're
supposed to know how to do things in any
framework that is given to you because
all of this is job is cover you guys are
acting like there's like a whole
different but the whole different
language like man you know and that's
how that's how you tell you know don't
take it the wrong way
that's how you tell between mid-level
senior developers to junior developers
right because it's like you realize you
just don't know everything at all and
it's just funny to me because I'm like
man do you guys understand that when you
go to a job listing or indeed com why do
you think that they post up angular
react ember backbone have you seen that
in a job posting they have six seven
different frameworks right what that
means is that they don't care which
framework is the one that you'll use
because when you get there you're gonna
have to use the framework that they use
but what they care about is that you
know these concepts you know this
concepts the front-end of single page
app and you know the concept of using
javascript in the front right if you
don't notice things and you're you know
it's like you're drowning don't drown in
this cup man the world is bigger than
this cup don't drown in this cup alright
you gotta think about it like this guys
you have to understand the concepts
nobody wants you to become a react
master you know become a angular master
what they care about is the concepts do
you know the concepts that those
libraries have man because how are you
going to be able to actually adapt next
year we don't know what's gonna be hot
next year you know what I mean like this
year was there was a lot talk of you jes
we do not know
gonna happen next year right if you stay
in a bubble of like hangman I just want
to learn the top two and it's like yeah
you're gonna learn the top two but how
are you going to learn the top two if
there's no in-between though maybe six
of JavaScript and learning the top
front-end frameworks alright people
don't have any projects in between there
right they don't have no projects they
don't understand a JavaScript somebody
hit me up with you know I see this a lot
of time people are getting stuck in
small parts of different projects
because they don't want us they don't
wanna say how to debug which now I'm
gonna have to create a course about how
to debug because I noticed that people
do not know how to debug like you got to
learn how to debug meaning hey if
everything worked like let's say an
example you have a page right I'm gonna
show you a little something alright
alright let's say we on this page right
we land on this page alright and then
when we click about is fine but let's
say when we click projects none of the
projects show up what are you supposed
to do you supposed to debug it you're
supposed to say hey why doesn't this
page show up all right you got a console
log it and find out like let's say if
this right here is data
you got a console log that data and see
where it's not coming in sometimes we're
treating data as if like let's say how
data is coming in we're treating it as
if it was an object if you console log
it you will realize that it's an array
right and then you will realize how to
deal with that array but you have to be
able to console log in and debug the
page you can't expect like when the
error comes up you like
I don't know what to do if you don't
know what to do that's exactly why
projects are in the in between
future-proof javascript is a very basic
is a very basic course right it's
teaching you the basics right but you
need projects in between there rain you
need projects in between that to
practice that JavaScript you can't go
from future-proof JavaScript straight to
react it's not gonna work because the
react has a lot of concepts that you
don't understand yet you haven't
practiced them you're not comfortable
with dealing with map you you're not
comfortable with looping through
elements you're not comfortable with
components you're not comfortable with
you know routing you're not comfortable
with so many things dealing with data
you know because when you're dealing
with just a Dom like if you do the
future of JavaScript and you do the
jQuery course you're dealing with more
of the Dom okay
you understand the dump you understand
how to add a class you understand how to
remove an object how to remove our
element how to add an element to the
page well how do you deal with data
right that's why I tell people do the
freaking restaurant app because that was
gonna teach you all those concepts so
when you get to react course you don't
hit me up like oh my god I don't
understand this
oh my god what's going on like there's
our that's too hard it's because you
skipped a lot of steps in between you
know some of you guys are gonna be fine
right because you guys have other places
that you guys when you know some of you
guys have done the web developer
bootcamp which is a great introduction
to to web development some of you guys
have been doing this for a few months or
on YouTube some of you guys have been
doing this in multiple places and then
when you come to the website you're
actually prepared to do all these
projects right but there's some of you
guys who are complete
beginners and want to skip steps you
can't skip the steps you can't skip
things because if you try to say hey
I'll just skip it I'll go fast forward
to react or fast forward to a more
advanced course and then when you get
that you're like oh my god it is so hard
I'm cancelling oh I can't do this what
development is too hard for me it's now
that it's hard is that you skipped a lot
of steps you supposed to have projects
in between you're supposed to understand
how to debug you're supposed to
understand how to deal with data you're
supposed to understand how to loop
through data there's certain concepts
that you just don't know and that's what
I try to do to help you guys out you
know like I don't want to hear nobody
tell me oh but this is in hyperdrive
oh this isn't this and that guys I could
give you right now the Harry Potter
framework you're supposed to be able to
understand the concepts it doesn't
matter if it's whatever framework that
is it's supposed to understand the
concepts because it's like you're trying
to jump into something more advanced
than you're ready you know it's like
you're not ready to be jumping to react
yet you're not ready to jump to angular
five or you know I keep saying angular
five it hasn't came out your bar already
got the beta but yeah so it's like if we
go and jump onto the latest things and
the most popular one without knowing the
basics of JavaScript all you're gonna do
is just frustrate yourself you know what
I mean so it's like that's all I'm
saying for you guys like you need to
really like listen to me if you wanna
you know and like Philippe is like
making it fun out of it you see like
sometimes I'm I'm really trying to give
like a positive message I'm trying to
help you guys out sometimes it's like
you know people come into the chat you
know just to talk ish and like I
dumb guys I'm really about this life I'm
really about learning I'm really about
helping you guys out like if you hear to
just mess around these days that is good
to mess around as days that I'm nine to
move for it right like I'm really trying
to help people out but when you come
here and you just dropped a whole bunch
of BS on a chatroom just for the hell of
it instead of just like hey there is a
point why Joe is doing this I'm not
doing this thing for my my own benefit
like I could care less you know I could
literally be like hey hey you pay for
something and you didn't learn that's
not my problem you know it's like I'm
here for the people meal to help people
you know I don't care if it's here on my
website on care fist on Coach cool talk
a little careful zone you know me I
don't care if it's in to tree house I
don't care if it's coke Adam II I don't
care what it is
I want you guys to learn and the people
that are here to learn you know so it's
like if you're not here to learn don't
ruin it for the other people you know
I'll be honest just don't ruin it for
other people because there's people here
for here trying to change their lives
here or here try to learn something you
know what I mean and that's all I'm
saying
like you guys learn whatever you want
you could take my advice because I've
been doing this for a long time and I
know the concepts what you guys don't
understand is that I'm just like you
guys I'm a self-taught developer I
didn't go to school what I have no no
training all the things that I'm doing
I'm doing it completely different you
know what I mean I wanna show you
something I'm gonna show you something
on on this curriculum right this is the
nodejs curriculum right we got the
introduction we got no js' basics in the
nodejs basics I'll go over routing I go
over cleaning up the route setting up
template engines and they're not work on
the view how to you know build the pages
through pug how to basically do the CSS
how
set up a REST API I do all this stuff
now if you notice I'm also doing a
deployment right I'm definitely I'm
doing the databases how to install
MongoDB how to set all this stuff
definitely I talked about working with
user data so now we're working on the
post on the blog post if you realize
something I'm not teaching it to you
guys in a way of here's HTML CSS
here's JavaScript here's our views
here's controllers here's models he are
assets he are MongoDB how to restore
MongoDB how to do this and that I'm not
teaching it to you guys in that way
because as a self-taught developer you
don't learn like that the way that you
learn is in a way of like hey following
a project how the project is really
built nobody does a project how most of
these people create courses alright they
break it down into sections okay
yes HTML CSS yes JavaScript is this an
that nobody learns like that that's like
looking at the documentation what I've
done is created something that I know
works for self to a developer it might
not work for somebody who's coming in
from a computer science background
because the way how they training in the
way out they trained to think is
different
they're from us we are self-taught
developers right so I come in here I
build it in a way that's gonna be easier
for your brain to understand it and
understand the concepts it's like I'm
holding your hand through this whole
thing and helping you cross the little
bridge to become a developer but at the
same time you gotta help yourself and
you know it's like you're for the people
that come here and and just talk bs it's
like if you don't want to do something
don't do it right but every time that
you come here and you be like oh hi
perhaps
is Joe this and that what you do is
reinforce and a negative thing for
people to be like oh I don't want to
learn this I don't want to learn that
and it's like my head is about to
explode for one freaking main reason is
that the reason why I'm doing this is to
make your life easier to learn this you
don't want to spend six months learning
react because react shouldn't take you
six months to learn it
alright it should take you literally two
weeks maximum if you know all the
concepts if you know the concepts of
immutability if you know the concepts of
components if you know the concepts of
dealing with the Dom so as I come
walking through you I'm walking you
through this whole thing and people is
like don't understand like I want to do
this in that and say bro don't skip
steps man don't stop trying to skip
steps because then you're gonna be over
here looking at a real stupid because
you don't understand it and then when
you bump into a wall and react then
you're gonna be like I don't understand
this I don't nobody taught me this it's
like you just skipped my 20 steps man
you know before I learn to react this
how I learned everything right
I learned backbone right look it up
backbone is the father of all this
framework st. or the single page apps
from there I learned angular after I
learned angular I understood a couple of
concepts all right and then there was
some things about angular that were good
and I was like oh this is cool but
there's something wrong with it
there's something wrong with the idea of
having to learn a different language or
a different syntax
besides JavaScript because it's like if
we do in JavaScript why do I have to
learn ng Aptus ng app that ng cloak ng
whatever and you're like why am i
learning all this stuff it's like now I
got I remember a whole bunch of stuff
that I didn't need to learn you know
what I mean so now
then from there I learned of amber which
amber was great because amber forced you
to do things a certain way it helped you
to keep your clear coat clean definitely
I learned react by the time I got to
react react was like easy-peasy
but thinking about it what if I would
have just went from JavaScript to react
there's a lot of concepts that I
wouldn't have been able to understand it
would have been too much for me so
that's why I tell you guys hey just
listen to me let me hold your hand let
me help you out let me help you cross
the street to become a developer so you
don't have to keep walking miles and
miles and miles to try to understand
something that I could help you out in
an easier way give you an easier route
all right that's all I'm saying man like
I want to help you guys about the same
time man people live in this bubble and
I really cannot stand that man I really
can't stand when people will be here and
leave it you know they they live in this
bubble of like hey I gotta find out what
are the the main things out there well
you know say hey there's a whole bunch
of react jobs there's a whole bunch of
angular jobs yeah you know and let's see
if we could we could get those jobs yes
you could try to get those jobs but the
reality of things is you don't know the
concepts you guys don't know what it is
to be working in a company you guys
don't understand that the the projects
that you built with all the courses
that's out there that's not the real
world that's not how the real world or
the real world works when you work in a
company they throw you a whole bunch of
stuff that has never been created right
there's a whole bunch of things that
somebody might be like hey man how can
we get react to connect to a TV that
connects to a laptop that connects to a
freaking cell phone how can we make that
work and you're gonna be like are you
learn they're in my course on udemy of
course it didn't
so it's like you gotta understand the
concepts you gotta understand certain
things that's gonna make you a better
developer to be able to solve any
problem that's out there you can't come
in and thinking like hey man there's a
formula to this thing there is no
formula to what the hell what
development there's not this concepts
it's like you master a concept right
like you come in you say hey how to
build a page that's the first step right
first step is how to build a page you
know that you need HTML alright somebody
gives you a design and you say ok how do
I make this page I have to break it down
in sections right and then once you
break it down to sections you have to
know which tags you gotta use all right
so you understand those concepts cool
then you say ok it looks like right
because there's no colors this the font
look ugly the spacing looks ugly so you
say ok cool I gotta use CSS right cool
so now your job to CSS and then you
learn to see a sense right but then
there's certain things that you want to
put in certain areas but everything is
like going around and now going the
right way so now you gotta learn another
concept which is positioning right ok
you learn how to position things now
everything looks exactly how you want it
now you gotta learn another concept
which is somebody comes in and tells you
hey we want to see this page right here
where it was just one image we want that
image to change multiple times into
other images so now that's a slider what
do you do you have to go out and be like
ok cool I gotta learn JavaScript now you
learn JavaScript after you learn
JavaScript you're like ok cool I know
how to program but I still don't know
how to work with the Dom now you gotta
go back and learn how to work with the
Dom learn how to move objects how to add
classes how to remove and add elements
to the page ok you learn those things no
this is the next level somebody comes in
and tells you hey you know why you
remember that slider that that you put
up that's cool
but we want you to actually you see the
on the middle of the page you see
there's a ticker there where we're
getting stuff from Twitter and you have
like Twitter messages we want you to
make that live how can you do that right
so now you gotta go and learn Ajax you
know cool now I gotta learn Ajax you
keep going you learn Ajax now you're
getting have it you learn how to deal
with data you know well getting data
posting data you do that whole thing
then from there somebody comes in and
tells you oh you know what
this whole page that you had that we had
to go and refresh the page we don't want
you to do that no more we want you to
just when you come to this page we want
you to just you click a button and then
you do a get request to the server and
everything loads up when you want all
right from the data from the pages
whatever right so now you're like okay
cool so now I got to create a single
page app cool then you realize you're
like oh wait I can't do this with just
vanilla JavaScript this is gonna take me
a long time there must be a easier way
out there you go you search for a
framework somebody tells you hey you
need a further framework to create a
single page app and then the next thing
that you bump into is this huge wall of
like freaking 30,000 different
frameworks and then you like my god what
do I do now how do I learn 30,000
frameworks and then you realize and
somebody comes in taps on your shoulder
and goes like you don't need to learn
every framework out there because all
you need to know is the concepts once
you learn the concepts every framework
does the same thing they just change it
a little bit when that happens then you
realize oh every framework does the same
thing they just make your life a little
bit easier and that's it all right those
are tools those frameworks there are
tools that
supposed to choose one whenever you need
it for a sensitive situation whenever
you need it for something else you
choose it something else you choose it
right every form framework has a
situation for it right now it doesn't
matter if it's a Teletubby framework the
Harry Potter framework right if you know
the concepts from that framework that
knowledge you took from there you get to
transfer it over to another framework
you don't need to be like hey I gotta
become a master on this framework to be
able to understand the next framework no
you understand certain concepts from it
and then you're good when I tell you to
learn something it's for a reason you
know what I mean like I want to help
people out you know but same time it's
like I can't deal with other people
throwing shade it's like yo if you don't
like hyper app that's on you keep your
mouth shut
that's a because in reality you're
ruining it for other people's right I
don't care if you don't like hyper app
that's what you you know the reason why
I did that was because you're supposed
to be able to learn anything that's out
there we don't know what's gonna happen
next year right it could be Marco Jay
yes it could be a pre-act it could be
infernal it could be whatever right
you're not supposed to be in this box of
like hey man I'm trying to be an angular
master you know as I'm trying to be the
very best angular everyone
angular like no you don't want to be
that guy you know you don't want to be
one of those people that's on the
internet that's like what a tattoo on
their face like hey angular team
hey react team hey view team
hey uh amber team with tattoos on their
face of which framework their you know
favor is you're a web developer it
doesn't matter which framework it is
you're here to learn you're here to
become a better developer you don't want
to be one of these people that's over
here you know it's like I see people's
comments sometimes I'm like young people
are so freaking dumb they're like oh
leaving comments like oh man angular is
the best react is the best this is not
ps4 vs Xbox kids like you have certain
skills if you're good you're good if
you're not you just not all right that's
it this is not a favorite thing this is
not a thing where I'm like y'all
freaking I know how to choose hyper
abacus that's my favorite no it's not my
favorite my favorite is react my favor
is react all right now why would I
choose something the hype rap because I
want you guys to learn concepts that
you're going to have to learn for the
future the future is components the
future is immutable data right that's
the future right there's really no point
of me forcing down you throw here's a
learn react all of react and they're
from there learn all over redux if you
know how many comments I get all the
time where people say man redux is so
hard and it's like it's not really the
problem is that you just jumped over
30,000 different steps before you
learned Redux Redux is not for people
who don't know immutable data who don't
understand the concepts of it and they
don't understand how to deal with data
there's people that don't even know how
to you know how to move or how to change
an object let's say a Nestor object
somewhere down the line of the data they
don't even know how to use object that
assigned people don't even know how to
do that right but they want to jump into
react
something that you need to use that
every single day they want to jump into
something that's more harder for them
because they think they're gonna get a
job the companies they don't care about
you know if you know how to use react
what they care about is hey is this
person going to be able to debug this is
this person going to be able to solve
this problem like yeah they might have
react on their back-end they might have
and you know they might have you they
might have whatever but the problem is
do you know the concepts do you know how
to debug it do you know how to create
whatever they throw at you you know what
I really like those are the things that
are difficult you know when I create it
for this other company I did the the try
on tool for this company that was
working on I can't imagine any of any of
you guys I don't think that any of you
guys would be able to build that because
there's so many concepts in there that I
don't think that any of you guys would
be able to build that especially when
people try to skip steps right and the
reason why I'm telling you all this
stuff is because I'm a self-taught
developer I went through the hard things
already I went through the things that
you you're going through I'm trying to
save you time I'm trying to save you you
know embarrassment the embarrassments
that I went through in the beginning of
you know getting hired in companies in
the beginning first year and then not
being able to do what they wanted me to
do you know like being embarrassed you
get embarrassed right like it happens
you might get hired somewhere and
they'll be like hey can you fill this
distance in this and you're like I
hadn't learned this on udemy oh my god
what do I do now then you go back to
your tutorials and then you realize your
tutorials that you did
don't have those concepts the things
that they wanted to build they don't
have it there what do you do and that's
what I'm trying to save you guys from
you know I hope everybody that that's
watching this take something out of it
you know and understand what I exactly
what I'm doing man like you know nobody
said oh hey I'm just saying like you
know you guys in general you know in
general should wanna learn new stuff
should need to learn concepts like us
guys man I'm I'm being honest man you
guys don't know what it is like you're
not gonna be getting the easy things
like why do you think guys are getting
paid $100,000 they're not gonna pay
$100,000 to do to do apps guys you know
they're not teaching you that to learn
or to do that you know today's I hate we
gotta pay you $100,000 to build it to do
it
no guys it's gonna be difficult stuff
right if you don't get the concepts now
you either gonna be one of those guys
working for lower-end digital agency
working for wordpress don't little
WordPress themes I mean if that's what
your goal you know if that's your goal
to work at at an agency a local agency
working with WordPress go ahead you know
I'm speaking to the air I'm speaking to
the wall then because if that's that's
where you want to go and earn you know
do you know forgetting $15 an hour $20
an hour then that's on you man
you know so that's what I'm saying I'm
trying to help people out I'm trying to
save people out I'm trying to you know
help you guys out man but yeah yeah I'm
sorry if we sounded like our rent but
man I'm just looking through emails and
looking through things and I'm like man
people just don't wanna do the work like
there's a difference between me helping
you out how to get something done then
me doing it for you guys I'm not going
to do something for you
right if you're stuck on somewhere I can
guide you but don't expect me to give
you the answer that's not going to help
you you know what I mean so that's what
I'm doing right now man I'm trying to
help you guys out I want you guys to
succeed I don't want you guys to be out
here getting embarrassed I went through
that you know maybe I should make a
video about that like you know in the
beginning of the first year where I was
working I worked so much on HTML CSS and
like working with the Dom that excuse me
that I don't even know how to do ajax
ajax is extremely important man and I
mean the whole first year I didn't know
how to do ajax
right so mind you when I started this
other company they wanted me to work
with with data you know pulling data
from the backend I didn't know how to do
none of those things right because my
tutorials that I was looking online and
coding courses didn't teach me none of
those things right so now what I'm doing
is I'm repaying you guys with like
really good quality
content of things that you're really
going to need you know there's a lot of
stuff that you need to learn and you
need to understand to be able to do this
this it's not just like okay I know HTML
I know how to make a variable I know how
to make a loop no there's a a way of
thinking a way of reacting to things a
way of getting certain concepts you got
to understand this industry changes
constantly man freaking lights is going
out so oh yeah man like you don't
understand it man I want to help you
guys out man but at the same time it's
like you know you know I need to really
any totally work man worry I'm next to
my Phillips
word man or what happened to Matt you
know we haven't seen in a long time man
they gave him a taste that's it
me personally to be honest with you
Ms where's the MSL 2015 CSS grades is a
waste of time to be honest with you
that's a waste of time you who actually
do stuff faster than trying to learn CSS
grids that's not really the right way to
to set up a layout
personally I like dinner with floats or
even sometimes flex boxes depends on the
situation but CSS great I'll be honest
that's just a waste of time
that's like people come up I feel like
they come up sometimes with things that
are not needed like if they really
wanted to come up with something
advanced for for CSS instead of done
wasting time with with CSS grids
they shouldn't create variables for
variables for CSS they should have
created loops for CSS but of course we
gotta use a third party thing like sass
that compiles to CSS but by now CSS
should have those things
yeah so whole bunch of workarounds you
gonna do with grids is dumb I'll be
honest don't even waste of time it's one
of those things it's like I don't know
if you guys have heard of this thing
called be ven BAM it's like one of those
dumbest things that I've seen BM CSS
school was a block block element
modifier
it's one of the dumbest things that I've
seen in my life
pretty much is like writing CSS classes
like that but in state that's a -
success but it's the button - - state -
danger that's like one of the dumbest
things I've seen for sure because what
it does is like it creates original CSS
classes but the problem about it is that
now you gotta think about creating a CSS
class now you got a dinner it's like hey
am I using a underscore or am i using a
regular - like like this like why what's
the point of this to say hey I got a
page and then under it there's a page
and then underscore underscore content
and then do the same thing with the
homepage underscore underscore
copywriting it's one of the dumbest
things ever like people you know
sometimes people try to find a solution
on something that doesn't need a
solution like people don't need a
solution to write CSS classes like you
sound retarded when you know I'll say
this freaking cornball don't try to tell
me hey we should use VN I'm like bro
this looks dumb there's a waste of time
you know in this people are liable
who'll be like man we just gotta jump on
this thing whatever is like mash it up
for
no sometimes man people just like
wasting time man you know everybody
wants to be famous
alright everybody wants to come up with
their own ways to do things they want to
create their own things you know they
want to create their own frameworks they
want to create their own stuff
and I mean sometimes I've been I'm
guilty of that you know I've created my
own frameworks I've done my own original
things but the reason why I've done is
because it solves a purpose there's
people that's just not solving anything
they used to be like oh cool I'm just
gonna waste six months of my life
creating a framework that nobody's that
we're gonna use and then it's not
solving anything you know what I mean
like how many CSS frameworks are out
there that don't show off anything like
the user interface look like ish
freaking the the the columns and the
grids look retarded you know it's like
why would you use that if you already
have tool strapped right now something
like boma the IO makes sense because
it's using Flex boxes and then on top of
that is nice to look at right it's
really good to look at like also to like
something like semantic UI looks good
alright but this thing's like it you I
it is skeleton you are UI these are what
is it then Yahoo created their own CSS
grade like there's so many different
things that people create and you're
like why are you creating this if
there's already good ones out there
you're not creating nothing new you know
that was like one of my main problems
with with UJ yes and it's like why are
you trying to solve a problem that
already has been solved right like why
are you trying to merge two frameworks
into one like what's the purpose
all right it's like if you're somebody
who enjoys writing your templates in in
a different page with regular HTML then
you're going to use angular if you're
one person who enjoys GSX writing your
HTML in your JavaScript and you enjoy
using different life cycles you're going
to use react what is the point of saying
hey I'm just gonna merge both of them
you know what I mean
bootstrap for is dumb to me to be honest
with you guys because bootstrap for
change a lot of things and they add a
whole bunch of stuff that what they
needed to do was keep all the classes
are still original bootstrap so when
somebody comes in they could literally
just upgrade their website without
breaking anything super fast like hey I
want to use flex boxes but I want to use
the same classes that you had before
people people don't want to have to
reinvent the wheel when they upgrade
from most rapid rates of bootstrap for
so that's where they messed up there you
know and they say oh we want to create
new things bringing new new features but
I'm like do you really save anybody's
time by doing it do you create something
that was solving a problem it's like you
created more problems instead of solving
it
I'm reading through the comments right
now
yeah a lot of times people create stuff
to not become irrelevant you know a lot
of times that happens Joe is it wise to
build any of my portfolio projects with
WordPress or not yeah you could do that
you could do that with WordPress the
only thing is you got to be careful with
WordPress because the problem with
WordPress is WordPress is easy to get
into but hard to get out of all right
and what I say that is it's easy to jump
into
WordPress to learn a and you go get a
job right away right but it's hard for
you to go from WordPress to like real
web development it's hard because most
companies when they see like somebody
with a lot of WordPress experience they
look at them like oh this person does
like digital agency stuff all the time
and listen that and it's hard for people
are seen it's hard for people to leave
that world you know for me to leave the
WordPress world took me like two years
like it wasn't easy you know if I would
if I woulda really went back into time I
wouldn't never try to get into WordPress
because of how difficult it was for me
to switch to like major companies like
to hire me after that like yeah I could
go work in little agencies and this and
that but it was hard to get that
approval because everybody knows
WordPress is like a platform it's not
really it's not really like what
developer I mean it is what development
and it's not at the same time I don't
know if that makes sense
yeah you could definitely get stuck in
there man
yep
you know I see people all the time talk
about WordPress hey man trying to learn
we're president that much yeah you can
try to learn it but it depends on what
you're going for like if you live in in
a small town where there's no
opportunities there's no jobs then yeah
I learned it because then you go open up
your own shop you go go and work for
another agency around there this and
that in make money you know survive it's
all about survival in this world right
but if you have bigger aspirations and
you want to become a bigger and better
developer I will try to stay away from
me and you know just don't waste the
time of it cuz it depends on what you
want to do it yes ac peñalosa 1983 says
I'm in the wordpress trap at least it
pays the bills yes it definitely pays
the bills it was paying my bills for a
while but it took me a long time to get
away from that that's for sure
where do we bout to come up with
t-shirts you know a milk stars what up
son it's been a while man they got you
stuck over there Amazon I've got the you
work at Amazon oh I forgot what was the
company I think Amazon you gotta let
them take you out man tell them hey man
let me out
oh AT&amp;amp;T you had the AT&amp;amp;T sweatshop
hurricane you had the ACNC sweatshop
when you're told to let you out
sometimes man yo word my poor boy milk
stars man pour milk stars man haven't
seen I mean let's pick up milks armies
have you dropped any new videos man you
slack man he was a very promising you
Superman
what happened let me see damn man
three months ago bro oh my god that's
your last video damn come on bro we need
new content for real man
yeah now little stars is legit man
do it is man funny like the rose to be
live now we just we miss you man we we
need content from you man you have a
different perspective that people enjoy
like come on one video for a week you
could do that man one video per week
come on man you could do that come on
we're gonna bring you back yo we bring
him back no star sign
milk stars as a TV T right now man we
gotta bring them back man we gotta bring
my boy back man
we need him the industry needs in the
community needs him we're one video come
on man just to break the record man just
break the record break that three months
record just started from scratch and
then your next video after that you
could drop it another three months but
come on we gotta break that record man
you created a blog was what's your
website man let me know who took you now
what you working on now milk stars man I
remember you was working outside and
last time I talked to you I mean I know
you probably have personal projects man
because every developer out here has
personal projects meant milk starts blog
review word
what they're using our AT&amp;amp;T milk stars
let the people know yeah I think I think
yourself we use using react to create
like dashboards and stuff like that so
okay League of Legends moosic streaming
app listen man I want to download league
of legends so bad but I'm scared I'm
being honest I'm scared to download it
because if I download it I'm gonna get
sucked in and I'm not gonna get anything
done because every time that I've
downloaded League of Legends
I get sucked in man every single time
that's why I'm now YouTube yeah man
League of Legends is crazy bro for real
man I've been stuck on it
look I quit it like two three years ago
I quit
League of Legends man completely because
I used to be doing about like four or
five hours and every game used to be
like an hour long and then my eyes will
hurt and when I used to come out of play
my my hands will be like this shaking I
don't know why but I guess all the
excitement or the though emotions like I
used to come out of there like shaking I
was like I can't be doing this this
thing cannot be good for me you know
because it's like I haven't an addictive
personality to some games like that like
I love MOBA like now I play paradigm but
Paragon is a 20 to 30 minute game but I
can't play League League is like its
addicting that it's like especially
now is like I can't
he was a storm yeah somebody told me
about here was a storm yeah no that's
what I did to BT web developer he says I
quit daughter tool to like seven times
uninstalled and downloaded multiple
times but yeah I eventually quit for
real now I just play one chess game a
day
see that's good that's good for sure I
try to I try to stay away from it man
now I feel like now programming is my
new addiction like I'm spending a lot of
hours like you know I come in I create
videos for you guys I talk about code
then I hang out with you guys then I
also I'm also creating games you know
and then it's like man this could be
dangerous you know what I mean
am i putting too many hours into this
you know I mean luckily all of this
stuff pays me you know what I mean I
gotta make some type of money out of
this but imagine if I didn't like I'll
be really bad you know I know some
people who who are in the same situation
that might may not I studied like five
seven hours a day and but they not even
working they're not even like you know
doing anything man yo pote thank you bro
thank you thanks for a dollar man we
needed that man for real man I really
appreciate it bro
let me see Mandela fxs just learn five
languages PHP VJ s react no sass throw
into rails number of you hyper I picked
a little Ruby instead of rails if you
want
I think sales can use for back in why
did I stop the crystal Lang videos why
because look you know Thank You Andrei
for coming back I love this kid look
that's my boy Andrei man yeah man I
stopped because there's a lot of people
people are not events man and it kind of
sucks because it's like I'm trying to
guide people through this thing and I'm
trying to teach them stuff that it's
more advanced and they're like we don't
care about it but what they don't want
to say is that that's what's gonna make
you a better developer they don't get
that they see like a dollar sign of like
oh I want to get a hundred thousand
dollars but it's like man you can't get
a hundred thousand dollars if you don't
know the basics you don't know how to
make none of this there's this topic so
you don't wanna be like none of this
advanced topics like you know so what I
did the crystal Lang is like they look
at it the same way how they looking at
hyper app right now they're like hey you
know I looked at indeed I didn't find no
jobs for hype rap and what people don't
understand is like hyper app is
JavaScript man you know crystal name is
freaking just a regular programming
language with Ruby syntax like you
literally if you become guarding in high
colors in crystal Lang you can learn go
quicker if you get good with crystal
lang you can freaking know Ruby it's
like you pretty much know Ruby so it's
like they don't understand those
concepts so it's like I'm speaking to
like the wall you know what I mean
comes to those type of topics man yeah I
got I got switched setup man but this
time I wanted to just do it through here
through my phone hello Sara Lee hello
from Korea I'm a back-end developer and
I have a question the Spring Framework
pretty much used in the States
sorry about my bad english don't worry
about it your English is perfect
yeah people you spring till this day
spring is very old it's a very old
framework and people still use it to
this day
yeah crystals way easier than go that's
for sure and it's actually fun you know
it's like you actually get to enjoy
coding it yeah a lot of people use
crystal nook rasam is free yes yes
FinTech but at that same time when
people think like that but like oh but
go has jobs and crystals don't do you
think like those guys that get hired for
crystal leng their background is not
crystal and for goldang do you think
that their background is on golden no
their background is on C or freakin
Pascal and a whole bunch of different
weird languages that me and you look at
it and we're like I'm not gonna learn
that you know what I mean it's the same
thing as crystal it's like those those
people that go in and the deep end and
try to learn a whole bunch of abstract
technologies like you know even the guys
that use elixir right those guys those
are not the regular people the regular
people are the guys
who are looking just into JavaScript and
PHP and that's it that's where your
knowledge stops right those are not the
guys that the big companies want to be
touching their gold lamé at all they
want people that is out here like
creating cool stuff and like who are not
scare who are interesting the technology
they're not interested on the language
