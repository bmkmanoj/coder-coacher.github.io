to the world
or hey we're gonna put in smaller clips
for the website and for the YouTube
community ok so we are here let's see
go into my channel I want to see the
questions that people had so let's go to
coding phase okay I'm just letting
everybody get in here you know give them
a chance you know I'm about to go live
to our Instagram we bout to make this
live everywhere you know what I mean
let's see if we get this in okay got the
channel let's go into the community
all right in case you guys haven't seen
this before you can come here and into
the YouTube channel and actually see
some of the post I release like today I
say right here the questions you want me
to answer or topics you want me to talk
about we will be live at 9 p.m. Eastern
Time
okay so we got a couple of different
comments you know see what else talk
about what's the most common server-side
language for pwace also if possible talk
about Peter gates coming to iOS 11.3 to
be honest with you I haven't really kept
up with that so I'm not gonna go into it
let me see what else what else we got in
here
let me see after someone was comfortable
with Java
another JavaScript will you recommend
that what will you recommend that
beginner to learning react or wait
sometimes guys gotta know how to word or
phrase your questions man you know I'm
gonna try to read this but I'm gonna
translate it okay so sometimes it gets
crazy like that
you know I want you guys to come in and
show me some love
write some questions and I'll answer it
back but yeah I need to write it down
properly okay so it says after someone
is comfortable with vanilla JavaScript
would you recommend that a beginner to
learning read where will you recommend
that beginners to learn react or PHP in
Arabic course to have a better shall be
coming junior developers yes so
basically the question is let me sum it
down and put in more simple terms if I'm
a beginner right if I'm a junior
developer would I recommend someone to
say hey focus on learn and react and
focus on PHP larva yes
that's exactly what I've been saying for
the past year I've been here on YouTube
for one whole year right and I've been
explaining to people
I'm like hey you gotta choose either
angular react or like let's say
something like PHP laravel WordPress
like you gotta choose here your lane
rang trying to master everything trying
to jump on every single framework trying
to do everything that's out there it's
not gonna help you find a job what is
gonna do is gonna make you constantly be
worrying about
Oh what's the latest thing what should I
learn you know you could spend a whole
year you know looking into was the best
thing to do right trust me take it from
me I could have probably started working
I don't know two three months in and I
didn't start working until like a year I
spent a whole year trying to learn
everything from backbone to angular to
ember to I learned no GS
learned a little bit of PHP out first I
was learning Ruby on Rails and then
because everybody was like learn no js'
at the time and it's like Ruby is dying
I was like okay i'ma jump to no js' so
those are the mistakes that I made right
when I tell you guys something is
because of my own mistakes don't do the
mistakes that I did
you know what I mean like if I give you
an advice is for a reason I've already
been down this path as a you know as a
self-taught developer somebody who's
learning online learning or on udemy
learning on a coke atom it's in
treehouse free code camp the whole
shebang the whole list Pluralsight I've
been through every single website write
the things that you gotta focus on are
the things that is gonna get you a job
right away you know sometimes you might
play around with like a new technology
or new framework just to play around hey
but that's not your main focus that's
like something that you're doing your
off time oh yeah cool let's go check out
Elm or oh cool let's go check out elixir
oh let's go check out golang but let's
be honest you're not gonna go get that
elixir job as a junior developer you're
not gonna go get that gold leg job as a
junior developer that never worked at a
company like those companies are not
gonna trust you the ones that are gonna
trust you are you know you becoming
either a front-end developer you snore
CSS and JavaScript right and knowing at
least one framework either react or
angular everything else is irrelevant to
be honest with you all right
every other framework out there is
irrelevant there's really no need for
you to learn it right even though I told
you to learn um how you call it hyper
app but hyper app is is almost related
to react and redux so it's almost like
learning the same thing so that's the
main reason why I told you guys to learn
it right now um as far as like the PHP
backs you know back in like you want to
learn something like PHP laravel you
want to learn the latest PHP PHP seven
you want to be able to come in and say
hey I know at least one database right
and most likely it has to be my sequel
you know a lot of times people spend a
lot of you know a lot of their time you
know trying to learn MongoDB and then
they end up never working at a company
that uses MongoDB right like you gotta
understand like what's in your area what
are the type of companies that are
around you like let's say if you live in
San Francisco you live in New York City
most likely at some point you're gonna
have to use MongoDB if you live in
Detroit you live in and I don't know in
Iowa somewhere if you live in
Mississippi most likely you're not using
MongoDB right so that's one of the
things that I always tell people like do
little research in your area find out
what the jobs have what exactly is it
that they're hiring for and yam and make
sure you get in there okay now let's see
let's see what else we got here what
other topics we can talk about let's see
the chat box make sure this chat box is
good I see that it's not moving which
tells me the chat actually went down for
a second so it's okay um let me see what
else see what else people are putting in
let me see if we go into the community
see what they put as questions is there
any limit on the sauce one can have
listen the source sometimes can be
unlimited you know what I mean like your
boys out here sauce in it you know pour
a little sauce on that you know what I
mean we doing this live okay now let's
see what else we have here which parts
of CSS and JavaScript are enough to know
- wait this is what I'm saying guys
sometimes I'm reading the questions and
it's like wait this doesn't even seem
like it's English it's like three
sentences mixed into one all right
which parts of CSS and JavaScript is
enough to be ready for an entry job
position okay if you're looking to get
hired right the very first thing is if
you could go to a website like let's say
dribble comm so I'm gonna screen share
right now so you guys guys that have
never seen this before
you guys could actually see it okay so
put this right here so you got dribble
comm if somebody comes in and says hey
let's say a landing page right
a company gives you a landing page and
tells you hey we would like you to build
us this website can you do it right for
a lot of you guys you're probably like
oh man this is easy like you know what I
mean like this is easy I could build
this website with my eyes closed
yes you can build it with your eyes
closed but a lot of people they don't
know how to break down this whole
website and build it themselves okay so
once you are ready to say hey I can
build the same website just give me the
assets
give me the fonts I can build you that
website all right if you are ready to do
that you could get a job right now you
know a lot of times people who are
thinking like they need like a lot of
skills are like man I gotta be the best
JavaScript developer it's like not
really
your entry job nobody's expecting you to
be a genius in JavaScript JavaScript is
supposed to be like hey can the new guy
go edit a menu can the new guy go change
a few things on on a page those are the
things that you're going to be doing as
your first job sometimes you might be in
a situation where you know a company
tries to scheme it right and this
happens all the time a company tries to
scheme it and what they do is they say
hey let's try to hire a junior developer
and let's try to get him to do as much
stuff as possible right so they might
have you doing stuff that in reality
you're not ready for it right in reality
they needed to have a mid to senior
level developer working on it but
because they didn't have the budget or
because they say you know what let's see
if this guy could do it if he could do
it is great because we're paying him as
a junior developer and we could save so
much money right in situations like that
when they try to scheme it you might be
able to be doing you might be doing like
more difficult and complex things but
that doesn't happen all the time
that's rare right most of the time as a
junior developer that's your first job
if you go into a company there's
probably two to three other developers
in there that are on a senior level
right you're the new guy you're there to
give a hand you're not there to
architect the whole website you're not
there to build a site from scratch 99%
at a time the whole website is already
complete and all you have to do is I
hate but you go build the marketing page
hey could you go fix this this or form
could you go fix this menu oh this thing
is off like two pixels those are the
things that you're gonna be doing as a
junior developer in 99% at a time right
like I said there's times where you
might have to do some complex things but
you are a junior developer right the
company knows that so they're gonna give
you time for you to learn it and they're
gonna give you time to actually look
online and figure it out right your job
is to be a problem solver you
job is not so being a genius right if he
was to be a genius and they wanted a
genius then they could go get a genius
you get what I'm saying like then I
higher they wouldn't be hiring you to to
basically do a genius job to be honest
with you okay so when are you ready like
I said as soon as you can build a page
just like that I give you a design you
have this design you come in and you say
hey cool here you go Joe I built it for
you that's it you showed me that you can
do your job that's when you really get
hired okay so stop worrying about how
long you should wait how long all you
need to wait to become a developer how
long is gonna take you guys the moment
that you can start building a website
out of a design you are ready my friend
okay now let's see what else we have
here man we got a couple of people list
let's see what up to the people in the
chat room man let's see what up to the
people who are here live we got Ramsay
Jordan always first you know

tastic is in here midnight code let's
see what else
yeah midnight go yeah I mean your
question is good the only thing is that
I don't want to answer something that I
don't have that much knowledge into
because I haven't really put in time to
progressive web apps
I just haven't it's like right now
somebody asks me hey Joe do you know
about JavaScript proxies I'm gonna be
like bro I don't haven't spent time Oni
me to give you an a an answer to it that
I don't know why I haven't spent time on
it will be your the service you know
what I mean so but yeah man any other
questions you have let me know Kelvin
Davis Ramsay Jordan who more deposits
let me see
let me see let me see Rohan saying Peter
Navarro the third salsa dude we got
Scotty rocks well we got Donovan we got
Victor Rivera
we got real tough candy in here what up
my what you doing man what's up
we got 84 music in here who else is in
here man let's see let's see test Connor
we got a couple of people's man with a
pronounced turn look car to lock car I
don't know how to say your name man
listen man somebody was trying to kill
me because I I chopped up this guy's
name was his name marco maximilian fish
March I don't know I don't know how to
say his name listen people chopped up my
name all the time be you know I'm tough
right so it's like it's like it's not a
big deal you know if I chop up
somebody's name that's just how it is
man you know somebody was like man you
gotta be careful you chopping up his
name as I bro like listen white people
chop up my name all the time they be
like your name is Joseph Ray Oh Garcia
oh your name is Joseph Garcia Santos is
a middle name right like I don't be
trippin on that you know what I mean so
if your name is some weird European name
your name is some weird African name and
I chop it up it's not my fault it's not
my culture it's not what I do you know
what I mean dad so so what's the
questions what questions you guys have
man let me see
he just Dean wants to know is like yo
don't read names please read the
questions and answer us damn do this out
here pressing me it's like I'm at the
wall right now you know what I mean
that's like those came out with the
ratchet is like yo you gonna you gonna
answer these questions or not be you
know what I mean laughing dude that's
crazy you gotta ask nicely man you know
watch your mouth you know what I mean so
listen we live man so let me see what
was this guy's name he just Dean says do
I need to know any framework as a junior
web developer I mean I just pretty much
answered it in the last video do you
need to know any frameworks yes you do
thank you
come on man is 2018 2019 2020 man like
you need a framework right like nobody
is actually coding here overall you know
nobody's going in out here raw you know
what I mean like nobody's over here
making applications raw nobody does that
you know I mean like doing vanilla
JavaScript applications makes no sense
in 2018
right you're basically writing more code
than what you need to be doing I mean
have you ever try to do ajax with just
plain vanilla JavaScript do you know how
many lies you have to do you know what I
mean like why would you do that when you
have something beautiful like axials or
you have even the fetch API or you know
what I mean or even jQuery you know what
I'm saying like nobody codes just like
vanilla JavaScript like that's a waste
of time you know it's like you're
supposed to know how JavaScript works
but at some point you have to say hey
man what do I do
do I want to look smart for people and
say I'm a great programmer and I could
write everything of another JavaScript
in it super efficient and you don't have
to load no libraries and spend yourself
like a whole week doing something that
with react you could have done in two
seconds you get on saying I hope you
understand that
and so it's like as a developer right
when you work for a company people care
about the time people care about how
long it's gonna take you to build some
trickly with angular some people's brain
work perfectly with JavaScript me
personally um not JavaScript react so me
personally I like react way better
because it's almost like saying just
plain JavaScript I don't have to learn
you know novi binders from like you I
don't have to know or ng there is ng
that 30,000
different things like you know different
API is this how you do HTTP requests
this how you do I forgot all the names
like I haven't touched angular in a
while and thank God I don't have to you
know what I mean but when you use this
something like angular of you like you
have to be learning the way how they do
things with react is more like hey it's
just JavaScript if you ever use a object
if you ever wrote an object if you ever
wrote a yes 6 class like that's a that's
all you need to know it's not that
difficult if you know a little bit of
object-oriented programming that's all
you need to know I mean you don't need
to learn rebounders remember that the
most I guess concepts that you gotta get
used to is States and props that's it
that's all you really gotta get used to
when it comes to to react everything
else is just JavaScript so you gotta
choose either one you know what I mean
so let's continue guys let's see what
else we got in here let me see let me
see let me see we got a couple of people
man we got a couple of people man come
on guys let's see you any of any more
questions let me know
Dennis jr. was good yo why are your
thoughts on team treehouse Tech degree
disregarding the price do you think the
treehouse Tech degree will make you a
more attractive candidate on the job
market let's look at it let's do a live
right so team treehouse Tech degree
let's go live kids so let's share the
screen let's see
same treehouse Tech degree okay let's
see what exactly do they offer
okay front end okay you can go from
beginning in just three to twelve months
with a tech degree like okay
in that project review professional
portfolio I mean this you could do it on
your own and deaf project or review I
mean I don't know to be honest I don't
see anything that catches my attention
you know what I mean like look at this
like this and you say price is not that
important but to me price is important
because most people can't afford $200 a
month like this is like your phone bill
your internet bill or and gas bill put
together in one $200 you get what I'm
saying now
does that make sense to you you know for
something that you can go and pretty
much learn everything on your own like
on my website alone and even if you
wanted to discredit my website you say
hey Joe your website is your website or
could you please review Pluralsight
could you please review teen tree house
could you please review uh uh other
sites and your own guys it doesn't
matter what website it is if you go to
my website and you go say the time line
look at the time line if you want all
you have to do is follow that time line
and then from there you go you buy the
courses on udemy ten dollars
all right you buy separately you don't
even have to sign up to my website my
websites ten dollars I'm offering
basically everything that they offering
for two hundred dollars a month you're
probably going to my website get it for
twenty or ten dollars a month very like
there's a huge difference between both
of them right $210 it's like you know
it's like if we put this on programming
to say if parentheses team treehouse
is greater than Joe's coding phase what
you want sure you choose I don't know
it's up to you right if money's not a
problem for you then go ahead choose
thin tree house for something that
pretty much is way cheaper than that
right now what's the difference in tree
house and any other website block i/o
Udacity all these websites they all
doing the same thing so be honest with
you guys
you don't need somebody to come in and
tell you on your project you know your
you're missing a couple of pixels to the
left like you don't need that right if
you need somebody to come in and review
your portfolio you get it here for free
I'm calling face.com you go what I'm
saying
this communities you go to what a
freaking meetup you show it to other
developers and say hey man what do you
think about my portfolio hey man you
look at this project what do you think I
should do with this should I fix it up
should I add a couple of new features in
the backend right you know what I mean
like I don't know to me it doesn't make
sense to spend $200 or something that
you can learn on your own for ten twenty
dollars right and some my safe man
I just don't want to go to no meetup I
just want to come home and do it on my
own and isn't that then in reality you
really don't want it that bad you know
it could be successful for some people
and some people might be blinded to say
hey team tree house was the one that
made me successful or Pluralsight made
me successful or even people might come
in and saying you know five years from
now saying coding phase dot-com made me
successful it's not really coding phase
not commenting treehouse none of these
websites that's gonna make you
successful it's how much work you put in
yourself it's like right now I'm going
to the gym you know what I mean I'm
going to the gym I'm working on all this
stuff if I slack if I eat unhealthy if I
do whatever you know then that's on me
you get what I'm saying like at the end
of the month when you see there's no
results you're like damn man you know I
I didn't lose weight I didn't learn how
to go at the end of the month
that's on me you get what I'm saying so
is it worth it is choosing a tech degree
like this isn't it I don't even know
what's what too cold is like this is
more like you know it's like online boot
camp slash let's just grade your your
portfolios and your little projects that
we give you you get what I'm saying like
to me it doesn't make sense you know
like you could pay that to a regular
developer who's gonna come in put listen
put this on Craigslist right now instead
of you spending $200 put on Craigslist
looking to pay $40 $50 a month to a
developer to come in and grade my
projects trust me there's a developer
out there that will grade it for you you
know what I'm saying like you gotta be
smart you know sometimes we we think
like hey man like it has a beautiful
site you know it's a company is this and
dad this is legit guys it's not the
company that's gonna make you a
developer is you you know it's the same
thing that I tell people all the time
and the biggest I guess beef that people
think and they have with me when I say
freako campus it could be a trap for
people is because people think like hey
this one location is gonna have all the
answers it doesn't work like that it's
how much work you put in right like when
you go to my website I'll come in and
teach you all the basics teach you
everything that you need to learn to
become a developer right but then from
there you come in and you follow all my
projects right but now if you say hey I
watched one video and now keep watching
another video if you're watching another
video and jumping from projects of
projects and you never took the time to
build a project on your own
four months later don't tell me hey how
come I went through your website and I
still don't know how to code it's like
nah you had to put in your time you have
to put in your own work you got what I
say some this teen treehouse tech degree
worth it no Udacity degree no this
things are not even degrees like it
should be to me person
I think it should be even illegal to
even call it a degree because what it
does it tells people like oh this is
like Jade like I don't even know what
are the rules of like calling a
university or something like that you
get one sound like wasn't Donald Trump
being sued because he called you know
real estate university or something I
doubt Trump University or something like
that you can't do that you get what I'm
saying because is it's lying to the
people it's like people think like oh
yeah I'm getting a degree I've seen
people send me in like their resumes
like Oh Joe could you please check my
resume and SS team treehouse Tech degree
brew that's not even a degree you get
what I'm saying I hope people understand
that
I hope people do understand that like
that's not a degree that's just some
online source you know what I'm saying
like nobody's gonna take that serious so
for you to be paying you know $200 a
month paying $200 to teen tree house you
might as well pay $50 on udemy and
basically be good for a whole bunch of
months with $50 you get what I'm saying
like spending I don't know $600 to to
learn all the stuff that some other dude
just went on udemy and got for $50 like
it doesn't make sense
guys I'm I'm talking right now I don't
know what to tell you guys like I'm
looking at the live chat but it's like
if I'm still in a conversation I have to
finish that conversation before I could
jump into something else you got what
I'm saying like I can't look at the chat
room all the time but let's see
let's see what people were saying to
chair Wolfpack you already know Oh
unless he was girls girls good I'm
reading a reading I'm going down the
chatroom
you
what company was offering Kelvin Davis
says one company was offering me 90 to
120 dollars an hour but 10 to 15 hours a
week I mean that I don't know that's
like part-time no that's like what
that's like it's like that's not even
worth it
I'm saying so I'm still reading man I'm
reading the comments I'm reading what
people are saying what people want me to
answer so let me see
okay test Connor says hey Joe even
though I'm not a senior-level should I
still give it a shot and apply yes you
know I would definitely apply to any job
even if it's a senior level even if it
says mid-level whatever right listen a
lot of times it's an HR person who's
creating this you know everybody says we
want to senior level developer but
nobody wants to pay for a senior level
developer you get what I'm saying I hope
you understand that company's always
trying to save money so if you come in
and and you try to if you come in and
you try to actually go into a company
right and say hey man I'm applied to you
guys I'm here for the interview you know
they call you in you know what to do
just do your interview whatever they ask
you you good you know what I'm saying
like if they want you they're gonna hire
you if they don't want you they just
don't call you back
that's it but they called you in because
they needed you you know what I'm saying
so I applied to every single job that's
out there because you never know who's
gonna actually hire you sometimes our
companies say we need a senior developer
to help us out with this and then when
you get to the company they're doing
like super simple websites you get what
I'm saying like sometimes they might
actually like I've seen the dumbest
things like you know I've been to
companies where they actually oh do you
know sighs you know I was like and I'm
looking at them like bro like do I
no sass like a freaking jungle sass
around you know what I mean I juggle
everything that CSS around like this
thing is easy to me I do that with my
eyes closed right and for them they're
like oh wow you know how to do but go
wet pack and I'm like bro like where are
you you know you gotta say like for them
some companies for them is like oh this
is new digital latest things because all
the developers are are in that company
they don't know they don't do none other
stuff right so you might come in as a
junior developer and no more than a
senior developer that's been there for
ten years in that company because he
hasn't kept up with the new things so
that's the beauty of it you get what I'm
saying so just go to the interviews man
you'd be surprised sometimes you go to a
job interview and you're gonna be
surprised he's gonna be like damn this
was a and they wanted a senior that you
know senior level developer like this
was easy like hey you just wanted me to
edit a couple of things around the page
and and you know push the react router
into a like that's it and that's what
she was looking for senior developer for
you get what I'm saying like you be
surprised

the teen tree house is like yeah you
could do those projects on your own like
you don't need somebody to come in and
give you say hey man here's the tap in
the back you went to teen tree house
like nobody nobody needs that I've been
telling people that since the boot camps
I've been telling people since teen
treehouse since the beginning of time
since Jesus since Jesus came out to
wound you know I was there and I was
telling those like you're broke you know
they had the three kings the three kings
is like they were talking in the
background should we should we go to a
boot camp I'm like girl bro listen I
know the Romans is around here but you
don't need no boot camp you know I been
since the beginning of time to telling
this the real like you you don't need to
be spending your money like that man
like a lot of you guys can't even afford
a freakin MacBook Pro and dudes is
worried about man we need to pay
somebody else five hundred dollars for
one course we need to pay somebody for
two hundred bro you can't even afford a
MacBook Pro right now like you're not in
a situation to be spending $200 a month
like when you get to that situation you
got one say like when you were at that
point where you can say hey man I'm
throwing money in the air and I'm
balling out here and throwing a hundred
thousand and in the air like that then
we could talk but you can't even
freaking buy a MacBook Pro out here I'm
not saying you I'm saying a lot of
people in here you got are selling a lot
of people's like bro I throw MacBook
Pros be like lose this out here like for
that you get honest answers like for you
to say I'm gonna throw $200 a month or
hey say hey I'm gonna sign this for $400
course or hey I'm going get myself in
there for $20,000 you gotta be caught
your mind you gonna say like listen you
guys got to set your life's priorities
straight you know what I mean like you
can't it's like opening up think about
this like opening up a business or any
when you become a developer this is your
business it's like the same thing as
your body is like how they say your body
is your temple you can't start your
business on a debt you you know you
can't owe money as soon as you start
your business
you gotta say like you going to Udacity
you go to all this BS degrees like
you're starting - while some dude went
in there he signed up to coding phase
for ten bucks and he was like yo $30 I
cancelled her account
I'm working I've seen this all the time
dudes come in they sign up wash their
hands three months cancel that account
working you gotta say like they good now
while some dude is out there crying
right now oh man I went to this bootcamp
I signed up I don't even know what to do
I'm 20,000 in I had to take another
10,000 in dev so I could survive and pay
the rent for the past few months and
this this and that is like bro like use
your brain you never if you're already
in a bad situation you never put
yourself in another bad situation you
get what I'm saying
like come on by the way there's a plug
go check out this guy um what's this
guy's name ramsey now rent they're about
to say Rams each other Dave Ramsey Dave
Ramsey dude has an amazing channel it's
just about how to get your life in order
right like a lot of people need that you
know what I mean
a lot of people don't even know how to
pay their own bills and other people
don't know what's what's important in
life a lot of people don't even know how
to manage their own money like tomorrow
you could be in here and say I got
$100,000 and get yourself in $200,000
debt so now you're walking around - you
get on saying like right now I'm plus on
everything everything that I do is plus
I look at my mint account is green
meaning that I have no negatives for the
past I don't know since I don't know
when everything is plus meaning that
everything is profit everything is my
net worth is going up when you come in
and you do best decisions and you don't
even know what the hell you're doing in
life getting yourself in in that and and
paint buying and paying for stuff that
you don't need like come on man you get
what I'm saying like and not to call you
out on it but it's just like the fact
that you as soon as you come in and
you're like man don't worry about the
price I do have to worry about the price
because
who's who could freaking be paying this
stuff like you gotta say like that's not
worth it and you could be spending it
and other stuff or even build your own
application and then use that money that
you was gonna pay $200 to to team
treehouse and actually use that money to
promote your website on Google Adwords
and you know YouTube videos the
advertising creator an amazing
application something cool and social
networks whatever use that money all you
need is like $1,000 $2,000 use that
money to promote it on Facebook groups
use that money to promote it in
advertising
be smart that money doubles up you know
it comes back and every week you keep on
your investing look into it man like
don't spend your money like that
you
let me see the missing I'm reading
everybody staying let me see
was girls girls good was good
see what else I'm reading reading any
questions guys put questions I see a lot
of comments but no questions have a
question is learning animation hot
should I learn green socks do people use
Adobe anime and websites yes green socks
green sock green socks green sock is is
very important I was like looking
randomly I said let me check let me see
right now like Disney job we're gonna
show you something that I saw today
developer so I live in kinetic right so
the biggest companies out here are Walt
Disney Walt Disney Company they also
have a lot of jobs for ESPN so those are
like the big companies that are out here
that are hiring right and the reason why
I like to look at those things is
because I'm constantly in my head is
like you never know when things is gonna
go bad you gonna say like one day all my
websites will get shut down right so I
have to keep a track of what's out in my
community what's out in my area I want
to know exactly what type of jobs people
are hiring out here so even though I'm
not looking for a job at the moment but
it's always like my plants see you know
what I mean it's like you have plan a
plan B Plan C plan D you gotta say no
you gotta have a whole bunch of
different plans if one doesn't succeed
and something happens you always have
two other plan my last resort is hey
I'll go back to work and get another
$100,000 a year
you gotta run saying like desk that's
the last resort right so I'm looking at
this thing says front-end software
engineer I'm gonna show you right now
see where is it I wanted to show you
guys this
there's a couple is a lot of jobs here
in Connecticut you'll be surprised
see
yeah so let me share this with you guys
right now if I wanted to go to this job
interview right uh I don't even know how
how to say this but it's like literally
I could probably get this job with my
eyes closed
let me see Connecticut where is it is
just it's right here I'm trying to show
you guys just the things that they're
asking for JavaScript developer where is
it there's no front end react
okay front every act
okay United States the reason why I'm
showing this is so you guys can see how
to look for things and at the same time
how important it is to basically no more
animations and SVG so react
okay here you go so this is this is one
of them okay so here you can see they
have like all the simple stuff man like
this is like the simple things like I
could do all of this stuff with my eyes
closed like no JavaScript CoffeeScript
types care of es6 I know all of them
HTML CSS lasts a stylist I could do all
of them CSS mythology's meaning like
they they're talking about you know be
BM BAM I know all of that a
responsiveness on a single page app
development I know all the security and
performance I know all of that
Crow's browser front every C frame were
such as angular and react I know both of
them um I gotta probably polish up on
angular but what I wanted to show you
guys is the s SVG's I can't freaking
find it right now but I saw it this
morning when I was looking for it let me
see where is it
SBG react
you
this is one of them but it's not that
one seen here I think it's this one
like they have a whole bunch of stuff
can't find it I hate when I can't find
something that was like right there like
I have on my phone but I'm gonna just
read it read the description for you
guys
and it's crazy because there's like you
would think at Disney they will be
asking for a lot man and they're like
nah okay I got it
let me see
they're like hey man they're looking for
somebody who knows react write react
they're looking for react SVG's work
with animation green sock pixel Jes what
else
let me see tell you right now
sass JavaScript backbone angular grunt
like who uses grunt anymore like I know
all of that stuff already but it's like
look demonstrate this is what I wanted
to show you
so it says demonstrated experience with
creating of SVG graphics and animations
using javascript SVG libraries like snap
that SVG like that's super easy like
they're not asking for a lot you know
it's like you know you'd think like man
they ask him they're gonna actually four
million things as like nah and that was
crazy
that's how you know anybody could get in
there this is how you know anybody could
get in there like what's the the minimum
education minimum education high school
diploma like then I even at look they're
not even asking for colleges not even
asking for an associate interaction
acting for um asking for a freakin
bachelor's or masters nothing computer
science nine high school diploma
meaning you out here what a GED you are
here with a GED you know your work you
you know you put in that word for you
know a few months you know what you're
doing you got websites that show your
skills right and you could get this job
at Disney on ESPN you get what I'm
saying like do this out here throwing
listen when they throw the high school
high school diploma that means everybody
in there you gotta say like the hood is
in there like yeah we in their GED you
know you know what I'm saying like dudes
is showing up there with a GED you know
in a do-rag
you gotta run saying that's how you know
like they just don't care it's like can
you do the job that's in
and that's at Disney you know what I
mean like that's here in Connecticut you
got a saying so it's like I tell people
at a time
you gotta learn animations like I put it
on my website for a reason do you know
how many people actually have taken to
animation course on my website
I'll let you guys guess
I'll let you guys guess I'll give her a
gift to somebody somebody out there
putting a number from 1 to 50
let's see whoever's hot let's see who I
was high and shows up right here right
here on the list whoever is hot let's
see who's closest to the number let's
see who's closest to the number let's
see how many people actually you know
what I mean like who actually went into
the animation right because people think
like yo animation is a game is like oh
well we don't we don't care about
animation like you know what I mean
test Conor Gotti out of two thousand
plus people twelve people took it slow
people went in there
out of 2,000 and how many you think
actually completed the whole thing
sad three people out of the 12 you got
on saying like people put like animation
under the rug that I I'll do that one
day they think like you know it's not
important animation animation I love
that little sound I love that
that's like a your boy ristic a real
quick
listen your subscribers we out here
we're popping but yes there's like 12
people um well sorry Ramsay Jordan
honestly no I ain't see no Peter you
gave us
I see no Peter al you only see seen that
one do test area or something like that
whatever I just said oh yeah
I don't know Peter man send me an email
man send me an e-mail I'll give you
something man but listen I'm just saying
like it's crazy you know people people
they think like if I put something on
the website guys it's for a reason it's
for a main reason because it just hope
everything that's on my website is
literally to open doors for you and to
be able to get jobs you know animation
is very important even game development
is very important when you work in a
digital agency you're more valuable when
you know animations and when you know
how to build games because when you work
like let's say what was a huge I believe
is huge huge Inc let me show you this
company huge Inc is one of the biggest
digital agencies out in the world they
work with all the major brands right now
when you work for a digital agency like
this you're working with the big boys
you're working with coca-cola you're
working with Nike working with all the
major companies let's look at their work
okay let's see what they got
look AMC Theaters right they designed it
right you got Canada Goose you got
Google they work with Google you got
cold so you got Hulu you got Gucci you
got LG Lenovo NBC Universal this guys
work with everybody right now if you're
a developer and you say hey man I don't
want to work with like a company like
working at a company like Google is
boring to be honest with you guys
working with a company like this this is
fun this is where you get money and at
the same time you get big bonuses and
not only just the big bonuses are you
working on cool projects you're working
on projects that you can say hey man I
build this application for Nike hey man
I built this amazing application that
looks great you know what I mean like
like this their work you know what I
mean like they up there you know like
they've work with McDonald's Nestle TD
Bank ups oh no man the list goes on
now if you don't know animation
you ain't getting in
you might apply but your ass is not
getting in as a front-end developer now
if you're a back-end developer you're a
software engineer that's completely
different you know what I mean like
that's completely different but working
at an agency and you don't know
animation you're not gonna be working
there for long
somehow you Swindell yourself in through
the the interviewing
then one day they say hey man you know
Kellogg's they want us to build a game
for a game for them and you know let's
let's work on this and then you say I
remember I was about to take a course on
Joe's website for animation but then I
didn't take it and then now you had the
job sweating balls you like stress cuz
you don't know something now you got to
go out your way to try to learn it in
two days before the deadline of having
at least the concept you got on Sammy
and I'm not talking like little
animation some people think like little
animation like oh we made a little thing
fade down nah we're talking about four
animations like building something the
enemy's building a game building
websites that enemy as you scroll
building websites that basically are in
3d like animation is important guys
sorry I went into this rant but it's
just like people really think animation
is not important guys working just for
Google those enterprise companies to be
honest with you are boring the best jobs
that you could get our digital agencies
a lot of times you might have a lot of
work because it's multiple clients but
that's where you build cool stuff you're
not building cool stuff right at Google
I'm being honest with you guys
look it up like those guys they're not
building anything that you'll be like oh
man you show it to your friends oh this
is great this is amazing it'll be like
something like oh how can we compress
this thing that's compressing into this
other thing is like I'm not interested
in that I'm interested in the cool stuff
stuff that's flashy stuff that I show to
people like you built this you get what
I'm saying like that's the type of
projects I want to be part of you don't
I'm saying so if you're like me and you
like money and you like to be successful
and you like to get those big bonuses
then
you gotta learn animations and go to
digital agency alright so let's go into
the next thing this animation on the
timeline no because the animation is
really more or it's like a side it's
like how they : in college is like extra
curriculum but it's like
it's not needed but need it enough dummy
sense
oh let me see so what else no it's not a
reference to my my course I'm saying you
could do do it with whatever you want to
do it with what I'm saying is animation
is very important right it's very
important if you want to become a
developer at a digital agency you got
what I'm saying that's a big difference
all right working at an enterprise
you're just working on like you know
like services like me personally does
boring like I'd rather be working at a
company that's building the websites for
Hulu building the websites for you know
Nike building the websites for you know
NBC like those websites look nice they
you know they're legit you know you're
not gonna get that at working at our
enterprise you're gonna say like you
work in a catalyst a Capital One I like
Capital One it's a great company
well let's say you work at Capital One
you're not working on cool stuff at
Capital One like you're not working cool
stuff at TD Bank you know when you're
working yes you set a victor and
elective yeah so animation is an
elective but it's an elective that can
open doors to other jobs that most
developers won't get in there all right
so yeah let's go to the next thing man
and I don't know me I don't you guys let
me know maybe we go to the livestream
open up the livestream for the people
let me see if we can open up the
livestream

yojo house connecticut man chillin yo is
it true about the ghosts or nah my bro
this is my son my son's been scared of
of like this little toy that we have in
the house I'm a chicken down it's like a
little dog no it's a dog it's a little
dog that has a speaker and I was like yo
this dude has never been scared of
anything and now he's scared of this I'm
like yo not as you're talking about
talking about ghosts like yo hold on man
too much no incident you may it's gonna
get you man you know I mean so what's
good more tells you you go hear us now
yeah yeah yeah yeah you do like now you
good now you're good now we got you man
so good so were you for more test
I am from Sacramento California
I'm actually like an hour away from the
bay yeah yeah that's why I had that
question cuz most of the jobs out here
like they always try and ask for like
senior level but at the same time it's
like when you look at what they really
looking for it don't really seem we
don't match up you don't match up you
start listen you go to the job listen
sometimes they are sorted I feel like
sometimes they try to make it more
difficult than what it is a lot of jobs
and I'm like yeah when you get into the
job like this is easy like you do you
could do this with your eyes closed you
know that's why I tell people a lot of
times like build your portfolio so
people don't even question you you know
what I'm saying like build your
portfolio bill something solid because
the last thing that you want to do is go
into a situation where your neck to neck
with like I don't know like some college
some college student who has also never
worked out anywhere and has no skills no
no you know nothing that he's built for
the past four years that he's been in
school and then if you're in the same
level as him now what they do is to
match you up the same okay dogs you know
they bring out the the bone they throw a
bone in the middle of the street and
there's like here's like ten thousand
algorithm survived you know last last
man standing you know what I mean like
you don't you never want to be in that
situation you gonna say like you always
want to be like man like somebody asked
me about we want to do a whiteboard I'm
like bro I'm walking out I'm like I'm
doing a white boards man you know what I
could do I'm not wasting my time on this
that's like that's how you always want
to be because if you have two projects
you have the skills you have everything
that they need is like okay he's already
done he's at the same level here I'm not
even showing you what I could work away
yeah it's like you're at the same level
as a company or even more advanced than
what they have understand you know so
it's like you know Joe real quick man I
feel you on that about like you know I
mean if they start bringing out the
white boards you bought a walkout and

like that's no bro but that's you that
you have ten years man what if you're
just like at a junior level and this is
your first interview and you're trying
to get into the door so yeah you should
you try to solve those algorithms you
gotta you gotta do your best I mean it's
your first job you never work anything I
mean you've never had a job as a develop
you know it's like this your first up
I'm talking about me right
yeah yeah exactly not an arm but for you
guys you gotta put headphones on man you
go ahead you go hang out if you want oh
I'm a mutual for now so you got some
headphones I really like they're greater
course on the algorithms that's a pretty
nice course on my body
like a couple of months ago it's pretty
good yeah yeah that's what I'm saying
like oh let me see if I could bring him
back
yo because I'm you know you work I don't
know if I could bring you back all but
look Lewis just get out the chatroom and
then come back in you get out and then
come back in with and then you'll be
unmuted so now here's one thing that
actually had to give somebody some
advice too because when they mentioned
like projects to actually show jobs
right over here showing like to do tasks
I'm like nah bro you got to make some
big like oh you got a tape stream bro
like you know build a store the to-do
list app is when you're first learning a
new language
Oh what kind of projects do I need to do
I'm like whoa bro you have to do some
real websites like build an e-commerce
build an actual website you know I mean
front and back yeah you got to have Auto
know if you know JavaScript you could
probably do some sure would know that
could probably help you out in an
interview or help you get an interview
you know I mean that's something that
helped me out my old college because
none of my professors even remotely
taught what you guys did
oh yeah they don't they don't know their
teachers C++ all basically just going to
college so I can have a paper to
actually show for that's it it's mainly
yeah yeah I mean that that's how it is
for me for me look when I was going to
school I was just going for the paper
man
it's like I was in there looking at
dinosaurs I was like you're t-rex right
next to me I was like yo why I ain't
messing with none of these people
because look this so crazy and this is
the story that I will never forget look
for anybody that lives in New York City
man or even close to New York City ain't
for whatever reason you decide to go to
Tech right now what's the city I once a
City Tech and freakin I'll never forget
this I'm HTML 101 that's the name of
course right I'll go in there I'll
create an amazing website like
futuristic no that dudes
wasn't even doing back right the teacher
tells us hey we I want you to build a
menu and I want the menu to be on the
top and this and that
I created a menu with a hamburger that
you click on a expense turns into it was
actually a square turns into a menu pops
up shows to the left side shows the full
menu with the full animation yo she
comes to me and she goes like all I
wanted was the menu just a regular menu
this is too much yo no tell you she gave
you enough yo she gave me a C plus my
dude I was like literally I'm I'm in the
glass I'm not even lying to you I'm in
the class tutoring people in the
classroom I'm doing this and they're
like teaching people haters but this is
how the school system goes this is why
when people try and act like they're
very intelligent just because of a
degree mm-hmm school school is about
obedience yeah not intelligence like are
obedient to complete the work then okay
but if they if they feel like you did
too much oh yeah they're going to lower
your grade yes not what they asked for
look look in a bug-out cuz you did over
the talk show yeah exactly yes that's
that's what I'm saying like look for me
one of my biggest problems with like
doing algorithms and all this stuff is
it's not really that I can't do it
because all this stuff is easy it's the
fact that I'm like yo why are we still
focusing on something that was made from
like 30 years ago you know what I'm
saying like this is something from 30
years ago where they will say hey man
we're about to put you on the first IBM
computer here's like how can you come
here and do this algorithm like this and
it's like what if that day you woke up
with a headache what if that day you
woke up and you like I'm just not a
great test taker you know I'm saying
like this show
many great developers and so many great
smart people out there that go through
the cracks and don't get hired to quote
unquote major companies because of they
had a bad date
you got what I'm saying like it doesn't
make sense if somebody comes in like the
guy who created homebrew if you have a
MacBook you use whole new everything if
that guy can't get in at Google like you
get what I said like if he can't get in
and everybody in the whole world uses it
you know why are we even talking about
all this stuff that they have you know I
just want to see the look I want to see
the look at the recruiters face or the
the lead developer or whoever the hell
did the hiring one their algorithm
master can't even build a single web
page like yeah yo bro I really want to
see like what they think how they're
thinking about it cuz if they're gonna
hire the guy who could do a like a crazy
algorithm over the guy who's built
countless amount of projects like
proving himself you know it means yeah
stupid how stupid do they feel when they
really give up a good candidate over the
guy who studied algorithms for seven
months you know what I mean look look at
one company that see that's going
forward is it's Facebook right like a
lot of the guys that are getting hired
right now at Facebook
ain't nobody going through the low test
you know what he's doing or that that BS
what dudes is going through right now
it's like y'all do you have a great
following like you know like the guy who
created our Redux right like he's a
higher he he ain't go to no office
without missing guy listen Dan we're
gonna put you here to for the next three
hours breaking your brain to do
algorithms that you you learned in in
freshman year of college
like you know it's interview with 10
different developers and every one of
them gives you a different algorithm
exactly like it doesn't make sense you
gotta say so it's like now Facebook is
starting to look at it and say hey man
this guy start creating amazing things
that we need to hire and why are we
putting this this is like a wall of like
hey who's the one that could remember
the best fibonacci way like no you know
really late
who could remember the Fibonacci
sequence is like okay cool buddy or is
like Hoku bubble shorter out of
this you know you know but at the
end of the day Joe does it come down at
the hiring process and that she's broken
or like how do you think we could change
that math I think I think the best way
is for a situation like let's say right
now if I'm getting hired if I'm getting
hired as a developer that lets say hey
we need you to become a front-end
developer right we need you to be a
front-end developer why would you test
me on things that I'm not gonna be using
on my day to day job right like we need
to start testing right there we need to
start doing like interviews and say hey
this person is a great front-end
developer he might not be a great back
in developer but at the same time you
learned that with time here at the
company right instead of trying to say
hey we want quote-unquote a software
engineer which knows basically the
theory singing has a hand hands-on with
everything under the Sun and we in our
heads we think like oh this person could
probably learn everything that we could
teach him is like sometimes it doesn't
work like that sometimes it's like this
person specifically only good at the
back end this person's never gonna be
good at the front end this person is
never gonna be good at data science this
person's never gonna be good at and
whatever right but sometimes they they
slide in to get higher at this companies
in and it's like what have you done you
know what I said like what projects have
you built what what was it that you day
that you got to show for it what you got
so far
you gotta say like there's guys out
there on github that 99% of the
companies are using the libraries and
nobody knows nobody knows them and they
working for Bubble xyz.com you
get what I'm saying so it's like instead
of them working in major companies
they're in the
middle of nowhere because a lot of times
they they get X doubt in the testing
process in the the process of like even
going through the recruiter if the
recruiter see it's like some crazy stuff
like they if they see you don't have
enough energy on the phone it's like how
do you know if I have anything like it's
like they need to fix that like that's
not the right way to choose the right
candidate like so I remember there was a
lot of people even from my junior high
school to high school there's people
that go into school and get ace a plus
on everything great a plus on a test
you ask some some regular logic stuff
they sound like the idiot they don't
they don't understand nothing like
they're like um like I remember the
things that the teacher taught me well
soon as you tell them go outside the box
go outside the little box that the
teacher bill for you they're like I'm
gonna sell the box like what is this
like they don't even know what the hell
is going on like see that's that's
something I be trying to tell it like
cuz I go to a couple meetups every now
and then so and I'll be telling like
some people who are still like new
developers like they'd be like oh well
what kind of what can I start on I'll be
like well bro one thing I know is start
applying for jobs when you feel like you
know enough because I used to do
security at a at a William Sonoma like
the data center though for so I was
around developers didn't know like
some of them didn't even know how to
select CSS elements like that's the
crazy thing but but they was good at
back in so it's just like the crazy
thing is is that many people who are
already doing development that don't
know as opposed to people who feel
like they still don't know enough and
not giving it a shot at all one thing
that gets me as I applied like the two
jobs online and one one of them the
first question was he could be a
dinosaur what kind of a dinosaur would
you be
I mean what was the last concert you
went to a scene that I've seen that done
I've seen that done I'm not gonna lie
I've seen that done and usually they do
that because they want to find out if
you will be like a good culture free you
know what I mean like sometimes you know
like uh sometimes I'll be honest this
this duels that you don't even want to
have in your company you gotta say like
I'm sorry I'm not a Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons
you know what I mean like like don't
come with me with your you heal cards
and I was like I ain't trying to be in
that crowd like that's not me like you
know what I mean so it's like if we need
to have like a group of developers out
what 1/2 those that will come in like yo
you heard that me goes like you heard
that you know what I'm saying so it's
like there's goes that is just like it's
not really part of the culture so it's
like at the same time is like it
wouldn't even fit that's why sometimes
this companies where people just don't
even talk to me each other like they're
saying emails to each other like you
will okay here you go is like Jenni sent
you the PSD okay cool Jen thank you
Thank You Jenni
yo I haven't told the story man I
haven't told the story let me tell you
guys this story you guys in the songs in
the emails back and forth look let me
tell you this story so um I'm at I'm at
this company it's a very corporate
company that's what I was working with
creative circle I was working with
creative circle which hey I just seen a
job application for them - yeah they
legit if you co applied the legit they
get you to a whole bunch of companies
and you're like you're like a temp right
you go into there you get higher for six
seven months you get paid twice as much
as every developer that's in that
company
and you be good right now I was a I was
a creative circle they sent me to a
company to work and mind you I'm working
right here and this this this other lady
that works right next to me right she
doesn't know anything about HTML she
don't know anything about CSS
she's a content editor right and she's
like the head of the content editors
right her her whole format of like how
to work with HTML was like super basic
she's like okay my h1 needs to be right
here my paragraph needs to be right here
my date needs to be right here if
anything changes I don't know what's
going on so she didn't know nothing
about HTML or she know was just there
was one file that she copied and pasted
and then she from there just basically
every time that she's about to write a
new content she'll go in there and use
the same thing never put into time to
even try to learn HTML right so I'm
there I get higher I'm there for like
two three months and things come
whatever
and one day I'm like okay this website
looks horrible let me fix up a couple of
things there because the order of things
it was wrong
you know I say I'm a fixie you know any
developer will say okay cool like this
is fine I gotta fix it
so I'll fix it uh she had like her face
turns red she's like and she's sitting
right next to me she feels like she
sends me a message she's right next to
me you right next to me I'm in a cubicle
I'm in a piece she's in the cubicle
right in front of me
hey I'm like she's like I start here
like little things moving around on her
desk like she was having a fake into his
bargain she's bugging out she's like
he's like how do like there's somebody
changed my file my HTML file and I'm
like everything is there everything
thanks to her like yeah I'm like right
next to her everything is there right
whatever I fixed that put her right back
to how she wanted and there's somebody
else from another team came back is like
hey
somebody fixed the HTML file and then
they broke it again what happened I
thought we got that was ugly so that was
the work that I did so now she she's mad
and I start laughing
I'm petty I'm petty I'm petty pockets
out here you know what I mean so when
the dough comes it's like this somebody
fixed her the HTML page on this layout
and cuz it was fixed like ten minutes
ago and I was broken back again since
how it's been for the past three years
sorry I start laughing I'm like I'm like
this yeah I'm like so late you want me
to bring it back and she's in there like
catching a fake like my whole head is
about to explode mind you thank you
whatever six months my six month
contract is done so I'm bout to leave oh
yeah thank you for everything you've
been great been a great mentor you know
to make her feel like a little bit
higher so a great mentor thank you for
the opportunity this is Annette
so from there I leave creator circle
sends me a girl who is in charge of like
my cases and everything whatever she
sent me a message she's like oh what
happened you you've always been great
and you know let's say let's call her
Cynthia so Cynthia said there was bad
communication with you that you need to
improve your communication and I'm like
I'm sitting right in front of this big
so I'm like I'm sitting right in front
of this chick for like six months she
never talks to me she freaking only
texts the sense me of frickin messages
I'm right in front of you like just
communicating you know what I'm saying
so it's like that happens all the time
in like those corporate companies people
don't even talk to each other like
people staying true like okay this is
the developers is the designers is the
marketing people is the content editors
this is the upper management of her
management never talks to nobody at the
bottom they have like one middleman
they have like like all the time you see
like one middleman that goes in and
gives the news to all the teams but they
never talked to nobody they look you
know what I mean so it's like a
hierarchy and they're like whoever is
the CEO is like a king of the company is
like people gotta kiss his ass and roll
down the freakin the red carpet for him
like there was another time like I was
like and I mean though I'm in the
elevator with the CEO I say something I
said like oh man is like I can't believe
it's gonna rain today is super sunny the
guy looked at me like do you talking to
me I wanted to I was like and I was like
I do like yo calm down you see or
whatever but you ain't you're just
a regular do to me you know what I mean
so corporate America that's how it is if
you ever work in a corporate company
like you got to be ready for all the
type of BS there's no personality you
got to be in a box man you go outside
the box
you're a glitch in the matrix they all
look at you like yo like what you're
doing like estimator you know what I say
like just a matrix my do keep walking
you know hey yo man joke um I want to
touch up on some you know that you stay
at home how you was talking about how
like we should actually go and apply
like singer all my love our jobs and we
should actually come up glad you like
every job here we actually see but but
now wait so we get Auto on be like let's
say we of let's say we applied to a
senior level job right and we might
actually um embarrass ourselves because
maybe might not be material that like
you know they're gonna like they're
gonna like have us to do another
something
how you feel about their well first of
all mean any any job that you go to man
any job that you go to they're gonna
have their own ways of doing things so
no matter what they're gonna have to
teach
- no matter what what I do from scratch
right because even if somebody tells you
oh we do JavaScript we do know GS once
you look at their folder structures or
their projects you start looking at it
it's like everything is completely
different than the last company you want
because everybody does it completely
different unless you work with a system
like a frame were like laravel Ruby on
Rails well you know everything is
exactly where it's supposed to be yeah
when you go to every company they do it
differently no matter what so if they
actually something that you don't know
just be honest and be like hey I haven't
had the opportunity to actually work on
this but I've done a couple of other
projects and this this and that that is
related to that or you just say like I
just don't know it you know I don't know
it well I'm willing to learn I could
pretty much learn anything that you
throw at me that's it you throw them
that that's saying you just gotta say
confident you can't be in there sweating
balls like maybe maybe I could learn if
you give me some time no you go it to me
give me a week you know what I mean you
learn then just like give me a week I'll
do that you know what I mean and one
thing I also wanna add is bro the point
is even if it is senior level see the
only thing I was tripping off of it's
because the jobs I'm applying for it's
talking like 100 in T in and up because
San Francisco pays that hard I already
had like a means of living if I did go
out there which is only an hour away
from me but the thing is is that they
always be like oh we paying 110 you
either gotta have a bachelor's or you
had is a whoopee whoopee you booked
years of experience if you want to get
the job but I just have to ask Joe just
to kind of confirm like a so I just say
 it and still give it a shot ya know
you still gotta go listen you're gonna
be surprised especially in San Francisco
there's a lot of startups right a lot of
startups so there's always gonna be a
CTO this guy always gonna be a guy who's
even more senior developer than you you
know some guy who who they really really
trust right that guy just needs
for five extra developers to work on the
website that he's architecting you're
just there to be an extra hand for him
you know what I mean like he can't do
everything
you're just the extra hand I could say
hey man I want you today to work on on
this REST API that we're gonna connect
for this iPhone application that's your
job
right you could go in there if you
already know no J yes you already worked
on REST API you can do that job right
it's not that difficult
all you have to do is just just freakin
get it done you got one say like
sometimes we get scared I was so scared
look I was opposed to be working like a
you know two to three months like I hear
the stories of fresh Shawn I hear the
stories of the dreaded death
I get so tight at the fact that I was
ready by that time you know what I mean
like I was ready when I was I got two
months in like I spent like not just
like working on something like part-time
I had quit my job and I went in hard
like 16 hours a day almost you know for
like two months I was ready well I
didn't go to a job interview for a whole
year because number one everywhere that
I went to they threw like 30,000
different frameworks on it and I say I
gotta learn every single one of them and
I gotta get nice on every single one of
them before I went to a job interview by
the time I went to a job interview I was
like so like so freaking good at that
time I was like killed when I thought I
was like none of the frameworks that I
study they even use or they were using
was the regular things angular at that
time that's in jQuery so I'm like why
did I spend so much time learning amber
learning a backbone learning knockout I
freaking like I learned everything under
the Sun you know that's why I tell
people the time is like y'all go online
all you have to do is either choose
angular or react if you're gonna be a
frame or a front-end developer that's
the it and then you're gonna be fine and
start applying to jobs soon as you can
build any website out of a design if you
can't build a website out of design out
of a design
don't go to no interviews because you're
not ready you're not supposed to be out
there you're gonna get embarrassed if
somehow you scheme it and you get hired
and then they give you a design you like
do I take this this image and slice it
up and make it into the background like
no nobody does that
everybody builds everything from scratch
with CSS so it's like nobody does it how
people used to do it back in the days
but they will take a design and slice it
up and basically take that that image
and put it as the background no
everything needs to be done with CSS now
you know because CSS has the tools that
you can build it on your own any any
design that they throw at you you gotta
say something you have to just be able
to do that and then just know warm
framework if you want to become a
back-end developer as a junior developer
and self-taught I'm not talking that's
the bit that's more difficult it's a
more difficult road but you can
definitely do it if you have the project
right because a front-end of like let's
say right now front-end developer you
can come in and say okay throw me an
InDesign I could build it was that you
could scheme it you could go in and get
hired
you could scheme it when you are back in
developer it's not just that you have to
go in there say I can upload everything
to the server I know how to use AWS I
know how to go in there you know set up
the data bases I have to connect like
there's so many different things to
becoming a back-end developer that foot
or somebody who's self-taught so go in
there and try to do it on this their
first job it's like suicide you you
basically if you make it alive you like
amazing you got are saying like if you
somehow make it to become a back-end
developer on your first job
that means you was amazing it is not
like you was like some regular dude to
be a front-end developer anybody could
do it you could go in there be like hey
man you want me to build this for you
that's it you gotta say it's a huge show
you um can I show you a website I made
for me um oh my god from up there yes
sure yeah I mean if you want you want to
do it right now
look here are posting a check this is
the design that I did um I was watching
all they hold out of your videos so it
kind of helped me you know so this is
the design or did you build this website
correct okay so you good
it looks legit looks very clean very
nice uh to me personally I think you're
ready you know they're not responsive
but on this semi responsive ya know it
looks good man is of course there's
definitely things that you could tweak
but listen I had a job that's why you're
hired you're hired to take your time and
build it the right way and add it the
extra features but so me everything
looks clean looks nice
typography is good so it's like it looks
pretty legit you know what I'm saying so
as far as far as that it's like it's
nice man so it's like you definitely
could get hired now it's just about you
starting to apply to places you know
don't waste time don't do what I do man
everything that I tell you guys man I
wish I could just you know if it was up
to me I start staffing people up just
wake up right that you know what I mean
like don't do the same mistakes that I
did you know I came in here and wasted
time looking through blogs YouTube or
freaking every website that's under the
Sun cuz I say I wanna be the best you
know that's that's like the worst thing
that you could put on top of your
shoulder that's your first job like
ourselves to develop and say I want to
be the best the moment you put in that
pressure on yourself you're never gonna
feel like you're ready because this
guy's out there that's a million times
better than you this guy's out there
that's been doing this since 14 years
old you know sometimes you might see
somebody that goes to even a job or a
boot camp or a a college student or even
a self-taught person that you you say
hey I'm 24 years old he's 24 years old
he did less than example teen tree house
ding treehouse he did coke a Damini
I think Academy and then you say hey how
come I'm now in the same level as him
and then what you don't know is that
this person's been voting since the time
he's 14 years old you don't know
nobody's history you don't know nobody's
background some people they come in and
say oh I just started yesterday I'm a
web developer but what they don't tell
you is I hate you've been building job
applications since you was with a thumb
in your mouth you get what I'm saying so
it's like you who is a brand-new
developer trying to get into this
freaking Jodha mechanic and say hey man
I was gonna go beyond uber or become a
web developer and you decide to become a
web developer right now you're coming
into this field and you're trying to
compare yourself to the dudes who've
been doing this since I don't know when
you get what I'm saying late don't put
that pressure on you of like I wanna be
the best but your pressure that you
should have is say I want to be able to
build a website builder anything out of
a design be able to be comfortable with
JavaScript no one back in language and
no one framework that's it that's your
only goal you shouldn't be putting that
pressure on top of you of being I want
to be the best out here I'm trying to
get the most github starts I want to be
the best youtuber out here I will create
a YouTube channel that I teach tutorials
it's like you don't want to put that
pressure on yourself you just want to be
able to come in here clean slate
do your the best that you can and you
get money that's it that's the only
thing that you need to be caring about
anybody that comes in and tells you oh
man your code is not as clean as mine is
like okay what do you nobody you know
what I mean like you know it's like go
ahead it's like you did this with a for
each loop I can do it with a while loop
it's like okay buddy you know all here
yes I mean it's like you gotta put
yourself in that world you know what I
mean like if you stay in that state of
mind you gotta be Goulding in this
career but if you puttin yourself in our
world of like hey man I wanna be the
best you know then you start singing oh
very best you trying to catch them all
out here or the frameworks it's not
gonna happen
you gonna say yeah and that's just an
advice that I tell people so yeah I try
and tell I try and tell my homeboy cuz
he always wants to be like perfect like
trying to get it right but I try and
tell him like there's no right code you
know like everybody has their own
practices of what they like to do you
got to get your own little vibe you got
to get your own little little little
sling went like y'all little vibe to it
to get it right yeah everybody's not
gonna type you it ain't gonna coat the
same exactly yeah look one of the
reasons why I love programming is
because programming it basically is it's
math you know at the end of the day it's
gonna you know two plus two is four
that's a you gonna say like I could do
it a million different ways I could say
one plus two plus one is four or I could
say one plus one plus one plus one for
this one is for like I could do three
plus one is four it's four at the end of
the day you got a saying so that's how
programming works so it's like somebody
might come anything I could do it the
best I could do it with a while looping
you know I could going assembly and
doing an assembly in and compiles to
JavaScript peasants peasants you still
using you still JavaScript guys I could
do it with assembly I'll be like okay
buddy that's a good job you know it was
like here you go here's your a little
too Santini
a low clap for you like when I'm out
here get my job done game what I need to
get done and then moving on to other
better things you know same like
everybody shoots should have that focus
you know when yourself to a developer
you're here for one reason you're here
for coming in and and just make your
money you know at the same time love the
the code that you're building and having
fun with it but at the same time is like
don't put that person on you're like I
want to be the very best of like
although all the freaking Pokemon
catchers we're trying to catch
that time be a skeptic you ain't trying
to be the a sketch of what develop me
you get all eight leave it leave it for
somebody else I mean you could do it if
that's you that's you
That's not me I'm more of like a realist
I'm more of like a regular person just
like hey man I come in I do what I do I
do the best that I can
I'm here for that yes I'm not here to be
I don't need nobody to put the statue
here's the statue for a guy that created
the the Harry Potter loop I don't need
that statue you gotta say like you build
that you know what for me is is like
okay let me get my job done and that's
what companies care about companies care
about you getting something done you
know building their their products
they've making money as soon as they
make money you get a bonus you know what
I mean so you good the idea of like
other developers are putting other
pressure on other people's like man I
don't live in that world man you could
live in that world if you want me I'm
more like I'm trying to just survive
make my money keep pushing and every
five six years reinvent myself you know
what I mean like I did this one for me
like I did this for five six years
already I'm trying to reinvent myself in
other fields of programming you gotta
send a guy trying to do game development
and trying to do software development in
like is that the evolution but the
introduction the easiest way is what
development for everybody I remember um
I was trying to actually learn my HTML
and CSS and freaking like I would
actually spend like hours a day trying
on to remember the like syntax and then
um and then um I remember watching one
of like your videos that you as I yo yo
yo own and you don't have to I remember
like the arm syntax all you need to do
is just know what to like search for and
they actually helped me out and made me
become a better developer because I
would like bookmark like things in the
lytic document
might come back later on yeah look
listen man back in the days before there
was Google and this is something that
people I feel like a lot of developers
they don't want to talk about you know
back in the days you will acts like
those old-school developers guys who
were working at tari that's what we're
working and like you know IBM they used
to walk around with a big ass book like
this right something that they will go
into as a reference they used to putting
a little paper you know you know how
back in the days you have a little
bookmark those used to do that you know
they put a little bookmark in there and
they said oh cool let me go back and
hear this how how much memory this thing
takes and this and that you know
whatever it was back in the days but
they used to do that right now a lot of
people they think like oh man it's wrong
to look on Stack Overflow it's wrong to
look on Google look it's wrong to do
this than that but it's not because the
idea behind it is you have a job to do
right let's say you have a project by
Friday somebody tells you hey we need
you to connect to this API that connects
to this other API that does this and
that that curve creates an array that
creates another array does a million
different things right somewhere down
the line while you building this
application there's gonna be something
that you're gonna forget something that
you're gonna think about oh my god how
did I forget this how did I forget how
to build how to put a background image
you know like you remember everything in
JavaScript but you forgot how to put
background image in CSS
you're not saying like hey don't mean
like don't try to remember everything in
CSS just go to the documentation and
look at background image how is the
syntax done you gotta say like if you
don't have to go in there and try to
remember everything that's under the Sun
is like JavaScript people try to master
JavaScript you can't master JavaScript
at least for another for like a year two
years like I didn't feel like our master
JavaScript for like two years
anybody that comes in and tells you oh
yeah I did this in three months they're
lying nobody could do that in three
months because there's so many different
concepts that you not only gotta see
on tutorials but you have to see it in
real life applications there's problems
that you you know like that you bump
into even with math this things in
JavaScript that you know that that is
messed up between like let's say the
number three and the string of the
number three
like you could still add those two
things together and you're not supposed
to sometimes you get errors in down the
line while building an application and
that's why they have like type type
scraping all of that stuff to try to
save you from that but if you build a
like a a JavaScript application you bump
into all those problems so you still
have to look at the documentation you
got on say so no matter what is it's
fine to look at the documentation and
just remember the concepts never try to
remember the syntax like syntax you
learn it by repeating and building
things the same way like let's say I
know how to do a map right I know how to
do math use map with react because I've
used there a million times when I first
started using es6 I couldn't remember
how to do it I know it was like dot map
and then I put a function inside and
then I couldn't remember that you had to
return something I never remember that
for like I don't know for like two weeks
I couldn't remember I always went back
to the documentation you know but that's
just being a normal human being
you get one saying so don't ever forget
oh my literally took and roomies oh my
two kids course on on react and freaking
like I probably spent I was trying to
actually remember how to set up like the
web pack on comfy like I'm I was trying
to actually remember that and um it was
a pain and I forgot it like in like a
couple of days yeah I mean even to this
day I still just I look back at the last
one that I built that's it it's like
there's no shame in that like web pack
is it could be confusing there's so many
things that you have to do different
loaders you have to go into the
documentation the documentation is not
even clear it might work and it changes
a lot it changes a lot
Sulli so you know what I mean like if
you try to remember things it's not
gonna work in this field you know this
is not a ABC you know it's not a
spelling bee you know I mean like you
know one of the things that my professor
used to tell us in class is when you
write them when you find a bit of code
that you're going to be using over and
over again just copy it on a separate
file that way you always have it yeah
that's what I do I mean I do that all
the time I come in and and basically
like you know whenever I need to use
something like when I use like react
write whatever I've done before I have
it on or another folder like I have all
the projects that I've done over for
yeah because the situations where you
might come up with a solution to a
problem that you might not see three
months from now and then you're like oh
man I remember I solved this this issue
before it's like now you could go back
to your project that you did three
months ago you know and look at those
things you gonna say oh yeah is a even
at that like a lot of people I see
people
somebody has to something dumb like oh
man you use the same web developer start
again like yeah man I still use my own
what developer started cuz I'm not gonna
sit down and build that from scratch
every single time I build a project I
feel you I'm on it Joe um I made my own
work extra hard a kid who's gonna be
building that every single time you go
what I'm saying like late
hey sending over a peg on takes around
me ain't nobody got time for that when
you wanna build projects and products
that you want to push out like you know
how time can be trying to do the same
thing over and over every project that
students if yeah you got to set up that
Babel oh don't you guys sit ups right
sorry about doing the same thing you've
got to normally do every time
we got your boy talking about Pokemon we
got your boy Jake guitar out here young
ass catch them you know what I really
like Jake what up what up what up
how much man just got home from college

from Jake God Christ man where no doubt
case where the hell is that I'm at man

man any other topics you guys want to
talk about let me know man and yeah look
man I'm sorry
sometimes I go into my rants I go live
and stuff but it's your is your show man
one's the truth let's see I mean I got
something I'd like to kind of share like
advice for people who are still applying
for jobs just so you know indeed monster
in Craigslist or not should only forums
and looking for a job man they got so
many other ones I just found out about
hacker news having a who's hiring thread
hacker news got one I didn't even know
about something called triple bytes and
they even quiz you got my head like when
you sign up so it's like it's just all
startups on there if you got discord
there's a discord channel where all
react basically where they have jobs on
react you know people post like for
hiring and all that so which help which
also helps I mean that's all I can think
of for a moment but I mean just just to
kind of give some people some help with
it if you if you looking for a job if
you if you know what you want to do
stick to it is all I'm saying and then
for the ones I always have a plan that's
also something I want to add like don't
get into it without a plan bro like hop
into this with a goal just like just
like Joe said before hop into it with a
goal achieve your goal and then find
other sources of income no don't don't
focus on one income bro you gotta have
more than one hustle I always tell
people listen you never want to be out
here you know
I see so many people that they they get
like you know I got a they're
comfortable they get seduced they're
like the keyboard you know what I mean
like they get seduced out here they be
like man my company
you know they got free lunch you know my
company they got they got free laundry
on Thursdays you know free coffee you
know it's like next drink a soft drinks
man
so that oughta sorta that you could want
you know what I mean like you fall into
that spell man and then you basically
given out your life to another company
just a couple of dudes who are
millionaires sometimes billionaires
ain't still strong why you suppose not
strongly you comfortable but you're just
some regular dude you don't say living
that way rest of your life bro exactly
like you know guys listen these guys out
there that if you if you get the little
entrepreneur bug like and you got a
skill you got something that solves
people's problems
listen man you could be out here one day
going from Nissan Sentra to a Mercedes
Benz from the Mercedes Benz you could
drop into them as Maserati you drop in
from the Maserati to the Lambo and then
by the end of the year Rolls Royce in it
you know what I mean like that's how it
is there's like sky's the limit man I
was like driving the other day I would
wife me through like some neighborhood
that's close by here and like literally
every freaking house there is like four
or five million dollars it's like that
man land like I'm talking Mel and I'm
talking about like Oh cake 30 acres so
there's like call it call it like
something like flying flying pig farm
like some dude has a a mansion that has
a farm that has a farm in the farm you
know what I mean like some food is just
appalling you know what I mean like you
look at at the freakin Google Maps the
dude's house is like rain the middle is
like a 30-minute drive just to get to
the house you're gonna say and then you
you're thinking your hair like yo man
how this guy doesn't this distant that
you do some research you find a line
like this dude just got this like five
years ago this dude was just some
regular dude out here working made it
happen
find a solution to somebody's problem
you know I was looking at this thing
like I'm constantly like looking at
everything that's around me like the
other day wife you found out some stupid
toy his neighbor the toys like a stupid
plate that doesn't move no matter what
the baby pulls on in does whatever and
I'm like thinking in my head I'm like
this stupid ass plate some do this
boiling right now on this dumbass plate
you don't say
you see the one with the camera print it
was on it was on the news like a while
back like basically I think it's like
last month oh do mein little pins with
cameras in them they're like say you can
record stuff like in class and that
month we're gonna sew it out that do the
knowledge he got all his yeah all his
products in his dorm look at that doo
doo when in cash doubt he said one
he said one got off the court fade away
fade away me they stopped them in they
subdomain this I got an idea do it you
know I mean like you don't need a
mailing ideas and even at that sometimes
you might have a whole bunch of smaller
businesses or smaller ideas see that
that's basically that is just accumulate
that's what I'm doing you know I'm being
honest like you know everything that I'm
doing is for a reason you know I said
four years ago my whole thing was like
once I got a Java thing I'm gonna be uh
you know I'm gonna be a digital nomad
I'm gonna see with my money I'm gonna
pay off all my debt I'm gonna do this
this and then I'm just gonna travel the
world and no backs out you know I mean
so that was like four years ago I was
like yo Oh before before I was wiping
everything I was just like yo I'm not
going to no relationship I'm not doing
nothing I'm just gonna fall out I'm
do my own thing get my career going you
know this and that
I found out whatever I found a special
person we haven't kid now you know I'm
happy you're gonna say but thanks to
that is we here right now you know what
I mean like I was actually able to say
hey man I'm not going back to work I'm
good you got on saying it's just like
how Kevin says yo he he cashed out he
said listen man I'm giving myself some
time to learn all this stuff and I'll go
back to work on my own time when I
decide you know what I mean and that's
because I put in the seeds for all of
this stuff to happen now you know give
me some more time like I'm trying to you
know I just got this this whole you know
media face it's called media face LOC
you know all this thing is growing you
know what I mean I got a whole bunch of
different websites I got my major
website where I you know I sew courses I
have other website where got reviews on
albums I got another website well we're
basically is like a CSS generator like I
have all those little things they just
generate generate most you know so it's
like even at that even here on YouTube
like I do this YouTube I do this for
phone cuz I love it and I'm just having
fun why at the end of the day is like
it's like a thousand dollar check for no
reason because I was gonna do this for
free no matter what you don't know
saying like that it's like an extra
thing to just pay taxes so it's like no
matter what at the end of the day it's
like everything is like you know it's
like little pieces I'm the type of
person that says you know I'm not gonna
try to do this amazing big company in my
life because I'm not I'm not the type of
person that I like the pressure like
that I'm like oh wait the work I don't
want to be I don't want to have like a
million people under me I don't want to
have that all boss yeah exactly I want
to do my own thing I want to do it in my
own way of like having take more the
businesses and smaller adventures and
you know I'll cash down the Bitcoin when
in it might not be that much it was like
ten thousand who killed oh you know
don't matter is that's to for profit
profit profit I can cash down I can't
came out of there quick so there's that
thing started dropping ISO 16,000
people's like Joe stay in there you know
it's like
you bought out mm you you know you're
good you even if you sell a 9000 I'm
like now I'm selling now at 16 I'm out
you know if we make my money and I'm
good and as I put that into the bag just
keep putting things into the bag you
know what I mean is like now I could go
in and say hey I'm looking into uh to
the yard rent the crib over there
to see how I like it right I'm not gonna
buy a spot if I don't know if I really
want to be in the are like that you're
gonna say so if if I decide to be out
there then I'll buy a place is my
cheap you know what I mean so you got
you just gotta say hey man you gotta
have goals man all of these things that
I'm doing I feel like people should take
advantage and look at all the things
that I've done and all the mistakes that
I've done and learn from them say man
what took Joe five years to do I could
do this in two years because he just
taught me the game me I had to learn the
hard way of bumping into the wall
bumping into the wall you know building
projects building uh trying to build
startups trying to do this and I that
didn't work out and then at the end I
said why am I trying to build something
big when I could build something small
and it held it up yes and build it up
small you know little by little a whole
bunch of different ones if I have 20
different places that make me you know
$10,000 a month I'm good you know what
I'm saying like I don't need to be one
of this dudes I'm like nah man I'm
trying to make 50 million this year nah
how many I made eight hundred thousand
oh good they're good you know the goal
is to get half a million I'm halfway
there you know what I mean so it's like
once I get there then we go say hey man
hey Bank you know what I mean going hey
CD bag I'm out pop the moment bring them
my wet out hey chase and I got a loan
for another five mil you know what I
mean cuz you that's nothing that people
don't even tell people like when you go
to the bank if you don't got money you
ain't getting no big money check you
know like you try to go in there with a
lawyer you like can I get a $100,000
loan and then they look into your bank
account and your bank account is looking
like $800
then lender you know 100,000
like you know I mean like money attracts
money you got on saying like that's the
only way that they're gonna give it to
you you know I see people all the time
like I got friends will be like man I'm
trying to get into this this realistic
thing you know and just try to have
money for that you tell my cousin the
same bro like you can't pay your rent
like how you gonna barely pay your rent
and you'll be here talking about our
real estate labor like you better pay
you really you wait until you you could
pay you reckon about how some fix it
okay this guy yo there's a crazy story
this guy's from Dave Ramsey you guys
gotta subscribe to that everybody's
watching me subscribe to that guy Dave
Ramsey he's like the man he's just
honest he's kind of he's kind of brutal
with it though he like people will call
him and be like um they're like hi Dave
um you know this is a real story some
lady I'm on my act like I was the lady
that came cold in it was like hi Dave um
listen my husband and I we're basically
$100,000 in debt and basically he just
left his job and in Alaska and but we
live in Arizona and the guy goes like oh
boy why you live in Arizona your
husband's job is in in Alaska well I was
born and raised in Arizona and you know
I wanted to keep my kids close close to
home and this and that then the guy goes
like okay and there's like were you in
$100,000 debt and then the guy goes like
um do you have any property she goes
like yeah we got we got our house and we
have another rental house and that goes
like well what you gonna do with that
extra house it's like if you got
$100,000 dead don't you think you should
sell it she was like yeah but I don't
know my husband he just quit his job so
that's like our only income and then the
guy goes like um but why he quit his job
if you're not working he's like well you
know I'm real head of a
was it how you call it the the women to
stay at home housekeeper that's right
how yes ma'am uh uh head of a housewife
and I'm like in my head I'm I'm like
this already I can never do that
my head is shaking already my if you
ain't making no money to the table my
neck is about to pop and I don't even
know this lady and she's like yeah
because you know it's like I'm one head
of a housewife in and this isn't that
and Dave Ramsey his the little veins
there's a little reindeer that that's it
starts moving like aliens you know what
I mean like so he goes like listen um
the best thing that you can do it's
really sell your house you know and then
she goes like yeah but you know we can't
really sell it because my husband wants
to get into this business he goes I can
also he has money to for business he's
like yeah he's about to start buying
houses and fixing them up and flipping
them the guys Dave Ramsey he has an
attack he goes like like he wanted to
curse at her so bad he's like yo you
guys are a hundred thousand dollars in
debt
you're calling me about all of this
situation and your husband wants to get
into flipping houses with money that he
don't even have like that's not you're
basically calling for a disaster to
happen and the lady goes like yeah but
you know I wanted to tell you about this
there's a vitro this five hundred
dollars vitro that we put money down in
the guy was like oh it was like IV s or
something like that the guy goes like
what are you talking about I was like IV
yes I don't know what I mean is again we
trying to have another kid in the guy
flip now on hurting you in debt
you owe $100,000 your husband has no job
he's trying to flip houses
oh I wanna check on credit he's trying
to flip houses on credit and you
worrying about having another kid
and she's worried about five hundred
dollars that she put down for this evita
thing as a down payment the dude is
telling you leave the five hundred
dollars don't have a kid right now like
what are you thinking now
this show that he has is amazing this is
the type of level that I want to get of
so like the way how he has things you
know people call in it have everybody
coming that's where I got the idea of
like having all of you guys in here is
it brings more life into the show right
but yo his show is so freakin good
because you will be surprised how stupid
people are like people are just like
they walk around like they don't they're
not using their brains like people
walking around with bad credit people
walking around with a whole bunch of
stuff like fix your life first before
you even start thinking about getting
yourself in debt and that's I tell
people all the time with boot camps man
you can't jump into a boot camp if you
already money like boot camps is perfect
for somebody who is who has a career
right exactly has a cushion but let's
say I'm also a successful digital
marketer whatever right I already have
money and I say you know what
when my marketing skills and my what
development skills if I put them
together I could come up with an amazing
software amazing service whatever
amazing website right that person could
go to a boot camp and that will be
perfect for them right they get the
skills that they need and they're fine
but freaking Ramon the uber driver who
already owns a car who already freaking
basically or owes money or on student
loans going to a boot camp is like
pretty much is like you was trying to
get out the quick-set and you just put
your whole head and just to see what's
down you get what I'm saying
late you can't do that you got to start
using your brain
yes I was talking about the team
treehouse on tech degree and I literally
went on the site like just to see like
what type of things they actually
offered and I was kind of surprised
because I had already like knew like
every single thing that they take degree
oh hey because I learned that all from
just like $10 courses on udemy so um
everything be like take the green hat am
I already knew MN and then somebody's
gonna be tight at the end of the day
when you'll be like oh
Oh Oh you at the same job as me I'm some
tools come out of college and boot camps
and and tech degrees like you know 60
$100,000 in debt and then you go in
there well I did this with $30.00 you
know what I mean like dudes be tight you
know I said to see a chat but I feel
like it's one of those things they were
like people think right like the more
something costs the better it has to be
the better value it'll give you yeah
yeah I I tell people all the time look
Oh what like the whole discussion that I
had with a clever programmer right I
think the kid is smart indicators great
for market anything he does what he does
right but what I was telling him I was
like yo you're promoting to the wrong
crowd most of his crowd is like from
Indian Pakistani Nepal that's the
majority of the people in there right if
you look at the the chat room right it's
a big difference my chat room is like Oh
American or English speaking countries
or even at that countries that were
English is their second language right
but for him to be basically trying to
sell 500 out of courses it doesn't make
sense now this is where the catch is
somebody even somebody from this same
chatroom enough from you guys you guys
yeah yeah think different but even
somebody in the chat room right now or
somebody is gonna watch this video later
on is gonna go and go to his website and
say hmm $500 here $10 here there's gotta
be more quality there because it's $500
and it's like no that's not what happens
what happens is that people could come
in and sell you a dream and basically
upsell your something that's cheaper
that the markets already say hey this is
this cause cheaper for you to get
especially if you're not like an expert
if you're not some dude that listen if
you like some do from from Google that
created the Android phone right
if you that dude I'll go sit down the
guy created the Android phone bro like
he earned that 500 you know what I mean
like it's worth it but it's like some
regular dude showing up and it's like
I'm gonna charge you five hundred
dollars just because I want to and I
want to see out of you know a hundred
thousand people that I could get into to
see me 1% is gonna pay that and I make
my money off that 1% you gonna say like
that's how all these big companies in
the boot camps work they promote to all
of this different uh there's different
crowds and say hey man we're gonna just
get 1% that's all we really care about
1% to people that we co actually take
their dreams eat them up and just
leaving without no money on you know
what I mean it's like that happens all
the time and people gotta be smarter
than that
you know like I look at even if you go
to like Tai Lopez right there's like so
many people in there's like super fans
of Tai Lopez like bro Tai Lopez distance
and diets I hope is his demand I look
with Tai Lopez is a great personality
Tai Lopez needs to get his his own high
call is like I just thought about the
Filipino milk in people my wife said it
was the scam yeah my wife says I didn't
believe her
never to be seen that dude is like under
a rock right now never to be seen cashed
out he said listen I got my $15,000 they
probably pay that do like $15,000 right
here you go
you're great actor you're great for
motivation it's like go speak for your
people over here in the Philippines is
like the dude is like that's like Tai
Lopez you know what I mean I tell opus
he's uh I think all these people are
great people when you meet them in
person they're great people
my only problem is when I see like man I
feel bad this times that people hit me
up and be like damn Joe there's people
that hit me up literally like damn Joe
like my for this month I won't be able
to pay for Cody face.com just letting
you know I'm like bro you don't have to
let me know personally like you can't
pay like you know what I mean is like
cuz I I don't know I feel like people
are more connected to me like personally
then the cutting phase brand itself then
the courting phase brain itself you know
what I mean so it's like bro like don't
worry about it I just tell them okay
listen just you finish it off you in
whatever and then you pay me whatever
you you freaking King you're gonna say
like if I see that you been here for
like three four months and I know you
can't pay like bro like what the hell
I'll be like I'm just gonna cancel you
like nah my dude is like it's okay don't
worry your body you know what I mean but
for some people that's out here they're
like listen man you go and sign up for
somebody's 500 out of course and then
they say we're gonna break it down with
three amazing pigments you know 200 200
and then 100 and then you tell them hey
man I can't pay that 100 at the end
unsubscribe disconnected you came and
get back into the website you get what
I'm saying because people is out here
just for their money
I mean I'm here for the money myself too
I'm not gonna lie I'm here to
get myself out there and promote myself
and get people to the next level right
but I'm here on a humanitarian way like
I'm not trying to take people's dreams
I'm not trying to hear freaking push
people to do things not to or what they
want to do I'm here to say hey here's
the timeline if you feel like you
connect with me and you can feel like
you can learn it with me do it with me
if not here's the best course
freakin udemy is the best courses or the
best websites for this that you got what
I say like the whole idea is for people
to just learn and be able to get out
there you know what I mean not she's
just like let's milk people let's put a
freakin a milk milk carton right under
them you know and just milk the out
of them like I'm not into that you know

cuz there I'm like the last one I'm like
the last of the mohicans right where
they're like man if we conquer coating
face you know how many freakin boot
camps keep hitting me up like listen man
if we get this guy it's like we won you
know what I mean
it's like it's not gonna happen you know
what I mean there's no it's not gonna
happen
black eyed IO is not gonna happen epic
atomy is not gonna happen
oh um coding dojo we now own coding dojo
is not gonna happen Dave mantain Singh
treehouse is not gonna happy lady
density Udacity definitely is not
you know how you'd add city did the
biggest schemes Udacity to say hey man
we gave her 50,000 scholarships like
just to get the biggest promotion for
the least important thing that they had
on the website like how can we get
50,000 people to sign up to the website
and then we have their email and then
now we could just promote the shout out
of them Udacity 24/7 like like we know
those games man I've seen all those
other different tactics that people try
to use with web development I'm like bro
I remember people he was doing this like
five years ago with like real estate you
know what I mean people be like hey man
I got I got that real estate course that
that's gonna get you this is gonna get
you the license everything man I got the
hook-up man you don't even gotta show up
for license I got the hook-up I got a
cousin Kewanee tow and he will sign you
up
you know I mean like those were showing
up online with things like that it's
like but for a limited time only
all you have to pay is $1400 dudes don't
even have
in a pocket those don't even they came
and pay the t-mobile bill and it was
like man we gotta get that 1400 man I
can't wait to see that video I'm like

and every time that you sign up back at

they tries to email you and then it says
email not set because you're
disconnected
that's God your boy is gone you get that
email bag like yo like that email don't
no longer exist play that domain has
been that domain has been repossessed by
GoDaddy
like we're coding phase coding phase the
domain freaking all expired and you're
like wait so what happened to my
lifetime is like easy a brand new
channel pop up out of nowhere were like
hi guys this this is your boy Juan you
know going there like you're going to
the next channel just like kill it looks
just like me the only difference is is
like you know I got one mustache I got a
wig on I got buddies to eat the same
turkey sandwich same circus said yeah
we're right do name create Tyler right
blocks skimmed every body on
YouTube like his first week right
started off they're like mm within a
month do hit a hundred K and followers
then he's like oh we trying to hire
people right oh I know who you saw a
young kid right
straight straight skin he'll the people
and that was crazy too like his
followers jumped up in a month from like
5,000 10,000 - all the way to like a
hundred and thirty everybody was
watching his stuff his gloves was dope
and then once you just started like
hearing people's like oh he scanned me
he scanned me scare me then he tried to
make a video like oh nine I didn't
happen like that come back real quick
like in order for you to do application
you basically had to do like sign up
with a credit card base I don't know
what type of fee he was charging but it
was to the point where even if you tried
to cancel it on the website that he did
or he had somebody do for it
it was so somebody actually put an
email on YouTube with him emailing him
and he was like yeah bro uh it still
charging me my mom and you know this is
some teenager so it's very nice to be
going to listen man that's how that's
how people do it man you know it was
like I was like one of the main things
that I hate about like when you go on
like YouTube you see all this fake
people man like one thing that I feel
like makes me different than everybody
out here it's just I'm just a regular
dude man I'm literally some regular dude
yeah I talk sometimes whatever I'm
just here with my family
and I say people who go into my personal
my coding phase my and tracks instant
Instagram you see just me my family just
regular you know what I mean like it's
not like hey here's Joe with a a
brand-new Ferrari just rent there from
Toro you know it's like hey here's Joey
his mansion in Calabasas and and then
you find it's the same mansion that you
could rent out for Airbnb and it's like
oh my god here's Joe in the in the
malleus is like oh this is my winter
home and you know that is right there
Rory I care more about those books than
that Ferrari because yeah but that's the
thing and then people is sad because I
feel back as people there's so many
people that they're looking to find out
what is it that what's the purpose in
life right like the people are still
looking online and see what is it that
they're gonna be good at you know
sometimes I think like sometimes you
gotta just be honest with yourself
sometimes you're not gonna be the best
anything you just gotta be good alright
anything that you you touch well you're
not the best right sometimes you just
have to just say okay if this is my
situation how can I make it better how
can I come in and work harder and
move on and strive to try to be the best
that I can do people try to be the best
at everything but not the best that they
can be on you know what I mean like you
have to try to just try and focus they
just they just say oh yeah let me try
this let me try it actually yeah and be
like yo everybody wants a shortcut
nobody wants to put into work you know
one of the things about you know like
web development and what's cool about
this is that you get back what you put
in this is not a quick scheme this is
not some things where people be like hey
man you know if you sign up for this
real estate course I'll show you how to
buy a house with 0% down as I bro like
you're lying you know what I mean
people who believe in those things is
because they're looking for a shortcut
they're looking for the easier route
they're looking for the way to try to
get a come up and it doesn't work like
that the world is not that easy right
so the only way to really get past the
certain class that you live on like
right you could be at hey you make
$30,000 a year that's the class that you
live on you live at the bottom right you
could be even worse and be earning only
$16,000 a year there's people that earn
that right there's people that are
freaking get only $8,000 a year and
that's that's all they get you know for
you to keep going up the ladder of the
different classes only way to do it is
either by education by something called
luck because you can never discredit
luck luck is a real thing luck is
something that it could just happen to
anybody you could be walking down the
street you found a bag full of gold that
bag you sold that now you got $200,000
in your pocket if you're smart you get
to put in a little taco stand or
whatever you want to put on you know
what I mean like you smart you you start
a little business or something there's
people that be like man you ever seen
that video that I put up online we're
way to do it is like matter of fact I'm
bout to put it up online because this is
one of my my favorite videos um hey was
it taxes Bentley all right this is one
of my favorite videos of all time
because I love this dude is hilarious
but because so many people pretty nice
bra like there's been so many situations
and so many friends of ours that they do
crazy stuff that like but like yo I got
a friend of mine who like like two
months ago was like yo I don't have the
money right now you know you could hold
me down dude is talking to me about like
yo bro income tax just came in I'm about
to buy the mozzie I brought two months
ago you even freaking have no money to
pay your rent like how are you gonna get
the mozzies like listen man I worry
about that wants to guess here like what
part of the game is that you can't say
so people do that all the time
like people they do bad decisions all
the time and people don't know what they
want in life you know you gotta have a
goal you gotta have a plan to fire your
plan as you say hey man this is what I
want to be to be at when when I get to
be you know 30 35 years old you know if
you're 20 years old you should be
planning your whole starting now start
all your home 20s until you get 30 at 30
that's what like right now I just start
30 like this the entrepreneur time you
know what I mean like everything that
I'm doing is for for stuff that I'm
gonna be basically enjoying at the 40s
you know what I mean like right now and
all the work that I'm putting here in
coding phase calm and everything you
know what I mean like I'm putting in
work from the beginning from the ground
up I haven't paid for No so promotion
having done none of that facially I
don't pay for fake subscribers
everything that you see here is genuine
people that's here that fo me greater
support that's here that's important and
I support them back out give them back
everything that I can email freaking
answer questions do everything that I
can right not none of the work that I
put in all the hours that I put into
this stuff I get nothing back like this
I could be literally working on my own
personal projects if I wasn't doing
oh yeah YouTube I could literally be
working on my own personal projects and
be really productive in making a lot of
money but what do I do I say hey I'm
gonna work on coding phase comm grow
this as big as I can there's a five-year
plan where this is gonna be like crazy
because look even when you think about
it looks reversing media in one year he
got to like 300,000 subscribers right
now mind you now he at this point where
he's at
that's like $20,000 a month just from
YouTube that's just from YouTube you
know what I'm saying me I'm taking a
different route but all the stuff that
I'm putting here and all the work that
I'm doing it just accumulates little by
little little by little little by little
listen and five years from now this
channel is gonna be huge but about that
time is gonna be crazy huge and then on
top but I have my other businesses and
smaller things so by the time I'm 35
could be the big dog that used to come
down through the block when I was young
I didn't see one of one of my boys
cousin that used to come through in a
Bentley just chillin got that he'd do
this oh he got a restaurant he got a
bodega he got a I'll freakin he's part
owner of a supermarket and you started
thinking like how the hell did he do
that well he's like 40 years old he's 40
years old he put in that work all
through his youth he invested in two
different things
and now he's good you know but some
people they don't think like that some
people's out here for a moment like
partying partying going out every
weekend can we do this now it's like
listen when you come from the bottom and
you don't have that little cushion you
don't have you know you know you can't
call uncle Shawn hey uncle Shawn can you
lend me 300 thousand to start my
business
nah boy you start from the bottom you
know what I mean like I started at
negative now I'm not positive you know
what I mean so it's like that's just how
it is you got to start having plans man
and I tell people all the time and just
keep watching my channel you gotta see
the growth man you're gonna see though
everything that I do cause I'm
documenting everything that I'm doing
I'm doing web development I'm teaching
you guys what the enemy so you guys
could get your foot in the door get a
decent income that's gonna get you money
so be comfortable but then from there
look at everything else that I'm doing
on the side so you can understand how
web development should be done what
development is not for just hey I'm a
web developer I work at Google for
$120,000 like people wipe their ass with
that you want to be like hey I'm what I
did web development and I'm entrepreneur
I got my own products I got my own
company I got I invested into other
things besides this we're gonna make
other things
somebody's they're going yeah somebody
somebody gotta go hey hey yo Joe yeah I
wanted to actually ask you do this so
when do you think like Nick's
arm developer um showdown is actually
gonna be or whatever you call it like
dropping dropping like the other one was
low-key kind of boring because of those
people they look like they didn't even
want to be there yeah I mean you know it
is I'll try to do it Tuesday's I'm
trying to do it in the daytime and
Thursday I'm trying to do in the
nighttime like how we did it right now
so that's the whole thing man like
Tuesday Tuesday and Thursdays that's
what I'm trying to do the drop in James
with coding face so we could have have a
how we have it right now what it's just
about different things first it's like I
said I don't know which Kevin wasn't
that was telling me that you know we we
ready for the chat listen the first hour
is just me answering the questions those
questions I'm gonna chop it up reapplied
them on the website on on YouTube we
upload them on YouTube for the people
that don't watch it
most people don't we'll never get to
this ending right this 50-something
people on on the live stream right most
people don't watch it to this long right
this is just for us right this for for
the real members of coding face.com you
know what I mean like this for us this
is the time to where we come in we talk
about anything we have regular
conversations you know but in the first
hour is like me I have to knock out
order answering the questions so
everything that I have to do and then
from there I basically reupload them so
YouTube and that's the the new format
I'm trying to I'm trying to keep this
you know in a certain format and yeah
man just trying to take it oh wait a
minute hold up Joe hold up Joe
um I don't know if we've like you heard
but you didn't really answer my question
uh maybe the answer am I was basically
asking when do you think that like
Nick's a competition um it's gonna be oh
you talking about my father talking
about like live streams like this like
this one oh no the next competition I
don't know to be honest with you I don't
know exactly because even at that I did
the the last competition I couldn't even
finish it because
one of the people didn't really reach
out to me I know cam got to finish his
work
the other care forgot his name he didn't
get to reach out to me or I don't know
maybe he got lost in the emails so I
never even did the last episode of the
show so I don't even know I want to do
another competition I want to do another
you know live show how how we did it
before but I think it's difficult
because it's like you got to make sure
everybody's there on time now you know
how many people call out that one I
can't make it this week I can't do this
and that like not everybody's committed
man like I want to do it in a way where
I could give out money like if I'd be
like y'all I got thousand dollars for
somebody whoever wins but the problem
with that is that the legality of things
like there's certain things that you
can't do like you I think you can't
really give it up and like money unless
it's like legit like some people do it
on YouTube but I don't I don't want to
get caught with that like that's like
some felony felony charges if some some
guy who decides to be an idiot
especially the amount of haters that I
get somebody be like oh this guy's is
giving out winners money as I came and I
was like some racketeering type I'm
like I ain't trying to with that
you know so I'm trying to figure out how
to make it that people actually get
motivated to be here weekly and do the
competition you got what I'm saying
maybe give them like a a laptop or like
a MacBook Pro or something like that I
don't know for products or like you know
some headphones or I don't know what to
do by software something you know
because that's the thing is like I'm
with it but it's people with it you know
what I mean like our people responsible
it's like that guy sam reny Sam showed
up and was freaking pissed off dreaded F
what up son hop in kid
yeah man so freakin she was crazy he's
like he didn't show up and he was mad at
me because I put the count down the
street fighter' countdown like oh he's
down Bobby he's like euros like you did
me dirty this isn't that why you put my
face there
I'm like bro is a show it's like like I
was planning on doing that to everybody
because I know people were gonna get
freaking either not show up or things
like that so I was like this is what I'm
gonna do for everybody whenever they
don't show up it's gonna be like well
there's like nine Hey seven is like
ideas like like you know what I mean
like the street fighter was pissed off
he couldn't even take it I'm like bro
it's just a show man it's just us having
fun man like calm down you know you know
hopefully you know I would love to have
more people back on but it's like man
