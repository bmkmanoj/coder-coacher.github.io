do the message messenger part where
we're basically just going to break it
down into different sections we got this
section here we got the next section
which is all of the messages and then we
have the search area okay so let's do
this alright so to get started we're
going to start with the top let's create
the HTML for this okay let's close up
everything that we have here as far as
the content container and let's open up
this messenger okay so we're gonna come
here put in a div class messenger header
div then we have div class equals to
icon okay
copy this copy this copy this okay so
first is the messenger icon icon right
at the end we have the three dot dots
icon and here we have the title so let's
do this we're gonna say messenger okay
now the next thing that we're gonna do
we got to come all the way to the bottom
of this page we already have this
already set up we got the idea of
messenger then we have what was a
messenger header inside of here we have
the was a messenger icon we have the
title and we also have the dot icon or
we could say options options icon for
options okay now let's get the icons for
font awesome
for this
in just tea
let me see I don't know
we should take this one which one shall
we take
that's the comment this is a comment
let's just take this one for now copy
this put this here okay
and then we're going to search for dots
and this one is a circle I just copied
this one
the color was a
let's copy this put this here okay save
that
all right we're gonna put in color is
going to be white for the title let's
see what else
we want to say text transform
capitalized okay let's say font weight
let's say 600 now let's go back here
we're gonna put everything inside of the
messenger header we're gonna say flex
display flex okay
you
all right now let me see search-header
the height of this is 53 point 33 so
let's say height 53 point 33
let's also get a gradient so let's say
CSS Matic grading generator okay we're
going to get the dark color so let me
see where is it
okay variables we got dark side dark
side starts here and then goes to light
so paced us here okay let's get the
light side now
okay and the direction is gonna be like
that going to the right side the seam
just gonna copy I'm gonna copy this one
at the bottom we don't need to copy
every single thing because automatically
this adds my what developer starter kit
already adds all of these for you and
let's see so we got messenger header put
this here
background linear gradient to the right
and let's see how that looks
okay so let's put in what's the height
of this thing here that's 33 point 33
point 33 okay so
now let's see font size let's say 33
pixels
that's not really what we want
you
sighs little Zico
are let me see user
font size
icon sections one sizes 1.2 Rams
so that's fire me say phone size 33
pixels all right then I'm gonna say
padding let's see 5 pixels top and
bottom and let's see 20 pixels left and
right
you
okay let me see
you
let's change this to 1.2 rim
let's put in color white
okay color white
you
Paden less 8 20 pixels say 15 15 pixels
all around
you
see so padding is ten pixels all around
on this okay
now
the high of the search box is 33 point
33
so technically we want the messenger
icon to be height 33 point 33 pixels
okay perfectly all right that's what we
want now we want to say that we want to
display flex so display flex on each one
of the section so we say display flex a
line item Center justify content Center
so we're going to copy this paste it for
all of them
that's gonna send to them all right now
the next thing that we want to do is
basically give this a whiff so I want to
say I'm in messenger icon with let's say
30%
you
okay 30%
you
let me remove the padding from the left
or right for now so we got 30%
I see title
I'll say 500
you
you
okay let me see maybe 300 looks better
so for
we'll definitely change the
we just playing with Roboto the Fontan
it's not exactly as the design but it's
close enough for now okay let's say font
size on this make a little bit smaller
1.1 Ram
okay now this we want this to be a line
items or justify content flex end so we
want this to go all the way to the end
but the way from this we're gonna say
with let's say
thirty thirty percent
okay so what do we have here so we got
this split up pretty even
you
okay
so let me see I actually want to move
this a little bit more to the left so
I'm gonna put in let's say flex and a
flex start for the first one flex start
okay
and then from here I'm gonna put in I
say 20 pick 20% forget to make a little
bit more this way
on this one I'm gonna say so we got 2030
this we're gonna say with 50%
okay so that's fine now on this I'm
going to say padding right 15 pixels
copy this
messenger icon I'm going to say
padding-left
15 pixels
okay now the next thing that we wanted
the box shadow
so copy this and we're going to add that
to the messenger header so here we're
gonna put in box shadow and close it up
okay so let's see what's going on with
this back shadows not looking so good
right now okay and that's because of
this color here so
you
okay so that's how it is all right
now
one thing that we wanted to do we wanna
do the same thing that we did before
we're gonna say overflow:hidden on this
so we must say overflow:hidden
okay and we're gonna change the
box-shadow to be let's say 1 B 1 B 1 B
so yeah ok 1 B 1 B there you go save
that and there you go so now we got our
header it looks nice and clean I wanna
change so you can see this like a little
shadow that is spinning to to this
section we don't want that to happen
let's take this overflow and put it on
the messenger itself ok and now as you
can see it's nice and clean there's no
shadow overflowing to this let's comment
this out so you can see what I was
talking about
you see the shadow was spilling to the
other side you don't want the shadow to
go anywhere you want the shadow to be in
here ok we don't want this to affect any
other elements that's right next to it
ok yeah this don't look that bad look
having a website like this actually
looks good alright so let's get back to
this okay let's see what
on here so let me see something
see as far as the height of this this
container
let's see 800 pixels I want to check
something out
you
I think we're gonna change it to a
hundred so now that we already here you
might as well do this right might as
well change the the height of it so
instead of being
you see instead of being a 900 let's put
it at 800 800 pixels
let me see contin container let's say
800 okay
so this whole concert
container the maximum height
that's gonna be
let me see yeah this constant contain is
800 pixels okay and that's what we want
alright guys so I'm gonna see you guys
in the next video alright bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
