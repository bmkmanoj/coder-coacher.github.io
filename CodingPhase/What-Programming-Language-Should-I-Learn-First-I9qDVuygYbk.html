they think like you know javascript is
super hard and for some reason people
cannot understand HTML and CSS for some
reason I don't understand people have
such a hard time with CSS that I will
say hey let's start with our programming
language or real programming language
right let's start with room right and
I'm actually going to do some videos
like you know you know how people do
let's play videos we're gonna do let's
learn programming
okay let's learn programming I'll be
nice right yeah so I'm gonna start a
series where it is basically i'm going
to start with the basics of ruby and
then you know later all we're going to
create a website creator you know none
of my sequel learn the whole movie oh

everything good movie and why would you
want to learn with Ruby especially where
people are thinking who real rails is

as a bump to become you know ruby on
rails developer think you're pretty much
starting with the big boys I'm talking
about 80 90 grand so yeah I will kind of

because it's so simple and so easy to
start with and like you guys don't even
have sort of stored on your computer you
can learn from online by following me
you know what I mean and then once you
learn the basics of programming trust me
that's all you really need once you
learn the basics of programming you're
pretty much going to be able to you know
learn any other programming language out
there thank I just want to make it easy
for you guys so how like an evil
introduction so pretty much that's it
guys are keeping you updated we got fun
to videos today and uh yeah follow UK
