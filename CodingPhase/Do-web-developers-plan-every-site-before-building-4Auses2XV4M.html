jump back at it again man coding phase
comm welcome to the web developers lunch
break alright so today we got a question
and I'm going to tell you guys right now
I do apologize basically trying some
lewd things out but yeah
okay so k-town 50 set when you design
something do you just jump into your
code or do you do drawings to decide
what you will do first I guess I am
asking you uh do you have a model that
you follow for each site
well this is what I'm gonna say
basically I should be drawing things out
I should be planning things out but 90%
of the time either clients or employers
that I work for they need results as
soon as possible so it's like I start
coding like before I even play anything
out like I know this let's say is an
e-commerce website so I know there has
to be a front page a products page a
categories page you know a cart so then
I start building those things right so
then after that you know whatever comes
up like if the special cases that I have
to go in there and you know create like
a brand new component or create logic
that's different from every other
e-commerce website that I've done before
then I focus on that but most of the
times I just start building the pages as
soon as possible even if I don't have to
design I still go out my way and just
start building them because you just
have to get started sometimes employers
or you know a client might just be like
man we trying to you know we're trying
to knock this out as soon as possible so
that's how I do things
now I wish I had the opportunity to just
plan things out every single time
but the reality of things is is that it
just doesn't happen like that most of
the time people just want things as soon
as possible so you just have to start
coding right or like whenever I'm
building my own personal projects I
don't sit down and and start writing
down like the things that I'm going to
add to it I just start building the
pages and I just start coding away man
because in reality is like I already
built so many different types of pages
that I know exactly what each one is -
needs to have like you know if I if I'm
doing an ecommerce website I know it's
gonna be a front page categories page a
way to filter the products or a payment
gateway like I know those things now if
I'm building something like a social
media website that goes found on social
media site or even I don't know anything
right it's like most of the times
already built something like that so I
already know that in my head I know
exactly what type of pages and means
like if I'm building my portfolio like
an on it I need to have an about page a
contact page you know and then for that
I just start building it you know
there's times that I have the
opportunity to start making the designs
beforehand but since I know how to code
like this times that it's quicker for me
to just start coding it like if I have
an idea of how the design should be most
of the time I don't go into sketching
and start drawing it and or I start
designing it and I rather just go in and
just start building it myself because I
already know what styles I want what
colors I want like it's all in my head
already right now if I have to give it
to you and you were brand new developer
I'm like man I got the design in my head
I want him to create that I have to
design it for you but if I'm the
building you know things just for me
like I'm doing it just for me man like
I'm going into straight color straight
HTML CSS like I have an idea in my head
I just build it you know for you guys I
was saying is good to plan things out is
very very good to play
and so but not every job is gonna let
you plan things out ahead of time you
know there's always a deadline there's
only something like oh can we build this
as soon as possible can we build this by
tomorrow can you build me a a
Facebook clone by next week and reality
you're like it's not possible I can
build in a couple of pages but to have
all the features that Facebook has and
takes time right so a man that's what I
would say right
but um yeah man I like the question man
definitely is a good question because a
lot of people wonder like when do I
start planning things out so I just
start going as soon as possible and it
all depends on if you have the time like
right now if your branding developing
like you want to get a project very
solid and you're like I don't want to
have to deal with bugs I don't want to
have to deal with the problems that come
with a website when you're it's not
planned then plan it out you know draw
some some some sketches of how you want
the layouts to be write down how you
want the database to be you know if you
have the time for that do it if you
don't then you don't you just have to go
in and you know start building things
that's what I do you know what I mean
but yeah man any questions that you guys
might have man this how my new what
developers bunch breaks are going to be
I'm going to be making quick videos from
five minutes to ten minutes every day
for you guys so answering questions or
topics that might come up with so yeah
