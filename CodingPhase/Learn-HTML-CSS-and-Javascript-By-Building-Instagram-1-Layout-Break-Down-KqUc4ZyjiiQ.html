enjoyed back at it again man listen
we're going to teach you how to break
down a website right and I do this for
every tutorial that I do so there's
always my first step so we want to
recreate you know Instagram right so
we're going to say okay there's a header
there's some cars and that's about it
it's pretty simple recreating this event
is pretty simple so we know all this
here is inside of the body all right so
we say okay this whole section here is
inside of the body right then we have a
header all right it's okay just a header
that's section all right but inside of
the header we know that there's four
menus right for menu links those
formatting link for on two three four
and inside those four many links this
icon right in the center
all right before they go all right now
we got to go down to the car and break
it down as you can see here I have set
up by section of how we're actually
going to build it you can have the body
you're going to have the header you're
going to have a menu and then inside of
the menu there's four links inside of
the links there spike on all right all
right now you're going to continue with
the card right so we know this card is
going to be a car container so there's
going to be like a parent container of
this the card I mean okay we got that
then we want to start from the top I'm
going to fake our header which is this
and got the user's photo and the user's
username and then from there how long
was the posted or like you know almost
two hours ago right then we have the
medium which is this section right and
then we have what this section which you
find basically where people put a
description or an image or their video
and people get to see their comments
it so that dissection there then from
there we have the comment section this
is where the user is able to basically
let the text read this right here is a
text field it might not look at like a
texture was action detection and just
icon here and icon there so right there
right so that's how you break it down if
that's simple nothing too crazy GGG or
you already knows you boy chill back at
it again man listen make sure you
subscribe and make sure you like this
video man by the way if you want to know
exactly what courses I took to become a
web developer they right there in the
description it's no secret it's nothing
crazy is no secret gifts that I had is
just pretty much I took the courses
they're pretty cheap that I Kristin
dollars feeds on specials and just
listen man change your life change your
lifestyle do something fun it's
something cool that you could call a
career
