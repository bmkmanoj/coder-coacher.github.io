it again man coding phase car make sure
you subscribe make sure you like to this
video man alright so we're going to
continue with the rocky stack alright so
like the same example you wanted to deal
with static files for you guys who are
new to this and you just want to work on
something new like I say your index page
right you can just have to go to here
you have all this folders on your main
folders you're going to see public right
public means this were the public sees
so these are the files that anybody
could go to your website so they say if
they go to Conan face calm slash static
HTML that's the file that they got to
see or if they go to concrete calm slash
CSS and then slash main dot CSS then
they're gonna see a CSS file right so
this is where those files are being
hosted CSS JavaScript in your HTML
alright so let's do this real quick
let's say we want to create index.html
right here is here on the main folder
public so now we have that file right
now if we come here and we say you're on
server what is going to do is gonna run
the server and then now we could
actually see that file on the website
alright so we click here you see and
it's a HTML this is just a plain HTML
file all right now let's say I want to
change this up so I say
the Skamania the file changed you see so
it's definitely static right so once you
change the file it changes automatically
on the server so all right now let's
talk about dynamic views dynamic views
are pages now are being rendered by the
server itself so it's not a static file
static files dot HTML or dot PHP that
whatever it is right that's a just a
regular file right but we're talking
about dynamic files files that you could
take variables from the server and print
it out on the page that's the dynamic
file all right so we're going to start
with the most simplest one which is
actually let's say get which is a get
request and then we're going to do slash
dynamic and then now we're going to do
do and then inside we're going to say
render and then we want to put in source
views pages slash dynamic right now
having created the speech yet but I will
do it in one second all right so now
we've saved this now what we do is we
basically create the page dynamic that
we see are so embedded crystal that's
what actually ECR stands for so you can
actually look at the documentation on
the website crystal lang dot org slash
api you could go in there and search ECR
and you see right here and this is going
to bring it to this page and you're
gonna get a little bit of knowledge of
what's going on they have a example here
which tells you exactly what to do so
we're gonna actually build something
similar to this but very simple okay so
remember we created a dynamic DCR right
so we're going to say this is a dynamic
page right so what this is going to do
now is going to Brenda we're gonna say
hey server load up you know run the
server and then from there the server is
going to take this page and it's going
to make into a regular page into a HTML
CSS and JavaScript take pics right so we
honest a yarn run server right it's just
gonna be a regular page but not so
regular you're gonna see why all right
so sorry we in here okay camel encounter
the problem okay so the issue here is
that we didn't put the extension so it's
gotta be dot ECR that's my fault but
it's good that you guys got to see that
because you get to see that actually
gives you errors it gives you you know
something that you can look for you okay
so what about an extension so now you
can come here me okay you look here
you're not okay wait it's missing
something
and you're okay that EC is missing for
me so we come here and we say okay the
dot ECR if you can't we say y'all run
server right hmm
voila right so now it shows you see this
is a dynamic page that's simple all
right now really interesting remember on
the static page and we could actually
come here and say hey index dot HTML and
we could just come here and change this
just by changing the file so that let's
say we're doing index hey this is the
menu part tool right so we change that
and if we refresh the page it changes
you see that right now let's try to do
that with dynamic views right so we
still have the server here running let's
try to change the dynamic view all right
so let's say part 2 when we refresh this
page is the same thing why because
there's already got compiled like that
it's already in the server already
running that way so that's the
difference between static files and
dynamic views
right so let's stop the server and come
back right we save this and let's rerun
it run server so now what it's doing is
compiling it and basically getting it
together for us now part two is dead you
see that's the difference between static
and dynamic okay
now the cool thing about dynamic fields
I'm gonna show you right now so let's do
this we're going to stop the server come
back here and we're going to declare a
variable we now say name name equals Joe
right and then we're going to say let's
say H equals to 29 right now we have
that we're going to print out both
variables the name and age so we're
going to delete this dynamic page the
first thing that we had there or we're
going to say user and then we're going
to say this is a syntax that you guys
gotta remember and then we want to say H
okay now what's happening here what is
doing is basically saying hey on this
page embed this variables okay so it's
basically going to bring those variables
that we have in the route which you know
they don't call it controllers or
whatever you guys want to call it but
it's really the routes right we're
basically saying okay
I want you to print out on this dynamic
view I want you to print out the name
and I want you to cut out the H and
that's what we're gonna see right now
this is our one server and then we
refresh the page user Joe aged 20 now
this thing a little bit what's going on
okay now let's jump to the next thing
okay
so what's cool about dynamic pages and
save you basically could run you know
raw crystal on the page and different
you know different things like if
statements loops whatever right of
course you could do all those things in
other languages like PHP you could do
the same
no GS but what's cool about this is that
you could do this here on crystal so
let's do this right now right let's do
it like this so we're going to say you
are young right you are old so we're
going to say if the user is older than
30 we're gonna say you're old if H is
greater than 30 well in fact greater
than 29 then you're old oh okay all
right now this should tell us something
right you are young
matter of fact if yeah exactly that's
fine if a is greater than 29 you are
young welcome at fact little backwards
if age is less than 29 or let's say 30
right if age is less than than 30 then
you're young if it's greater than 30
then you're old
all right so let's run this and I don't
mean that you guys are old if you're
above 30 guys it's just me playing
around okay so little is so it says you
are young because it's less than 30 now
what if we send this to be you know left
and
25 right what's going to happen here
you gotta reset the page remember
whenever you do a change in our dynamic
view you have to reset the server now
one point I'm going to automate that to
happen automatically but from now you
know it's the first version of the Rakhi
stack so you know bear with you so you
have to reset the page every set to
start on the server I'm sorry guys
okay so you see because it says if H is
less than 25 it's gonna say you are yep
if it's greater than 25 it's gonna say
well you are old so pretty much you
could run you know if statements loops
on the page so I don't know it's very
useful especially for situations like
where you want to say hey is this user
logged in on that alright that's so
that's the end of the video this is part
1 of the views I'm going to name this
static files and view pages part 1 so
then I'm going to create a part 2 which
is going to come up next and I'm gonna
teach you guys how to work with layouts
and how to do includes and all the cool
things that you know camel has for us
especially the Crystal leg alright guys
you know I love you guys man make sure
you subscribe make sure you like this
video man please subscribe man
please share it please tell your boy and
I hey man you want to know how to become
a full-stack developer guys there's the
time to learn crystal a and by the way
if you looking for courses go on my
description right now you could get
courses for $10 on udemy once you use my
link alright guys it's right there in
the description you will see the courses
