right so we have a design we're going to
follow what this is I have but we're
going to use our own images what I want
you to do is follow my instructions
follow what I do trust me you will be
able to succeed in this this is going to
be such a cool project because it's
going to show you what it feels like to
be a full stack developer from scratch
all right now you see this here let's
make this thing into I actually like it
like that size like your little design
has it like that I actually like it like
that now let's do this let's give it a
little margin margin cut our whoops
margin to the right some pixels cool
yeah so let's go through that now let's
care for a space between you know the
bottom of that the paragraph so you
wanna say marking bottom is too low the
size of this thing
24 pixels that's another thing that you
guys gotta learn line hierarchy you see
it just looks more cleaner when you keep
give everything almost the same size and
the same spacing it gets more cooler so
let's do this one more time so let's say
I think this is a little bit bigger
okay 30 pixels now for this you know
copy this and we're going to put it here
on the side section
I'm gonna say okay whoa all right now
for the title let's give it another
patty so of course not that let's give
it half of that say 15 pixels cool now
let us see what else can I do to this
maybe let me try this
I'll try see what's going crazy nah okay
what else
okay we got the buttons which are this
too so let's see how it looks okay now
let's look at the HTML how it is set up
you have Dave action buttons so stop it
is now inside the content area we have
action plans as you can see you see how
everything's set up inside of the
console area system model which is that
and then inside of the model there's
only a image and then inside of the info
which is this area there's a whole bunch
of different elements and then I have
all those elements inside of info now
make sure that this action buttons
actually go inside of the info so let's
do it like this now let's create this
also name of it right hallo BTN red
power
BTN now
Boulder wall pixel solid now that looks
like three pixels three pixels solid
array nice I love the too big to pixels
yeah
now we can say display:inline-block now
we want to say padding padding let's
give this 20 pixels okay now so out of
this I'm going to call this price then
change it to price now we're going to
say inside the red Holly button we're
going to put in price and the price is
going to be color oh it is already
everything's inside of it is already
ready so color red color red and then
price we're going to be font size that's
24 pixels 495
all right now we question use the same
trick to Center
so we're going to say we're going to
take this display:inline flex Center so
we're gonna say hey well place this here
should do it here side of I see now
everything Center inside of it now we're
going to say give this a little space
going right 10 pixels now both side of
this we're going to say text transform
uppercase because we want this to be
uppercase cool now you see the font is
actually smaller than that so font size
toward the pixels star good so pixels
yeah that's good
now look this up the line kerning CSS
letter spacing is this alright that's a
little bit too big okay
okay that's fine now let's give the
stone space here to let's create most
out of the button light grey u2n that's
what this one ends we want to say like
gravy TN what else I like grey BTN
background might Rick's Adobe color
whoops
Toby okay I'm already registered to this
thing it's free guys so let's do this
like this code there's a big store
public image supreme let's get all them
colors in here
all right now what was the colored I
needed I needed this color okay this we
don't need that color all right
now we saving it up damn it
save is that it's saying I'm
still free can see them in the back are
you see that
see okay so this is missing there's
something role of the JavaScript as you
can see the simple SS void I don't know
why it's messing up today but I guess
it's messing up but for now let me just
going here add a copy I'm gonna bring in
myself copy this so two things happen
well sometimes a website mess up that's
what you gotta know how how to do things
improvise kids okay what else
let me see you want me to make this too
light great for now until we figure out
what's the color of it
okay we gonna copy this you're going to
sing my copy this fall ahead of it just
just to save ourselves some time
and then whatever we don't need we just
take it out so let's see was the border
around it there's no border so border
deleting okay color let's say is 1 B 1 B
will be okay let's do this then the font
size on this thing is supposed to be
smaller so from size 10 font size 10
yeah that looks better
okay now let's do this minimal minimum
height so that both be the same height
high save see how much it this one I see
what's the size on that one okay
24 plus 20 okay so let's take little
height say 30 pixels my fact not a
minimum height max height for this one
you got to find the right thing things
that this thing here because it big is
messing it up so let's have some more
padding around it where is it padding
okay now let me to this little the
cessation relative no was a tap negative
green pixels then cut negative five
pixels okay that's what's possible now
with should be minimum
same with this what's the waves back so
it's war for the inside plus 24 okay so
180 okay let's be one pixel smaller so
let's make this notice five Missy
Caligula you think I can zoom in you
know that's pretty much the same size
now this background is bothering me
because I know it's not supposed to look
like that
so because we got them yellow okay
like rain yes okay now this is too late
okay now can ya that's absolute Stan
yeah that sounds perfect cool but as you
could see this like a a margin it's like
a marginally so 490 I think I saw the
whiff of this thing so inside of this
content area class info
there's another container so we want to
say fifth class insider you're going to
call it insider from now and then we're
going to put it down here now what we
gonna do is when I give this pill space
both side for the insider okay all I did
was just press type it's for my own you
know
because I like to see the code pretty
clean now
this tool is the maximum which was the
insider where's the action buttons for
model so insider you gotta copy all of
this
cut it put inside the inside let's see
did it wait
kind of messed it up okay yeah we just
bring it back let me figure it this out
guys
I gotta figure this out so let's see
counter outside there let's just do it
here we don't have to put everything
inside of it okay so counting inside and
we want to say with Max with 490 so
daehwa jacket ripple sauce
little homie I'm a boss let me know how
much that costs
all right so now we can still try to
perfect this even more by actually let
me see because I want this image to be
at the bottom so one person used to go
all the way to the bottom of the screen
so let's see model
let's say height 100% okay now working
no it's not making it on yourself hungry
for the H no sorry I working there it is
like a perfect situation when you want
this thing to go all the way to the
bottom this is one you got to use
something like you know like a flexbox
because there's certain limitations to
CSS the railer CSS without the Flex
boxes so I might do this later on and
add some more but I think we just did an
hour kids so I might put a stop to this
right here but maybe not maybe I just
might dug it out and just finish the
whole styling in one video
all right let me see how long oh like
grade this minimal wave say 50% and then
what else man always on this other one
50% or with Bradl this rule with this
margin with a marching to the right
Adam spaceless how long
try to figure out where's the margin
it's 249 pixels okay so now let's better
okay and then we need to put this thing
inside of a container there's something
that we almost forgot to put so let's
see let's put this into a container so
we're going to put the whole page itself
inside of a container so we're going to
do this quick container max with 90% now
you're going to take all the HTML with
us in here
you're going to put it inside of the
container copy all of that put it inside
of the container what this is gonna do
it won't say the max worth of everything
is you see it starts here now let's see
why this thing is not it's not going oh
yeah we got to make the container sensor
so margin:0 auto now it's centered sure
okay
so we got that okay now of course we're
gonna write this response about some
point but for now we're not gonna worry
about making this thing responsive you
already knows your boy Joe back at it
again man listen make sure you subscribe
and make sure you like this video man by
the way if you want to know exactly what
