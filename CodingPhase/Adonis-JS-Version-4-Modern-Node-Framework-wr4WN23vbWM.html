it again man coding phases calm your
boys backing out and did it again guys
listen
Adonis Jes came out 4.0 came out it's
time to go but everything I'm actually
going to make a tutorial Asst you guys
probably know the people that have
followed me from the beginning I started
one of the very few tutorials here on
YouTube on Adonis Jes you know before
everybody else jumps on their a because
you know how it is whatever I do
everybody wants to do but pretty much
this framework Adonis GS is super cool
especially if you come from a background
of Ruby on Rails laravel Django like
it's super cool right and for me
personally well I like about it is it
gives nodejs structure right when I look
at frameworks like Express write Express
Cola you know it's a whole bunch of them
out there right they give you too much
freedom alright so what happens is you
spend more time on figuring out hey
where should I put my files and you know
what folder where should I do this how
should i do my routing how should I do
this and that that's why you have a
framework like Adonis GS that pretty
much say hey this is how you do it this
is how you work with me and that's it
right it's like it's pretty much
convention over configuration right so
what's cool about it too is just the
minimal requirements the minimum
requirements means that it needs a no J
yes 0.0 or greater or MPN 3.0 or greater
which tells me that the creative Adonis
Jas he's pretty much using the latest
things from no GS you know a lot of the
frameworks out there they using stuff
from Lake you know nodejs from like 6.0
no GS from 4.0 I've seen people trying
to get like a beta version like you know
some you know some companies they
have to have older versions of nodejs
for security purposes and because they
don't want to upgrade and change
everything throughout their whole
website and I understand that but if
you're a brand new company or a brand
new developer you should definitely be
using the latest nodejs
all right now all the cool things about
this it has routing it has you know it
lets you lets you actually come in and
use things like my sequel more easily it
has a or RM in there like it has
everything that you need you know
middlewares file upload what else uses
for the views I believe is still using
let me see oh SJS a word a new
templating engine okay so a new to learn
the last time that I checked it was
using nunchucks I guess the the Creator
decided to switch it up or maybe create
his own I got a C go check it out but
yeah man I'm super excited I'm gonna go
over this whole framework and I'm gonna
start creating tutorials for you two for
free you know for the people that keep
saying Joe we haven't seen you create
any tutorials I'm gonna create a
tutorial on Adonis GS which is no GS you
know for the availables who like to have
things structured right for people who
like to just hit the ground running
without having to think like Oh which
library should I get for my Express you
know no Jes slash whatever right if you
don't want to waste time you want to hit
the ground running with a great
framework Ordonez JSF for you alright so
for those people that keep saying like
Joe we don't know we where is your
videos on YouTube but we miss you
tutorials this and that guys it's on my
website right but this is one of those
tutorials that you know makes sense to
give it out to the people on YouTube
because you know I still get people that
hit me up and ask me questions about
Adonis Jes and I made those videos like
nine months ago you know what I mean so
it's crazy how you know this videos that
people you know they don't do them at
the beginning right they don't do the
tutorials at the beginning but somehow
people
to find my tutorials after some time you
know as a little bit discouraging when
you create a tutorial or or course on
YouTube it takes you seven eight hours
and next thing you look you're like oh
man I can't wait to see how many people
are watching and then you look it's like
twelve people you know out of thousands
and thousands of people on YouTube you
get twelve views right but it's fine
right
I don't mind doing this it's like
hyperope Jes it's like I don't mind
spreading the word of great frameworks
cuz you gotta understand this you know
when you have companies like let's say
an you know the creators angular which
is Google you have Facebook behind react
you know like those frameworks get
really popular even if there might be
another option out there that's better
than those right the reason why they get
popular is because people talk about it
and people share you know applications
and ideas that they have about the the
frameworks and you know the more you
talk about it the more that people get
to know about it right but you know
frame was like this like Adonis yes
Adonis j/s doesn't have like a big
backing it doesn't have those big you
know companies behind it where they're
like pumping money into it but it's fine
because not everything is coming forward
not everything that's good is coming
from major companies that's the truth
alright so yeah man I will see you guys
later
just wanted to drop this a little video
with you guys and yeah let me know what
you think leave a comment on the
description below and guys for those of
you guys that want to be you know
developers and still learning and still
trying to get in the game and just want
to be more comfortable and have somebody
talk to you you know the same way how
you talking you know just have somebody
help you out hold your hand through this
whole process guys you gotta go to my
website coding phase calm listening is
the best place to get your courses man

not gonna find a better deal than that

over 20 courts or for ten dollars right
