livestream arena in my life
no shows I'm dick yeah people will see
me Miller a yes so much let me go check
this close
we're here live next to the inner circle
martial arts doing the Little Rock so
what's good kids what you guys working
on
although what you guys is working on man
today I'm knocking out a couple of
videos for nodejs
man I'm trying to finish that as soon as
possible man I love mo Jes but they
could get boring after a while
- man what I mean
like I'm not trying to be doing nodejs
my whole life
trying to jump onto his new tutorial
move courses that I got
and you got mineral in my shop
marjory of starving kid
how is it that I will use the director
the FK from github every time when i
duplicate the directory when I'm done
yes
yes you download the no directory right
you download the zip and then what you
do is you rename it every single time we
rename it to something else whatever
project you work in office learn HTML
CSS you take that project and you rename
it to HTML CSS if you working on nodejs
you mean it yes but of course you got a
duplicate it multiple times you like
that I use the same folder every single
time you just download it unzip it and
after your zip it then from there you
just you make a copy of it and put it
somewhere else
rename it to the project that you're
working on
okay Mickey on the lead says hey Joe
I'm going this week into a coding
convention and many companies from the
city will be there got any tips for
talking to Don showing interest and
getting hired well what I will say is if
you can make sure to have some resumes
with I mean it's at a job fair or is it
just like a convention you know this is
where people have come to me asking me
about hey you guys are you guys taking
junior developers this and this this and
that right that's the moral that's I'll
be honest that's the lowering when
you're they're trying to show your
product and people come up to you like
oh do you guys are you guys hiring this
tomorrow
that's annoying what if it's a job fair
this that's different you gotta go in
there you know go presentable you don't
have to go in there with a shoe I always
feel like when you go into a job
interview or you go into a place with a
shoe on you gotta do the research and
the company first you can't show up
anywhere with a sewer you know I make it
sometimes you you're like a little bit
overdressed just put on put on some like
regular clothes you know a button-down
you know a little quick button now
preferably a black black shirt set and
simple not too colorful it would be like
a something simple for you something
that people could be like okay this guy
he's a cool kid he's he's dressing well
you know what I mean now for the
convention if it's just a convention
just go in there find out what products
they got what they working on what
projects
you know try to figure out like you know
actually in a nice way ask about that
about their heart that they selling or
that they building right now and then
actually all the you guys are you guys
currently taking anybody and it
developers you know and then like that
you try to get in there don't try to get
in there with asking them all about the
job first ask them about what the
product is you know make conversation
and then once you feel like they're
comfortable with you then you'll hit
them in the head
you'll be like yo you guys hired well
you hit them with that
Joe do you explain everything that's in
the Deaf kid directory in our second
video actually I'm supposed to do that
okay what I will advise you is don't
worry about everything that's inside of
the Deaf kid because if you're just a
beginner you're gonna get overwhelmed
there's more stuff and more concepts
that and reality you'll need to know
about because if like for example right
now I'm teaching you HTML CSS right if
you know HTML CSS that's all you need to
focus on until you get that done right
if you go in there I start explaining to
you hey this is the Deaf kid this is
gold this is JavaScript we're using this
object to make this you know it's like
it's too much you get overwhelmed you
gotta take it one step at a time but
later on I am gonna create a video
mattifying I'm probably gonna create a
cork
first project you should do is
determinate so hectic that you signed up
for the subscription or you bought like
one course
and also too it depends on what level
you are because if like let's say an
example if you know HTML CSS I'm not
going to tell you to take the HTML CSS I
will say skip that that's like for
people that are really like beginners
right so if you really want to find it
find out that's this thing called the
timeline it's on the top navigation you
click there and you will see everything
is in order
you know if you know how to use the
terminal then you can skip that if you
know HTML CSS you can skip up let's skip
the tool yes sir Manchester you know
Nene for my people for my beautiful
England man I'm over here repping for
you guys
so yeah
we just follow the timeline see what is
there you know follow the timeline and
there from there you should be good
that's my advice for you I would say
start with the terminal then after you
learn the terminal and then html/css
after that I believe is responsive web
app and then from there I will say take
future-proof JavaScript after taking
that take jQuery after taking jQuery I
will say take pug all right
oh no that's Tonto so I mean you look at
the time line one by one and you figure
it out
you figure it out which means you you
actually haven't done
we look at a term light you know
following
harder than anybody got any questions
man let me know yeah that's the thing
that's what I try to do like you know I
feel like I'm not I'm not building
objects
somebody give them a chance dogs out of
here
and the point of this gold beat here is
yeah I meant to slap this chair out on
this day my mother slapped the shadow
I'm now further buzz was gonna mess up
my stream to have a stupid dog barking
there by himself there man
any questions let me know I'm in here
kids
the mace of course in the description of
broken two of them are broken up fixing
that today soon as I get home whatever
reason Google says that they need to
think something policy
so you gotta fix that book and we'll fix
it today
okay Sonia swatter says hey just found
out about this web developer stuff
yesterday definitely pursuing this
career thanks for my recent info I'm
totally not a true listener I got on my
website : face calm pretty much the the
coolest course is out here this is my
thing my thing is to create courses that
be like we don't want to have a course
that is giving you stuff that you're not
gonna find in the real world you know
what I mean like there's only too many
to do apps that you can do
you know a looser
not even know does it go back to zero I
gotta check that out
we love we hear battle with the dogs
barking yes sir
but like I said like I was saying reason
what my question is good is because I
have real projects nothing like there
might be Allah performs in other ways
for people to learn and I think that
they're really good like cold steel web
developer boot camp I think it's really
good
and boy the reason why my course is gold
is because you need real live examples
like real life projects sometimes people
go and try to get this thing done but
they're like not prepared you know for
when they go through a job job interview
or you know all different jobs that
allow stuff money
in a
we're directly
there's a lot of them but I can't
remember I think the beach store there's
a project here that I have called the
Bape store on YouTube that pretty much
is
yeah
now that's what I'm saying like trust me
and like I tell people all the time like
the good thing about my courses that you
can reuse that code like everything that
I learned you know from from UT in all
these other places I reused a lot of
that code you not I mean
once you go one time you shouldn't have
to recreate the wheel every single time
don't swim the bank's 1988-1989
appreciate it man I'm glad that you know
it is becoming you really appreciate it
I just want to help people you know what
I mean like that's all I want
yeah this is why why ass black right
here there's like walls you know this
house right here looks like one of those
houses that somebody gets body in a
movie
you're a murderer
no one's funny is like what and you like
talking to yourself
so camera people look at you like you
crazy like you don't do something crazy
yeah I've seen that that commercial
where he turns to this guy turns to Joe
Pesci you ever seen that that's me
and I'm hoping I'm not myself there's
like another person there's another joke
the swag is not there the swag is not
there
skills is not there
Joe we still play League of Legends nope
I deleted that last night if you guys
saw the livestream yeah I could have
seen that I've deleted it right away I
got too much stuff to do man if I start
playing video games again I'm gonna make
no money out here you're gonna find me
under a bridge you know making websites
$0.99 day hey guys
like now
the a man I love Manchester
I love Milan I like Madrid who else I
like if it's like internet Brazil what
else I like
I used to like the New York Red Bulls
until they became garbage
yeah man that's how it is you can't be
playing video games on here like that so
much stuff to do man too much money out
here to be lame
leaving it for other people that's how I
look at it now you come down I'll play a
video game I'm like man I'm leaving
money for somebody else out there to
take that's Oliver I need to go and and
make some money
right now I can't be out here like that
now you know what's crazy when I think
about it when I was like 14 15 years old
spent like five six seven hours a day
playing video games and now that I look
back and I'm like what the hell was I
like what a loser
unless you're getting pay for unless you
like a big-time like League of Legends
freaking player
word
that should be like a game right there
make a video game where Joe has to make
it through YouTube comments without
getting hating up
seven of BT's
taking spot man
washing clothes man
those good about washing clothes outside
nice is that you get to go outside you
know having been outside like two days
two three days I've been just cooped up
making videos recording stuff that's the
only thing that I miss about like
working in the office it's just getting
out the house it's like now I have no
reason to get out the house now game
your face is not that I play games are
played selectively games like if you go
in there see you should subscribe to my
gaming channel but
you're not gonna see me doing 510 hours
of gaming but now I please select these
games man I play some NBA 2k where I
could play like it for 20 minutes and be
back what's the other one
Paragon because I could go in there and
half an hour we'll have fun you know by
spending an hour where I get to play two
games but League of Legends you're there
for one hour you play one game you come
out tired and you're freaking your arm
is jittery your nerves is crazy
