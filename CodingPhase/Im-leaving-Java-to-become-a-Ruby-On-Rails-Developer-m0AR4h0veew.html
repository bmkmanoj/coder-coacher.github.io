up man john g what up how's life man
alright guys don't miss on anything that
happens on coding phase comm subscribe
and click the notification and you get
notified every time that I drop a new
video or a new content Allen Wells girl
was good can you hear me yeah cool here
you can hear me okay call okay yeah yeah
I'm good how are you I'm good man how's
life man huh doing good just doing stuff
on the weekend you know just enjoying it
amen you got to enjoy the weekend man
yeah yeah definitely
especially from work so so uh how long
you being a developer how long you've
been in this man uh I'll say since like
May of 2015
okay so yeah you started working already
you uh uh no I'm just trying to
currently trying to move to another
stack yes I'm currently working on I'm
currently like a Java developer company
currently trying to move to maybe like
Ruby stack or probably node a poly more
to a porch Ruby since there's more more
stable mm-hmm I would say now that's hot
that's I think I think that that would
be a really good good move for you plus
you have since 2015 you've been working
or yeah it's like one company for about
maybe buddy here and then got laid off
from there cuz of how their system works
and pretty much they're like an odd job
for seven months delivering packages
door-to-door just to get by and then got
hired to another company like seven
months later okay here and where I
currently live that so will you part you
from Oh from Texas a Santana a a Texas
you already know that's why people's out
there man shout out to h-town your you
know we here sourcing it you know set
out the sauce
twins man we are here man I so let's get
it
alright so it's hot man I mean you
already have skills right you already
know programming you already know Java
so all those skills that you have in the
experience that you have you could
easily transfer it to another stack now
is it's time for you to just start
building your portfolio as if you really
want to become a ruby developer or the
things that I will say really focus on a
building full applications and don't do
what a lot of people do like they create
applications and don't give access to
the application right like you want to
create an application that you have a
back-end meaning an admin section I see
that I see a lot of times people come in
and but I hate here's my blog and you
know it's like the blog is cool it shows
that you know the crowd you know how to
work the the framework you know how to
work with databases migrations the whole
shebang right but now you want to have
an admin section and you want to be able
to supply what was the employer like
somewhere at the bottom and say hey
here's the the password to an admin so
that admin user so now the person could
go in there and say oh cool he has in an
online store this is pretty legit let me
log in to the online store see
everything working they could add
products they could um check or what
product sold like you know what I mean
like you want them to see that you are
ready for primetime and you really know
the framework cuz in Ruby on Rails were
noting too that they really asked for a
lot is testing unfortunately they got
the r-spec and all that bs I hate that
part I hate that part of Ruby on Rails
you mean like a testing testing yeah
yeah actual testing so that's why pretty
much have to jump up on get more into
that just in case I apply for any jobs
that may require any testing libraries
or frameworks or that even at that year
you're fine because with the skills that
you have and experience that you already
have they you know though if you have to
write
and you could show them I hate listen I
could build whatever you want then from
there what they would do is I okay maybe
you don't have that much years in doing
text testing so because you don't have
testing that much you know we'll take
like a $5,000 if there was gonna pay you
ninety thousand did they'll pay you
eighty five right who cares it's five
thousand dollars he's still gonna get
higher you know what I mean I've seen
people I know one of my friends was like
pissed off because he had guy in a Ruby
on Rails position and they they deducted
him like five thousand dollars because
he didn't have the skills as far as I
testing so the position was like for
ninety ninety two ninety three thousand
dollars a sign like that and they
deducted him like five thousand dollars
so he was like a eighty eighty eight or
something like that he was like pissed
off was like rain I'm not gonna take the
job I'm like bronze fraud Island dollars
like you know it's like two hundred
dollars less on your check
like just frickin take it you know I
mean so you're gonna be fine
yeah cuz I got my jobs I just straight
through a resume and implying so I
haven't had a pearl to get jobs but
that's because I graduate from college
with a CS degree so that's pretty much
the main reason why they gave me a
chance no no I'm not one of the to goal
audience for this channel but I do watch
your channel a lot and your videos are
have all those gems in there and it's
just it also ends here and watch the
same time so do you know it taught me
some stuff that I didn't know so you
know yeah no no I'm really glad look
this channel is for everybody we welcome
everybody here you know I used to have a
a side persona of kumbaya Joe but come
by a joke passed away now is Joe
Hollywood Hogan you know what I mean so
it's like now we got a new character
coming in but we welcome everybody you
know um and at the same time is like
listen this things that I tell people
all the time that you could take some
things that fit for you and some things
that don't fit for you like now
everything on the channel is gonna be
for everybody
meaning like I might one day I might
talk about a topic that
relates to you and then the next day it
might relate to the the next person you
know what I mean
so for you as a you know computer
science developer you know somebody with
the cs degree like that's exactly what
I'd be telling people like hey when like
let's say for them who are self-taught
developers if you don't have that degree
what's gonna happen is if you don't have
a portfolio you're done you're not
getting in period now you because you
are a developer you already have a OCS
degree you could say hey man I know
everything I already know the theory I
already know that their destructions I
already know I have a history this is
something that that shows on your resume
like hey this holds weight when your
cell to a developer the only thing that
holds sway is the project's in the first
impression if you give somebody a good
impression and be like damn how the hell
this guy his website look better than
our website you know they want you
automatically and even for you too now
that you're you're focusing more on the
website right let's say I don't know if
you as far as Java will you do like
spring or were you doing like what what
exactly were you focus on well let's be
honest currently for this whole EE for
this whole year they pretty much have me
working with Salesforce instead of Java
so that's pretty much the main reason
why I'm looking because I'm using
Salesforce it's okay but it's not really
my thing I'd rather focus more on actual
development and front-end back in you
know so I thought maybe I can switch to
Ruby I can do more fun stuff in the web
yeah that's pretty much what I feel I
want to do but the the company itself
and all that it's like real nice to work
there and all that and it is a good
place to work actual work that having to
do for this new year it's not really my
cup of tea but you know it is it is but
you know but mainly I also want try to
be more of a full-time developer because
right now working like on a contrary to
hire basis mmm so what I'm trying to
focus on is either try to either try to
get another job with Ruby either
remotely or in my area first or try to
convert it full time so I can try to
do an internal transfer to another
project or team that does use the skills
that I would want to use so that's like
my plan either one or the other would
have whichever happens first and in the
meantime I'm just working on trying to
just a brush up on any gaps I have my
weapon of knowledge and then trying to
get more comfort with Ruby stack and try
to make projects out of that so I can
actually have actual real web projects
to show to employers that look I made I
made these web applications and this is
what they look like and they look like
all nice and all that so pretty and
whatever so that's what much my goal
right now just working towards that but
out of that I'm breathing pretty good
right guys this video is brought to you
by viewers like you and people that
support our website coding phase com go

developer from the beginning to becoming
a pro</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
