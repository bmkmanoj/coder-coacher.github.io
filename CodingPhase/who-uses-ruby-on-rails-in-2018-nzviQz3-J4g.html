again coding face.com
your boys back and I done did it again
alright guys so today's topic is you
know who actually uses Ruby on Rails hey
guys this video is brought to you by
viewers like you and people that support
our website coding phase com go check it
out over 20 courses in there that's
gonna guide you to become a developer
from the beginning to becoming a pro
alright so basically one of the most
famous ones that till this day still
uses Ruby on Rails okay it's Airbnb
alright Airbnb is one of the most famous
websites out there it's like literally
the best website to book not even the
hotel but like an experience book
somebody's house book somebody's role
you know just you come in wherever you
are you can say hey I'm gonna go to
Tokyo I want to rent down a house cool
pretty simple you come in you rent it
out and that's it got millions of users
it's super popular all over the globe
it's not just the United States
everybody knows about Ruby or Ruby on
Rails Airbnb so and it's cool because
they still use Ruby on Rails to this day
you know what I mean I'm gonna point
this out a lot of company started with
Ruby on Rails you got Twitter you got
twitch TV you got who else you got
hulu.com you have like so many websites
that if it were for Ruby on Rails they
wouldn't be where they at right now okay
one of the things that you have to
understand when it comes to Ruby on
Rails Ruby on Rails is an amazing
framework for you guys that have ideas
half you know an idea to come up with
and your startup and your service
something right and you want to come in
and you want to build it as soon as
possible
that's where Ruby on Rails really shines
it just gives you so many different
things so many options
that just opens your doors as a
developer right so climb I come to you
in being like hey man I want to create
the next Facebook perfect Ruby on Rails
somebody comes in and tells you hey man
I want to do the next Kickstarter
perfect will be on reals
hey I want to create something where you
know it's just like genius.com where
people go come in and basically break
down each line and leave a comment about
each line on the lyrics right Ruby on
Rails you got an e-commerce website Ruby
on Rails so you got anything that you
could think of Ruby on Rails guys so
let's continue with this the next one is
Shopify Shopify everything about Shopify
is made with Ruby on Rails and then not
only that but their system the way how
to edit the templates for stores is
basically with Ruby and if you're used
to where the ER be basically you're
you're very comfortable with it you can
come in and start selling your services
on Shopify
you could create different applications
for clients online I know a lot of
people have been wanting to talk about
Shopify how important it is and
currently right now in the industry is
very important like you know you have
WordPress for PHP right then Shopify is
like the WordPress platform line stores
okay so pretty much everybody's using
Shopify they have a story they want to
sell things online that you Shopify okay
now as a developer is very you know it's
a very good skill to have to know Ruby
and Ruby on Rails because you don't know
how many clients is gonna come up to you
and be like hey man I want you to build
me an online store and you can say hey
man we could use the platform of Shopify
and I can create a custom-made template
for you I can create a custom a couple a
couple of different applications for it
because you create
occasions within Shopify so you could
sell those as services to and make your
money you know what I mean then you have
IndieGoGo you know IndieGoGo is pretty
famous it's like another Kickstarter
also Kickstarter tool started with with
Ruby on Rails basically right now
indiegogo everything still done with
Ruby on Rails everything that you see is
all done with Ruby on Rails I believe
now they use what I was saying I mean
they're using Ruby on Rails
automatically but yeah let's see what
else
dribbled the website that I tell you
guys to go visit all the time whenever
you need a new design all of this is
made with Ruby on Rails the guys who
built this they made it I think it was
like two guys one was the designer and
the other one was the developer and they
made this multi-million dollar company
by themselves and now this whole website
is maintained
I believe with five people so that shows
you like how much power Ruby on Rails
has like literally you could come in
come up with an idea build a push it out
to the world put in product come put it
on you know all the websites that let
you better you know beta test although
the sites and from there on that's it
once it's rolling and your website is
growing and you know you start up start
getting bigger then you know sky's the
limit you know another one is get up all
of this is done with Ruby on Rails you
use get up every single day and all of
this is basically done with Ruby on
Rails okay very simple very easy website
but if it wasn't because of Ruby on
Rails is probably what I have picked up
as soon as the day you know and nowadays
we use it and it's all because of Ruby
on Rails you get what I'm saying now
there's a lot of websites like I said
this switch switch started with Ruby on
Rails
Twitter started with Ruby on Rails
what else hulu.com started with Ruby on
Rails and at some point at some point
depending on your business model and
depending on what type of content you're
delivering you do get to upgrade to
something else all right but this is
where I tell people all the time let's
say if you have I don't know you have an
e-commerce website and you don't need
like a live chat room right you don't
need a live chat room you have you know
five hundred thousand concurring people
you know concurring requests at the same
time you don't need to upgrade something
to Scala you don't need to upgrade
something to Golan you don't need to
upgrade something to even know Jes you
just don't need that at all right
because it's like you gotta find what
exactly is your website what exactly is
your application for first plus you
really want to find out if it's even
gonna work sometimes you come in and you
say hey man we have an idea for this
application it's gonna blow up big right
and you start thinking hey man this
thing's gonna be so huge we got a scale
you know we got to scale this from now
you know it was like let's prepare for
scaling you know once we have five
million subscribers the say for example
have five hundred you know 100 million
subscribers before we get 200 million
subscribers from the scratch you know
from the beginning let's come in let's
build everything in Scala write Java or
Scala or even freaking c-sharp or
whatever C right we gotta scale it from
the beginning before we even start
coding then you realized that your
codebase is taking you forever and
you're like wait we still haven't
released anything and then a dude that's
in his house with the same ideas you
comes in and says oh I'm gonna use Ruby
on Rails I'm gonna try to see if this
application works he releases it to the
world now he's the first one now
everybody knows that hey you know
freaking Teletubby calm that's the place
where you
get your Teletubbies if you could have
freaking released it before instead of
you thinking like hey man I got a plan
for scaling you know once I get to a
hundred million you don't even know if
this application is gonna get to a
hundred million you get what I'm saying
like you have to build things according
especially when you know you're trying
to build something as soon as possible
and release something out to the world
okay now like I said a lot of the things
that people say online but like a ruby
slow ruby is dissing that guy's yes is
slow python is slow but somehow python
is thriving everybody's talking about it
right python is slow PHP is slow you get
what I'm saying so it's like all the
languages that's out there they're slow
javascript is slow now it's all relative
to comparing them to C or comparing them
to golang or comparing them to crystal
Lang every other language below them
they're slow so it's like you know what
I mean it's like you gotta take it with
a grain of salt and now listen to
everybody's BS online but I wanted to
show you guys a couple of websites that
people are still using them and
basically every single day new websites
pop up you know if you come in and you
start going in like let's say this this
app is called webalizer it shows you
order the different websites that people
are used basically you got cope and I Oh
get laughs calm get bootstrap calm one
signal code that touch plus calm well
touch plus calm the whole website is
made with Ruby on Rails MyFitnessPal
browser stack on font awesome that IO is
built with Ruby on Rails
you know this like so much like so many
different websites you know you could
come in and try to figure out over a
hundred sixty thousand websites that
this application has actually crayon
like you know crawled like that use from
your rails you know there's so many
different ones if you come in going in
even deeper
you know you're like hey I'm trying to
find out which ones using Ruby because
also to you could come here and check C
Ruby programming languages you start
seeing which ones get used atom dial you
get T one signal all the same ones that
we just saw right now but yeah man this
is a perfect way to to see exactly what
websites is out there okay but yeah man
so I'll see you guys later come to the
website guys this Ruby on Rails course
down building is pretty legit we we
going in very deep into it and we're
gonna create like you know a Craigslist
clone like you're gonna get to learn how
to build everything from scratch so any
idea that you might have any type of
startup that you might think like hey
man what if I was to create a service
for firefighters right what if I was to
create a service for you know I don't
know artists who who want to find people
to collaborate freaking how how about I
create a a freaking service for
developers to collaborate like there's
so many ideas that you can come up with
like you guys probably know things that
you gotta you know you want to build so
yeah man definitely check it out alright
so I'm gonna see you guys later see a
boy Joe back at it again coding face.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
