back at it again man listen cold face
calm make sure you're subscribed make
sure you like this video man because the
boy is back and I'm blowing my dad out
here just for you guys listen till we
gonna learn Ruby right okay so we're
going to go to Kolkata me calm we love
you got it we're just learning the
basics of programming like this is not
only to teach you how to make a website
but this is basically the foundation for
you to be able to learn how to program
because I not only guys are having
difficulties so I'm gonna get a lot let
me walk you guys right to it man I'm
gonna hold your hand through this whole
journey you may get it boy okay I so
good look like this we gotta go to coach
Adam calm and we start recording I'm
gonna start calling the screen right now
let's go alright so I'm going to go like
this and basically do for me i'm going
to log in okay I'm already not saying
right and there for you guys to do that
at the points click dashboard right and
basically is going to or catalog and
point Sabrina here right and from here
you're going to click or movie when you
come through ages you know sign up in
class started it's free right and
basically it's going to start right here
for you guys so basically giving you a
little sneak peek what it is is saying
hey Ruby is a high-level language which
is weird because when you things hi
would be like really like the bars hi is
like super difficult but in reality and
the programming languages hi link easier
and then no level languages actually
meet hard so I don't know it's backwards
so it's weird so it also means
interpreted language meaning you don't
have to actually compile the land
do a whole bunch of stuff like you know
screenshot or like jawline all the other
languages and is also object oriented
meaning a lot of user to manipulate data
structures call objects in order to
build and execute programs will learn
all about the place okay cool and it's
easy to write I know it's kind of going
the window right right give it alright
so looks like so pretty much what is
saying hey one cutting movie so this is
a common all right common means
accounting is just basically is people
write on your coat a comment and it will
run on your console so up coming here
today hey there guys alright and that
will actually run it will show anything
here no nothing was running all right
full star next level so right here let's
say an example and rule the entire can
be number strings of boolean right so
what the hell does that mean it means
you can basically say hey a variable is
basically i think my number right why
number equals 25 and my bully it equals
true and let's say my strings equals
will be okay thankfully alright so my
string equals Ruby right so what the
hell is going on a data type pretty much
what you're saying is in this variable
my number equals 25 so what you're
saying hey and this is I can make me
think about it like this and say okay my
name is Joel but you know he's a commie
coding fate or whatever homie Joel Santo
only whatever you want but as I can Nick
me right my real name is jealous but
then the nickname it's actually cold
entry so you'll say something hey for
this nickname for them nickname i know
equals 25 so any moment you can actually
call up a nickname a little pricing and
basically say hey I link name this
person is my string and it's equal to
Ruby or I make name my name is equal to
Joel whatever you guys want to do so
let's say my nickname equals to Joe just
break it down even more amazing a box
and then you label that box will say hey
this box is called my name and inside of
the box is the name of the person right
so now whenever you want to actually get
the person's name you just say hey let's
look into the my name box and then the
name of the person was in it so let's
continue with all right okay very cool
right this is exactly what I just told
you god imagine just a box and then in
that box I'm gonna call in my num and
then the side of the box there's the
valuable and all of this what I really
wanted to call it it could be a stranger
could be a boolean it could be any type
of data type you know true folds it
could be a number and you watch it
basically calling this little box you
know quote unquote nothing but is you
call it a mine own so you say okay my
love equals to a hundred so inside a
lockbox there's a number call you know
I'm gonna Andre family so pretty much
the cookie see it says Clary variables
and movies easy just right out to name
and then pretty much use the equal sign
and then assigning whatever you want to
assign so let's say set the variable
along to the value 100 so that's what we
pay right here click Next all right with
this with Matthew Plexiglas with Brody
right there's like any other programming
language so pretty much you got applause
which i haven't done here so let's say
five plus five and then if you wanted to
do this let's see how much that will
give me it's time right so this is
pretty much it with the master people
actually do australian they could be say
hey follow say my name right equals job
all right so i used a method called dot
length right that was going to tell me
how many characters outside of that
straight so to sleep strengthen their
top a say my name x 3 equals 29 yeah you
can use mass at any more length anytime
alright guys so let's see the next day
let's continue puts and print so put
some prey is pretty much when you want
to print something to the screen right
now whenever you see stuff here on the
side it means is the code behind the
website is printing out whatever
variable you wanted to print out that
only happens on this website or you can
actually do that on your own code and
basically say hey my name equals Joe so
basically put is going to print mine I'm
going to print my name and then
price is going to print hi I'm Joe you
know what I made so you see this prank
thing the nail is just basically
something that's being returned right
now the levels being retired from this
so that's fine so don't worry about mail
alright so let's go to the next day okay
everything a movie is an object inside
of the data type right this thing's
called method so imagine like this
numbers strings and bullion's which is
true or false basically they have
special functions inside of it so those
special functions mean that you
basically have extra things inside of it
same way how we use Joe that length and
basically inside of that string is
basically saying okay tell every single
character inside of this string so is a
little function that is inside of every
single every single data type it could
be a function could be a number could be
a strength and you're going to learn
that as we go and I'm explain it to you
guys that easiest way that I can't
explain it to you all right all right
