coding freaks calm your boy is backing
out and did it again
listen guys just because your developer
doesn't mean you have to work for a
company you can open up your own company
you can open up your own software
as-a-service you can create your own
content online you can do tutorials do
blogs do tutoring do there's so many
things that you can do as a developer so
I'm bringing you guys here basically my
top websites that I think if you create
a product this is where you need to get
it to become popular or successful or
you know just viral you know what I mean
like this one one of my favorite
websites and I always check it out just
to see what other developers are coming
up with basically this website is called
producthunt com pretty much every
developer who's out there
independent either applications
developer mobile apps or you know just a
web developer right basically they all
come here when I would have a service
that they wanted to let them know let
the world know about right they usually
come here to product hunt release it
here see how the people react see how
other developers feel about it and this
is a pretty cool place man because not
only do you get to see what other people
are working on is like it's also
motivational you know what I mean like
you could come here like look at this
this is pretty cool
somebody came up with like an augmented
reality type of a ruler so pretty much
you could you could measure something in
the air you know what I mean like you
can just go like that drag it and
basically measure it and automatically
it gives you how many inches it is or
how many feet it is or you know how many
centimeters like that's pretty cool guys
like you know what I really like there's
a lot of cool things that developers are
building now what do you think do you
think this guys is gonna make in they're
gonna become popular well they're
already number one on upload right which
means that
lot of developers already seen them so
then from there that people start
sharing this idea and sharing this
project this this application next thing
you know this thing is you know in the
top 20 top 50 apps on a phone app or
Android Apple iOS app you know what I
mean like now calculate that how much
you think those guys gonna be making
after that you know what I mean like
this probably some guy in his house with
him and two other people probably
created this app now the guy is probably
gonna make like at least you know a
hundred thousand just from this product
a month right or even a year even if he
makes a hundred thousand dollars a year
from this product there's one product
you know what I mean like this is just
one single app imagine when you start
stacking up a whole bunch of different
apps how much money you make you know
look at the guy who created a flappy
bird he was making $50,000 uh was it not
a week a month for $2,000 a month like
that's a lot of money you know what I
mean and that's independent money right
now I'm giving you guys the websites
that I think if you create a project in
your house right or you create a project
in your own office or whatever something
that you own right and you now you want
to share it to the world
here are the websites that I think you
need to share it to send you know share
it to product come for sure you can
share like let's say you create a brand
new framework or a brand new library you
can come to site point send them an
email tell them that hey I want to write
a blog for you guys and basically show a
tutorial on how to use your your library
and then that all the other developers
get to find out about your your library
how do you think you know you got all
these frameworks popping up and becoming
popular and they'll be like a whole
bunch of libraries that you would like
wait what this library has 10,000 stars
on github how do they have that
well people write good articles and then
after they write good articles they give
a link to the github and the next thing
you know
the github project already has like
10,000 stars a lot of times people don't
even check them to see if if the project
is legit or even works it's just about
the promotion of the marketing so you
got SitePoint calm then you got echo Jes
where almost anybody can come here and
share a library or or anything and
people just upload it or download it you
know you got react there's something
react beautiful drag-and-drop you know
so somebody created this and then now
he's sharing it on Echo j/s let's see
how many stars he got he just released
they got 3,000 stars you know what I
mean so now your project is becoming
more and more popular people start
sharing a you know so it's pretty cool
you got echo Jay yes of course you got
the the big boys now
this is when you wanna take it to the
next level a lot of times you can't get
here unless you're already making a way
from the internet meaning your viral
your you have a company you have legit
VCS you know you gotta have a real
company a lot of times to to make it to
this website so you got TechCrunch which
is pretty much the bubble of San
Francisco so it's like you create a
project or a software-as-a-service that
other businesses and other companies are
gonna use this is definitely the place
where you want to show up at all right
of course you got TechCrunch now from
day you got the next web the next web is
cool because it's more like a blog and
more regular people come here it's not
just developers it's other people's who
come here to and basically what's cool
about it is like let's say I come up
with a cool app right if I get a
placement on the next web I know that's
at least fifty thousand a hundred
thousand people that are gonna watch my
product right and once they watch my
product they can use it they can you
know go download in the App Store go do
whatever so thanks to this website it
just makes my my application be known
out there
to the masses not just to the developers
not just to you know the the developers
community but also to the regular people
the consumer all right there from day
you have ready ready is like it's like
the place where you know you're gonna
find cool things and you're also gonna
find a cute cat you know what I mean
like now of course the problem with
ready is that the moderators have a lot
of power meaning you know Joe Schmoe his
house his basement
he got granted the power of moderators
so now because he's a moderator if you
share something here he's I up that
self-promotion oh this is dissing that
so they always trying to shut down the
the new people coming in so what I would
say is try to make yourself show up in
one of these websites from product con
site point echo genius TechCrunch the
next web and then submit it to ready
alright okay guys so yeah man this this
are my like my top tips to become viral
online or releasing a service online as
a developer you know I always tell you
guys guys you don't have to stay stuck
to a company like you once you become
somebody in this world meaning like
you've been put in the work you've
worked in a couple of projects you you
have the skills you don't have to stay
there you have you could come up with
your own ideas make your own money you
know create your own companies like you
don't have to stay in just one company
you can also branch out because we have
a gift we have a skill that not a lot of
people have so if you have a creativity
or you have you found like you know the
the solution to a problem like let's say
you working in a company like you know
my last company where I was working on
like pretty much they were paying I
don't know like 800 dollars a month or
something like that for a pop up like I
know you
you guys gone to two different websites
and then as soon as you scroll down or
pop-up shows up like hey enter your
email and we will send you a coupon and
this and that to do that they had to pay
money like I don't know like 400 to 800
dollars a month just for that so you
telling me there's a guy who created
this service and it's now selling their
own line and telling people hey I will
create a I will give you a pop-up that
is gonna show up and I don't know two
minutes after the person's on the page
you telling me none of us can create
something like that you know how easy
that is like you just put a set timeout
to ten minutes like literally I mean of
course it's not that simple there's
different things you know cookies and
different little things that you got to
work with but it's a very simple service
and people are charging $800 all right
so it's like you guys can do that you
guys can come up with something where
like let's say you work in in a
construction company and you find out
that they need a certain type of website
to maintain I don't know they the
inventory of like machineries or
something right you can create that and
sell that to all the other of
construction companies like that's how
it works that's how business is kids you
know what I mean
so don't get stuck in one place where
you're thinking in your head I'm only
gonna be a developer no you have a gift
you are a developer you are a creator so
make sure you use it for yourself and
for your family you know for your
friends you know I mean I create
something that people are gonna enjoy
and it's gonna bring profit to you all
right guys you already know a boy Joe
