jump back at it again man : face
calmness and your boys back I didn't did
it again
listen rocky stack we in here so we will
be asking me hey man when we gonna start
working with databases
well pretty simple I'm going to show you
the little quick introduction to my
sequel with the rocky steps alright so
okay you're gonna find this link on your
well on this video's description
alright I'm gonna put that link there on
how to install my sequel pretty much
just follow the steps you know make sure
you have installed homebrew then install
my sequel with brew then through
homebrew you're going to run our
services basically are you going to do
is copy every single thing that you see
here of course not the little dollar
sign the dollar sign what it means is
put it inside of the terminal so you
copy this alright put it here paste
right there from there sorry I'm just
deleting the stuff
okay so just copy that paste it copy
this paste it here of course
okay so then here install my sequel then
it's still homegrown then from the
brutal services start my sequel what
this does I'm going to start my sequel
on your computer right you click that is
already running on my computer then of
course you're going to come here check
your room services list then just to see
that oops sorry
just to see that my sequel is actually
run so you see that's my sequel started
till fences messing it which means is
already running in the background now
you click here copy this check if you
laugh while version you have okay boom
114 okay then from there you come here
you copy this and then
open the server to execute your follow
set to route past whatever root password
right this is just set the password so
you take that and then you of course you
change this where it says your password
you name it to whatever you want it
right and then from there once you do
that it's going to set up a password for
your your roof which is your user okay
if you guys don't know about this it's
fine
just follow the steps you're gonna be
fine if you want to get more deeper into
my sequel of course the courses are
right there on my description there's a
great course on it or even you could
even look on youtube search PHP my
sequel or just regular might be cool
quick introduction a lot of good videos
are gonna come up right so you come here
Bruce summers and start my sequel you
start it up it's already starting all
right now from here what you're going to
do is you're going to come in okay
everything is going to take this here
you basically type it on your terminal
to check if you're good but that's gonna
do is basically log you into my sequel
and then you're going to put in the
password guys we use usually it for my
own computer I just use root so Roo see
now that you inside of my sequel we're
basically going to create a database
right so I say create database movies
and of course gotta put a semicolon but
I always mess that up
I hate semicolons right now we're going
to exit out of course equal right but so
pretty much now we set up my sequel now
we gotta go back to the database example
first
a rocky stag no come back to you alright
so we're going to go into this file so
this is a final set of source and then
config and then database so here you're
going to see this thing right this is
going to be actually oops this is
actually going to be commented out so
it's gonna be like that so what you're
going to do is you're not an old
commented and basically you're gonna put
in your information so you're gonna say
Who and then whatever password you used
and then the address where your my
sequel or database is located of course
this is the address to a which is
localhost
which is your computer and then this one
3306 is the port that's actually being
hosted on so usually if you set it up
exactly how I saw you in the beginning
and you follow it the you know the
instructions of the pace and I gave you
that on the description basically you're
going to be fine there's going to be the
settings right and like I said before if
you want to make your life easier for
the password just put root you know just
say root rule and then you're good you
know what I mean so then of course
here's where you put in the database so
since we named them movies we come here
basically say okay hey we're actually
using the database name movies right
okay so now let's go to the routes
alright
I already sent this up for you guys all
right so you got movies right so when
you go to get flash movies we're going
to create the table and also put data
inside of it alright cool so we're going
to paste this this is code that I
already wrote for you guys because
there's no point of me write in it but I
will explain what's going on so
basically you say okay
this is my single we're basically
running my single right and then the
exact ones executes all right so inside
of this quotes from there to there
we're basically running just a sequel
statement so we said okay create a table
if it doesn't exist if not exist movies
so we're naming a table inside of the
database movies right so basically we
naming it movies right we created it now
inside of it there's going to be an ID
there's going to be a title there's
going to be a year there's going to be a
description right the primary key is the
ID and then it says okay let's break it
down let's go back a little bit okay so
ID is an integer not know and it's auto
increment so every time that you add a
new one the number goes up by itself
automatically right now title is
basically a string so it says okay you
know characters 30 right so that's the
maximum character that you have then
gear is an integer which means it's a
number and then the description means a
long text so it means there's a long
last text right so it could be as many
characters as we want right
of course I think there is a limit but
it's like thousands of characters so
whatever right so then it says okay
primary key IP so what it means is
whenever somebody's trying to look up
any data inside of this table you know
the primary key that they gotta be using
is the ID right so if I say hey I want
to look for movie star wars right I'm
gonna give them ID one right because
there's the first one that we're going
to create and then I'll be easier to
find it right cool so let's say the
second statement is my sequel execute
and then it says insert into movies
title year description so this is the
area where the columns are at right and
this is
and set into those values right
Star Wars 1977 a cool movie right so
what's going on here you see there's an
order to it so the same okay title Star
Wars year 1977 description or cool movie
now if I move this things so over here
is going to mess up because it needs to
be in the same order
same older that you see here title year
description so Star Wars 1977 a cobalt
II and then we're going to save this and
we want to run you know yarn Iran server
and then everything should be Gucci
everything should be good alright so we
come here right and we say slash movies
because then I say hey Rose effective
one last and Saturday ID one so it gave
us the last concerning ID right so if
you guys know her a sequel Pro there's
another thing that if you want to look
it up
it's called sequel probe it's totally
free you could download it I'm also
going to to add it to the description so
you guys can look it up this is very
helpful whenever you want to see data
and you know in the user interface
instead of having it to see it through
the my sequel terminal you actually come
here annual data edit the data basically
through your computer or your Mac or
whatever you got so single Pro is free
is pretty legit alright guys so yeah
let's see okay let's start the single
Pro you see once you download this thing
you'll see this thing oh it says you put
in you name it whatever you want
for me I name a local host and then I
say okay just the address to the local
host using a root password root and then
you know you can put in 3306 if you want
automatically already thinks that here
that so it's fine then you click connect
and then here you're going to see you
details see movies is done the database
that we created right in the beginning
all in the beginning right and then
inside of it is some table called movies
and then that is going to have data
inside of it
see it says ID title year description
and it tells you the type that it is is
allowed no you know the whole shebang if
you guys don't know the basic that my
sequel is fine you guys could you know
when you can take the course it's that's
important so you take the course that I
give you guys because this is super
important right you're definitely going
to need to know my sequel now for this
project this whole Satori that I'm doing
on the rocky stack you don't have to be
a master or sequel because all you're
doing is following me and I will explain
to you what's going on right now that is
just an installation right now it
doesn't matter if you don't understand
what the hell's going on
this is just to get you to install it
and have a good life all right
so okay so here is you see content you
see that you got the structure shows you
the data what what type of columns they
are and then content you're gonna see
their information in star wars 1977 a
cool movie now if I come here and I say
hey I want to change this up I want to
say oh the Star Trek let's say 1996 and
now say you could ready for me a shitty
movie right so save that right okay now
if we run again you know reset the
server and then bring it back up one
servers loading once a little click now
we come back to this refresh the page is
going to create another one you see a
give it an idea
- now here we're going to see two of
them same Star Wars Star Trek right so
yeah man now it's already set up with my
single and we're ready to go now what
was really cool about this is that was
this example that I gave you guys you
could come here and start messing around
with my sequel if you've taken a course
or large from somebody else or you've
used another language like PHP no GS you
can actually come here and just mess
around with you know my sequel creating
your own database creating your own
tables try it out give it a chance you
will be good and yet man you already
know super chill back at it again man
color face calm your boy you did make
sure you subscribe make sure you like
this video make sure you check out the
courses on the description if you don't
know my sequel trust me guys my sequel
is like the backbone of everything
literally it is the backbone of like
almost all the websites that you go to
when I really save your your information
you put on your address from your name
most likely they use on a single server
right or they're using some type of
database right it doesn't matter if it's
MongoDB if it's my sequel whatever it is
most likely they use some type of data
database to save your data right so my
seat was like the best introduction to
this world right it's going to make you
a full full stack developer somebody who
really knows what's going on in the
front end and the back end and if you
keep following me I'm gonna give you
some good you dig all right guys
I'll see you guys later
