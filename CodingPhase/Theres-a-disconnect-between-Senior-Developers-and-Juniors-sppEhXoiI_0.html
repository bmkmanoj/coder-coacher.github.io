back at it again man country's calm
listen your boy is back I didn't did it
again good morning
all right kids listen I just want to
talk to you guys about you know
something that I heard for jay-z jay-z
said something like oh you know okay all
these and he said something like you
know hold the money to your ear that's
the disconnect some like all right
which kind of makes sense for somebody
who has a lot of money by jay-z but for
the younger people you know sometimes
you know you have $5,000 in your pocket
you feel like man you own the world
right you own everything you're like oh
man I'm good I'm rich so you young you
don't know about these things all right
so I don't know to me that was just a
dumbass line for jay-z to be talking
down other people's
and why do am i talking about this in
code is because I feel sometimes the
same thing that happens with senior
developers or developers are really
passionate about coding they look down
on the developers you know don't be like
oh this person is using bootstrap or
this person is using jQuery or this
person is using angular one but in
reality guys nobody cares about what
technology you use to create something
as long as it works
and I put both most topics together
because it's like I see that all
the time where I go online I see a
comment where somebody will be like oh
oh you're still using react you're still
using anger it's all about you Jay yes
right now and it's like man was going to
be the next framework this summer right
you don't even know it could be the
 Harry Potter framework right now
right it could be the Teletubby
framework next right and then why are we
supposed to jump on it just because
everybody's talking about it on the
Internet guys if you know JavaScript you
know react right I played I don't know
how to explain this to people sometimes
like listen react is just JavaScript
it's nothing different right now when
you're talking about UGS you ejs copy
the same model of angular where you
gotta come in and learn a million
different things like computer computer
it was a computer something Oh
to be buying there's V buying that like
if you X this you what's that like come
on guys
like it doesn't matter what what
technology you use as long as you get
the job done right and I'm talking to
you guys who are like senior developers
mid-level developers people who have
been in the industry people who are not
even in the industry and are like
constantly following the trend that like
every time something new comes out that
I hey man we got a jump on this its 2017
so now we got to jump on this so
now he comes like a three month thing
that's what a lot of people don't even
want to be doing running you know the
front end or even JavaScript because the
community has become like a bunch of
sites people who are just creating shape
and recreating the same that's
already there you know what I mean
instead of making was there better there
recreated
that was one of the main reasons right
there now like media aniseed oh no
upside so because I already know
JavaScript
I understand somebody will doesn't know
JavaScript and then I know man I could
start using a framework it can be
productive but I still don't know
JavaScript but Wow Vijay yes makes this
look so easy
you still don't know JavaScript so I may
be external showing I guess you can duel
was a rebuy for each of sunshine like
that to create a loop when it's like
even how to total the JavaScript why are
you worrying about doing it in a trailer
now that's one thing right now the other
thing is in a way all the senior
developers and people have a little bit
more experience to others they look down
on others because they don't have the
same experience guys this is all about
how much hours you put it man you can be
mad as somebody doesn't know as much as
you because you have $10,000 in they
might have maybe 60 hours later it's
going to take them sometimes to get to
hear that way well we continue these
comments on their videos or these
comments or their of their comments like
you don't know what you're talking about
with
like pros they they know as much as you
can you back then so sometimes I don't
know the community I feel when it comes
to the fernand community I think it's
pretty shitty I'll be honest like you go
into the Riviera's community and
everybody so far yeah everybody's happy
everybody is like oh cool you release a
gem wow man
Congrats let me know so I can put it on
my blog or let me know so I can sharing
my Twitter feed there's a JavaScript
isn't like that
there's just a bunch of people who think
they know but they don't have no
right be able to have those open
and then on top of that they're bringing
out other peoples who are just getting
into the industry that's what one of the
reasons why I don't go into like ready
I'm trying to stay away from ready like
there's just like so many losers there
they it's not even twenty sometimes we
go in there and you see a good article
or a good post and everybody's putting a
thumbs down because they don't agree
with it it's like what the hell man
somebody came in and wrote something
good something that other people can
read but on the moderators or the
 the losers will be in there if I
go thumbs down
renessa them and don't let nobody see
this
so then in Mesa high evil is an illusion
of like Oh a certain framework is like
really popular right now but in reality
this will jostle or there's a god
frickin programming language that is is
really good you know I've been coming
they don't want to show it no love
because they're like nah we're sticking
today's Norway like I just want like
people be doing so much dumpster and I
reason why I brought it down to like Jay
Z bring it back to the main top right is
basically like Jay be talkin about all
you know younger people over here you
can put in money money stacks to the
ears you know as a disconnect because he
has millions of dollars it's been here
for 20-something years
30-something years right all about the
new people are coming in well he came in
he was learning
so is the same thing as told the same
mistakes that people are making that
doesn't see mistakes that every
developer takes and that's fine
so I'm failing if you want to get to the
certain level guys just don't be an ass
some other than this be cool feelings
that's it he'll be a better person
people want to believe this community
more instead of having other people be
like you know shutting them down or you
know if you have a different opinion
that others like automatically the whole
community is against you like
and I was like was this guy's name I
forgot his name it there's this guy who
was like a core member of no GES one of
the founders right and he basically got
bored from noisy yes and decided to
start learning golden right
sorry learning goldang started promoting
it and the whole community work against
it the whole community is like
oh my god go genius is better than
golden
you're a desert mind you he's one of the
people to create nodejs
but he has a right to say that there's
better options out there because they
are so the community goes against them
you know it's like me sometimes I come
in here giving it an opinion and people
is like I'm supposed to go with the the
 the sea of losers and
I'm like ma'am I'm I got my own opinions
I make my own decisions on how I feel
about certain technologies - why thank
you fine
to me till this date you jes spelt
estelle like I worship at all it's a
waste of time it's a waste of time it's
pretty much a clone I don't
understand how can people be praising
something that was already created like
if the guy water cure created something
brand-new I would have been fine but
it's like he took the the style of
backbone took everything from angular
and then after taking from angular he
said you know what let's add a
components to it and let's make it like
you know I reacted like come on
you know really we have to so applause
originality and basically for people who
are creating routing recreating the same
shape you can't get no credit for it
it's like you create something and then
somebody comes in and repackages and it
means they Betty Boop
framework right and now everybody sir
have you seen the Betty Boop Franklin oh
my god is the same as
reacting angular where's Betty
Boop come on guys I mean but I have an
opinion on it now say anything about it
it's like the whole community is against
a like oh you can't talk about this that
I like man shut the up
you know what I mean but yeah man that
was my load
good morning topic with you guys man no
message no message to the peoples who
are in this community and look down upon
others and and try to shut down other
people's opinions as if you can't have a
different opinion than what the whole
community already have like you know
what I mean like I don't have to follow
what other people do and you guys don't
eat it you know I mean like you don't
have to do what everybody else is doing
this sounds that you have to do it for
your job because they already might have
something set up like if you put some
company and then again we already have
an angular one that's our stack you
can't go in there but like okay guys
 this I'm gonna just start doing
react they're going to look at you crazy
it's like no more like that was already
decided and that's it you just gotta do
your work and I think but all your
personal projects you do whatever the
hell you want
you know nobody can come in and tell you
what technologies to use what war
libraries or framework like that's your
project
nobody owns - you know I mean so yeah
man that was a quick 14 minute ride to
work I'll see you guys later
make sure you stay up make sure you stay
positive and yeah we talk later kids bow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
