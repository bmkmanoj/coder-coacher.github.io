at it again man : face calm listen guys
today we got to talk about algorithms
whiteboards you know the whole interview
process of a lot of companies that's out
here man especially Google especially
Facebook especially on this major
companies out here right and why the
system is so fucking flawed it's like
you know they came out with the system
to basically test people out and it's
just like okay let me see if this person
actually knows how to code does this
person in this test to see how his
brains things in let's see how you know
how he functions in pressure and this
and that and in reality man that shit is
so flawed is so all schooling like to be
honest with you guys it's a waste of
time
you know usually when I when I hear a
company does uh white boards or they
want you to basically get tested on
algorithms I pretty much don't even want
to go in there I'll be honest with you
guys I've gotten you know a whole bunch
of jobs where they sent me you know
recruiters and then I owe everyone just
you know we watch what action you know
XYZ company we want you to come in and
and basically go through the whole
process and I'm like you know this is
cool I like it let me go show up you
know but once the whole whiteboard and a
whole explaining of algorithms I
seriously like it's like my brain shuts
down I don't work like that I don't work
in the sense of like hey let me prove my
worth in creating this algorithm for you
in front of you on a whiteboard my brain
doesn't work like that and some people
is gonna be here oh it's because you're
not smart oh is because this isn't that
no man because I study coke I know how
to build things I don't study fucking
well you know riddles and and a whole
bunch of shit it's like you know DHA he
said it best since I had he's I hello my
name is David I will fail to write a
bubble sort on a whiteboard I look cold
up on the internet all the time I don't
do riddles and that's just like me man
like I'm constantly like whenever I have
a problem I'll look it up online and
basically I search on Google search
Stack Overflow because being a
programmer is basically being somebody
who could find the answer to things it's
not just about like hey let me remember
this riddle with my head so when they
give me this test I could go in and just
basically write it down for them man I
know so many freaking you know Indians
who come here Pakistanis who go to
special classes just to learn this shit
just to get hired and it's like it's a
shitty ass system it's like you know you
go to this classes you pretty much you
pay you know I think it's like five
thousand dollars and the guy teaches you
order the fucking waste of like you know
this algorithms the way they work and
the ones that they ask you at Google and
the ones that they actually are Facebook
and the ones that they ask you are
whatever fucking company is out there
but a reality now you just like using
shift for memory you know what I mean
now you're just like okay I'm gonna
remember all all the fucking questions
and when I get there I'm just gonna say
yeah I'm gonna pass the test but I don't
know shit and that's what happens a lot
of times I keep hearing stories of
people who have gotten hired by Google
and then they are let go two three
months later it's like nobody talks
about this nobody says like hey man
people are fuckin gaming the system
because the fucking system is fucking
broken you know it's like if I have the
skill so go in and create an amazing
software why the fuck do I have to come
in if I can create something on a
whiteboard just to prove to you it's
like hey man he's he's part of the group
of people who could remember this
bullshit let's let him in you know it's
like it's a way of having like fucking
you know gift gatekeepers a certain type
of power where's like all the big guys
that get hired those big companies they
don't have to go to normal shit but like
you know a brand new developer has to go
through all this bullshit be like man
let's make it as hard as possible for
them to get into this job and it's like
man a lot of times you hire people who
is not even qualified to be there
you know what I mean it's like look at
this guy fucking max hawa he's the one
he's doing to create a homebrew whenever
you use homebrew on a Mac whenever you
used you know on your terminal you go
like this even like okay
brew update all right whatever you do
that he created that and like 90% of the
people on Google a whole bunch of
basically whoever uses a Mac uses brew
and pretty much he didn't get hired
because of it you know you want to go
over there to Google and pretty much
applied and it's like yellow you can't
get fucking hired because you can't
fucking remember on Ritalin
which is an algorithm algorithms are a
fucking waste of time guys like I'll be
honest with you guys don't even fucking
late I mean I don't know I would say
don't waste time with it but then you
might just be one of those people who
wanna fucking remember riddles to feel
you know like you're smart man that's
like going to a spelling bee and be like
man I remember all the words from the
spelling bee but then when you tell them
my hey right
you know spell this word they don't
fucking know it
you know what I mean they only know the
words that they remember and it's the
same shit as cone cone you could come in
and you know every single fucking you
know algorithm that's out there sorting
trees and all this extra bullshit but
when it comes to the code and they say
hey could you build this app for us
you're like
like that's how a lot of times people
are I see that shit all the time at
different jobs in different positions
where it's like guys are somehow they
get hired and they they there for a
reason but it's like man they don't know
how to fucking solve problems man
so they I'm pretty sure they got it just
because they did some algorithm and it's
like man luckily for me when I go to a
job interview have so much work that
pretty much I'd just be like hey man I
did this website did this this this is
this I worked at this is this this
company and pretty much is like I don't
have to go through the whole algorithm
bullshit but at the same time I feel bad
for new developers because it's like
there's a way to just you know give
somebody power and be like hey man I
fucking learned the riddle do you know
this riddle and do you if you want to
get in and you want to see the fucking
what is it the fucking magic Oz to
fucking give you get you back home and
shit give you superpowers you gotta know
this riddle like come on man you know
what I mean like that's why I wanted to
tell you guys about this list right here
you know if you go on github.com and you
search hiring without white boards
you're gonna find a long list of
companies that don't have you know that
they hire but they don't do fucking
white boards man because white boards
are a waste of time it's just
remembering riddles algorithms is just
remembering a fucking riddle it's
nothing it's not a skill
stop taking just because you know our
algorithm you're smart you're not all
you did was just remember our fucking
riddle it's like the same she has the
Fibonacci the fucking sequence this is
something that everybody fucking just
remembers and it's like this is doesn't
mean that you're fucking smarter it just
means you're fucking good at remembering
fucking bullshit that's a you know what
I mean is a dubbed formula
but yeah man so there's a list that has
a whole bunch of companies man and it
was cool to that they have a website err
table where you can actually see the
cities and you can you know actually set
it up by cities and be like ok let me
set this up by the city let me say San
Francisco let's say New York you know
all the cities that all the cities that
the half companies with you know that
are not fucking asking for algorithms
and fucking whiteboards man because to
be honest with guys it's like it's
fucking it's a waste of time man like
you don't need that shit if you want to
get into my Google or Facebook whatever
yeah you might need it because people
are just fucking assholes a lot a lot of
times people are just assholes in you
know you might not have gone to the same
you know Ivy League school that they
went to or whatever might be and they're
like you know what man I won't make it
harder on this person I wanna see I'm
gonna test this test this brain I wanna
fucking pick out his brain and see if he
could actually remember this fucking
riddle that's all it really means man
algorithms it's just something to
fucking remember it doesn't make you
smart it doesn't teach you anything it
doesn't I don't believe in the idea of
like oh you know how to sort something
out the most efficient way as saying hey
you that makes you smart just because
you remember it then you fucking study
the fucking Internet is there
Google is right there if I wanted to
find the best way to sort something this
shit is right there the idea of like hey
you gotta remember this riddle for you
to get hired
it's a fucking bullshit idea and I say
that's what I did you know what I mean
