back at it again
coding face.com your boy is back in ID
and did it again let's turn on the
lights
you know like Spiral turn it on because
I'm gonna get a little bit so hot but at
least we turn on the little regular
light it won't be that hot up in here
but was good man listen man
almost a week sick man since last week
I've been sick and even right now I'm
not like a hundred percent but your boys
back you're not and did it again somehow
somehow we we survived you know I'm like
like that bad week in your backyard just
don't go away you know what no matter
how much pesticides throwing it like
you're not I'm coming right back man you
can't get rid of your boy yeah man so
what's good with you guys man hope you
guys just doing good I hope you I was
doing way better than me this past week
you know I hope you got been coding you
guys been you know a couple of positive
things so let's see who's in here right
now we are few people let's see we got
Ramsay Jordan Kelvin Davis 84 music man
snow hot
we got only Stephen never seen her
before in here so I'm glad that she in
here new people yes
let's see who else is in here how cool
is living in Connecticut I mean it's
pretty cold it's cold in the whole East
Coast especially it's been snowing all
these days and your boy got sick you
know how we be man Spanish people we we
go outside when
shirt on you know go outside with no
jacket on you know throw out the garbage
and whatever you boy got sick for like a
whole week and I'm still now 100% cuz
I'm still like my eyes still hurt
somehow
um but yeah man I'm here man word
somehow I survived so let's go with you
guys man how's the community anything
new anything new happening I mean having
watched nobodies YouTube I haven't
checked anything any other blogs I'm I'm
out of the loop for the past few days
I've been just focusing on coding phase
calm the new website but I'm like oh my
god it's been almost two weeks I've been
working on this thing I get tired I get
like I'm one of those people that I want
to keep on jumping with other projects
like there's my own website and I'm
already up to here I already want to
move on and work on something else so
give you guys a little preview for those
of you guys too haven't seen it yet see
so we did everything already I already
did the timeline I did the front page
everything is responsive now I got a now
I gotta create a high call this a
responsive menu but as far as everything
being responsive it's good to go
I did this page already finished
everything's responsive so that's a go
what else and then it was the timeline
so the timeline the whole way how is
kind of work is you is like a checklist
right it's like your own personal
checklist like hey you want to become a
front-end developer there's other things
that you're gonna need to learn well
before that you gotta tell me how many
hours per week and you devote to it
right so if you say hey I can only do 20
hours per week
hey which you know it's not that bad
but it tells you okay if you haven't
learned none of this stuff right it's
gonna take you 18 days to go over every
single every single basically every
single course okay
and I believe the reason why is 18 days
I decided for it to be I'm gonna tell
you right now I'm gonna tell you the
math behind it how we calculate this
okay so let me see where is it oh my god
so much okay so we got whatever hours
you put in per week right we say hours
per day right so you say 20 let's say 20
hours per week so that gets divided by
seven okay now that's hours per day how
many hours are you gonna be able to do
per day okay and then what it does is it
says okay so basically every day you're
gonna have let's say if you have 20
hours per week
how long is gonna take you so let's say
20 hours okay divided by seven that's
two point eight hours per day okay now
let's say you have how many total hours
are left so let's say in total here
let's say there is I don't know I don't
know the exact number but let's say this
70 hours no it should be more than that
should be like a hundred and twenty
something like let's say 120 hours let's
say an example right so it's 120 hours
divided by the hours per day so how long
is gonna take you so let's say you're
hungry 20 /
to point a it will take you 42 days
right to complete the whole front end
but technically it's not that many hours
all of this course is here usually are
like the most like four to five hours
each so that's how the math works on
this thing so as you come in and you
check it off you say okay I already know
a text editor I already know HTML CSS so
it starts going down and says okay cool
so you only got 14 days left build a
responsive they say okay I got 13 days
left you know I just keep going keep
going keep going keep going and then you
say okay you got two days left and
that's on the average of like if you
were to put in you know three hours per
day right
how long is gonna take you to actually
complete everything so yeah and that's
pretty much it that's the timeline and
I'm still working a couple other things
man I still gotta set up the for the
backend I still gotta set up for the
full stack which what is which is
basically just this and this combined
together into one so I got a basically
program all of that so that's what I've
been working on what I've been sick now
let me go back to the Google hangout and
yeah man that's what we're doing right
now so let me see let me see let me see
so yeah man just reading right now
everybody's comments and stuff how long
does it take you to build a website it
depends I mean a simple website I could
do it in like a day or two but when you
you start adding things like you gotta
work with react you gotta set up the
data there was a lot of stuff that I had
to do on the website like you know for
each
each course I had to go in there make
sure or the writing was properly this
kid Jake help me out basically he went
back and forth he sent me some of the
stuff that he had then I went in there I
fixed some other things I added a couple
of the descriptions all of that stuff I
needed to make it into order of like a
JSON object is he sent it to me in
paragraphs so I had to go in and do all
those things manually like manual data
entry like it took forever and yeah it
was a lot of work man but I'm still I'm
still doing a whole bunch of things man
let me see what else
where's you know course that's commonly
I'll later on man right now I'm just
gonna focus I'm being honest right now
I'm just gonna focus on knocking out all
the front end stuff so I want to teach
this week how to build your own what
developer starter kit meaning learning
to use gulp learning to use webpack
learning to use all the tools that I use
you know learning to use certain parts
of nodejs to make this thing possible
so yeah let's say machine learning
you're not a data scientist yeah but
that's a good question Kevin I've got a
couple of people that are actually
helping me out with this stuff who are
really really good with machine learning
to be honest with you like from the
things that I've been going over like
the past two three months because like I
told you guys everything that I focused
on for the past five years has been or
web development right I've kept my mind
straight on just one thing because I
didn't want to be one of those people
that were jumping around and like 20
different things all right but I've been
just focused on web development but that
doesn't mean I'm limited to just what
development you know that would be like
kind of stupid to think like hey Joe you
could only do web development in your
life as I bro I've been programming for
years it's like you could put I don't
know freakin Haskell you could put in
any language you can put any topic out
there in front of me and I can learn it
it's like it's not that difficult so as
far as like machine learning I got a
couple of people that they are actually
data scientist so what they're doing is
you know they showing me how they do it
I have a friend who works for PayPal so
that's what he he does over there so
he's showing me his way of like you know
how they do things over there sorry I
gotta fix this thing so he's teaching me
how they do those things over there at
his company right um because Python I
know Python simple right but I want
somebody that really knows this stuff
right to help me out
and deliver it to you guys right either
by them teaching it or by me going over
the materials they set up the materials
and then I teach it for them so that's
what we as far as that um be gaming you
know there's a couple of things on the
timeline let's see all the things that
you see here are you know all of this is
regular you know web technologies right
the way I'm gonna teach game development
is gonna be through web technologies
meaning facing jas I've been using face
a J's for like two three years already
it's like two years and a half are on
there so I know everything about it
mobile development I've been using react
native for a good year and a half um I'm
very comfortable a react native like
really really comfortable um
yeah and so forth development basically
we're gonna talk about the things like
you know things like electrons so all
the things that I'm talking about are
things that I know about and things that
I've used the only thing that is new to
me is machine learning but at the same
time I have somebody who's basically
giving me the material it's not my
material this is not something that I'm
coming out and but I hate guys I'm gonna
teach this it's like nah I don't have
enough experience in machine learning so
somebody else is giving me the material
for that all right so yeah
and that's about it but yeah we got a
lot of stuff that we're doing you know
it's just a lot of cool things I might
be having some guests or instructors in
there you know a lot of people behave me
up like you're Joe I want you to put my
course in there I want you to listen
that I haven't really done it like that
because I just don't want to have random
people on my website because my website
is not just like it's not udemy.com it's
not for people to go in and try to sell
courses you get what I'm saying like my
website is a community is a place for
people to come and learn everything that
they need and there's a specific way of
teaching things I don't want people that
come in and talk like robots I don't
want people that come in and follow like
every single thing of the documentation
because that's not teaching you know
what I mean like when you go to a
teacher the teacher is not supposed to
be reading off the book right the
teacher supposed to break down problems
that seem difficult and explain it to
you easy in a way where you can
understand it you know that's that's
what makes my website special is you
know if now then you could just go to
Flora site you go to you to me you could
go to seeing tree house you can go to
every single other platform out there
right because hey it's like if they got
a reader of the documentation I might as
well just go to teen tree house right so
it's like why would I go to coding phase
calm
you know so yeah but yeah man so that
was a good question Kevin let's see any
other questions guys let's see what you
guys is up to what I'm Joe the weather
looks good let's see did you cheer 84
music back at it again the website let's
see what else
new tonight looking good okay yo Joe
there's no way on teachers to change to
a lifetime pass from my current at all
my current or access
I mean I'm pretty sure you could if you
wanna go and get the lifetime you could
cancel you could cancel I don't know
would you gotta send me an email Hector
cuz I gotta see what's your account you
know if you have like a monthly and you
say you want to do the lifetime all you
have to do is just probably just cancel
it and just and definitely just get the
lifetime so you should be good or if
anything I could maybe do it behind the
scenes I don't know send me an email
let's see let's get you in there oh let
me see
Miguel ASIMO can I do a remotely without
location especially I don't even know
what he's talking about
Hey Joe what do you put why do you put
your projects in the root directory is
there any reason besides per purposes as
to where it's we saved the project
directories oh yeah you can save it
wherever you you want where do I save it
I save in the root directory
why I'm gonna show you right now oh let
me see where's my share the screen
oh let me make sure everything is clear
okay why do I always tell people to put
things in the root directory right and I
don't think technically somebody
freaking told me this before he's like
yeah that's not the root directory
that's actually the home directory okay
so the home directory why do I put
things in the home directory and the
home directory is this little thing so
let you see that that means you are in
your home directory okay
some people they have their username in
my safe
sorry still sick guys some of you guys
might say Joe Santos Garcia which is my
username of my computer and they're from
there it'll speed this little thing I
don't know what's the name of it
basically that's your home directory and
the reason why I do all my projects
there is because I could come here and
just say LS right and then I could see
my folder where I have my projects I
have a folder called projects that's
what I do other projects with you guys
from our website and then a half our
website another website a folder called
called code that's why I put in all my
personal stuff whenever I put on create
some games I put into my games folder if
I want something with go I having my go
folder let's see what else this no
modules this is I got a delete this is
like a error I probably try to clone a
folder or something and they actually
went to my home that right home
directory I got a delete that but all my
folders are in projects and code so at
any moment from the home I could just
literally say like this I can say CD
anywhere my computer I mean a coach if
click on the tick which is right above
that when you hold shift it shows that
you say CD code and then there you go
you're inside of your folder where you
have all of your projects all right now
let's say you are on a Windows computer
I'm pretty sure is something like the C
folder so if you install everything
inside of your C folder it should be
like C and I think it's like that and
then you could just go into code
something like that I'm I haven't used a
Windows computer in God knows how long
literally probably over ten years so
don't hold me to it like figure it out
right to be honest with you um okay so
yeah that's why I use it like that
that's why I like to put it on my home
directory because it's easier when I
would you go to the terminal you just
literally say okay shift tick and then
you come in and you put in slash code
and then click enter
you're already changed to your your
directory you have all your files there
now if you want to be crazy but I oh I'm
gonna put in some My Documents folder
and then I'm gonna set up my documents
folder I'm gonna put in a folder called
code now you gotta put that whole
address just to get to that that folder
right instead of just using the the root
directory is okay this is where it's at
and that's it yeah it's just easier you
could put it wherever you want
let's see ginger lemon curious or throw
yeah game development is suffer field to
get a job in compared to web development
you need to be absolute best to get a
game developer job but that's the thing
coming to me and this is something that
I feel like I'm preparing all of you
guys everything that I teach you guys
and everything that I show you guys here
it's not really preparing you to say hey
I want you guys tomorrow to just work in
a company
everything that I'm teaching you is
gonna be able to get you a job right
you're gonna be able to work if you want
to go that route right but the way how
to teach you guys and the way how I come
in and show you things is for you guys
to be able to make your own money I want
you guys to be at the same level that I
am like I was looking at like you know
at Facebook right now say a Facebook
Oh Facebook let's say Facebook employees
salary hey
employee salary right let's see you
start looking into it okay
most of these guys are like super
professionals guys who have been around
for years okay and you look into it and
you start noticing like hey they've been
around for like 5-10 years some even for
longer than that and the most
facebooking go for them it's like a
hundred and thirty six thousand dollars
right I myself without working our
Facebook without doing none of this
stuff you know what I mean like I made a
hundred and seventy four thousand last
year right now how is it that I make
more money than a facebook employee it's
because I use the skills that I have and
I'll make money with right like that's
what I teach people that's why I want
people to learn it's like you don't need
a job tomorrow you might go in and but
okay I could get hired at a company
right but that's not the end gold the
end goal for you is to come and create
products and be able to make money out
of stone your own products that you
create all right I don't want you guys
to just be like oh man you know I was
like I can only make money with this and
get higher now you like I don't want you
guys to get into that that state of mind
I want you guys to just be like creative
and be able to you know just make money
on your own like there's a lot of indie
game developers out there guys who who
just make a websites and my website
makes games for like html5 games things
that you could convert with Cordova
things that you could put on our little
BS websites like let's say it's the
aisle I'm gonna show you right now it's
got I all right
this is a website where you could sell
your games your indie games you can sell
like your code you have an indie game
that you created but you're like okay I
have two idea I want to sell it you
could come here and sell it here and you
might take like oh you're only gonna
make $5 $10 but thousands of people come
here
all of that money starts adding up let's
say you have five games in here selling
right and each one is making you $2,000
how much is that I'll send down some
dollars a month that you're making just
from one website and this is just one
website that you can sell it that
doesn't mean that you can't sell it on
Steam that you can't sell it on the iOS
store you can't sell it on the Android
store like you know if you start
thinking in your head even with game
development right you're thinking ahead
hey man I'm gonna be a game developer
and I'm gonna go work at Bungie I'm
gonna go work at EA I'm gonna go work at
whatever company right if your end goal
is that you know more power to you but
if your end goal is to say hey I'm doing
all the things that I want and I wanna
have fun while I'm doing coding and
programming my games and doing a whole
bunch of stuff like there's a whole
bunch of different avenues you get what
I'm saying like you know even here man
like somebody sent me a message like you
know Joe I love everything that that
you're blue in here on YouTube and and
this does that and I'm like you dude I
told the guy I'm like you do know that
you can do the same thing he's like yo I
don't know how you find the motivation
how you do this this and that and I'm
like bro you could literally do the same
thing that I'm doing on YouTube and you
know somehow you know create your own
audience as long as you give value right
like we all know something right I seen
somebody the other day um there's a
there's like this kid on YouTube who's
like 18 years old 19 years old
and oh he does his Dominican style
cooking right so he cooks Dominican
style he got a whole bunch of
subscribers people buy his books people
are you know buy his recipes and this
this and that
and it's like is it something special no
it's just some regular kid but why does
he make it happen right you get once a
little you know to answer that thing
where will you say like him and I don't
know game development stuff feel to get
a job and it's like we live in a you
know you know we live in an era that I
can't see myself going back to a company
like I see myself making one business
idea to another business idea to another
business idea to another business idea
every year I keep growing like you guys
most of you guys know my story man like
all the stuff that I've been doing for
years it's just a ground you know you
can't expect nothing to pop up that fast
but everything pays off at the end you
know all those skills that I you know I
learned over the years and just focusing
on the web you know I didn't jump into
every single thing out there I just
focus on one thing that's surrounding
the web right like I learned game
development but through the web I
learned you know mobile development you
know building react negative ionic like
all of those things I learned it put
through the web right if it weren't
because of web development there I
wouldn't be here right so everything
that I put around me and surrounding the
web so that's why I tell you guys listen
you could do it too it's not that hard
and stop focusing just on getting the
job is what happens after you get the
job like are you just gonna be a worker
you could be a worker at a freakin
Macy's you could be a worker at
footlocker you could be a worker any of
those companies like yeah because you
get a little extra money here but you
have to understand too is you could be
getting a hundred and twenty thousand
dollars tomorrow but your lifestyle is
going to change so that $120,000
is still going to feel to you as if you
was earning $50,000 the more money that
you earn the more expenses you're gonna
have no matter where you go right
those guys are making you know you know
$134,000 we compare bank account between
most of the the Facebook developers that
I've seen some minds and I'm like I'm
actually doing better than them all
right because they paid so much money or
anything you know they have a whole
bunch of expenses they you know they
super stressed out all the time so they
have to go and take long vacations and
you know they gotta go around the world
it's all seems fun but then at the end
of the day is like when you look at the
bank account you're like wait something
don't add up
you got my saying and I'm not saying
this everybody cuz if you're a senior
developer is somebody who's been there
for 10 years let's say five ten years on
Facebook yeah you probably make like 200
something or more alright and you
probably got you know stocks and a whole
bunch of equity and you know and
benefits and this and that and that's
great but I'm saying somebody who is we
just got hired who has the same amount
of years as me as experienced as a
developer we put go head to head I'm
like I'm already ahead because I never
put myself like I need to work for
somebody the company needs me you know
what I'm saying so it's like it could be
game development today could be web
development tomorrow could be software
development tomorrow doesn't matter to
me you know what I'm saying like I'm not
gonna be like oh my god I need the job I
need I need to work for a company it's
like yeah I got skills
I'm gonna use the skills I'm gonna get a
job you know cuz it's always good to get
a job at first the first two years you
need to work at a company right but then
from there you jump into other things
you start making your own money you
start opening up your own offices you
know I mean like that's just how it is
man go check out the the Ruby course man
that's already done that's been done let
me see what else what else what else
what else people from Mexico
hey man let me see what do you use as
invoices for freelance work I just use
venmo for a thousand dollar payment with
a 25 cent fee
I used to use PayPal invoices but they
charge a 3% that's good
every more I sing a lot of people use
way more like when they go to a
restaurant like you pay your friend
that's how I use my mom I mean I like to
get cash if I'm working with anybody
freelance work like and I'm close to you
I rather go and drive let's say the 25
30 miles to go see you somewhere and get
that money cash because that money cash
I'm not reported and that's how it is
that's just that's the truth I'm not you
know but um besides that if I have to
take like a payment and I rather get
like like a direct deposit or a bank
transfer or even PayPal I don't you know
sometimes there's like three percent to
me I don't even cry about it like if I
was to show you guys all the things like
you know when people was buying stuff on
from you to me right when people buy
stuff from you to me you know how much I
make out of ten dollars I make three
dollars right and then from there I
gotta pay taxes on those three dollars
so when you think about it for every
course that I saw on udemy I'm making
maybe two dollars do I cry about it no
because it's like I just don't paint
mind to it you know the certain things
I'm like I say you can't go around it
there's gonna be a feed there's gonna be
something else so I just don't pay no
mind to it you know I try to bring it
down as much as I can but it's like hey
not all the time man let's see
yes sir if you have
dollar salary because any formula says
because most people live in within
within their salary not their needs if
you made a million year a million
dollars a year you probably have a
higher mortgage fancy car find the
clothes etc yep
trust me man you know what I mean like I
was like thinking about it just the
other day I was like y'all I made one
sending for yesterday yeah but not
yesterday last year
all right I'm thinking in my head I'm
like wait I'm still wearing the same
hoodie that the same type of style same
hoodie nothing crazy
I could go crazy you know I could go
crazy but I hey man you know what we
gotta just buy everything I'd get is
bait everything I get is is freaking I
don't know let's go to the Balenciaga
and let's get some goat cheese you know
what I mean like even the other day I
wanted to buy a very nice beloved watch
right and I was like should I do it but
the watch was crazy expensive and then I
was like you know what i'ma stay with
something simple and then you know we
just copped these there's a little

time if you wanna play with me download

right now and my name is coding face in
there so it's easy to find me kids add
me on it man I'm like I'm like og triple
og in this game now I have one day that
I started I'm already like level seven
level eight you know your boy is nice

playing playing NBA 2k 18 I know it's
not to K 19 but I'm playing to get 18
the story mode the my player campaign
just because I haven't played it and I
had the the game there for like a year
and never touched it so I decided to go
back into that what else on my plane I
also play Gundam versus if you have
Gundam versus if you have a ps4 goodbye
it's called Gundam versus is pretty
legit it's like an arcade fighting game
with condoms okay if you guys don't know
I love Dunham's that's like one of my
favorite listen I love everything that
was in tsunami right
everything that was in tsunami Dragon
Ball Z uh you as a YuYu Hakusho what
what else freakin Gundam Wing I love all
of that man
but yeah feels like what a blue bills
that without blue cheese I was telling
my wife yo like when we moved over here
any when we move to this new crib I
freaking I took out like 10 grand cash
alright credit bank and I was like kill
this feels good
you know what I mean like when you you
take your cash out the bank and you walk
around with that you just money falling
like a I got the money phone I was like
yo you know what I'm gonna do like a few
videos man just all blue cheese all blue
cheese like I don't know like 20 racks
just all blue cheese and I'm gonna hey
man it's called a phase calm you're in
no boy job back at it again out
here it's counting money you know people
get tight you know some people get tight
man
somebody had me up the other day man was
it like you was talking about money why
you always doesn't that listen man some
people we know like me like I ain't grew
up with like you know with money around
me I ain't grew up with you know people
who the way we get motivated is by
seeing money like if you out here I
don't care it's like I was watching this
thing on a hacker noon was like why Mark
Zuckerberg only wears one t-shirt same
color t-shirts ain't precise for the
past five years
and it's like Mark Zuckerberg he has
everything he's bored like let's be
honest when you have everything you have
nothing else you're like he's bored
right
Bill Gates bored he's bored by now right
so you have guys like Elon Musk who was
like okay I got mad money I could do
whatever the hell I want
so what am I gonna do I'm gonna buy a
whole bunch of fancy freaking you know
fancy suits I'm gonna buy myself a lot
of jewelry he has mad jewelry freaking
Elon Musk freaking or who else um he got
a whole bunch of cars you know what I
mean like this is all motivation man you
know I was like I think one of the
biggest problems is like sometimes is
that you know you see like a superstar
you see if somebody famous
and you say hey that person has money
because he has this this and that but
what if you're you go into your doctor
right you going to the doctor's office
and the doctor is like yo yeah I got the
Tesla in the front you know what I mean
like you go into your doctor's office
you're like oh man damn my doctor's
legit with the the Tesla do got the
grills in his mouth like he's like dr.
going is like yeah I got you know me and
baby from Cash Money we go to the same
dentist you know I got 200 grand he got
200 grand
just on diamonds on on the teeth you
know so there's like that could motivate
somebody but is that you go to the
doctor and you're like oh you see this
old man shriveled like old washed-up
even though you know he's getting money
you like you don't get inspired by that
you know I mean like sometimes you got
to put it into people's faces so they
could get inspired so I was like oh
maybe I should do that
maybe I should do take one of our
freakin ty Lopez tricks out the book the
only difference is like we actually show
what we do have so it's just like just
come outside with a 20 racks and you're
like yo what up we are here 84 come
outside you know I mean like just have
fun with it do a video like yeah today's
topic is you know
yeah there's a video obviously lemme see
if I could show it hopefully you took
don't create and steal my my freaking
thing man
lay don't block me let me see a baby and
Rallo like okay let me find ya this is
hilarious to be honest it's kind of
ridiculous matter of fact is no it's low
baby money back yo this is a scene
that's just so ridiculous there's like
yo like it's kind of crazy but then
again why do you think the youth meaning
kids meaning guys who were in high
school like why wouldn't you be like why
wouldn't you want to be like one of
those guys see you know what I'm saying
like back in the 80s back in the 80s and
70s you look at those rock stars right
their lifestyle was in the gym because
every city that they go to they stop by
they get like 20 30 girls already
waiting for them like you know oh my god
is freaking knows the Rolling Stones
right it's like everywhere they go is
like they pop it right now in days you
got like it's like hip-hop you you know
what I mean so I feel I don't know I
feel like you could bring all of that
you could bring all of those things to
the people to the masses and just be
like yo this is what we yet you know
like we're doing good we could show it
you know what I mean like all this work
that I do all these coatings you know
what I mean like all of the stuff that I
do is nerdy same you know what I mean
like that's how consider in my head is
like oh let's see it's nerdy right
so all that is nerdy being in front
of a computer getting fat because I'm
I'm in front of the computer 24/7 the
only answer that I have to it is just
like hey man I'm freaking making money
out of this you know I mean like I got
all my friends that hit me up all the
time they're like yo Joe where you been
had you lost this and that and I'm like
bro I'm making money out here you know
I'm I'm grinding you know what I mean
like one of my friends hit me up the
other day he's like yo Oh Joe or freakin
was a huge send me saying oh come on
let's let's go play what's this stupid
game let's go play fort night and I'm
like bro I just had a kid I got a wifey
like if I'm gonna play anything's gonna
be like a mobile game and that's like
after I already did everything all of my
work I frickin went through all my
websites I freaking made sure everything
works I answer all my emails from
everybody that sends me an email to
Conan face at gmail.com after I do all
of those things then I'll hang out for
low B I have like an extra hour you know
what I mean but how do you like you know
what's the answer to all this stuff like
why would you be doing all the things
that I'm doing like I'm doing a lot of
work you know the coding phase I do my
website is where I make my money from
answer emails freaking contact people
like now like I got my friend was gonna
help me out create this all data science
you know a machine learning course all
right a couple of other stuff so it's
like I got interviews people call me up
for interviews they want to do
interviews on me for magazines like I
have a lot of stuff going on in my plate
but it's like like what's the answer to
all of this and it's like and I'm like
a man I come through with the money bag
you know what I mean like like that's
the only thing that you could give an
answer to it you could be like oh why
are you doing all this stuff is like I
have fun but at the same time it's like
there's a back behind you know what I
say it's like there was a line where
this guy said some stuff man do say he
says something like I don't rap for free
I need a budget like people come to me
like a maker you
you spit some lines it's like bro I
can't even do it you gotta have a budget
for that like if I'm gonna open my mouth
and say anything there has to be a
budget for it
yeah and I'm saying and it's like even
everything that I do from now on I feel
like I'm trying to create a brand of
coding face calm to help people out but
at the same time I have to take it to
another level so that means I gotta work
extra hard and then to the people like
you know like my mom called me up today
too
she said oh he's like my mom literally
that's what I got my mom asked me if I
was doing something illegal like
literally she asked Joe is a but you're
working from home and in say but you're
making more than what she was making
before are you doing something legal
like no doing illegal like I'm just
working hard I'm making stuff happen I'm
you know I was like the only way that
you could you know explain to people
like why are you still like why arguing
your house working so hard why are you
staying up all night why are you doing
all those things why with the thing the
days you're sick you're not taking a
sick day you just like daughter suffers
like listen there's a bag it's like a
pulling up the the TD bank accounts like
there's a bag you know what I mean is
like if I leave this for a second I'm
losing on that bag
so that's how I look at everything
nowadays man it's the blue cheese way
man I'm trying to I'm trying to take it
up a notch man I got a little skinnier
but we need to really we need to
definitely get get to work harder man 84
music Spanish mom is like don't play you
know what you know why because was it
like this month right
this month we went to to the casino
right went to talk to - hi
it's why you might be listening but once
in a casino whatever lost money over
there lost like I don't know like eight
hundred eight hundred nine hundred
dollars this month right now me back in
the days we'll be like oh my god eight
hundred dollars
oh god there's a lot of money there's
like two weeks of work because that's
how much I used to be working man that's
how much I used to get paid nowadays I'm
just like cool I'll make that in and now
you know probably in a day you know I
was like we don't really stress it no
more you know but yeah my mom was like
telling me is like oh like what you
doing cuz she she still don't understand
everything that I do that she knows I I
called our bill stuff online but she
don't understand it how I make my money
she don't understand that
people go to my website and then they go
and look at the services that they want
and then from there they see on the side
advertising and then they click on it
and when they click on it I get like $5
per click $7.00 per click like all that
stuff adds up even this month like now
in YouTube we going up in his world like
I broke a record this month right the
most I was making before was like I
think it was like 300 is something from
YouTube right like we wasn't making that
much but now the channel is growing
crazy and like now your boy is making
like 900 right this more for long I mean
like 900 from YouTube now is it like
crazy money no but when you add up all
the little things that I'm doing all
those little things add up like 20
things you do the math I leave it to the
people's man I leave it to the people's
man so it's a good year man it's 2018
man we're blessed we're gonna have a
better 2019 you know that makes me think
man like I wonder you know you got
people like traverse immediate traverse
the media must be making a killing Raina
now that I think about him like damn if
I'm at 15,000 I'm making I'm making like
900 how much is let's see 15 so let's
say now let's say 15 / no 200,000 I
think he's like a - how much is it
he got traversÃ©e media I see traversÃ©e
idiot I'll look it up
this is media who I think right now this
whole 2017 he was killing it he got the
most he got two hundred two hundred
seventy six thousand and divided by 1500
another water by fifteen two hundred
yeah no two hundred seventy six thousand
divided by fifteen thousand that's
eighteen now 18 times nine hundred damn
sixteen thousand five hundred and sixty
so he could be making right now sixteen
thousand just from YouTube like we don't
know his business and stuff like that
right but that's a lot man you know what
I mean like if I will not look when I
get to that point man like I'm not
looking to become millionaire I'm not
looking to do anything I just wanna
freakin provide good service to the
people show you guys how I freaking make
my own money and how you should guys
should make your money online you know
once I get to that point it's a rat man
then I think I could probably start
doing that you know by that time I can
start saying hey man every month five
thousand dollars worth of of MacBook
Pros or you know Windows computers we
could give out for free like I'm dying
I'm dying to get to that game and once I
get to that point is a wrap because it's
like there from there I could just like
help so many people out
[Laughter]
yeah when 84 muses like yeah I was
running a scam cuz they didn't they
don't get it
84 how many beats per month cuz you know
was crazy
84 music you know I it's so crazy
84 music I was like listening to his
beats probably I don't know months even
like a year before he even came to this
channel cuz I used to like write down on
beats let's see my boy right down on
beats like missing one day 84 started
getting on YouTube
let me see he's sort by the oldest two
years okay two years ago he started
getting on YouTube
putting beats online man shit's crazy
nah yeah look I said that's why I tell
people look all the things that you
learn from me our skills you're gonna
learn how to code right but on top of
that I'm gonna show you how to make
money like if you wanna be successful in
this field and you just don't want to be
depending on just a company like that's
where I really shine on like I'm not
depending on any company you know what I
mean like I go in there like you know
like I was telling my wife I was like
yeah maybe I'll go back to work after
the summer not because I need to but
because I just want to do it just for
the hell of it just for the challenge
and going there work for like four or
five months and then you know be like
you know I'm out of here you know
but it's crazy let me see what else
reading everybody's comments man if you
guys have got any questions guys let me
know coding phases here man we live end
of 2016 man how long do you work for
somewhere until you branched out I mean
I started my first job was in 2012
so from 2012 to September of last year
I've been working for peoples and stuff
like that but you know it's like the
first two three years I needed to work
for a company because I just didn't know
no I wasn't ready to branch out and do
my own thing and then at the end of the
last three four years then I I say you
know I wanna my plan was I wanted to go
to Thailand and live off the minimum
like the minimum minimum minimum I'm
talking about like four hundred dollars
a month
survive on that and be able to open up
my own companies over there like either
doing drop shipping either teaching
online either or tutoring either
whatever it was you know but I like I
need to find myself I felt like I need
to branch out and take that chance
alright I mean maybe I waited too long
but
you know it's cool cuz it's like now I
have a foundation I have you know like
five websites that generate money that
no matter where I go in the world I
could be good
I have coding phase car which you know
helps out a little bit you know it's
like a little extra you know make sure
that I could pay my taxes that's what I
really is for to be honest with you guys
like it really just helps out like any
type of income diagram from coding phase
calm it helps me to pay off all the
other incomes that I have to pay taxes
on and yeah because it's not like
nothing significant it's not like you
know I'm not crazy
I seen American gangster dance out I
know what you wanted to do up there
that's Buddha I just wanted to go over
there even to DRI wanted to go to the
are at some point you know cuz it's just
like I feel like he in the United States
is like you're stuck in in this song
enough constantly you know running
around working super hard to just pay
off your rent here you're freaking debt
like you know everything is everybody
it's not even the most richest person in
the world still has a lot of debt going
to India
April see how how I like it why are you
going to India I mean I think for for
you it should be fine because you you
know your English so your English
British you could go over there I'm
pretty sure like Indians are used to
having like British people out there all
the time so I was like India is like the
second England or something like that
especially now with so many Indians in
in England let me see what else was the
opinion on the merge stack the merge
stack is cool man but I don't know man
to be honest with you I don't think for
is for me all right
even like right now I'm doing all on my
website in JavaScript I am doing
everything with react even at that I'm
like this is cool but this could have
been done so much easier and something
like Ruby on Rails or you know something
simple but I don't know not really for
me like God it's not my favorite deck
like if somebody tells me hey Joe we
want you to build an emergency tack i
building burn stack because i know it
but it's not my favorite
so I'm missing Barbara
love Indian food that's the stop ya know
all the JavaScript man let me know AJ
have you tried the the rails it's so
much easier it's like so so much easier
to do do things and get things done is
actually fun
guys I'm gonna start recording some
videos a little bit so I'm gonna start
heading out of here yeah send me any
questions guys I'm gonna start recording
questions and answers from people so
please email me coding phase at
gmail.com any questions that you guys
might have I'm gonna answer them in a
video
okay so send it to me cuz then it gives
me content you know I need you guys to
send me questions and whatever you you
want me to talk about alright so yeah
I'll see you guys later
 boy Joe back at it again coding
face.com love you guys check out the
website : face combo check that out
right now I'm about to start recording
you know how to build your own starter
kit and that whole process between gulp
between wet pack and how everything
works okay so keep a lookout for that
that should be done in the next two days
I'm gonna start today so the new videos
the newest video should be out probably
like an hour so if you're a member of
coding phase comm go check that out
alright I'll see you guys later bye e
okay one last thing what is it Kevin
Lopez
Kevin Lopez one last thing
what is a Kevin Kevin Tommy Tommy can
you make
your Ruby course free bro I put in so
much hours into that thing I can't put
it for free men like unfortunately it's
too many hours man it's too much work
if it was easy if it was easy man and
like I have to stay here who wants to be
in front of a computer 24/7 not me I
want to be doing other stuff you know so
I was like if I'm in front of this
computer and my wife my son they want to
hang out with me they want to see me
right I have to have like just like
why'd you set in this whole video I have
to have a reason in explanation to give
to people like Hey Joe why are you
always worked and why are you always on
the computer why are you always doing
other stuff you have to give them a
reason so the reason is like hey
financially it helps me out but if I'm
just doing things for like for fun then
I would look crazy like who you know
people would look at me like hey Joe

enough to pay my rent with YouTube okay
so yeah I'll see you later love you guys
