brought up is he a boy joke back at it
again man : face calm nice man heading
to my job today I actually woke up a
little bit late so I'm freaking rushing
to go to work
but I wanted to say this to you guys man
yo listen guys number one man stop
listening to everybody that's telling
them oh learn nodejs
not learn nodejs like as if that's the
only stack that you need to learn listen
if you don't live in New York City if
you don't live in LA if you don't live
in San Francisco
forget about nodejs that's the first
thing that you gotta know forget about
it for now
like when you see on jobs description
and they say oh requirement nodejs
Dana freaking asking you to be off
yeah man my fault my fault this thing
keeps cutting off I'm I'm on trying to
get some connection out here supposedly
Verizon is the best way I guess it's
pretty
so yeah yes sir man stop listening to
everybody telling you just learn no GS
if you don't live in those major cities
you know New York LA San Francisco
you know Dallas you know the domain big
cities man stop listening to people man
because it's actually hurting you guys
you guys has got to go to job interviews
and you're gonna be like oh yeah I'm a
full-stack nodejs developer but I have
no experience I've never worked anyway
people's gonna look at you like man we
have developers who will do JavaScript
already and they've been around for like
five years
why would we choose you who's never done
this before you know what I mean like
it's not that easy it's easier in big
cities because they need the people but
what about the snow you know those
companies in whatever Tampa Florida
freaking Atlanta Georgia freaking
Washington DC Wyoming
Kansas if you live outside of the major
cities man stop thinking that you're
gonna find a no js' job right away it's
not gonna happen
I hate when people come over here on
YouTube but I hate man no two yeses
you know no js' the best is the only way
to go
and it's like come on man you're
actually hurting your viewers because
what you're doing is you're talking
about a stack that's good in your area
which is why I tell people learn PHP
because PHP you could get a job anywhere
PHP is like 80% of the web no matter
where you go you're gonna find a job it
doesn't matter where you work you can
still find a job and like once you learn
a stack once you learn how to build a
website from you know the front end to
the back end you know designing the data
structures designing the you know the
user authentication once you know that
you could learn that in any other
language like that's the truth you know
what I mean and the reason why I tell
you guys start with PHP is because
there's jobs out there it doesn't matter
you can live in any City I bet
you right now
there's a job for you out there decide
that a job for you and WordPress decides
our job in laravel decided to a job in a
codeigniter my my favorite language is
not PHP and I'll be honest with you guys
like it's not my favorite language but
for a person who has no experience you
cannot come in here and be picky and be
like oh I'm only gonna you know I'm only
gonna learn no - yes because it's the
latest thing in the world man that's why
yeah stay out here for
like six months without no jobs man
there's no reason for nobody to not be
able to have a job right now like I'm
telling you guys what you guys gotta
learn now I'm telling you guys work what
courses yeah you gotta take but if you
don't want to listen to me I want to
listen to the trendy stream be like oh
yeah I'm gonna learn you J yes because
you genius is the latest thing mind you
nobody's using that
the only people are using UJS is in
private companies like if you have a
design
you have your own small business
creating websites for people
yeah you could use view yes because
you're basically the only developer
there so now you're on the internet
saying oh you have UJS is the best for
reality when you look online there's no
 companies hiring for the for
that nobody's hiring for that so
why are you gonna waste your time trying
to learn some wait you just a
beginner
you just started web development you
have no experience you've never worked
anywhere
you gotta pick something that's gonna
let you in once you have four year under
your belt then you can pick whatever you
want but while you're still a beginner
you have no choice this is not about
 democracy where you'd be like oh
yeah II let's vote on the language that
we want to learn no because then you're
gonna be out here without no job and
then that's when people give up they'll
be like oh man I have six months looking
for a job I can't even find a job
any you've been learning the
wrong I haven't told you is thank
you you focusing on that you're not
supposed to if you never in high
college say in Minnesota why the
are you learning nodejs
single view or every single YouTube
that's telling you oh man
no js' is the way to go yes it's the way
to go if you live in New York LA
San Francisco Dallas but if you
live outside those cities those are
those are not that's not the way to
 go because you're gonna be out
here looking for job nobodies no
other company it's working or no js' you
have more chances on finding a PHP
developer your position as a junior the
run or a c-sharp c-sharp is hard
most of the c-sharp companies they want
somebody with a computer science they're
not gonna hire you right away so
it's like I'm telling you guys I'm
giving you the shortcut I'm
giving you the way for you to
get in this industry and I told it you
gotta have in your portfolio you gotta
have a real estate a restaurant a design
agency and an e-commerce website and it
has to be from dribble comm the design
because if you have a shitty website and
people look at it and but all man this
guy looks like the website look like it
wasn't done in 1996 they not gonna
 give you the opportunity to even
come in for an interview
they gotta be really desperate for you
to come in for an interview with a a
really shitty website
you know what I mean like come on man
take advantage take advantage of what I
tell you I'm the realest developer how
here I'm not gonna give you a
fake fake information so you guys soon
to not be well informed when I come in
here this for a reason I want to give
you guys the best chance to get a job in
the best chance to get as much money as
possible
you gotta understand when you're a brand
new developer you cannot just you can't
be choosey you can't be like oh man I
don't want to work in WordPress oh man I
don't wanna working in PHP oh man I
don't want to do this
idiot you never work this that's like
poison that's like you want to become an
example a doctor right and the doctor be
like you know what man I'm not even
gonna do a residency because I'm nice
like that and I'm just gonna go straight
to being a doctor you can't do
that you have to go through the
residency you have to go to a hospital
and pretty much work for man
hours for no reason and do the
hard work PHP is the hard work because
it's not it's not as fun as nodejs it's
not as fun as crystal lang
it's not as fun as a whole bunch of
languages out there but you guys are
 hurting yourself when you guys
are not learning PHP stop listening to
people that's telling you that
hey only learn nodejs are only
learning what I read Python or
whatever man
those people are hurting you
straight up I'm being honest they
hurting your chances of getting you
don't hire it out here because most of
this you know most of these blogs
they're located in New York most of
these blocks is located in San Francisco
so why the focus are you listening to
people that's not even in your area I'm
giving you a general information that's
kind of basically be good it doesn't
matter where you are it could be New
York it could be South Africa
you're gotta be able to find a job with
 PHP and not only that then once
you know
stack once you know how the web works
you could learn any language all you
have to do is just pretty much have
those projects that I told you and if
you want to get a full stack position
build the front end and the back end for
each side that I told you and you're
gonna be fine man but I'm telling you
guys man I keep seeing this everywhere
everybody's like oh man but I don't know
js9
this dis and that little Python and I'm
like man those languages are cool and
they're fun but they're not gonna
guarantee you that job man then I'm
gonna get I can guarantee you that job
that's a brand new developer man you're
gonna be out here looking for a job for
a long time because number one if you
like let's say an example number one if
you have three months in a boot camp you
can even learn you can scratch the
surface of all the things that you have
to learn in JavaScript I've been doing
JavaScript for five years and every year
every day I learn sign you I
learn something completely new in
JavaScript every day and I have
five years javascript is not easy
javascript is napa is not a way to go
for a brand new developer javascript
like I said once you learn how to
manipulate dumb cool jump onto
PHP right away ASAP that's what you know
to do once you know how to add a class
so uh a element like a div
that's it you've learned enough
JavaScript jump to the back
which a sign and learn my sequel MongoDB
is cool but nobody's using that
like that's what I'm saying man like you
guys is over here trying to learn
 you know different languages
that are not gonna get you that job by
the way man
I'm just trying to be real with you guys
so I don't want you guys over here
wasting your time because it's gonna be
very frustrating when you come and you
better hey man all I know is HTML CSS in
JavaScript they gotta look at you like
okay like that's great
you know JavaScript but we also have
other stacks here we also have a PHP
stack we also have a Java stack we also
have a c-sharp stack asp.net so it's
like now it's like oh man bar all I know
is JavaScript you're already in a
disadvantage because this a lot most
developers know three to four different
languages automatically so it's like
when you know HTML CSS JavaScript PHP
Python whatever any other languages out
there it just looks better because then
it shows that you could pick up things
quick when you're a brand new developer
they're not hiring you because you're
such a great developer when you're a
brand new developer they hire you
because they need an extra hand they
need a grunt
you know me as just senior
developer in my company if like right
now we're looking to hire somebody we're
not looking to hire somebody who's like
extremely expert and it's the best in
the world what we need is a
grunt somebody that's gonna do the
that we don't want to do and that's the
reality of things so you guys is gonna
be doing
they said that other developers don't
want to do it you know they might give
you a page down okay could you
make this page into
the HTML CSS and JavaScript page if you
could make that cool you're hired
can you turn orders these pages
into views for laravel for us cool can
you make all this HTML emails for us
cool then you're hired
that's what we hiring people at my job
and it's like dang every job
when you you hire somebody for
entry-level they hiring you to do grunt
work when you hear grunt it means it's
like slave work you're gonna do
slave work that's it there's no if and
buts about it
that's it just do it just learn
that spend the time and that's it
it's gonna take you six months to be
nice and then you're gonna learn from
the senior developers their that
you can't learn online and shake that
you can learn in your own house the
that you only gonna learn from working
on a team you know what I mean stop
listening to people that it gave me so
pissed off you find out that the
companies are these people that are on
YouTube they talk to you about
oh no jsr Dada Ryan and all these other
languages mind you in the company that
they work on they don't even use
nodejs
what part of the game is that you know
what I mean it's like that's the same
 that I tell people is like hey man
how the can I tell you guys go to a
bootcamp when I've never been to a
 bootcamp how can I be promoting
something that I've never been on it's
like how can I be saying hey guys
learn nodejs cuz oh my you know my
personal projects are in ojs and it's
great I know it's great well are they
jobs for you as a brand new developer
out there not really me I could go out
and get a job in nodejs cuz I'm a
 seasoned developer I've been the
machine for five years anywhere I go
there actually any question about
JavaScript I can answer it
I have websites from the front
to the back from the database to the
 sort of structure so even
through the way how we do the deployment
even so everything I've done everything
inside our website anything that
you could imagine after done it
I could get hired as a node.js developer
like this but for you guys you guys are
 brand new developers man stop
listening to people that's gotta
throw you out there and it's gonna be
like hey man I could find a job in
 in the month in a week
or Lord J yes yeah you live
in San Francisco you live in
your lay you living in New York
it's easy for us most of these people
that are on YouTube they don't live in
this cities so why are you here like
telling people hey man learn something
that is pretty much they won't find jobs
out here when I come to YouTube I give
you guys a full a full look of how to
basically get jobs in and do your thing
yeah it's a lot of bullshitting here a
lot yeah a lot of people would be like
hey man I learn how to code
learn how to call in a week
mind you they don't tell you
that when they talk I learned how to
code they learn how to say hello world
in a week that's what they
learned that's not learning how to code
or the following a project online
 project is not learning how to
code learn how to code when you say hey
I want to create a website about this
this and this and I want users to log in
when you could create that on your own
without having to look at
YouTube projects then yeah you know how
to code if you still looking
through through notes and you're
still looking through tutorials and
like that you don't know how to code yet
let's be honest out here you don't know
how to code I'm trying to help you guys
I'm wrong I'd rather be hard on you guys
and just be honest so you guys
can have a better expectation of
life when it comes to this you can
find the jobs right away if you listen
to me I guarantee you that if you listen
to other people that's telling you man
let's let's learn this trendy shape that
nobody there's no companies
looking for PHP man soon as you know how
to how to you understand PHP the
language your your hireable like most of
the time all you gonna be doing it's
maintaining code so they're gonna be
like hey could you change for you go to
the database and make sure that you know
find all other users that boy I don't
know t-shirts last year like that
that's what you're gonna be doing but
that's like grunt work you know what I
mean it's not fun it's not the most fun
jobs but it's like getting the door get
you a little fifty six thousand dollars
which I bet a lot of you guys are not
even getting that right now
so get yourself fifty sixty thousand
dollars in your pocket work there for
six say
smarts to a year and therefore they jump
to something else then you could jump to
I know J as a job but don't spend six
months looking for that nodejs job and
be broken in your house I'd rather be
getting paid and then I said I'm looking
for the nodejs job or Python or whatever
you know what I mean I'd rather be
getting paid man that's my whole thing
like there's no reason for somebody to
be learning in the house when you could
go to a company and work there and
they're gonna give you they're
gonna give you money you know what I
mean like this company here that will
hire you will hire you and then you
pretty much you could learn while you
you're at the company but learn PHP man
I used to talk so much share about PHP
man in the beginning man because I used
to go to a site point calm and I
used to go to tree housing everybody I'm
gonna I'll PHP is
you know that's actually hurting
like my first two years because I wasn't
getting those higher paid jobs because I
didn't know PHP and yeah I could have
went to the city I could have went to my
hat in in and got jobs over there but I
took a different route I didn't want to
go to the city I wanted to working you
know smaller business outside of the
city because there's more chairs more
relaxed right so me working outside of
that gave me a perspective of like hey
this how it is all around the country if
you're not inside of the main cities
you're not looking for people who have
no js' experience nodejs looks good on
paper and be like oh that's cool man
you're you actually pretty trendy right
now that's pretty cool and now give you
a plus on your interview but is that
what they're looking for it no more
trust me man start looking for jobs
online and you're gonna see all of the
jobs say no js' when you go to the job
into you you're gonna ask them what
stack are you using tell me somebody
tell me how many jobs they're
gonna tell them that yeah we use
nodejs and
front end in the back end and we use
MongoDB on our database it's gonna be a
very very low low number of companies
that do it you know what I mean so man
stop listening to other people that's
telling you don't learn PHP stop
listening to people man
cyber zillions of people that's telling
you only learn nodejs nodejs is cool
it's like an extra feature it's like an
extra plus that you have on your resume
well that's not what your your first job
is gonna be yet I guarantee you that the
only way you're gonna get an ojs job is
number one if the company don't know
what the they doing that's number
one number two they really in need of
developers like extra hand which means
you're only gonna be doing a little bit
of stuff on or nodejs cuz they're not
gonna put somebody companies that are
working with nodejs
they're not gonna put a brand-new
developer to work on the back end of a
major company that's built on OGS
especially when you if any little
 could break the whole life site
you know what I mean like there nah no
js' any you'll ever a semicolon
somewhere you put an extra letter
somewhere and you've gotta up the
whole server
you know the reason that's all I
say that
listen to me man and you will win listen
to other people that's telling you
I said if they're they're only concerned
about their area and they think how it
is for them in their area like yeah I
could talk about nodejs I could talk
about a whole bunch of other languages
started really popular in my area but
that's not the reality for the whole
world that's not the reality for America
all right guys I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
