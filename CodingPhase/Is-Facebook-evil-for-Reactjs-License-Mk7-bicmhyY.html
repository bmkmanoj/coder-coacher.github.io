again man coating face calm your boy is
backing out and did it again alright so
today's topic is let's talk about a
little bit about what's going on with
react and Facebook's
our licensing of reacting with a patent
and all of that stuff right so what the
right thing first of all I'm not a
lawyer none of us here are lawyers I
mean you know most of us we're not
lawyers so we don't know exactly how
this thing works we know is that you
know react is supposed to be sort of
open source but not really basically you
can use it for any project but like from
my understanding is Facebook is also
trying to protect itself because
Facebook users react everywhere and is
using it in their own applications react
native and this and that right so
people are basically flipping out
they're like oh my god are reacting well
Facebook getting reissued their
licensing and whatever whatever right
now I would say this man if I was
Facebook I would do the same thing I
want a patent that's got to protect
react right and it's gonna say hey
whenever Facebook uses it like everybody
should know like hey this is ours right
the idea that people think is gonna be
like hey this is open-source completely
open sourcing and everybody should
own it
nah Facebook is paying a lot of
developers a lot of money you know this
guy's making $200,000 imagine in a team
of 10 20 people how much money that is
right you know two hundred thousand
dollars each to keep on working on react
like here's some people get to
contribute and do a little changes here
and there but the people that are really
making the big changes in it and adding
all the quotient are the people that
work for Facebook so Facebook is the one
that that's really investing into this
right so how do you expect for Facebook
to just say hey you know what let's do
this completely open-source we pay for
it we we don't own it no more
we're gonna give it to the community
they can't do that especially when let's
say an example a situation where let's
say a company comes out with a new
product and react native and then they
try to patent that die new product
let's say your application or whatever a
workflow that they might have right and
they try to pay now because react is
being used on Facebook now they could
literally sue Facebook for it because
they're already patenting right so it's
whoever patents that first that's from
my understanding that's how it works is
that you're fine if I put in something
before you even though you created it
I'm doing that only so now basically I
can sue you who is the creator like
like that happens all the time
have you ever you guys never heard of
that show like you never heard of
 people being sued because of the
word podcast and and using numbers on on
your podcast like number in your podcast
people get sued for that because
somebody created a patent for it or even
like you know people go and create
patterns for technologies that haven't
been even created like somebody already
has a patent for an airplane that that
is also a car or you know a car that's
an airplane there's already a patent for
of a watch inside of the person's skin
has it been created no but people
already have a patent on it so it's like
this happens all the time guys so
Facebook is just trying to protect
itself you know so don't freak out don't
be like oh my god I can't use react
because it's not really open sourcing
and Facebook calls it no Facebook owns
it but Facebook has in the licensing
from my understanding from what I
overriding and just went over it alright
basically it's like you could use it for
your projects it's just is very clear
who owns it who always react
right like you cook all the project you
just cannot suit real Facebook
you cancel Facebook for user react
that's all they really did they just
protecting themselves it's like people
are looking for those loopholes guys
people are looking for loopholes to to
try to Facebook at their own stuff
like they do that all the time
look what what is it Apple has gone
through with with galaxies like Samsung
like you know how many times that you
sued each other back and forth like a
million times because every time that
that becomes out with something new
Samsung was right there copying the
out of it just every single thing and
then of course after a certain amount of
time Apple started on you know switching
up their their whole model and what they
wanted to do is just make more money and
try to melt people so then they wasn't
creating new technologies and new new
things for the people that were reusing
the same phone and basically Samsung at
the end came out winning because Samsung
always comes out with something new
doesn't matter if it's the fingerprint
thing doesn't matter face you know like
the camera the quality of the camera
like this so much that Samsung has
taken from Apple but then now they've
already passed it now
iPhone this copy in the goddess's you
know what I mean
like this is like a technical thing like
this happens by default every
company wants to protect itself they
just have to put those bang you know
patents out to basically protect
themselves you can't be mad at a people
are freaking out they're like oh my god
yeah this thing is all about Facebook we
can't use the react no let calm down you
know pull your panties up and just relax
man
like stop acting like this shares like
the end of the world like you should
know that like if you create something
why would you give it out to the world
and say hey you guys own it no you got
to put it out there but like we all of
this and then you could use it that's
what reacted that's what Facebook day
that I gave man anybody can use this go
ahead use it we're now going to sue you
we're not going to to you know mess with
your but at the same time we're the
ones that created this amazing that's
just how it is
yeah man I just got back to work man
I'll see you guys later man
stop flipping out guys just take it easy
relax just chill don't worry keep on
using react you're gonna be fine it's
not the end of the world you're not
gonna die from you know react being
owned by Facebook all right guys and I
gotta say man check out my website Conan
face calm I have a whole bunch of free
tutorials I also have some premium
courses there trust me guys you're going
to learn a lot for me man if you listen
