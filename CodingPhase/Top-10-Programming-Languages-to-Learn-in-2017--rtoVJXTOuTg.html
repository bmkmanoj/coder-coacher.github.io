at it again listen we're gonna go with
the top ten programming languages for
2017 all right man make sure you
subscribe and make sure you hit the
little bell down there for notifications
man trust me all right so we gonna stop
top ten programming languages for to
learn in 2017 all right we gotta start
with go goes pretty much it's like a
super fast language you know the
competition for it is no js' job and you
know pretty much there's a lot of
companies out here looking for you know
developers who actually know go or at
least know the basics to basically hire
them and you know bring them in and
build api's you know we've go right so
this is like the future right now this
right here this the reason why I put in
number 10 because it's one of those
languages that not every company is kind
of hire for that this is gonna be like a
specific team a specific company a
specific startup there's not you know
your local shop your local shop is not
gonna be able to hire somebody for go
you know what I mean all right so Swift
so if I put a number nine because you
know it's definitely one of those
languages that is it's needed you know
because there's a lot of people iOS apps
and then the iOS apps and Mac OS but at
the same time so it could get pretty
difficult you know because most of the
time is you're developing apps and
developing apps is not that easy to pick
up you know you can't just be like hey
I'm a new programmer you know can I
freaking come in and work for you you
know you gotta have some type of
experience you know a year or two and
that's how you're gonna get higher so
pretty much is a very good language but
it's not that easy to get hired right
there's definitely lots of jobs so I
would you know if you
have experience already in programming
languages I will go with Swift right all
right so Python one of my favorite
languages I really really love Python
and Ruby that type of programming I love
it you know I mean definitely
object-oriented there's a lot of you
know companies that say hey we're
looking for somebody who has experience
with Python or Ruby and you know there's
definitely a lot of jobs and I'm talking
about you know high paying jobs it's not
like if you are a Python developer you
definitely gotta get top dollar for it
you know eighty thousand it's like the
starting point you know ninety five
thousand one hundred five thousand
twenty ten thousand one hundred twenty
thousand plus you know what I mean if
you want to become a data scientist like
go ahead you know the sky's the limit
you don't know how much you can make
trust me you're gonna be good and of
course you got Django a flask which is
like you know the frameworks for like
what development but a lot of people use
this for big data you know for data
science so it's all up to you right Ruby
people say Ruby on Rails is is dead but
the reality of things is there's a lot
of jobs out here and you know there's
not how many developers for it you know
it's like search Ruby on Rails and
there's a lot of jobs waiting it's like
high paying jobs so it's not like you're
you know you're you're not gonna find a
job there's definitely jobs but of
course I will say this the jobs usually
as far as Ruby on Rails are in major
cities so you know if you live San
Francisco New York Boston Seattle that's
where you most likely gonna find good
jobs for Ruby on Rails and you know I
would advise if you live close to any
major city you know try to learn Ruby on
Rails it's also a great way to be able
to learn a framework and how to work
with a framework and you know for web
development right all right guys let's
go to Java right
so we have Java right okay job is like
one of the oldest languages around right
but so many companies already use it in
their back-end or you know you know
their custom software I know a lot of
companies that you know they have whole
warehouses the items is basically being
run by Java right at the same time you
could go and create Android apps you
could actually create websites they have
different frameworks for it where you
could use it for web development
that's definitely jobs like no lie it's
like one of those languages that look at
this 58,000 like that means like there's
so many jobs for this thing that
like they don't even know how to you
know how to freaking hire anybody
because it's like there's so many jobs
like they need so many people but
there's not enough Java developers and
that's why you know a lot of times they
bring bringing uh you know h-1b visa
developers from other countries because
this nine of people to fill those jobs
so if you want to learn something and be
able to find a job quick job is one of
those languages all right all right
c-sharp all right people's gonna be like
oh my god I hate C sharp
I hate dotnet I hate you know I hate
working with unity3d well you know this
is like one of those languages that's a
bunch of jobs it's not that hard to
learn and it's like you're pretty much
set like for life like really like if
you know dot neck like dotnet is one of
those things that it's not gonna die for
a while and like it doesn't matter where
in the United States you live at you're
gonna find jobs for it because every
corporate company pretty much uses
dotnet so C sharp is pretty great for
that you know now unity that's a whole
different ball game that's where you
know video games you know video creating
video games for for the Andrew
for iOS or for PC or for ps4 Xbox
whatever it is a lot of games are really
made with unity 3d and you know pretty
much that's like the future you know
what I mean so like I say an example you
go over here you need to be like this
one of the games that you know created
with unity you know pretty cool graphics
right and that's all done and you know
unity so definitely we'll look out for
c-sharp and this definitely like I said
million jobs for like c-sharp look at
this twenty five thousand eighty five
thousand $90 $100 now let's go to the
next one PHP why did I choose PHP one
everybody saying hey don't learn PHP why
because if you're brand new developer
the easiest way to get into the industry
is to start building websites for PHP
why because number one there's a million
websites that use WordPress right every
you know small little workshop or design
shop you know or like you know any
mom-and-pop store has a WordPress
website so you pretty much who either
become a freelance for like you know
your first year of developing and
programming or you could go ahead and
become you know larval programmer you
know and pretty much you you could get a
lot of jobs you know for this PHP this
always gonna be jobs for PHP because PHP
is like the whole wife it's like most of
the web is made in PHP like look at that
you know 60,000 I mean the starting page
is not gonna be that great you know
60,000 75,000 but at the same time the
skill level doesn't need to be that high
you know what I mean like you could be a
beginner and get hired as a PHP the
pelipper so my advice to you is hey
learn something that you're gonna be
able to get your feet wet it's not the
best programming language but it's gonna
get you in the door you don't want to go
in and say hey I want to learn go
because go is more like a senior level
you can't just become a junior developer
and start working with go you know what
I mean so I start with PHP starts to go
right all right
sequel sequel is basically you know my
sequel post grass my Microsoft sequel
every company that I know they use some
type of sequel database you know right
now they have Mongo DVD whatever but the
reality of things is everybody uses
sequel so pretty much that's how you you
know you keep data inside the database
so for anybody that is starting up and
you gotta be doing any type of what the
web development or system administration
or anything like that I will advise you
to learn my secret like there's like a
given let's see right now let's say an
example it's 92 thousand jobs just on 65
thousand plus right a hundred five
thousand dollars for you know there's
23,000 jobs 105 thousand so that means
that there's so many jobs that they
don't even know how to fill them up like
you know what I mean like oh this w2
sequel
developer contractor 72,000 our like
seriously like why were you saying no to
this no that's like free money you know
my seek was not that hard at all trust
me all right so then we got JavaScript
you know there's like the holy grail of
like what develop me right and right now
people say oh don't learn jQuery listen
trust me learn jQuery because the first
thing you need to do is first of all
learn you know vanilla
just regular JavaScript learn the basics
know how to do or how to do loops how to
do a switch statements how to do
anything else statements and then jump
into jquery different they learn nodejs
and i seem to learn in the back end of
you know nodejs i'm talking about
learning stuff like you know grunting
gulping webpack those little things is
gonna help you out there from there
there's something like react angular of
UJS it's up to you but you know you
definitely need javascript javascript is
like like one of the go-to
what development language this day
you're gonna need Perrier
like look at that seventy thousand
thirty five thousand jobs like that
means that these freaking jobs
everywhere you know what I mean
so I would advise you definitely learn
JavaScript and of course which people
are gonna hate me for this
and why did I put this at number one
like I said I'm here to tell you about
programming languages that's gonna get
you in the door and get you higher for
2017 if you was looking to get higher as
a farm
programmers a web developer or just get
your you know your foot at the door and
just get your little feet wet
you gotta learn HTML CSS that's
essential right now like no matter what
like this what you have to learn
people's gonna be like oh but it's not
even a programming language that so
whatever there's a synthetic language
like listen man people need to stop
lying to you know developers aren't here
because before pretty much they putting
in their personal and their personal
feelings and you know whatever they
actually invested on you know they say
hey they're top ten of programming
languages for 2017 whatever well that's
their favorite languages I'm talking
about languages that's kind of
change your life and get you a job out
here man get your money I don't think
nobody's out here trying
programs just to be in their house and
just program for no reason
and say hey I know the hardest languages
in the world
I know Pascoe I know Perl I know
whatever like you don't want to be that
guy you want to be the guy that's
getting money and get hired because you
could go in learn HTML CSS and work on
any website as a junior developer and
that would get you you know get you in
the door there from there you could go
ahead and learn any of this other
languages but without that essential
would without this you can't get any job
period and that's something that nobody
tells you because it's like hey if you
don't know HTML CSS is gonna be even
more harder for you to get a job this is
like if you know this that's saying
you're in the door you know what I mean
if you argue for your design and you are
able to turn that into HTML and CSS
you're hired
