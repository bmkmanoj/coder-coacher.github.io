already know aka I do this aka coding
face man we're gonna start very simple
we're gonna start with the basics right
now man straight up html/css right now
right and the easiest way for you to
learn something is to you know build
something that you want to build you
know like let's say an example Netflix
right so we're going to build a clone of
Netflix you know nothing too crazy now
lotta animation is a lot of JavaScript a
lot of stuff it's just gonna be the
basics you know basically we're gonna go
take the website Netflix calm and is
pretty much screen shop the website so
like let's say from here screenshot this
alright that's one and we're going to
screenshot this
all right so pretty much we just gonna
take those images and then we gotta
break it down right after we break it
down different there we're gonna jump
into the code and start building up
little by little until you understand
what's going on you know I'm gonna teach
you the way that I wish somebody would
have taught me how to build HTML CSS and
JavaScript type websites you know how to
build a website because usually they
teach you in a very boring way something
that for you you think this thing is
difficult I don't know what's going on
and then you lose interest and then you
don't want to do it right so I'm going
to teach you how to actually build this
all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
