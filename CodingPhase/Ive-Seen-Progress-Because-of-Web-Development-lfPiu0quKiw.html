beyond you didn't man I still I still
like young clay well your boys out here
I'm just showing them know what I mean
like for coming I'm gonna give you a
little background story on my first car
my first car very first car was like an
Oldsmobile 1989 or 1990 some like
that that one of my mom's friend came
through littles I kill anybody wants
this piece of and then I was like
can I just get it I was like so excited
because I just got my my permit I was
like let me get it so he had
paid for insurance for like six months
and then it had Massachusetts plates and
I live in New York so whatever
oh this call was such a piece of
one time me and my boy Blackie right I
go I go to a party
I wanna party and one of Lucky's parties
my boy he always doing parties and his
house in shape so I'm there
he tells me hey Joe like I have two
girls man what's up we go into the city
I'm like man I don't know if I'm in the
card I don't even know if my car's gonna
make it to the city he's like man we go
into the city come on we're going to go
to uptown well uptime is way over the
Dominicans listen and so it was like
that's what everybody's at right and
he's like oh man we just got to go man
we gotta go we gotta go okay cool so
trust me when two girls in the car
getting this old-school ask hard
it's
it's not like inside inside of me I
was like oh my god I thought it was
gotta be like you know a couple of girls
I'm a guy but it was some bad dots man
like some really bad shorties I was like
oh man no he didn't he didn't just bring
those girls into this car
so what I automatically the girls
they're already clowning they're like oh
man cuz dozen of them to the backseat
had a hole that you can see through the
ground like that's crazy
you know sickening that's when you know
that car is a piece of when
something rusted off and you can see the
bottom of the floor so what our girls is
constantly clowning the whole
right so now we get to the city we go
over there we buy some jimmies some
Chili's right and it's like from the
food trucks and so we get that
all right
now we in the cloth and I'm like
all this man the car
doesn't turn on
we're like literally like two hours away
nah nah nah two hours well so I was a
knight and public transportation and
then not only that I was broke I
had like three dollars in my pocket and
then I'm like cuz I have filled up I
filled up the car I said okay I will
fill it up and put all the percent of
gas in there I filled it up next thing
you know um the cousin turned on and I
have no money on me now I'm like man I
wanted to just like literally like
 just go on the ground and just
 I don't know let the ground eat
me or some like like I wanted to
disappear I didn't want to titles people
like go I don't want to like it I'm
gonna tell little girls because one of
the girls I was like flirting with them
else and yo even though I had the shitty
calls I kill him I'm about to get that
today but after that I know I wasn't
going to get
so whatever then from there we take a
cab and I'm like telling my boy Blackie
Blackie I don't got no money and then
the girls you know how girls be they
 schemers they act like they never
have money so they're like oh we don't
got no money either and then Blackie is
a guy got like $20 so but we come in
from uptown from uptown to to Queens or
Brooklyn is gonna be at least $60 all
right at least so we like we
gonna get in the cab and then we're
gonna drop every girl off and then we
gotta go tell the guy to drop us off by
a park so he he dropped us over by a
parking that we just ran we both
just we was out I felt bad we
 we left that guy with 20 bucks
man like that's only the only come
 gas man I felt bad but she was
crazy so that's my story of my
automobile there from there I went in a
guy I wanted credit rate and I got my
first little development job
which was paying me it wasn't a
development job but it was a way to get
my get me in the door which it was like
you know some ecommerce company
selling shell eBay so my job was to edit
the HTML CSS from basically the eBay
eBay listings right so then after I used
to do that shelves okay I saved up some
money I saved like $2,000 so I go on
Craigslist and then I body there's no
 Saturn Vue
for $1,700 man
and I was like oh man this SUV is like a
little G yo that car was another piece
of
one thing they kept dying on me and then
one day me and my girl I take my girl
home and then I got off and was like
mass snow outside and that happens
that the car turn turned off and doesn't
want to turn back on and then I'm like
oh
come on thank God that was this Mexican
guy I guess he just came from work or
something and he basically helped me out
put her in the car man you know
that's all I'm very grateful I have a
lot of good Mexican friends wrong there
you really good people's like
you know with the whole Donald Trump
 you know I understand what people
are saying sometimes you got to put a
limit to how many people are aunt coming
and but at the same time it's like
whoever's here man just leave them here
is like a just get a residency
give them a green card in that saying
just like stop more people coming in but
whoever's here just let them be here man
you can't just be like hey you've been
here for totally something years now go
back home to a home that you don't even
know you know so yeah man and then from
there what did I get after that that's
what I got my other my other car and I
got that little new son rogue but then
my credit was sick and somebody stole my
credit all right somebody stole my
social security and they had my credit a
whole bunch of shame man so we don't all
this that I'm doing out it makes me
feel good because I've been through so
much and I've been through like so
many embarrassing moments and so many
 moments that you know follow
somebody else I would have hold it I
could have easily take it or not a whole
different I could have been you know
like one of my friends just like
grinding working like construction work
or working on on retail or you
know selling drugs like I got a
couple of friends are hustlers
you know they got money
but at the same time that wasn't my
route that was unlike what I wanted to
do you know I feel like I could never go
to jail because I'm not built for that
so I'm not gonna put myself in a
situation I could land me there like I
don't know like being around drugs I
don't like having anybody that that has
any drugs or anything like that around
me or even if you got violent
tendencies man and you'd like to be
getting into fights don't come around me
man I'm not trying to be going to a bar
and getting into fights with people and
also that's just how I am here man so
and one of the reasons to what I might
stop the the live videos because you
know everybody be like oh god the

really just the service it's the
internet service my my phone camera
galaxy and my phone is good man this
