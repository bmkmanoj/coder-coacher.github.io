cohdon face.com live from the creek
doing a little quick what the vamp is
lunch break today I woke up extra early
I was knocking out a whole bunch of
videos for my website coding phase calm
excuse me for an hour lack of throat so
yeah man we in here man I just want to
go over you guys like hit you it itches
whistle fire right up right it's my
little lunch break I had low a little if
you ever heard of this you know the
Mexicans know what this is Mexicans
and I was a Peruvian is they know about
this yo having toast it's pretty
legit stammering had that a couple of
bagels and yeah we in here live right
now man I want to see who ever got a
question or whatever I want to tell me
something let me know I'm here live
right now there's like one of those
moments where everybody be like man I
wish um I got to go on the live chat man
this is chance let me know hit me up man
I'm here live so let's check the the
live feed right now let's eat was online
right now see let's go to guys and see
them see what I what I what I went up to
check
yah hear me is a good good audio good
video dimelo flog the auto I'm dueling
what up Scotty what up
Barbara what up primitive without
Victoria what up Marty I'm matey MIT I
don't know a matey Murph the surf
without let me see who else is in here
fan productions fan productions I mean
have you seen my my website fan
production I have a course there where
is pretty much like I don't know if I
showed it to you guys let me see I
talked about media queries if you go in
here
oh dear face calm
it's called bill responsive web app
right here and pretty much I go over you
know css3 media queries because in
reality css3 media queries it's not that
difficult eyes it's very easy all you
gotta think about it is you have
different break points so I'm gonna say
you're off all right let's say I for
iPhone 5 I think is 320 or something
like that so let's say at 320 you wanna
give your page a certain styling right
like your fonts might be a a little bit
smaller or whatever it is right
then from 320 to let's say 700 that's
like a larger phone then I think like
768 and to like 900 something is tablet
and then after 909 60 and up you're
looking at a laptops and you're looking
at desktops so that's how you would do
like the breakpoints I mean you could
google it online a search for different
phones and different um
you know the best break point css3 media
queries break points you look that up
and different ages whatever your your
target audience is right like if your if
your target audience 99% of the time
it's gonna be on on an iPhone target the
iPhone if is
that's in between then then do something
where you say hey from 320 to 600 this
the stylus that we want you know that's
it
use percentages that's another than to
don't use fix don't use fix way for for
things use for sentences it's better to
say hey a hundred percent of this or
eighty percent of this you know use that
like that so it'll be easier that's how
I do my my responsive designer I
basically use percentages you know you
call so use flex boxes but flex boxes
and see says grid I don't find of it
because there's certain situations where
it would be faster for you to just do it
with percentages alright sometimes
people come up with with things like
let's say new new libraries new
frameworks whatever that is for me it
will take me more more time so go and
learn it and and get to and edit things
in a certain way and I can I say I have
bootstrap for it's hard to edit
something in bootstrap for then editing
in bootstrap 3 because of flex boxes and
the way how they Dakota everything so I
don't know me I'm not I'm not a huge fan
of flex boxes yet like I use flex boxes
for the situations like let's say I
wanna I want something to be vertically
aligned and horizontally aligned right
in the center I like to use flex boxes
for that but for my male oh and my
website I don't really use it for it let
me see
so what else what else any other
questions let me know I help you out I'm
here that's why I'm here right now this
month when I take my lunch break my
lunch break is like my gift to you guys
it's like now I have time to give it to
you guys directly on my life videos
right so yeah we here what up let me see
who else is in here web development
without Murph the surf says I've been
looking for looking at your courses on
I'm a beginner what course do you
suggest I'll take what I would do is
first of all sign up for the monthly
subscription because in reality it's a
better deal right in reality it's a way
better deal because of course you could
get through a course in a day or two
right so if you finish one course then
you could jump into the other course so
in reality if you go and you buy
separately you you basically pay for
just one course all right and then if
you finished it in a day or two then
that's it you're done all right now you
gotta go and buy another one now if you
have the subscription you go in and just
be like okay I've knocked it out in two
days I'll learn HTML CSS then from there
I'm gonna jump to the JavaScript all
right
then from there I'm gonna jump little
lerigot you can do all of that in one
morph you could take all the courses in
one month which is what I tell people
like you can literally go in there sign
up for a month knock everything now and
then if you want you could cancel it now
if you care about my channel you love
the concert that I make here you will
continue it and then the next month by
the end by the end of the month when I
still drop in more videos you still have
access to all the new videos you know
what I mean but I will say start with
the learn HTML CSS so start with this
one I will say start with where is that
kind of moved it to the bottom see this
one start with this on there HTML CSS by
building a cool social network right and
then from there jump to this build a
responsive web app right after you do
that then I will say jump in to
future-proof javascript and then after
that jump into this one laravel like a
boss I think I should really organize
this let me see let me set it up so in a
way where people could actually look at
it okay this one's not gonna take first
so let me
put in order all right let me see hold
on I'm going in the back so I could show
it to you guys okay
okay so we got learn HTML CSS then let's
say build a responsive web app they're
from their future proof JavaScript learn
HTML CSS then build a responsive web app
future proof JavaScript Larry like a
boss and then somewhere this week I'm
gonna start the jQuery the jQuery course
is gonna be super short because it's so
easy jQuery is so easy and so easy to
understand that it's gonna be short
probably gonna be like I don't know 10
15 videos each video is gonna be like 10
minutes so let me see what else I just
finished reordering it oh let me see
yeah so let me show you my screen yeah
so this how I basically tell people to
take it learn HTML CSS by building cool
social network build a responsive web
app future-proof JavaScript right then
Larry like a boss and then I'm gonna put
in jQuery which is gonna go here next
but definitely if you're gonna buy
something or you're gonna sign up for
something sign up for this get access
get all-access pass which is going to
give you access to every single course
here and everything that I create for
like forever right so if you buy a
lifetime the lifetime one if you pretty
much if you go through the link of our
web
like automatically you get 50% off of
everything here so this is 150 this is
$45 for the whole year and this is $10
for monthly I mean if if people really
want to take advantage will be like hey
I would just pay for the whole whole
year but okay I'm good for the whole
year right now if you never want to pay
anything else you will I hate I just
won't pay for the the one-time purchase
which is this one and then you have
access to all my courses forever you
know because we're gonna have all my all
the courses gonna be on you to me but
you know for you guys that know me from
YouTube like you guys get this dirt
cheap basically right the people that
find me on udemy.com they paying you
know like crazy prices like sometimes
I'm getting people who tell me that they
paid $30.00 for learn HTML CSS by me
they love in that course is getting a
lot of sales when it's catching up on
udemy but they don't know me like you
guys know me you guys know me from
YouTube so anybody that comes from
YouTube and they come to my website
automatically they get discounts now the
people that come from you know from
Google search or other websites that
that basically they're like affiliates
and send send people to my courses they
paying full price that's on them that's
out of my hands you know what I mean but
you found me on YouTube automatically
you get the super discounts but um yeah
let me say I mean keep on that answering
questions man give me questions guys
whatever questions you guys have let me
know or any suggestions you guys might
have about the courses I'm making or
what course you would like to for me to
have next that would be really good let
me see
want to start new coding Channel please
suggest if you want to start a new
coding channel man start ready
primitives have pretty much primitive
sorry
primitives said you know that you to me
my sequel V is because he got in the
description spear trashed
listen as I don't know primitive if you
know about if you don't know about this
right when I first got into you on you
to me those were the courses that I took
alright so when people the reason why I
still there even though to me the new
course that this guy came out with was
his name coal steel the new my single
course that he has is better than that
one but the reason why I still have it
there is because people constantly ask
me Joe what do you take to become a
developer so what I did was I put in all
the courses that I took that's it right
can there be a better course now yes the
my sequel if you really want to get into
my sequel go still has a very good my
sequel course which I made a review it's
on my channel I just haven't put it on
my description because the reason why
things are in my description is that
because I want to say hey guys go
promote this other people
is because people ask me what did you
take as a you know as a brand-new
self-taught developer like what do you
take so I just put that on the list you
know so I'm mindful if you didn't like
that one my fault you know it's not I
can't do nothing about it it definitely
did wonders for me I learned everything
that I needed for it you know do i code
in Java nope Andres I'll kosair how do I
break into the field very simple it's
very simple what you got to do is have
real projects
real websites and basically show off
your skills like that by having real
websites that you can explain to people
but I hate I built the whole front end
of this page and then it looks great
right
oh I created this animations and you
know the sliders and you know this
drop-down menus all of this stuff right
those are little things that you can
explain to people like hey I made this
whole page right now if you want to join
more to the the backend side you got a
half like a full-fledged website like
you have to have multiple full-fledged
websites meaning you got a half a
restaurant you got to have a social
network or a real estate have a
portfolio site like you gotta have
multiple things guys it's not just like
okay I have this and that's it you gotta
have multiple things um and you show off
your skills man you gotta show off that
if somebody hires you you can do the job
you can go and build something from
scratch like that's what's really
important for people and it's like they
tell you hey could you customize this
for me can you build this this custom
back-end
you'd be like yes I can do it for you
you know so that's how you break into
the feel man
different is just about applying to jobs
apply to a bunch of jobs and then you're
gonna get hired Kohl's PHP my seagull
caws no that's another thing to call
this really I'll be honest with you guys
there's really no good PHP course out
there in reality there's really no PHP
course that's really good
I'm being honest PHP is one of those
languages that it's just like everybody
does it different all you need to know
is just the basics if you want to become
like a PHP master and you're looking for
that course out there there's really not
a great course out there is
there's so much out there that
all the overflows from that
good little course that's out there I
haven't found one like and say hey this
is amazing like this one from Edwin Diaz
and I'm like I can't watch this
guy you don't know what the hell he's
doing he's like a mess you know what I
mean but also to understand I think he
said something like oh those courses are
old and that was in the beginning and I
understand too you know if it's even
like my first tutorials first courses
that I was making
they weren't that great but at the same
time it's like he's selling it me I
wasn't selling I'm putting
online for free you know what I mean
like he's selling it but that was the
problem when it comes to PHP it's hard
to find a really good one but for what
you need so become a PHP developer
that's why on my description I put that
that course there it's simple
it's easy and just straight to the put
it straight to the point
sorry let me see what else who else is
in here got your boy Robert Jones what
up Robert Jones says I started backwards
and no basic bootstrap but I'm leasing
I've been on a back end with Django and
Python I'll check your front-end courses
out yeah man check it out see what your
thing it's definitely gonna help you out
you know because that's one thing so
like I didn't want to go into anything
that I make I'm not going in there to
waste your time you know what I mean
like this courses that you take and
you're like man he is wasted three hours
of my time like show me the things that
I need to start building things
don't show me two hours of HTML
was built in 1992 like I don't give a
 I could Wikipedia
you know to me like that's how I am
right I'm more of a straightforward type
of person so that's what I give to
people you know I'm not trying to give
you hey this is what the description of
 of a method is it's like nah a
method is just a function right that's
it you know so it's like I keep things
very clear very simple and just teach
you the things that you need to get you
going all right thoughts on
Maui I mean I already said what I need
to say about bootcamps bootcamp SAR
closing down to nobody surprise because
number one they teaching old stuff they
don't you know change their their
curriculums you know like they got
comfortable at first they were they were
very trendy and like you know that will
come up with the latest technology
because they had just started but then
that curriculum they stretch it to like
you know five years and it's the same
curriculums it's like the internet keeps
changing frameworks keep changing people
are still talking about angular run in
their boot camps people are still
talking about like Ruby on Rails even
though Ruby on Rails is great but it's
not something that I will take $20,000
now in 2017 and go paying money for when
I could learn it online you know what I
mean like if I was to go to a boot camp
it has to be for a special reason it has
to be like hey I don't have no
motivation but I need a job and I want
to learn this because I need a job
that's the motivation for somebody that
wants to go to a pool care now if you
guys want to learn and get like yo I
have to motivation I really want to do
this you could do it by yourself you
don't need a bootcamp to hold your hand
you know you are sent a mail to you
about my subscription cancel let me see
cela Katonah yes a lot of people a lot
of people's accounts
that but it didn't cancel it wasn't like
cancel like you paid let's say you pay
for a year least yearly subscription or
you pay for the lifetime subscription in
your accounting account and got
cancelled what happened was I was using
the service from teachable calm right
and at first because I didn't even know
if this thing was gonna be profitable
whatever right so what I do I was I had
the the first month was just a free tier
that whole July right to see how it goes
right and then I said you know what I'm
gonna pay for the probe which is about a
hundred something a month all right so
I'll pay for that now I connected
directly to stripe and connect it
directly to PayPal which goes directly
to my bank account all right but the
people that have signed up in July there
and they signed up through teachable
their thing got cancelled it got
cancelled but all you have to do is just
read put your credit card in you you
haven't gotten charged right you got
charged your $5 that first month and
then from there you think I'll cancel
because I cancelled using their service
so now I'm using my own service my own
separate service is like that's why I'm
paying pro because in reality like look
you were paying five dollars out of it
right you would pay five dollars and
then their fees were like three dollars
right so you know what I mean like
literally out of everybody that paid
four dollars I mean two dollars that
whole month so in reality I wasn't like
making so then I had to pay for the
pro to put in my own API call to stripe
and then it would be more it would be
more profitable you know cuz even though
I still gotta pay a fee which is
probably you know credit card processing
fee but it's less than
than what I was gonna be paying I was
paying $3 and now I'm paying like a
dollar and thirty cents you know what I
mean so and that's what I tell people is
like hey this is really to motivate you
guys you know to really motivate you
guys to really go hard and learn this
because in reality all I want to do is
help you guys out that's my sole goal
this whole
just to help you guys get in this and
you know just some some day you
become a successful developer just be
like yo man I remember this kid
crazy-ass kid from YouTube and his name
was coding phase right that's all I want
right and then yeah because it's like at
$3 a pop I'm not gonna become a
millionaire that's like I tell people's
like $3 a pop I was not gonna
become a millionaire and then like now
after the first month whoever signed up
in the first month had the best deal cuz
it was like $5 real quick and then now
we basically put it I think is it's $20
per month if you use the code if you
came directly from YouTube where it says
right here on my description it says
from YouTube let me see me share it sort
of people because sometimes people come
in here and they're brand-new and they
don't know and then if you came from
YouTube you should be checking out my
descriptions man like you see the
description right here if you click on
this it says 50% off code from YouTube
that's the name of the code if you click
on that that's going to send you to my
website and it's automatically going to
give you that 50% off so it's ten
dollars forty four hours and $150 right
so if you're from you two always come
back to the description man always come
back even when you bout to buy something
on udemy come back and use the
description the links of my descriptions
because they're going to give you
discounts when you go out of your own
way be like oh I'm just gonna go to the
website coding phase com directly if
you're coming from you
you're not if you're not coming from
YouTube you're not gonna get that
discount now if you come from you - you
get the discount all right so it's that
simple yeah cuz I I have two different
crowds man I you know I'm very
transparent with you guys I'm very open
I'll tell you guys exactly how much I
make and how much I don't make you know
what I mean and very transparent like
this is a big line right the people from
YouTube which is you guys that come here
yeah pretty much get discounts on
everything no matter what right the yeah
family other people I hang out with the
other people that I talk to on the daily
I create videos for you guys right at
the same time it's like if you are
support me and yeah I wanna learn
something that I might have then you
will support the website code offense
calm or if you seonyoudo mean you buy
from you to me right if you see your boy
out there like this like in the front
page like yo you know is your boy Joe
right so I got that fire but you always
get that discount now this other peoples
that might find me from advertising that
might find me from advertising from you
to me or they might see me from a
facebook advertising they might see me
from YouTube advertising those people
they didn't find me through my my
website or my YouTube right so they pay
the full price you know what I mean like
and even if you're a new subscriber and
you came from that that route it's like
different funnels right follow from
YouTube always gets discount those are
like my fan base those lot of people
that are really really far away and then
the people that come from everywhere
else you know it's like something that I
gotta apologize for it's like you know
you just gotta pay for the full full
price you know it's just how it is you
know because well if you follow me
somewhere else it means I paid for the
advertising there so when you come in
and even I hate I'm gonna pay ten
dollars I'm gonna pay twenty dollars on
this guy's website in reality for me to
for you to find
I had to pay five dollars in advertising
for every single person I'm paying like
five dollars four dollars or something
like that that's how I calculate it
sometimes even less but in reality it's
like father so I had to pay for you to
find me so you know so I do apologize
and like that said bringing back the
people that find me from YouTube yeah
good I don't pay anything for
this you know I mean so it's like
that's why you get always discounts but
everybody else is like I'm paying for it
I'm paying for you to find me other
other places you know let me see uh yeah
I'm just trying to be transparent guys
you know I like to just tell you guys
what the hell I'm doing I don't want to
be like I wish people were more
transparent it's like you know what it
means like sometimes like you were like
oh I'm trying to help out this on this
channel I want to support this channel
but this channel is making like you know
a freaking 30 40 grand a month you know
what I mean like doesn't give nothing
back to nobody and doesn't help anybody
out like to me I would get pissed off
that's what I get pissed off with people
when they they just kick in it
so much and then it's like bro you
 making like a hundred grand per
month on on your website or your YouTube
and you don't give nothing back to
nobody you know what I mean like and
then you expect people to support you
like you're already making enough money
like you know me I don't make from
this but it's good it's good thing cuz
at least I get to help out other people
or I give out free courses to people to
it and little things like that looks
like just the other day I sent somebody
300 bucks so you could buy a laptop like
those are the things that I do on the
side with the money that I get from this
 you know so it's not even like I'm
over here I don't know
Bill Gates and I can donate a whole
bunch of but what I can donate I
give it out
let me see oh hey Joe have you got your
steamer going yet I try to find you yeah
I'm trying to get in it it's just so
hard because it's like I have to post a
video here on YouTube then go and post
it on Steam me then it's like then
people find me over there and that's not
but I'm there if you find coding you go
to coding phase and you put coding phase
together like the two words then you're
gonna fire me I'm there it's just hard
it's hard for me I'm thinking about
hiring like and Michael is a virtual
assistant I was telling my my wifey that
she should help me out but she don't
wanna do you don't wanted
to say when it comes to this like I
think the baby is enough work for her
but I'm thinking about finding a virtual
assistant I don't know I was gonna reach
out to Matt maybe he will like to help
me out and you know I pay him depending
how many posts I do or whatever I just
I'm I'm looking to find like a team you
know what I mean I don't know if if any
of you guys really would like to be part
of this coding phase calm and just how
about like number one I can you know pay
you guys some money you know I know a
lot of people that watch me are from
other countries I can't pay a lot of
money but you know something like let's
say a hundred dollars per week you know
$400 per week or $150 per week force
maybe let's say five hours a week of
work you know it's not bad that's like
twenty thousand hours I'm sure like that
you know if any of you guys wanna help
out let me know I mean we'll see what we
can do because it's like I need help i
need help with number one like just with
different platforms like i can't do
everything like I want to post a
facebook I want to post
so I want to post a facebook I want to
post to Twitter I want to post to
already I want to post on all the major
social media but I can't do it by myself
because I have to make the videos I have
to record videos for YouTube I have to
create the courses I have to go to work
every single day 9:00 to 5:00
so there's so many things that I want to
do but I can't do it at the same time so
it's like I need the extra hand
but yeah any other questions man let me
see the Missy John turtle said thanks
for showing us the prices seems very
reasonable yeah you know it's like a
reality I tell people men just sign up
you either sign up for a subscription or
buy the yearly like this is breaking it
down when you break it down you think
about it like this automatically you
guys get half of everything right if you
sign up for the subscription per month
is $10 right if you sign up for a yearly
you get I think the course it's like a
44 hours I think this is get all the
courses right um I believe is $45 let me
check I gotta do the math exactly but I
just know that if you buy the yearly you
get so much more for your money right so
let's say okay so the yearly cost $45
right
so that means when you're gonna pay
let's say five months all right you
could literally just say hey I'm gonna
just get the whole year $45 now the
one-time purchase is just like hey I
paid off let's say a year a year and a
half off and then I really just took
care of it forever like I don't have to
ever pay anymore because I'm not
gonna stop making courses
I'm not gonna stop making tutorials like
this forever like this the that I'm
gonna be doing forever
and as new technologies come up I'm
always gonna create new ones so in
reality if you just went and paid for
the lifetime you just got the best deal
cuz it's like for every that's it you
don't have to pay any more and you get
access to everything because even got
you to me like I love you to me too I
wish they had a model like that like
what you will pay monthly because in
reality is like this times that I go
through a course like if I have a good
weekend where I have nothing else to do
I could go through a whole course and
learn it in a weekend in two days right
but then I want to continue learning
more stuff but then now I gotta buy more
courses so every time I buy a course is
ten dollars ten dollars and dollars it
adds up now I would rather say hey I'm
gonna pay fifty dollars or thirty
dollars a month from you to me to give
me access to everything I would do that
 you know what I mean cuz I
I love learning I love learning new
programming languages I love learning I
mean frameworks so if they had a 30 $40
$50 package that would just give me like
Netflix unlimited everything I would do
it and it's like the same thing I'll
tell you guys you guys have the ghetto
access past gives you unlimited to
everything you could watch everything in
a few seconds now a few seconds a few
days you can literally go through the
whole course let me see any other
questions man let me know Python for
what development Python for what
development I don't know guys people
talk about Python and like people love
Python there I kind of like Python too
but I just don't see the jobs I don't
see the jobs I see jobs in a like you
know the scientific community I don't
see it in the web development like web
development you could be John small
right it could be Johnson
John smoke right and John smoke comes
through and says hey yesterday I used to
work in the ball today I want to become
a developer I want to become a web
developer you could get a job right
but John Schmo who used to work at the
mall can't just get up one day and say
hey I want to be a data scientist nobody
liked those jobs is not for you they're
not gonna hire you so it's like even
when I look at Udacity in a lot of other
places but they'd be like Oh Laurie
Python learn this in there is like okay
do you think you're gonna find a job for
Python as a developer with no
college degree I don't think so I'm
being honest like those jobs they're
very demanding they require certain math
levels that most people don't have you
know what I mean like I want to count
the highest math that I got was calculus
- that's it and then once I got to that
I was like I barely passed I got like a
 79 I was like this she I'm not
touching this ever again and I'm
not into it I didn't want to go to
linear equations I don't want to do all
that extra cuz it wasn't what I
really wanted to know about I don't care
about math why carabao is website same I
have phone applications like like
that that's why I like you know what I
mean so Python I can't recommend it I'm
being honest it's good to know it just
in case for whatever reason but I can't
recommend it for people hey joke he
talked about being obsessed with
learning versus building a portfolio yes
that's very important sometimes we fall
into this trap of learning and learning
and learning and learning and learning
and learning and trying to learn
everything that's under the Sun a new
framework came out you trying to learn
it somebody comes in and be like
hey guys this is the fastest thing
you guys got a learning now you gotta
learn that guys don't fall into that
trap learn two things are they are going
to guarantee you to get a job number one
you're not angular number two you got
react right those two things you know
those two things you got a guarantee job
number three my sequel number four PHP
those are the things that are guaranteed
they're going to give you a job I'm not
talking about which one other cool is
which one are the fastest which are are
the latest I'm talking about things that
are gonna put money in your pocket and
get you hired right and like I said
before you do it free coke am and
spending hours and hours and hours and
hours and hours building little
trinkets or little cool for Coke
pen and be like oh look at this
animation look at this hamburger divide
into three pieces and join together and
become into one and shows your hamburger
I don't care about that you know why
because those things are not gonna get
you hired at all unless you go to like a
digital agency where they looking for
animation and cool stuff like that but
the reality of things is guys those jobs
are like those are like
wish list type jobs you know what I mean
there's jobs out there that all you have
to do is just to let's say an example
animations or all you have to do is
clean up the UI like let's say somebody
and that works at the New York Times
right there is a division of them who
just works on on the font size or line
height just making look readable or
just work on accessibility but those
jobs are wish list
that's not what's really going on in the
world that's not what the type of jobs
that you're gonna find right away those
are like things that every other
developer it's like something has remote
jobs every other developer in the world
wants a remote job so in
you're not only just competing with you
know Johnny and John small right
you're competing with like the
best sort of best and guys who have 5
years 7 years 10 years you know what I
mean like those are the guys that you're
gonna be competing with when you're
looking for a remote job
those are wishlist so you know when you
come here every night
I just want to learn keep learning keep
learning yes it's cool to keep learning
but it's cool to keep learning once you
have a job if you don't have a job yet
as a web developer your goal should be
not learning to learn it or just to
keep on buying courses it's to say hey
what's going to basically guide me to
make sure I get a job in the next month
or the next two months you know what I
mean so yeah that was a good question
Jones and like I say you got to start
building your portfolio don't waste your
time building little trinkets and little
 for free coke campaign and
 a whole bunch of the
websites that's out there start building
real websites start coming in look at
drag we'll find a good design that you
like build a website you know inspired
by that design let me see el-hadji know
Hadji Baca Baca I don't know you guys
got some crazy long names okay hello Joe
how do you decide to take a new
technology for example when you decide
to learn a JavaScript framework how do
you decide which one to learn with all
the technologies out there how well to
me like I just said right now the
frameworks that people need to be
learning if you don't have a job if you
don't have a job you need to learn
either angular or react right now that's
what the first thing automatically now
once you have a job then you learn the
things that are going to make you happy
meaning hey if you're gonna come home
after working eight hours nine hours of
coal
and your eyes hurt what is it that's
going to make you happy when you come
home to work on when you get home like
for me I've been working on hyper rap
like I've been working on this thing
here I'm gonna show you guys a little
something called pen that I oh okay let
me go to my pens my public pens recent
oh my god what the hell are my pens let
me see hey what are those things
let me see I'm trying to sing the one
that I created I don't know why it's not
here
well let's go back to this one like this
just a regular duet so this is what I've
been learning and I'm looking to teach
it to you guys which is hyper app is
based on Elm but it's just regular
JavaScript you can just do it with JSX
you could use JSX which is HTML tags
inside of JavaScript or if you want it
you don't even have to use babel like
right now this is using babel but it's
so simple that you could just do it with
like vanilla JavaScript it's a pretty
fast framework like let me see see if
pops up super quick
like you ask something and pops it up
Matt quick like it's only one kilobyte
like literally only one kilobyte the
whole framework and it's very similar to
react this very similar to to Elm but
it's pretty cool it's challenging
because it's more about functional
programming so for me it's challenging
me to to like learning things yeah new
paradigm in a new way of doing things so
that's what's making me happy right so
that's how I really figure it out and
and when I come home that's how I decide
hey I want to learn this new framework
if it makes me happy or it makes me
intrigued on on the technology and how
it works
Plus sometimes the community like I left
the question
I left the question let me see where is
it github slash hyper app I came here
let me see where is a hyper app I came I
dropped him in issues right and then
what I did was a Missy filters your
issues and closed so yeah so I asked the
question automatically people came in
and gave me so I came here hi Brad oops
I came here left the question and they
basically helped me out you know I'm
also talking to the creator of hyper app
because I'm ago I'm gonna do an
interview on him well interview with him
just talk to him find out how he's doing
you know he lives in Japan which is
super cool and like he created this
amazing
framework and like people help me out
like you know I don't I don't know
everything under the Sun guys and like
I'm very happy to say that you know I'm
just like you guys like in certain
situations I'm a noob - you know what I
mean like they helped me out because I
wanted to know how do you pass you know
pass the state between multiple
components so you have one component
here and one component here how do I
make it - to have the same state with
hyper app because I was trying to treat
this like it was react but it's not like
react it only has one state so the state
they can't have multiple states like and
react every component has its own state
and this only one has a state all right
so you see here where I save our state
equals count 10 so automatically
they're both sharing this they both
sharing the number 10 so if I say add a
number to the state on the count right
it's s 11 so this was also reading the
state here and it adds it to that one -
I mean if that makes sense I got a I
don't know a tutorial on it
so you guys can really understand it
it's a little bit more complicated and
then just like regular JavaScript but
it's super fun let me see what else
yes python is more for data science than
like Robert Jones thanks bro I
appreciate it I really do yeah let me
see hey how do you get from oh how do
you get fun awesome to use their icons
to use on your website how do you get
fun us and to use their out how do you
get font awesome to use their their
icons to use on a website kind of
confused on the process very simple you
search online for font awesome CDN
that's it that was the say a Harrison
without what I would up kam what up yeah
keep sending me questions man sorry I'm
late this is for the people for the
people on usually yeah cosiness the
Jones is like yo please answer the
questions Joe that's why we here in
other words this is a hidden text that
says here you guys maybe you can't see
it because there's the font is white but
she also said what the I ain't
trying to hear the same now she did not
say that now but I answer your question
right it's just I'm reading the stuff
late you know what I mean I'm BRE I have
to go through everything and answer it
as I go you know I'm looking at this and
then I'm scrolling down and then you see
Python matlab's
are using universities teach students
exactly
let me see yo can you take a look at my
portfolio and its infancy send it to me
Zachary George I'll look at it
lamp stack is definitely easier to get
set up
yes sir super easy okay so let's look at
Zachary George portfolio Ton Ton Ton and
the Jones don't be mad because this this
is what happens
sorry buddy done tanta okay let me see
but PHP is otech ambition just to let
you know everything is old tech
javascript is old everything is old
Python is old if you want to really
really really want to be on the top of
the gaming and be like hey I'm on the
latest and greatest well you got hyper
app which is the literally the fastest
framework out there period right so you
could go to hyper app jes org the
fastest framework one kilobyte all right
super fast
that's one then you have crystal Ling
right if you really want to be on top of
the game and be like hey I'm on the
latest and fastest thing out there well
also those are the two things that are
super fast right now
all right now when you talk about PHP oh
but everything else is old you know I
mean like everything out there is old so
it's like when somebody come in and be
like oh this is the newest thing is like
man they still working on all technology
we all are and that's just how it's
gonna be you know what I mean like it
takes a really long time for anything
that's new to pick up you know even
typescript people are talking about
typescript right now I'm like typescript
is old typescript Dart Jas is
old they're both old they've been around
for a long time it's just now
everybody's jumping on it but they've
been around for a while you know what I
mean so everything is also PHP it can be
old but it guarantees you a job no
matter where you go in the world period
let me see what else let me see Barbara
Barbara Barbara what up MA
okay Joe I gotta go
please keep this in mind keep this video
alignment gotta leave so yes I'm keeping
the video online you're gonna find the
day on my channel it's fine if you can't
be here right now it's fine you'll come
back to it let me see so I'm still
reading arey P is like ha ha ha ha ha ha
[Laughter]
okay let me see what up in the
JavaScript frameworks cold unsafe wishes
data right yep you boy everything here
what up how much time did it take you to
learn Redux I'm having a hard time
learning it yes you want me to tell you
the truth six months and I'm gonna bring
my camera back again yes it's looking
six months - really really really really
understand Redux because number one I
have no idea about what I had no idea
about functional programming I had no
idea about immutable data like I didn't
know about none of these concepts it's
like all I know is just the front end
right and that's where I'm I basically
come in thinking like that and what's in
the front JavaScript
is object-oriented programming so in my
head everything is objects and that's
how I think of everything even now when
I'm learning something else I still
think of it like oh like did is like an
object like somebody tells me about 2.0
yet so lose like an object or if
somebody tells me about what else like a
list in immutable data I'm also this is
like an object - this is like an array
when a reality is now so it's different
concepts they sort of look alike but
they're totally different so yeah man it
took me a while to get comfortable now
do you need to be a master of Redux no
because all you have to know is what
happens think about it like this think
of it there's a boy right this button
has an action and action is just a
function when you click on that function
matter facts man I'm going in I'm going
in hold on give me a second I'm going
I'm gonna explain this in a real dummy
way but in a way that anybody's gonna be
able to understand how Redux
works all right I'm gonna show it to you
guys right now let me see I'm trying to
look good gonna okay let me see all
right okay so this is your component
right think of it there's a button on
the page that button gets clicked right
it triggers the function that's an
action right so you have that action
then that action goes to goes to the
reducer I don't know why yeah that's why
it showed it like that it goes to the
reducer the reducer is it's just a
big-ass object right it's just a big-ass
object
where you have all your data right you
basically go in there it changes it's a
switch it's a soy statement right that
switch statement changes the data then
it comes back down and now that becomes
the store and then the store changed so
now this component has to re-render
depending on on what happened all right
now I want to show you this I'm gonna
save you so much time right now from
like all the of like react I'm
gonna save you so much time so you go
understand it okay so this there's a
component from whole art resources
assets this my my jobs website right so
there's one component and let me see and
try to find one lens apps and let me try
try this one
let me see containers let me look for
gender where it's the gender I just come
see where is a component gender right
okay let's think about it like this this
right here is a Tryon tool it's a tool
to basically try on something well
forget about that think about it like
this there's three buttons on the page
the story bar is on a page that you
choose either you're a male female or
your kid right when the person clicks on
this they click on that boy right that
button it goes here since okay there is
a function that we're adding it says
this I choose gender so
this is going to trigger this function
that's here so it that Bart got click
the person chose what gender was so it
shows men right it shows a man now the
action is this select a PD action so for
every single one if it's a male is 62
if it's a woman's 58 as a child is 54
alright so when they click here they
click on that select on the gender they
click on the button then the barring
comes here and then here we basically
click on the action so we select the 62
right automatically when we clicked on
that action what we really did was click
on this on this function which is the
action right now because we selected
that we bring down through here through
this function the number 62 so now we're
UCPD it means 62 right so you have PD
here which is a console log that's for
me to know what what we got right
selected PD will succeed too and then
return return select PD pelo
PD well payload is 62 so the name of the
the action is called select PD and then
the the data that's being transferred is
called PD all right now when we do that
what happens is this right here reducers
it comes here to the reducers it comes
into the reducer and then it combines
them if you have multiple reducers that
combines them right now forget about
this what's important is global state
because this is where it changes changes
the data so down here we import the
action there's a let me see where is a
select
you see this select predict got imported
right now when we click when we clicked
on the action right we click select PD
it came through it came through through
here on the switch statement
there's your initial data and then your
initial data is all this object here so
now through here it passes this down the
action comes through and then here the
action that we we chose which was the
button that we we chose which is on on a
gender and that gender became select PD
and then from select VD it also passed
down 62 so it says what's the action
type the action type is the Select PD
which is this so this is a switch
statement so it shows this right now
because it shows that what a day was it
comes here takes the original data from
the website and changes the property
that says actual PD and basically puts
here action payload which was the 62 now
this day gets sent back to the main
store which is let's say let's say this
one right try and preview it passes down
the store to here and then now on on
this component where's the gender on
this component now whatever that that
data was being used wherever needed the
actual PD re renders it so now every
component on the page has that
information so like let's say if
somewhere in the page you decided to put
it in something like this show a pop up
if the actual PD is greater than 54 then
what happens is now that pop up shows up
if
is less than 54 it wouldn't show up and
the page wouldn't render wouldn't do
anything alright so I don't know I hope
I saved you some time and you kind of
understand it but yeah man is just think
about it like this your current state
you have the reducer the reducer is just
a switch statement and that switch
statement sends out a new state for all
the components that simple and I know
you're probably like what like what the
hell that just happened but yeah man
that's why when you're react developer
you get paid a lot of money because it's
not that easy it took me a while so give
me 6 months to understand react with
Redux like react by itself is simple but
nor react with Redux because you only
need Redux when you doing a big
application that depends on on a state
that's it if you're gonna do it like a
little drop-down menu
you don't need that you don't need
Redux you could just do it with the
local state of the component but that's
why people get paid a lot it seems
difficult right now because it is
difficult but with time the more that
you practice it you know you you know I
mean you know what I mean like it just
takes time let me see yes the Jones I
know I know you plain complain - I'm
joking
I'm thinking of buying a computer
science textbook do I need to know
computer science to be professional
whatever no no you don't at all if you
really want to get into computer science
look it up
look up this right here let me see
computer science MIT course take this
learn this it's like you you're watching
an hour right
you will learn you will learn so much
 from like the free open-source
courses that mit has that's if you want
to learn more things than just
programming you know like websites and
 like that if you really enjoy
learning and expanding your mind then
take the courses from MIT you know you
learn from the best and they're free but
like I said they they're gonna be mostly
dairy and that you know in reality
they're not gonna get your job word the
missing Zachary George let me say ok
thanks ok ok I'm sort of missing let's
take this and do HTTP now it doesn't
work your website is not working for me
I don't know send it to me in my email
coding face at gmail.com I'll check it
out
just wonder why do you call yourself J
on your portfolio social media oh
because that's how you know that's how
my daddies call me now is that my boys
call me is like your name is Joe there's
so many Joe's out there so there's like
yo J what up nothing you know what I
mean wouldn't all that be easier using
two-way bindings um no I mean maybe
it'll be easier but this a bunch of
 problems with that there's a
whole bunch of bugs if you I don't know
I wish in I don't know how if you ever
use angular one or I don't know how even
even if you they're stirring in certain
things of you there's two way binding
all that brings you a whole bunch
of problems like people make things
easier look easier when they're like oh
yeah you can just say V bind is and V
bind that real quick and everything is
fine yes you can do that but that's only
cool with like small applications once
you start getting to like those large
applications like let's say Zillow right
i'ma show you right now oh
let me see let's go to zillow.com okay
this whole page is built on we're gonna
look at this oops closed hold on alright
we're gonna look at this and this page
is built on it says Amazon CloudFront
Google Analytics Google Fonts alright
now let's come here let's say
I want to look for something one one
seven four seven alright now I'm gonna
show you so this my neighborhood right
all right
so we here my neighborhood right now the
cheapest house here is 350 which is like
the little tiny shape that you could
barely fit anything there now let's come
here and not put no minimum our max a so
let's see big sales again all of the
stuff is done with react now how do you
manage all these different states like
state of adding that so the favorite
states of you know changing this the
price here are changing what type is a
if his apartments of his condos
townhouse how do you manage all of this
 like it's extremely difficult to
manage this shape right so the only way
if you also do this a two-way binding
this whole website will be a
mess
alright but the reason that it works so
good is because everything is being done
with react and redux so let me see if I
could maybe go into the respect let me
see
see you can see this right here
that's how you know react is being used
on the page all right now all of this is
being done by my react and the
only way to to really manage other
is with free ducks you can't manage all
the state like if the user logs in what
happens right if the user comes in and
in changes the listen type like
all of the stuff needs to get tracked
somehow so the way how you do is you put
inside of an object right and then every
time that an object well a property
changes on the object the page
re-renders but not everything on the
page right so like let's say right here
if I was to come here and say hey I want
to take out all the potential listings
all the things that's gonna change this
gonna rerender is this in the map that's
a nothing here we render nothing here we
render nothing here we render only this
area in this area because those are the
only two places that are depending on
that data to be a certain way so when we
changed it it went to the reducer a
change it took the old object that used
to have the state and then took that
change the creative oil Creator a new
object it didn't change the original one
it created a new object and then after
creating the new object it changed the
property in that new object and then
returned back the state for the
components to know that hey you got a
rerender if you also do this with
two-way binding this whole thing becomes
a so that's why people
don't want to use two-way binding
anymore so way binding is dead that
is like it's for people that want that
in their head they thinking oh I want
things to be easier yes it can be easier
but
if you've ever worked in big projects
you know how difficult it is to maintain
- because then everybody on the on the
website who I was working on the website
needs to think in their head what will
happen if somebody changes this data
here like where does it affect it
throughout the whole website right
that's what two-way data-binding means
it's constantly flows like that in and
out in and out in and out but when you
have something like Redux Redux says hey
you can only do one action at a time
meaning you chose one thing something
changed it came back and returned back
the data it's not a back and forth you
know so if that makes sense all right
let me see what else any other questions
guys before I leave scottie rocks was
like that simple huh yeah it's
hard man it's not it's not that easy man
another thing too is once you create a
boilerplate for like react like you
always use the same boilerplate because
it will really be annoying to have to
write down all of the like
everything from scratch right it could
take you like me building the the react
bundler like wet pack and setting
everything up on mine my company's
website took me two days that was two
days of full of eight hours so meaning
it took 16 hours to build all of that
 so you know once you build a
boilerplate and you say hey this is how
we gonna run with it all you got to do
is always copy the same the same
components because if you wants to take
that down it's gonna take you hours
and hours and hours like it just takes
time
yeah just take your time with redux it's
gonna take you a long time man because
even when you follow I don't know
Prince are you taking the course from
react and redux from Stephen Ryder if
you are then you're doing the right
thing because he explains in a very easy
way but even what he teaches you is not
really the how is done in production
right because it gets more difficult and
more complex and he gives you a very
good introduction and then once you have
work then you will learn everything else
you know you can't teach those things
online it's like you only learn that or
with experience you know but trust me
man it's definitely worth at the end
now let me see what else what else man
Missy I'm reading through everybody's
messages any other questions any
questions guys I'm about to leave soon I
gave you guys why gave yeah Wow I gave
you an hour in 20 minutes we've been
here live at Erie sweat I said when are
you switching jobs to the city I don't
know I'll be honest I thought I was like
this week I was like really stressed out
but I want to see what happens you know
I mean I'm in a crossroads of like let's
see how it goes
cuz I'll be honest this company I've
never been this stressed out in my life
and all the years I've been working for
web development because um naturally I
always get stressed out because that's
how I am but I've never been in all the
crazy that I've been in this
company and all the crazy projects that
I've been working on I've never been
this stressed out ever in my whole life
so like I told the owner Mike hey man
I'm just gonna I'm gonna try to do this
let's see how it goes man I told her man
I need a week of vacation as soon as
possible because that's another thing
too like my other partner he took his
vacation which to me sounds
crazy okay he went we went through like
a whole bunch of over the whole
year I like fixing the website building
up a new website transferring everything
over a home like a million bugs and it
was just us two and like another guy
remotely and that's it so we did
everything on that website and
like he was already stressed out he was
already dark in out I was darking out
and they'll be days I'm like man I don't
know how
 come in to worry this days that
I still go late to work cuz I'm like I
really do not want to go into work
there's never a good day that's never
like a good day where I'll be like all
gray today is gonna be an amazing day
today we're gonna work on something cool
now it's been just building a whole
bunch of rebuilding a whole bunch of
 that's super complicated super
boring a million bucks so you
know what I mean so now we're gonna
release this new redesign which I'll be
honest I'm scary now because
number one I'm the only one who's gonna
be able to handle this number two
the other there might be two other
people are coming in but they're
beginners you know what I mean like when
 goes bad who is the whole company
this company has like 200 people who are
200 people going to be looking at to get
 done and get fixed me all right not
nobody else not anybody else help me now
 is just gonna be me right so I
got a answer to 200 people who
are waiting if something happens
on the website in people things are not
working so that does make me scare
that just because how how
difficult and complicated this website
is if it was just a regular website like
our ecommerce cool fine I don't even
 worry about it
but there's so many and so many
different variables that could go wrong
and then everybody's gonna be
looking at me when goes wrong
everybody's gonna look at me like hey
could you find the answer and I
don't know about you guys one of the
worst things to do is be having to find
an answer to a difficult problem with
 200 people in your shoulder like
this can you fix this you know you can't
it's stressful you know what I
mean so that I don't know I don't know
if I'm gonna go anywhere I'm just gonna
continue gonna work continue working on
what I'm doing
and that's why I also to need your
support man that's why I've been like
promoting so much my website calling
face.com
like in reality I'm not looking to
become a millionaire I'm looking to be
doing this full-time right or even
if I was to do it part-time and just
help people out and create courses all
the time like I'll be fine like I don't
need to be in extravagant lifestyle and
this and dying and buy this and I have
money all the time now I don't even care
about that no more I'm looking for
the happiness that things that make me
happy is when I come into YouTube when I
hang out with my family those are the
only two things that make me happy
um maybe I feel like this job they burn
me out the other K who was working with
me he he got burnt out that's why he
went somewhere else where oh he's gonna
be working on is selling bracelets
like they sell bracelets like you know
how easy that job is to build a
website to sell one thing like you know
what I mean like us we sell glasses and
and I hope unjust that's difficult
you know so I don't know if I'm gonna be
there forever I'm just gonna be there
until I can't take anymore you know and
that's what so you guys you know support
the channel when you see a course by I
haven't spent no money at all from
anything that I've heard
just because I'm saving it for those
days that I might not be working at that
company anymore there might be a day
where I say I can't take it I got a
leave I'm and then what am I gonna do go
 find another job and do the
whole process which I can do but I'm
gonna try when that day comes I'm gonna
try to just do YouTube and you to me
full-time well go is it going to be good
for me I don't know you know but yeah
man that's why that's where I'm at right
now you know that's what I tell people
you know if you enjoy the content here
imagine what I can do when I just do
this full-time when I come in and
create I really you know this times I
want to create even way better tutorials
like I see traversing media I see
even the videos that John Simon's does
like they do a lot of counseling a lot
of because chef for the people
here on YouTube for free but I because
they do the shift full-time you know
that means me I do a full-time job super
stressful got a family and then I come
home and I can only give you guys an
hour two hours in there so I'm trying to
switch it up man if this job doesn't
work out things doesn't go as planned
then I hope that you guys help me out
just support the channel that's it you
know I'm not saying that hey I'm gonna
be homeless it is now I got
 savings and I'm gonna be good but
at the same time man I don't want to
jump to another job I want to give this
 a chance I want to give this at
least six months I'm gonna give six
months to YouTube and see what happens
can we take it to the next level of like
me creating content for you guys
constantly right meaning like magic I
come here and do like treat this
like a real job where I come in drop two
tutorials a day to advise videos in one
live video five videos a day man like
that's how I would treat this like
it's full-time if I was full-time you
know what I mean but let's see what
happens you know me and my Scottie say
wow this is over my head at this point
when we were still gonna bar react man
man you got to learn it trust me man
yep if you buy a mac book online man use
you going man
what does buying this
alright this is my last thing my last
thing before I leave I'm explaining let
me see can I explain it in two seconds
let me see where's the Google hangout
okay I'm gonna give you a very good
example oh okay so we here right now you
see this this what I say here is I
created a class right in this class is
really just a function right so what I
do here is the first thing that this
function is going to declare is the
state and it's going to say this that
choose gender equals to this that choose
gender that bind this so wherever I say
this that choose gender is going to mean
I'm talking about this class which in
reality is a function right I'm talking
about this function right so when I say
let's say an example come here and I say
this choose gender right but I use it I
use it inside of render when I use it
inside of render is going to give me an
error it's going to give me an error
because when I say this is looking at
this inside of this function
all right so it's looking inside of that
function it's not looking outside of it
I don't know if let me see maybe I could
bring it out see if we have time real
quick let me create a new one okay
cocaine let's do this
create new pen right so I got this and
say far let's say Class C bar out class
okay just what I have I love it I just
named it like that whatever right that's
an object right if I come here and I put
in something like this funk now say
function function and I'll say console
its funk and I come here and I say let's
see another one
RT that's a function function and I say
say for example
it's a log party okay
 I'm here and then I say style class
dot funk see what that does
it comes along this funk all right now
if I say this party see there's that
party oops okay I say this that party
console.log that it says this party
right now
 common side of of this and I say I
create a function say var inside it's a
function and I say this dot and then I
come and I say let's say this tie front
what happens mostly clear let me save
this
okay let's the party let me come to the
expect console.log Missy and let me see
put in something like this is that party
cause a log
okay now let me see here we say inside I
think I see this stuff honking is it's
not a function so the reason is because
right here we lost that that information
we lost the best the dislocation see how
we had it over here it was working
before and everything was fine but this
that funk the moment that we put it
inside of another function the moment we
used it inside of this of the inside
function we lost that this location
right but if we were to bind it let's
say something like is that func equals
to this that func a bind this now it
works there's no errors so what we did
here was we binded the disk keyword to
be with this this class well I'm
simulating a class simulating that I
have access to that this whenever I say
this I'm talking about anything that's
inside of this object right well because
we put it inside of and start off here
inside of this this function
and it gives us issues I see hung on
this phone undefined it's hard to
explain there's like one of those things
where you have to really like set it
down and it's more about functions and
how this keyword works it's hard to
explain it right now to have my mind set
on this thing it's really hard to
explain it let me see
look at this I'm sorry what the hell are
you talking about
javascript is a shortcut for machine
called JavaScript it's not a real
programmer okay so what's a real
programmer milk stars would up spending
many months oh I'm out of here guys well
all you really have to think about it
I'll be Brian research this keyword in
JavaScript nothing
you know there's another one that's for
constructor but think about it it's just
very simple man whenever you see that
the dist they stopped buying you know
this that whatever bind this all you're
saying is binder this keyword to the
class don't bind it to the function
that's it
it's like technically it will always
bind to that function that you're trying
to put whatever code inside of it but if
you want to say hey I want to bind this
to the parent div so then that's what
that's what's really happening it's
nothing too crazy you know coding
face.com guys I'm out of here man I'm
tired I'm hungry I'm I gotta
cook I gotta clean I gotta watch
