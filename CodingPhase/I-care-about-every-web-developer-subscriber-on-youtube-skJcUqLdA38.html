back at it again man listen I just need
to talk to you guys there's gonna be no
fillers no editing no nothing just
straight-up spoken to you guys I told
you guys if you guys have any questions
any topics that you guys want me to go
over I will talk about it I will do it
you know don't think that this channel
is just about whatever the hell I want
this channels for you guys so today one
of the subscribers somebody who are I
support him like a not sure a lot of
love to whenever he leaves a comment is
kickoff I think it's bang bang I don't
know why couldn't choose crazy main
source for you to user names but yet so
the kid has to comment like hey I'm
gonna be on subscribing because this
shadow I don't like though where this
channel is going right well all I could
think tonight is anybody like I'm sorry
you feel that way and I'm here to
address it because I care about every
single subscriber that I have this is
not about just like hey I have 1500
subscribers and I'm not going to care
about every single one I don't care if I
have a million subscribers I'm going to
care about every single one of you guys
like I answered or I'd give a thumbs up
or reply back to almost every single
comment that I have then like I told you
guys you guys have to tell me what you
guys want to make this channel box tell
me hey I like it when you do this
video's hey I like what you do dis
tutorials you see that people have been
telling me hey they don't like the ruby
on rails tutorial the Ruby tutorials but
at the same time other people have been
telling me hey we love your HTML CSS how
to build networks chrome type tutorials
and I'm going back to those radius I'm
actually doing them right now so it's
like they're coming guys but I cannot
make something that you guys don't tell
me hate this is what I like you know
what I mean because what you have to
understand is like no matter what my
subscriber count and my views are still
going up but I don't know exactly what
my you know my course
is really want you know because there's
people that come here and they watch one
video and they like it and they
subscribe to it and they never come back
because they have a million subscribed
channels that they subscribe to work
whatever right so but for you guys to
guys that I actually come in here every
day when I got dropped from and they you
know you drop us a comment like I care
about you guys because the same way how
are coming here every day from the work
and I come directly over here and come
to this camera and talk to you guys is
the same way how you guys come you know
to me everything and leave a comment
like I care about you guys so I don't
want you guys to feel I hate I want to
leave the channel because the guy is not
doing videos that I like you have to
tell me hey what video is it that you
like you know I cannot read everybody's
mind I mean you know what the same time
I need to have different topics I can
talk about the same things I can't do
the same tutorials because then I'm
going to be pigeonholed into a little
box where it's just I'm doing the same
thing every single day you know I mean
plus one of the main reasons was I
haven't done that many tutorials is
because I'm building coding face calm
for you guys I cannot go in then matrix
or meals at the moment until I finish
that website because you have to
understand coming to this camera takes
like you know and now we're two hours of
my day when our door tutorial it takes a
long time I have to do editing I have
some practice but the cold which you
guys have to be able to know exactly
what I'm building how is going to work
like it takes a long time one video
might take 2-3 hours like that's just
how it is make you see a 20 minute video
half an hour video and you guys think
hey this is super easy this guy just
went in there and just coded it up like
I can't do that I can't just be like
just cold a whole tutorial off the bat
like it takes time it takes passes it
takes you know planning so it takes time
guys like take it easy on me like it you
know what I mean like at the same time I
have a full-time job but every night I
come
and I bust my ass for you guys and I
care about what you guys have to say you
know that's first of all I care about
what you guys have to sit so make sure
you leave a comment tell me what is it
that you want to know tell me what
questions you have send me a message
there's a lot of people are sending
messages and not answer right back this
time that I don't make a video about it
but the same time I answer your question
you know what I mean like don't think
just because I'm not making the type of
videos that you want at the moment just
what are you going to leave him right
