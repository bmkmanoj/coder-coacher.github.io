know c-boy job back at it again coding
freaks calm your boys back and I done
did it again guys we try something new
today alright so I'm basically going to
be talking about basically John psalmist
leaving
well quitting simple programmer right
and I just wanted to try this out right
I wanna talk about topic very short
maybe like 10 15 minutes and then also
give you guys the opportunity to show up
on on the chat right to see what the
community thinks right so basically
let's get to it
alright so basically I was watching a
video that somebody sent me and they say
oh my god Joe simple programmer is
quitting what do you think about it what
does coding face think about it right
coding face always got an opinion about
something coding face always want to
share to the world how he feels well
cool so I'll give you my penny money
basically what do I think about I think
John Thomas is very successful he's been
around for a long time I know about John
Thomas before I even know he had a
youtube I seen him before in Pluralsight
I've seen him before his books and stuff
so he's successful like let's just put
put it out there John Thomas knows what
the hell he's doing long time you know
how to promote himself you know how to
get his products out out there and
pretty much he came into YouTube he did
what he wanted to do did the same thing
created a channel caused him programmer
just like his website and at the same
time made it pretty successful I mean he
got to a hundred forty was a hundred
forty three thousand subscribers so
you know to be honest with you just like
somebody said Oh Jay Noah says he don't
need you to write from I don't know if
it was a podcast that I heard from him
or it was an interview or something like
that and it was like John Samus has like
real estate like he got multiple real
estate like he's good like he he's like
the definition of like a smart developer
right like he knew what he was doing
when he came in somehow he got a job
yeah you know like we know what the
skills that he had he came in he got
money you know from their investing
other things and continue growing which
is exactly what I tell you guys right it
took me five years to really understand
everything as far as like web
development and programming and like to
see where I wanted to go right but
that's why I give you guys examples of
things of what to do and what not to do
right I constantly give you guys that
right it's because you guys are learning
from my mistakes so now if you're a
developer you just starting you should
definitely look at what I'm telling you
or even let's take an example as John
summers is like okay he started as a
programmer but at the same time that's
not where he's ending all right
so pretty much I mean I've been noticing
this from the channel alone there's like
a whole bunch of videos that have
nothing to do about programming on the
channel right which makes sense it's
like there's only so much you can talk
about when it comes to programming it's
like how much can you tell people like
oh download this there's a software hey
try this programming language okay
here's the top ten programming languages
somebody sent me a message about this
and they're like yo it's so true Joe
like how how many top-ten programming
languages can you make like every month
can you do like a top ten programming
languages of January top ten programming
languages of February top ten
programming languages off of June or
July you get what I'm saying so saying
there's only so much that you can talk
about even I myself are my
here I'm like damn man like I want to
talk to you guys about other stuff and
just like have you know conversations
talk about other things besides just
coding but at the same time I realized
that's actually what hurt my channel if
you look back into like my social blade
whatever my channel was going up soon as
I came in the moment I started diverting
into other topics and helping other
people out and promoting other youtubers
and a whole bunch of other stuff my
channel dropped right literally right
now I could've probably had like 50,000
100,000 subscribers at the trajectory
that my channel was going but the moment
you start switching your topics in and
you know now being SEO friendly now
putting the right titles and I put it in
the right keywords then your channel
starts dropping right so I noticed that
but um for John Simon's like I could
definitely see like you know this he's
been doing this for what like four years
like that it's like at some point you're
like man there's only so much
programming I can do here right it's
like I don't even think that John Thomas
codes anymore to be honest with you I
don't even think that he codes anymore
because it's like he has so much stuff
to do got writing books freaking you
know do videos or two courses do YouTube
videos do advice videos the funniest
video I seen for John Thomas is like it
was like a crazy video is like hey it's
like what happens if you have a small
penis and it's like yeah like who's
asking John Simon's this who's sending
him with this this emails to ask him
about that like I'm not going to John
summons for that you know what I mean so
but you know the guy's cool man you know
this situation was like you know people
be like oh he's just constantly
promoting and this this and that but at
the same time it's like what are you
supposed to do I mean YouTube you can't
really sustain a career or YouTube and
to be honest with you I mean
he's doing what he's supposed to be he
has a business called simple programmer
right if you have a channel called
simple programmer you're supposed to
promote a wheel it right now see the
subscribers right see hey yeah we poppin
but yes that's what you're supposed to
do you gotta say like you're supposed to
promote your business on a channel that
is about your business you get what I'm
saying so it's a nobody can really be
mad at that you know so yeah man
let me see what's good was good was good
so what do you guys think about this man
do you guys how do you guys feel about
John Sam is quitting simple programmer
and I don't think he's quitting YouTube
what he's doing is pretty much like hey
he's gonna focus on other things and try
to find inspiration sometimes you gotta
find inspiration other things you know
what I mean it's like myself right I
feel like I've already mastered
everything in web development right
so now my goal is to jump into game
development right that's my goal that's
where I'm trying to you know prepare
myself and even with my free time I'm
going over you know c-sharp C++ doing
Python doing G was a GD script you know
basically the whole shebang I'm trying
I'm trying to go super deep right but
that's a personal challenge it's like
after a while you know you you really
want to you know you want to challenge
yourself it's like yeah I could be a web
developer yeah I could work for any
company that I want yeah I could go in
and try to was like my goal what should
be my goal after a while right I've been
doing this for five six years right like
I already found success I already made
all the money that you can make as far
as a web developer I mean I'm not
looking to become a project manager I'm
not looking to become you know how you
call it as one of those guys that
architect the the whole design pattern
of the company I don't know what we're
doing enterprises like that's not me
that's not what I want to do right so I
still want to challenge myself in
programming rain so what do I do after a
while right you know for the next five
six seven years you know I really want
to focus on coding phase making sure
that you guys get get get to where you
need to be as developers and at the same
time maybe you know - like I always said
like you know going to state to state
going to like high schools and
explaining to kids why they should learn
to code why it's important those things
I would love to do that you know for the
next five six years right but at the
same time what else would you know what
else would I want to do after that you
get what I'm saying so it's like
sometimes you got to reinvent yourself
and you know even for him like to think
about it you know there's like hey man
John Thomas does not need to be working
at no company right now you get what I'm
saying like John summers does not need
to be on YouTube to be honest with you
right he already makes money and enough
money to be like hey man I'm just
traveling the world you don't sound like
if y'all summons tomorrow said hey guys
I'm just gonna make this a traveling you
know digital nomad Channel whatever like
you can't be mad at it like because the
guy already achieved everything that he
wanted to achieve but you still need to
challenge yourself so I feel that's
where he's at right now that's where he
basically my call is he he's basically
at that stage okay I want to challenge
myself I want to challenge myself and
see what's out there you know cause it's
like web development program like he
already mastered that like what else is
there you know he created a YouTube
channel he's already successful at that
you know was what's left you know what I
mean sometimes you you look at yourself
in the mirror and like okay I'm
repeating myself every day doing the
same thing but what's left you know what
I mean why like he's gonna stay here
until a million subscribers and was
after that you get what I'm saying like
what was the guy's name are the New
Boston like that guy has a million
subscribers well yeah he left it for
some reason we don't know what happened
to him we don't know why he quit
we have no idea he gave no information -
no
you say I'm just not uploading no more
videos I'm just gonna live off whatever
my videos generate and like he did his
thing but you know at least John summons
came in and gave people like a little
you know a little reason why he he wants
to get and get out and you know try
other things you know what I mean
somebody say another computer guy quit
like five times
oh yeah you know the computer guy quit
like five times but I feel like the
reasons why he quit it's more like he
wants attention from YouTube that's my
problem with with like the computer guy
because the probably like the computer
guy
sorry to whoever's watching this there's
like damn we told her about John summers
who brought up goddamn Eli now but the
probably like the computer guy is that
he like the computer guy is like one of
the first guys out here right he's like
the new boss thing he's like one of the
oh geez of YouTube right been here since
God knows when he's been here since I
used to have a music channel right and
that's like I had a oh seven he was he
came in I think it's like oh nine away
or something like that right so he's
been here a long time just talking about
technology and you know IT and stuff
like that so after a while that was left
for him to talk about right but his
problem is that he keeps quitting
because YouTube ignores him YouTube is
like hey man nobody cares about this
technology section of YouTube nobody
cares about this programming side this
little niche area like you're too small
nobody cares about you right but he's
upset because it's like hi I'm Eli the
computer guy I've been here for almost
ten years like buddy you're not Logan
Pole you're not bringing us no money
like what you bring in is chump change
you know game gaming channels make more
money than you fuss you get what I'm
saying so that's the problem with him
but you know more power to him you know
right now after I got on him after I got
him is funny he decided to now start
coming back and creating content which
hey my job is done I actually you know
I'm a Eli come back into content
so you know can I get my props yes so
anyway so what do you guys think what do
you guys think about this sorry I did
not read anybody's messages on the
chatroom I want to I want to actually
know what do you guys think are you guys
gonna miss the simple programmer are you
still gonna just be watching John Samus
and hey guys this is John Samus we're at
the beach of Thailand we retire right
now you know you're still gonna watch
John summers and in Florida working now
are you're still gonna watch John
summers you know I don't know if he
might go into midlife crisis like F this
I'm buying myself for a Lamborghini it's
like you know it's like whatever right
we don't know what's gonna happen with
freakin like John Sam is like hopefully
everything's gonna be all he gotta do is
refine himself in and just working other
stuff is like it's obvious you know from
like all these videos that he has on his
channel is like answering questions
about hey do you have a small penis hey
do you do this and I and it's like this
channel is not about programming this
channels more about a life you know life
and and Michael is it and just helping
people out like I think that's the road
that he needs to focus on because the
program is sad you could tell like the
passion is not there anymore like that's
done okay so okay let me see what
everybody says this very this video is
currently the monetizes doesn't meet our
requirements to be successful in
monetize please answer the call after
the beep
okay Kelvin Davis says yo John Simon
sells books man sells courses of help
stuff has a youtube subscriber dollars
and programming dollars he's straight he
can let that Empire Builder on his own
he got money now word Luis Pentecost
says he will be missed and I enjoyed his
his videos let me see
let me see what else Genoa says yeah
props is John Samus Louise Manticore
says he don't need John summers we have
chat chit chit chit yeah man I mean your
boys here man but no he did he does his
job man he did what he needed to do you
get what I'm saying so he did his his
job he's still gonna be on YouTube now
that he's gone it's just I don't think
he's gonna focus more on the program
inside well I don't know what's gonna
happen with his like how you call that
supporters not to his supporters dog the
people that paid him for commercials
like coding dojo and that mountain and
what's the other company that pays them
all the companies right because in
reality they care about simple
programmer I don't think they care about
John Thomas the channel I don't know
that's what I think because there's like
if I come in right now right and you
guys are here
coding phase right and then I don't know
where all of my content is now I don't
know freakin I don't know milkshake
herbal life frame over herbal life face
right I'm pretty sure a lot of people
are gonna unsubscribe me a lot of
people's gonna be like okay cool
this channel is not for me you get what
I'm saying so I don't know what's gonna
happen with with his sponsors you know
after that like he's gonna have to build
new sponsors because it's like yeah
there's a hundred and forty three
thousand people who wanted development
brain programming courses or programming
videos and it's like if they're not
there no more right if that audience is
not there no more it's like now you got
to restart from the beginning and I
think that's what sort of what he was
saying because he was saying that
he been feeling like he wanted to leave
but he just didn't he didn't want to
quit because this hard man when you put
him it's like having a girlfriend man
like YouTube right now I was like
thinking the other day I was like yo man
you know I spent a whole year it's like
oh there's like a year long relationship
with YouTube right it's like having a
girlfriend for a year right so it's like
for John summers even simple programmer
you know the YouTube channel right let's
say for example it's like having a four
year a four year old relationship some
girlfriend that you loved in the
beginning then at the end she wasn't
doing it the same and you know she you
know now you got the girl across the
street winking at you and you're like I
don't want to leave her because I've
been with her for four years like
nobody's gonna give me back that time
you know so I feel like that's what he
was talking about like you know you're
investing all this time and all these
things in there and it's to leave it
behind it's like it's hard man so yeah
man anybody else what that mouth to mom
yeah listen oh let me know what you guys
think man let me know what you guys
think you know what you guys think about
this whole situation I mean I feel bad I
feel bad you know people people who love
his channel you know you can't deny
people do love his channel man you know
you definitely see he gets a lot of
views on all his videos I mean it's a
hundred thousand subscribers so let's
say his average is around like 4,000
something so out of let's say 4% 4% out
of the 100 plus subscribers 100,000 plus
subscribers it's not bad four percent
that means said that's a lawyer
that's a law you squad right there
because even when you when you look at
it as ecommerce and businesses right you
you come to a website you create a
website you create a website that
the service or business right only a 4%
conversion rate is amazing right a four
percent conversion rate is amazing right
let's say a website like my website
which is at a forty percent conversion
rate it's kind of ridiculous that
doesn't happen in the real world but at
four percent any business could be good
man that means four percent of a hundred
thousand people buying his stuff like or
just supporting you like that's great
man
people say simple program is the
blueprint I'm happy for him yeah man I
think he does his thing you know at
first I couldn't I guess like last year
I couldn't understand him too well like
a lot of stuff but what I did was I
actually went out of my way and started
looking at into more things about him in
like reading little articles on the
internet and also like podcasts and
stuff like that
interviews that people did on him and I
was like you know were like this dude
actually he's cool because you know
that's exactly what I tell people to do
like you're supposed to come in you're
not supposed to become a developer for
the rest of your life like if you don't
web developer for the rest of your life
I don't know what you're doing with
yourself like that's the truth
you understand like somebody that comes
in and be like hey man I'm a web
developer for 30 years there hasn't been
a guy out there like that right
everybody has like a five year limit you
know when people say oh there's a hike
oldest thing burn out a lot of times
it's not really burn out a lot of times
it's more like you're tired of doing the
same thing you're doing something that's
repetitive right so it's like hey you
know how to code you could jump into
other things right you could say okay I
know how to code I can jump from what
developmental software for software to
applications from applications to game
development or however you want to jump
around right once you learn the skills
you can jump around to different genres
of of development you get what I'm
saying so
you know that's how I mean that's what I
plan on doing like I'm the type of
person every five year I reinvent myself
right I find new goals I find new things
that I want to do you know I wanna have
you know my five year ago I wouldn't
have a million subscribers here and I
wanna have at least fifty thousand
members to encourage members because I
feel like I could get fifty thousand
members to coding phase comp like
probably by this year but I want fifty
thousand members current code or is it
concurrent users on it like users that
is like when I look at the analytics I
want to see fifty thousand people there
right that will make me happy
you gotta say like I go in even now I go
into my website and I log in anytime I
come in I'll see like two hundred people
are in on the website like that's great
that means - that's like having think
about it like this that's like having a
school and you go into your school and
you see all this 100 students here you
go in at four o'clock in the morning you
know oh sure there's two hundred
students here this 150 students here
like that that feels great so my goal
will be something like hey man come back
five years from now and come to the
website see like 50,000 people in there
you know what I mean
okay so I haven't even talked about this
so I guess I got like an ulcer or my
stomach great
or any like just what I needed so this
thing is killing me right now
so certain angles if I move on
it just feels imagine like on your
stomach you have a band-aid
right and every time that you move a
certain way somebody rips it Matt fast
it just hurts like crazy so I got a deal
with that this past two weeks
I mean it's past week it just started
last week so now I'm like drinking like
a whole bunch of like you know liquid
diet stuff and like fruits and
vegetables and stuff I'm trying to just
fix this thing man this thing hurts I've
never had this thing in my life and I
tell you guys this thing hurts alright
so anyways so what's good guys
what do you guys think we gonna miss a
simple programmer or not are we gonna
continue subscribe to him what's gonna
happen what does the community say
there's fifty three of you guys in here
what do you guys say right I want to see
like but why if you're still gonna be
subscribed to a simple programmer and
put a n if you're not I just want to see
you know I want to see you from
everybody that's here just put on the
message board put a why and put an end
just so we could see like how many
people out of the 53 people will you
still be subscribing and to you know
simple programmer John Samus Channel
just wanna see what's going on
see was gone
know that
ms awesome yes some nose
you
yeah that's a good that's a good answer
so flowers to Kitty says I will stay
subscribed because it doesn't cost me
anything to keep if something looks
interesting I'll watch
you
you
yeah so music source
where he will do next let's see if it's
interesting but I am subscribe last
month okay so let me see
I just watch his videos when you to show
stuff and he shows up
oh let's see chat Whitman
chairwoman says who cares if I subscribe
I just watch YouTube to get informative
videos to get information
I've watched YouTube video after YouTube
video most of them are filled with a lot
of talks and not enough chat women it
sounds like somebody who's like I'm
tired of you too I'm about to just
delete YouTube that sounds like you
don't want to see you - no he's like yo
listen man I'm watching a lot of the
videos and I'm just not getting anything
out of them it's not worth it
yeah so it seems like the majority of
people are still gonna be subscribed so
that's good I mean you know those good
that people you know support you know
sometimes you gotta support what people
want to do next you know what I mean and
then give them a chance and see what
they're doing and if you you know if you
eff with it you know if you don't effort
it then I say you move on to something
else you know I've seen it happen to a
lot of channels where it's like oh you
know the worst thing though is when you
know like I had a channel that was a
hundred thousand subscribers right and I
feel bad because I sold it I sold it to
a company right I sold it online I sold
it a to a company and then my channel
was about music and then they basically
made it about reviewing baby toys right
which makes no sense because the
audience that I had they were not there
for baby toys you know but whatever
that's there that's their problem
well yeah man it's all I learned from my
lesson from now like I'll never I'll
never sell like another YouTube channel
again like this channel I love this
channel I've put so much time like my
other channel that I had music channel
was just like more reviews and talked
about you know how music was you know
back in the days and this and that but
now this channel I've put so much time
in like I know so many of you guys like
stay in contact emails I answer your
questions it's like this is like part of
my life you know what I mean like I was
telling my my wife like yeah I was
looking at the how you call this thing
like the stat saying pretty much we
basically we doubled in this and this
month right like I was getting like a
800 subscribers around December then
January started getting like a dolls not
like a thousand one hundred and now this
month were getting like two thousand
subscribers per month so it's like
almost
almost a thousand or a dozen almost a
hundred subscribers per day which means
it's like you know like everything that
I'm doing now is like really working and
people are supporting it and you know
it's cool you know so it's like I can't
imagine I can't imagine like my this
channel like going away like oh I would
hate it man I would really hate it cuz I
put in so much time to this and it's
like I feel like I would lose contact
with most of you guys you know
question do you have a sub ready I don't
even know how to do a sub ready if
somebody wants to do it for me listen
there's a job
let me see why would he quit I don't
know he just won't he wants to take some
time off man let me see what else
chat women I don't understand how you
get paid from YouTube I really do
understand that I don't understand that
I don't understand how many subscribers
it takes to get how much money well
let's say I'm I like 10,000 subscribers
right and let's say my average right now
from like the last month to this month
and all this stuff I probably make I
don't know like from advertising on
YouTube and stuff like that probably
like $800 an average right so if you
calculate that and you say okay cool
let's say you got I got 16 where's the
sixteen thousand let's just keep it
simple
let's say for everyone every 10,000
subscribers you make like $700 right
let's say let's say that so let's say we
got seven times 14
7 times 14 Alana was SSA 700 yes so 700
times 14
that's $9,800 so this is just average
right so just John Solomon a simple
programmers channel probably makes about
makes about nine thousand eight hundred
dollars per month right
and that's calculating you know
according to what I make right and I'm
almost small YouTube where I'm just
growing my channels growing fast but I'm
just growing right so his channel
probably makes like 9800 traversing
media is about to be like three hundred
thousand subscribers so and you guys
know me I'm a very transparent you know
most of the people on YouTube they will
never tell you how much they make how
much they are making how much they will
make like people who like to keep things
to themselves right me the reason why I
share my things and why I talk about
things here on this channel so much also
talk about money and all these things is
to really motivate people and to see
what's possible right to see was
possible as you becoming a developer
like everything that I do and all the
money that I earn is from web
development like last year I made one
hundred seventy four thousand dollars
that's just being honest putting it out
there
right including my job including YouTube
including other websites and other
things right most likely this year how
much I probably make because I don't
work full time no more I probably make
like ninety thousand right with YouTube
and all my other stuff that I do that's
just me being clear but the reason why I
put this out there so people could
actually come in and gonna own this is
what's possible you get what I'm saying
you know cuz when I grew up I didn't see
nobody you know it's like you think all
doctors lawyers they make money they do
this they could afford all this trips
and all this stuff but nobody comes in
and tells you oh yeah the fella mean you
know programming you could really make a
lot of money you could really live good
like nobody tells you that right so if
you don't know about it you don't know
what's the possibilities and
what's the things that you you can
actually make and nobody tells you about
it especially in the United States
everybody's like so hush-hush
right you know the people that that's
one thing that always pisses me off it's
the people that make money they very
hush-hush they keep it very quiet right
because the reason why there's people
that make money is because there's
people that are poor that's how I think
about it right for people to be rich
there has to be poor people so if
everybody makes money and everybody
lives good and have a quality of life
better than what they have now then
everybody who has money who will it's no
longer like in Italy right I could go to
Lord and Taylor I could go to Nordstrom
and buy whatever I wanna buy the Gucci
shoes whatever right that no longer is
special so that's why people like to
keep their that thing under right
nobody's gonna tell you like let's say
you wanted to come up with your own idea
of a store right you know oh man I want
to buy you know some sneakers to sell in
the store you go to the owner of us
sneaker store he's not gonna tell you
the price that he's paying for those
sneakers he's not gonna tell you where
to buy it
who's the whole seller they would never
do that right because they don't want
you to know they don't want you to see
what's the possibilities and stuff like
that you know but but yeah so it's like
you're like traversing media it's like
you calculate for a verge of like what I
make at this amount at this subscribers
even him right now like he got two
hundred and ninety thousand subscribers
right let's say that's what that's
twenty nine times seven hundred that's
twenty thousand dollars per month
when you think about that you get what
I'm saying now I'm pretty sure the new
Boston at 1 million subscribers so let's
say 100 times 700 the new Boston at his
prime
making or maybe even now we don't know
hey we don't know how you two algorithm
if he's still showing the new boss thing
whatever to be making about $70,000
per month like that's crazy you got I'm
saying like the the possibilities are
there man what's this guy's name deaf
tips
Steff tips he disappear he left you know
and one of the reasons why I think he
left it's like hey man you got 200,000
subscribers two hundred let's see he
left he hasn't dropped a new video he
got fun fun function on his channel
dropping the videos right cuz I guess he
became a gamer and this is not and and
it's like oh yeah I'll just leave this
channel and let somebody else come in
and into videos for me and personally I
wouldn't have done that I would have
never done that because what he did was
pretty much take fun funk functions is
good but what he did was basically
pretty much give his audience to him and
you know that's why his channel now is
growing even more because he just
basically he was already already huge
already 264 thousand subscribers and he
just pretty much hi him hosting now his
channel so that's like why that's like
26 times
26 times 700
$18,000 without having to put anything
out
he put his man's I was wrong with that
was wrong with that to me what I think
is is cheating the game
I feel like that's like cheating that's
like you know I let's say for example
like I love whose channel do I love
dance was this kid's name so DL the
Dominican care
but let's say an example let's say for
example let's say I was to take was this
girl's name Ruby Rose wasn't I forgot
honey Rose whatever her name is let's
say out when she was starting up I was
to be like 200-300 thousand subscribers
right and then I said okay you know what
just start hosting my channel for me and
you come in and you take over the not a
real tough candy or even the real tough
candy right if I also feel like I'm out
three hundred thousand subscribers and I
give my channel to somebody else's okay
you could put videos here and yeah rules
Barry so if I was to give my channel at
three hundred thousand subscribers while
the other person only has like a
thousand subscribers it will be wrong
because they didn't go through the whole
work you know what I'm saying like
people go it's hard work guys like this
thing is not easy you know what
traversée media is doing it's not easy
you got a saying that he has to do
research find new tutorials find new
ideas new things all this stuff takes a
lot of work right and then when you come
in and you just say hey man this person
just comes in and is gonna basically
take my audience and run with it like
it's wrong you know saying cuz it's like
now you're cheating you know what I mean
it's like now you skipping the line
that's like somebody who you know let's
say we all at footlocker right and we
bought we want to buy some Easy's right
we want to buy some Easy's and we have
to line right and we're all at the the
end of the line there's like 200 300
people there right and then by the time
I get to the front of the line I let
skip the person that's all the way at
the end and just bring them all the way
to the front without putting in the work
without waiting outside without camping
without doing nothing just skip and put
them right in the front that's how I
feel about deaf tips putting fun fun
function in there and even though fun
fun function is already so
popular in coring a whole bunch of other
platforms but I feel like that's like
skipping the line you get what I'm
saying
but that's just how it is man
flowers Kelly thank you thank you for
creating a sub ready
you
yeah that's just a deal man people
in business all the time no law says
every person has to take the hard path
yes definitely definitely agree I mean
but what I'm saying is it's not that is
wrong it's just like you didn't put in
the work you get what I'm saying like
you just didn't put in the work you know
but yeah that's like you know when I
don't know if you guys have heard this
this term industry plan right so this is
a term in music when people say industry
plant right and the reason why people
might call somebody an industry plant is
when they do that like let's say you are
an artist right and you've been working
you were selling you miss your mistake
mixtapes in the street you've been doing
shows you've waited outside the the
radio stations you was in Times Square
handing out cities you was selling
cities out of your trunk you know by the
time you you build your audience your
audience is huge right because you're
putting all those years or that hard
work now when your artists at the
industry like let's say I'm I'm an
executive at Universal Music Group right
I come in and I have a little nephew who
raps oh yeah
my little nephew raps I'm gonna bring
him to the label and then I just
bypassed that whole process of working
hard and you put him in the front and
you say okay this kid Got Talent even
though he got talent he skipped all that
work sort of people that is in the
industry they don't respect it you got
what I'm saying the people in the
industry don't respect it they be like
oh this person is an industry plan he
didn't put in no work you know what I'm
saying and I'm not saying that fun of
fun function and they're not put in the
work he putting a lot of where he's been
here for years but I just think like
after doing all that work
you don't put somebody else you don't
give your the keys to the car to
somebody else you put in that work
that's like the new bossing why you
think the the new Boston could have
reached out to a bunch of guys out here
on youtuber say okay guys you guys take
over my channel and we split up the you
know the earnings you know back and
forth between me and you right but why
he hasn't done that it's because he put
in that work not the other person it's
like you know what I'm saying so yeah
man I'm about to get out of here guys
listen
shoutout to John some is he putting a
lot of work he got his channel popping
now he's doing something else we don't
know yet it could be John summers
working out all day
John sama is trying to get to I don't
know 400 pounds of just muscle you know
it could be John summers you know how to
find a girlfriend with John summers that
could be the next stage of the channel
John Simon stuff the porn chat it could
be I don't know it could be whatever he
wants to do you know we gotta support
him we're gonna show love his way so
