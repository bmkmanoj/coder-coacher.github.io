alright alright so first of all we're
gonna start with modern react with Redux
by Steven Grider
okay modern react with Redux well
basically it's one of the best courses
out there that you're gonna find for
react is a very beginner course there's
nothing fancy it's not a cool
application you're gonna build but
you're gonna get all the essential
things that you need to learn as far as
you know States props how components
work how to do it with es6 how to work
with basically babel and web pack and
how to set things up so it's pretty
complete course I would definitely
recommend it it's one of the courses
that just helped me get to the next
level when it came to learn and react
it's just reinforced everything that I
already know but yet for you guys to our
beginners it's one of those courses that
you must have on your stash now number
two the web developer boot camp by cold
steel the web developer boot camp by
close to you is a great introduction to
web development it has everything that
you need you know basic HTML basic CSS
even has bull strap okay it teaches you
like the very basics of JavaScript and
gives you a little introduction to what
it is to do backend with
no Jay yes okay at the same time it's
literally number-one-selling course or
on udemy
above everything else I'm talking about
every category every other course that's
out there it's actually the number one
selling course I mean people love it
it's for a reason it's because it's
actually good it's a good introduction
you know what I mean
if you're one of those people that that
you're not getting it you know if you're
not getting everything that you need
from websites are free cocaine coke ad
emini or etc the web developer boot camp
is cool because you have somebody
actually explaining it to you and show
you how to build the website server-side
rendering with react and redux
that's why sniffing Grider that's number
three all right basically that courses
is more about using the myrn stack
basically using express using react
using node here's a MongoDB it teaches
you the basics of it you know it also
teaches you know how to do server-side
rendering with react which seems to be
very popular nowadays you know so for
those of you guys that want to be you
know on the cool crowd go ahead take
that course I definitely recommend it
it's a great course for beginners and
for people that want to become nodejs
developers okay now number four number
four I will say is one of my courses PHP
seven laravel master course by Joe
Santos Garcia that's your boy listen um
I would say check that course out I've
seen so many courses from PHP a lot of
the PHP courses are new to me are pretty
old I've seen people who don't even care
about to edit the videos that leave
mistakes and you know there's so many
issues in different PHP courses that in
reality that's why I put my course in
there because I really think that you
guys will get a lot out of it so go
check it out search on you to meet Joe
Santos Garcia and it should pop up the
coding interview boot camp by Stephen
Breyer ok if you're looking to go to a
company like
Google go to Facebook go to you know
Amazon the big threes right
they gotta test you a lot on algorithms
right and I believe this is like the
best course out there as far as
algorithms because Stephen grinder goes
into every single type of algorithm that
you could think of like literally every
single algorithm that they got a test
you with he actually went in there and
basically just showed it to you and how
to do it with JavaScript okay so you
know you can't really go wrong with this
course even at that even if you're
trying to study something for like let's
say Python or Ruby or it doesn't matter
what language it is like literally you
could apply everything that you're gonna
learn here and put it into those
language so I definitely recommend it
you guys this video is brought to you by
viewers like you and people that support
our website coding face.com go check it
out over 20 courses in there that's got
a guy you to become a developer from the
beginning to becoming a pro number six
react native the practical guy by Mac
cementing schwäbisch murderer
I don't even know how to say his name he
has one of the best courses out there
for react native is very detailed um if
you're one of those people that really
want to know like everything around a
framework in how things work like he
really goes the extra mile you know
sometimes I personally I think he goes
too deep in it but if you're one of
those people that you really love like
courses that go very detailed into every
single part of the framework every
single part of the language like he
really goes in and react native is very
popular right now react native is the
future when it comes to you know
creating applications with web
development technologies like javascript
okay so definitely I will recommend it
okay the next one that we have here is
Python and Django full stack web
developer
camp by Jose por dia all right why do I
say this course is pretty good well it
teaches you Python and there from there
at the same time it shows you Django
basically people want to learn it so I'm
giving you guys which one is actually
the best one out of everything that's
out there so I would definitely
recommend that course you know
personally I would say focus on PHP
focus on even though Jes and Ruby on
Rails but hey if you want to focus on
Python and you're like hey I wanted to
what development but with Python because
I love Python then this is the course
for you the next one that we have is
angular front to back with Brad
traversée so if you guys have heard at
reversing media here on YouTube he's a
very established you tuber he's also
been an instructor for years I think he
used to work for at the onyx now he's
doing his own thing and to be honest
with you guys like this course and if
angular is like one of the best ones
right straight to the point it's not
going to detail into things it's more
like hey man there's other things that
you need this is how you work with the
framework this is how you build
applications this is how you become
productive right a lot of you guys yeah
might be coming from react it might be
coming from other frameworks and then
somebody tells you hey do you know
angular you want to be able to say guess
right and this is one of those courses
that's going to provide you with the
knowledge and the information that you
need to actually show up and say hey I
know this programming language or I know
this framework right so go ahead check
out this course I definitely recommend
it the next one is ionic in ionic 3
built iOS Android apps by Maximilian
Schwartz Mueller okay listen guys this
is one of the best courses that's out
there when it comes to ionic like I said
this guy max he's very detailed gives
you the whole history of ionic gives you
every single part of ionic you know all
the AP has everything that you can build
with it
it has some
cool projects in there so as far as the
course is very very complete I would
definitely recommend this course because
if you're coming from angular and you
say hey man I'm kind of jealous that
react native is out there and I you know
what I want to make my own phone
applications I have a lot of cool ideas
right but I love angular I love the way
how things work with angular well there
you go that's the answer
ionic tool you know you having three the
course is perfect for you because
everything that you already learned if
you put it into practice and just
learning the the framework of ionic to
help you build iOS applications and your
applications so it's pretty cool because
it's like universal alright so I would
definitely recommend it for the people
