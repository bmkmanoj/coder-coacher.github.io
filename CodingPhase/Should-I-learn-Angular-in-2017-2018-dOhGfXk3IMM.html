back at it again man Co defense calm
listen people being asking me hey Joe
should I learn angular should I you know
spend some time learning angular means
2017 everybody's talking about react
view and I will say yeah kind of learn
angular like you're gonna be very
surprised angular is like PHP a lot of
people hate it a lot of people say hey I
don't want to work in angular but those
are personal choices right and now in
the enterprise level of the industry
right a lot of companies are still using
angular and not only angular but angular
1 meaning like the original like the old
angular that pretty much of you copy
that's what people are using and just
know this job's so I would say God is a
few if you really you know want to have
a chance to find a job quick man learn
angular or learn react right reactors
good because it's gonna be a modern a
modern stack if they they're using react
right now if you go to a company that
like I say I don't know let's say Macy's
right Macy's they use angular a lot
right you go to those companies they
create a lot of tools and a lot of
components and a lot of applications
that are already built on angular and
they just need people to maintain
meaning like hey we just added a new
product so you add tag to to the
component and it's an angular can you do
that yes ok you're hired
so or like let's say you work for a real
estate company then I hey man we be
basically three four years ago we we
hire somebody to build this website for
us and you know the thing is that they
built it in egg
can you build the photos can you build
the files and you know just edited just
modify it whatever you want to call it
right can you do that in angular yes
okay cool you're hired
you know if you look at a lot of job
postings online they're going to say
angular a lot of them like this
I think angular holds the most you know
jobs in the market like there's so many
jobs for angular you know a lot we could
all talk about angular and how we
hate it how we do this and that but this
companies who already spent you know
millions of dollars into certain
applications and you know spending time
on hiring people you know and then three
four years ago
so they created those those
websites in angular so now they have to
continue maintaining it in angular so if
you know angular you're going to get
hired you know plus I think angular
wasn't the best framework but it
basically showed people what you could
do with a front-end framework right have
a single page apps and routing and all
the cool things that it did a day but
you know a lot of people hate it right
that's the truth a lot of people hate it
but businesses they they don't care
about what the developer wants or what
the developer wants or cares about or
even likes like all they really care
about is hey is this going to make me
money that's what they care about so if
like some guy three four years ago
decided to choose angular over react or
angular over backbone then everything's
gonna be building angular so now for the
you know for like the next five years
five ten years everything is going to be
maintained through angular sometimes
they they might let you come in and do
something else but
if a company already spent so much money
so much time into a certain technology
and it works for them they're going to
keep it so yeah I will say learn angular
is not gonna take you that long you
could literally learn angular in one day
it's not like you know it's not a super
difficult thing if you know JavaScript
you can understand angular of course
there's gonna be a lot of that
you have to learn like little jargons
like ng direct or was it ng bayan or
something like that
ng cloak like everything is ng so I was
like a lot of reasons why I hate UJ s -
so MA
that's what's going on with the angular
world but hey guys make sure you
subscribe make sure you like this video
and like I said if you want to have a /
tunity to learn and be able to ha get
hired out here like it's not going to
hurt you to learn angular at all it's
not going to be like one of those things
oh my god it's a debt technology no this
plenty of jobs out there that are
actually looking for people for angular
especially because nobody wants to work
on it so if you're a brand new developer
you like nobody wants to work on this
cool I'll come in and I'll do it and
I'll get hired and I get paid for it you
know what I mean so you've got to be
smart with it okay guys anyways make
sure you subscribe machine like this
video and by the way man make sure you
check out the videos in my description
basically those were the videos that in
the courses that taught me how to become
a web developer you know gave me the
opportunity to change my life gave me
the opportunity to care you know my
girlfriend my future baby that I'm about
to have everything that that I'm doing
is because of those courses so it's like
it's not a science thing it's not who's
smart it's not who who could do it you
know everything that you think that that
has to do with development and has to do
with computer science man throw that out
the window man
it doesn't work like that man it's easy
meaning like anybody can learn it this
is not you're not creating you know the
next car that drives myself
you're not creating the net in the next
Testament you're just building a website
it's not that difficult trust me guys
and people are paying a lot because
everything is seeing ecommerce now you
know you want to go to a website and buy
a product you gotta buy it through your
phone so everything is not mobile so
desktop is dying out but the websites
are never gonna die out because people
need it Plus what development is like a
you know it's like the beginning of like
your programming career you could become
a game developer you could become you
know I don't know a senior
architect you could come in and just be
like hey all I want to do is just deal
with databases you know you could just
maintain databases like this just
opening the doors for you it's like it's
a great career man all right guys so
make sure you subscribe and show you
like this video be like I said again
check out those videos in the
description all right guys
