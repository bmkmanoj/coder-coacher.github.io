of the game coding fees.com
your boys back in I didn't did it again
alright basically tonight what I'm doing
is I looked at my website I did a search
I did a Google search for myself right
so I said you know I'm gonna share my
screen with you guys and I said let me
search my name let's say Joe Santos
right Garcia and let's see what comes up
it's a reasonable teen tree house back
in the days when I used to be in team
tree house shows up my dribble account
shows up my jsg shows up which is also
the same thing as my Joe Santos Garcia
so I'm actually supposed to reroute this
this is like super old this like from
back when I first started where I pretty
much just use somebody else's um I call
this design it was like a theme that I
use for this and it's like now that I
think about I'm like I could've just
literally done something way better than
this all right so this is super old
there's like in my first year or
something like that right then I have
this other one Joe Santos Garcia dot-com
web developer and this was not that bad
but as you can see it's a couple hiccups
on it and in reality is because I never
got to finish it I was supposed to start
it then I created I say there's like a
prototype of what I wanted to do and it
never came to fruition because every
time that even though my my portfolio
look like to myself like to me it
looks like right every time that I
will come here and I'm like okay I'm
gonna build my portfolio bill my my
website builder the proper way want this
to be like really really good you know
what I mean
pretty much and this is old it's like
three years ago there's like super old
um but yeah every time that I started
making my portfolio I never got to
finish it because I will always get
higher no matter what so it like really
sucked because you know how I know a lot
of you guys have a lot of free time in
your hands where you get to build your
portfolio and you're like oh yeah I
could work my portfolio and you working
on it for like two three weeks
like a month or whatever like the most
in the last five years the most out pain
without a job has been a week and a half
which in reality sucks because if you
want to build your portfolios like you
don't have the time you never have the
time to build your your website how you
want it how you really love your you
know something that you could really
love right so I know a lot of people
always ask me like any man how how can I
build my portfolio how can I make a
great portfolio website so that's what
this videos about building or what
developers portfolio pretty much so I'm
gonna show you guys my process of how I
do this even though I never got to
finish none of my portfolios because I
always get hired
anyways um this time I really gotta go
in this time I'm really gonna create a
top-of-the-line website something that
could be proud of and whoever this is my
dot-com and searches my name they could
be like oh okay
he got a legit website right so I'm
gonna show you guys my inspirations
right so I was first of all I went
through dribble calm and I was like
looking at the people that I follow on
dribble and what I was looking for on
dribble was colors it wasn't more of
like all I want to copy somebody's
design I want to get somebody's style is
more about colors I got come here and I
look at what other people are working on
and see like
what I want you know why inspires me
like this right here this is very
inspiring like I like this I like the
colors on it it's very clean I'm really
into the dark themes I'm not so much
into like the light themes like
something like this I wouldn't care
about you know something like this I
would love you know I don't know if you
guys could see it let me see I gotta
share the screen so yeah so I was
talking about this right here this is
nice
I like the colors in here I like the
fact that it's dark so it's pretty cool
I like what I see and then what I was
saying that I don't like is something
like like this like to me this is very
plain this is like super plain all white
it's just plain all right never been
into like the all-white design if you're
gonna do like a really light design you
gotta go with grey instead of white
that's what I think I said like there's
a clean design but so you can see the
background is like off-white and then
the things that he wants to show are
actually white so that's pretty cool
I'm sorry guys I'm I think I'm sick
but yeah so yeah let me stop wasting
time this is what I found that got me
inspired so I really like the colors on
this I like the the background color I
like the white showing off I like the
you know there's a little light dark
purple I don't know what's that blue or
purple I don't know
violet so I like this so I'm getting my
inspiration and my colors from this then
this this this portfolio from this
photographer that thing is really good I
really like how the website feels and
how it flows so I'm gonna create
something similar to this not exactly
like it but I'm just going and getting
the idea of it and just like how things
are flowing I hope you understand what I
mean so I pretty much getting all my
ideas from this and you know how it just
flows so imagine a website like this but
with this colors that simple alright so
yeah and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
share the companies you know that I've
worked for show the skills that I I have
like all the programming languages that
I've worked with all the frameworks all
the databases that I know like pretty
much like a doll their logos and have
something nice you know something legit
something that when I go to Joe Santos
Garcia that comp I could be proud of you
know cuz right now it's like I never got
to finish it and it really sucks because
since I'm always gonna frickin hire like
I never have the time to really do it
and then when I was gonna have like a
little bit of free time then I started
doing YouTube and
my website color face that come so I
haven't had the time to create anything
so yeah man that's what we're doing
right now now what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna be making some videos probably
tomorrow and the day after tomorrow on
just like me creating my portfolio as
far as like Photoshop how I start design
and you know just prototyping it and
then from there I'm gonna start making
the code you know probably the HTML CSS
I'm I might release it here on YouTube
most likely of course it's gonna be on
on my website coding phase comm where
it's gonna be like a free course right
because in reality you just creating a
portfolio with me but for a lot of
people they're gonna you know get a lot
of value out of it and then I'm gonna
you know basically just really double
down on hyper app and I'm gonna make my
website in hyper app so it's gonna be
interesting you know with a back end of
laravel which I might just after I do
that creative with high perhaps
definitely I'm gonna add that as a
project because creating a portfolio
will flare about it's not that hard but
there's definitely a lot of pieces to it
that a lot of people will get something
out of it so if you're part of the get
all access pass or you have to Larabar
like a boss course you're gonna get that
as a project of how to create your own
portfolio site meaning you know creating
the pages then from there creating the
views in laravel there from there
creating a login for yourself so you
could use it as a CMS a content
management system basically it's like
we're creating a content management
system for our own website right so you
could take everything that I'm gonna
teach you guys through laravel you can
also go ahead
and implement it to your own website all
you have to do is change the HTML pretty
much right so that's what we up to right
now man just just grinding it out man
it's one of those weekends tomorrow I'm
supposed to be going to the beach so I
should be going to sleep pretty soul
because I gotta wake up early but I just
wanted to share this with you guys
there's new idea that I had and it just
came up to me I was like man I gotta
create my own portfolio but at the same
time I should just make it with
everybody else to hear so everybody
could get something out of it it's not
just like me creating a portfolio on my
own time at least it'll be something
that I'm teaching it to you guys so yeah
man let me see anybody in the chatroom
right now I know it's super late I know
it's super early I wonder who's in there
let me see if I could get to my to my
thing let me see let me see let me see

promo videos from the waiting and I was
like man this guy's doing too much
screaming too much crazy like
McGregor is doing too much and like
flow me whether it's like bro
like I've never lost in my life like
you're doing all this crazy but you
about to get washed up so I was like you
know we know who's gonna win that's
gonna be easy but it's gonna be good to
see if he even last to the 12th round if
he lasts to the 12th round
then at least I'd give him some respect
you know at least to Conor McGregor but
he's not gonna win it's no way an old
man but yeah man this is gonna be very
interesting sorry guys
freaking my girlfriend keep on putting
the AC in the the air conditioner the AC
and only that the the freakin oh man you
call this a fan we got a fan and
she puts that right on me so she
says not to blame her but
I'm not leaving that freakin air that
air-conditioned area or or the freaking
fan on all night
yeah when so if I sound like
tomorrow y'all know who to blame yeah
man but that's gonna be cool I'm gonna
be creating this new like a course I
don't know cuz I want to I've been
saying this for a while right I've been
telling people like hey you gotta create
a real estate website you gotta create a
portfolio you gotta create a digital
agency website you gotta create a
restaurant you have to create what's the
other one there's pretty much any type
of business out there ecommerce so those
two five type type of websites like if
you have those then you're good you know
so I've been thinking about them like
may you know what I just gotta create
those websites for the people so they
could have an idea of what to do and
just to get motivated you know
yeah man I got your money on moneybags
if Lauren Mayweather he's gonna wash him
up so I want to see it I might um I
don't know I'm gonna look online and see
if I find a link or something I'm not
trying to pay $100 to go see a fight
that might last you know 10 seconds or
some that's what I'm like yo I want
to see it why I don't want to pay
freakin $100 to watching that
sounds ridiculous Joe Joe says breath
how you remember old tags and elements
in html5 and css3 number one you never
remember everything there's a million
tags that I don't know and there's a
million tags and properties that I don't
know like the back of my hand right the
best thing that you can do is remember
the ones that you use all the time like
a div of course every h1 to h6 right
remember paragraph which is a P remember
sections which is just a section tag
remember header footer what else that
you always gonna use a span and that's
it like I could probably count them with
like two hands all the HTML tags that
you need period then everything else
what you got to do is go to HTML or
reference that IO and that's a you look
whenever you do need something that you
don't know it you look at it there it's
like a documentation of HTML you know
you never try to remember everything man
even in programming the idea of trying
to remember everything it's like you're
limiting yourself right because it's
like now you're using memory in your
brain and in brain power to try
to remember things and it's like nah
don't try to remember every single
things like use that knowledge and
that's pacing your brain if that makes
sense
to basically learn how how and where to
find the answers right instead of you
trying to be like oh I remember
everything that I like now don't try to
remember how how to freaking you know
write every single HTML tag learn how to
find the answer and where is located
that's it if you can get a degree yeah
I'm not gonna tell nobody don't get a
degree but I think if you like let's say
in exam four you like 29 30 years old
like if you're my age or close to my age
like bro don't get a degree it's already
I feel like you're already in a
different stage of your life like if
you're a little kid who's 17 years old
why wouldn't you go to college it would
be stupid for you to not not to go to
college now if you're like a grown-ass
man we're kids or a house you got a
freakin car you got responsibilities
going to school is like is to me is dumb
because it's like you're in a different
stage in your life like it they say oh
it's never too late to go to school but
at some point yes it is too late because
I don't know anybody who's my age or
older who's trying to be in a classroom
like listening to somebody like you know
what I mean like you're in a classroom
listening to somebody teaching you some
stuff and you're like man I got other
 to do I got I gotta go see my kid I
gotta go to work I gotta do a whole
bunch of so your mind is not really
on that you know what I mean your mind
is of money you're - on on doing a whole
bunch of other
you know what I mean so that's just my
personal advice that I would give
anybody because it's like we're in a
whole different world it's like right
now I was like two days ago sending my
my coworker I was like man his
girlfriend is going to college what
she's going to get her master's and
basically she got so much cool
right now going on in her life that
going to school doesn't make sense
and then like now she signed up for the
school and then now she just dropped all
her classes because she realized like yo
I don't have time for it it's like after
a certain amount of time it's like you
just don't have time to be in a
classroom like that you don't have time
to be sitting down and listening to a
teacher and then from there the person's
giving you super complicated homework or
like let's say somebody gives you a oh
you got to write a thesis on this
subject it has to be a minimum of 20
pages it's like do I look like I got
time to be freaking spending 20 you know
writing on 20 pages now I don't have
time for that
you know what I mean but yeah man let me
see who else is in here
yeah man you just gotta be dedicated man
you just gotta be dedicated and don't
worry about a thing you just it's gonna
happen trust me it's not it's not one of
those situations where somebody comes in
and tells you oh yeah like you're gonna
be able to become a millionaire in
 in three months nah you gotta be
realistic with the world you know
sometimes you might be a developer who
comes up with I don't know the next
Facebook right an example right the next
what's the name of this app damn the one
that people hook up on the next ender
right let's say you come up with the -
you know a crazy application like the
next sender instantly you could become a
millionaire right you could just be like
okay I just created some that's
viral people love it and they enjoy it
cool right - it could happen now you
could also just become a developer who
was just working at a company at a
 company and be miserable she
happens to but one thing that's for sure
is that you're gonna get paid pretty
well you're gonna get P two times or
even sometimes three times what the
regular people are getting right now in
all their regular jobs so I don't know
just put in the time put in the time
kids put in the time man
you know what man we already here man I
don't even know why I'm wasting time I
could literally come here and start
working on this a little bit okay so
these are the colors that I have in mine
let me see
model is real quick straight-up
prototyping kids all right
cool se all right that seems cool I see
what else what other colors
all right so let me see because well I
would like I would like to have
something like that something similar to
this so let me see how I would do this
create a new layer I know up here will
probably have like the menu of course
the the text looks like but that's
fine you know nothing that have America
cannot fix
of course the text is gonna be something
that will fix later on
Queeny like a couple of little things
here man let me see
hmm what else would I do this you got
Joe signs I see ya probably put like an
image right here a few boy so let's see
okay let's say this put a little shadow
on this
okay so those look looking a little bit
clean all right something like that so
let me see I mean I will put like thing
here that will say many way a cool icon
all right
seems pretty cool then probably like let
me see what else would I do to this
thing
yes no sense or see here I got the menu
there okay
maybe like a sliding menu like that okay
let me see yeah one thing two guys like
you guys gotta at some point you have to
learn how to use certain programs like
like this like Photoshop or sketch
because this is super useful it's really
good whatever you want to create
something because
you know it's like it's easy you know
nothing that is easy but it makes your
life easier when you could see something
visually and then you start coding you
know now for this assignment you know
what I'll be cool to do something
different instead of the menu coming
from the side menu coming from the
bottom I've never seen that done so
that'll be cool okay make this like what
ah let me see what was the colors that
this one had here something like that
let's see how that looks
mm could look sexy now all right
so different an air drop a shadow tool
but we gotta see how the shadows coming
out shadow should be a little bit darker
than that
now let me see something yeah okay now
the distance is a little bit too off
can't call this is a good a good
starting point for my portfolio site
then here will be something like let me
see what else here I will put in like
this will be the menu for sure so I will
say something like this like I'll bring
the color white can't why is this not
showing off okay that's why
I hate this auto-select thing there was
the colors that they have they have to
have a color that shows off something
that pops see about like that of course
a little bit smaller than that Stu
placate that
right now let's try to organize this
things okay cool evenly so you know
something right there's good
so let's say about skills about skills
what else about skills
Thanks all right now let's see this see
now let me see okay that's why skills
and I shine up okay
vertically okay there you go
now let's stick these things together
group them together so this is just a
prototype
this the idea that I have behind it and
then what I'm thinking about is this
will be like the menu this right here
would be like area that will expand so
it will basically be start as small and
then will definitely turn like that
depending on the project
all right now let me see something else
let me make this a little bit smaller
and we're gonna change the background
color on it so let's see what's the
color on this thing
change this one to white okay
make make this a little bit bigger okay
cool
so if for whatever reason you wanted to
make this a little bit bigger see how
look all right smell that bad some
prototype kids just clip that together
call this content call this one's that
many all right there you go
I mean that's good for now so let me
save this save as create any projects
portfolio
20:18 meme this prototype that's it
that's good for now it's an idea so my
dear kids I say that's how we do
late night so you just come up with
something new we're like okay we're
gonna come up with something new for for
tomorrow and that's it I'll make it
happen kids so let me see what you guys
is up to her before I go to sleep let me
see let me see let me see uh who's in
here we got Dennis we got a mission we
got caught of AIDS was Andrew Garcia
Andrew Garcia say Joe you've been a
great inspiration I'm from New Jersey
pretty close to you started the web
developer bootcamp course about the six
section so far in one week you see
that's how you do it thank you for the
motivation he says that's how you do it
man if you have the time go hard man you
know I know people who are like oh yeah
I'm still in the third section or in
they've been on it for three months so
that means they're doing one section per
month which is like to me is like you
know what I mean like how are you still
doing this you know like you know so
that's how you do it man if you have the
time do it real quick because in reality
it's like after the course is done
you're not done yet
you know what I mean like you still got
to build the project
so you still gotta practice for you to
be able to get a job it's like you can't
just show up at a you know at a job
interview and be like hey guys I just
finished the web developers boot camp
hire me know they're gonna look at you
are you crazy
you need to have projects you need to
have a whole bunch of so you got to
have this kit Andrew Garcia's doing it
like you know his first week he's
already in the 6th section so that's how
you do it kids if you're gonna do
something go hard at it don't just be
like oh I'm gonna waste time and my
procrastinate leave it for later no just
get it out right now just get it done
and then from there you could chill
later on you know you gotta think about
it like this once you have a job yes you
could be like me and be like a height
beast like I call myself like a heipiess
when it comes to code like I'm learning
constantly I'm always on computer I'm
doing something but because I like this
right but once you get hired you don't
have to do this every single day you
just do it your job and then after work
you just chill you don't touch a
computer ever again you know of course
after a year or two you're gonna be out
dating you're gonna be like really
behind what's going on in the industry
so I wouldn't recommend it but I'm just
saying that you know give yourself six
months of working hard and then at the
end you're gonna see that everything
pays off but yeah
guys it's crazy
yeah I'm just reading the comments here
man people are crazy let me see let me
see who else is in here
you got needles scribe in here David
yang what up who else your boy cam
always showing love fan production 16
years old that's what's up man if you
guys is 16 you going hard man that's how
you're supposed to do it I wish I you
know when I was 16 I started out 14
years old and then I left this thing
alone because everybody was telling me
Oh graphic design is not gonna go
anywhere and like when you think about
him like what like this had nothing to
do with graphic design but people kept
telling me that so much like even my mom
was like Oh graphic design and computer
stuff that's not gonna go anywhere so I
was like okay whatever I believe this
 along but you know for you guys you
guys have me to motivate you you know
what I mean like even for your parents
or somebody from the streets or somebody
your best friend but I all get off the
computer to listen that like now man I'm
here to motivate you because you most
likely gonna make more money than them
so I was like don't even listen to them
Joe what was the first three months at
your first programming job like it was
boring because all I was doing was eBay
products like let me see maybe I could
find something let me see CEM
distribution I'm gonna my first job a
very very first job which to actually
you know my first job now that I worked
in my whole life way my very first job
as like the developer you know a
developer like coding it was at
this company called ZM distribution
I mean that one started tells you
everything you know what I mean link it
was not the best place but you know it
was the start kids
let me see there's their website look
like
it would this how they website looked
back then that's how you know those
people don't care then they don't
understand how the industry works like I
used to be telling them like hey let me
build your whole website let me fix it
up and like nah we've been having this
for years and it's like it's worked for
us I'm like okay cool
I'm out of here you know so I'm three
months I left from that place because
they just wasn't you know trying to up
great things like you know
so whatever the in distribution let me
see if they still have my my design let
me see yep you see all of the stuff that
you're seeing right now
this is what I did on my first job this
was the things I could show off be like
hey I built all of this stuff you know I
built this I built this you know it's
supposed to be clickable I of course
they probably didn't add the JavaScript
so didn't they messed it up somehow I
mean this is like five years old guys
this from 2012 and they still using my
design and the things that I built for
them like that's kind of crazy right
I mean I guess some of them they still
using the old ones but yeah whatever's
new I guess they and they using the ones
that I added the look house this way I
get pissed on like they're so stupid
instead of hosting their own images you
know what they do they put it on photo
bucket
that is not gonna expire like come
on man like it's a business man like
come on guys like put some time into it
like that's why I left I please man I
quit that job quick man I lasted in
there maybe three months maybe three
months probably less than that like
because I know why you know I was like
deep down inside of me I'm like yo I was
like yeah I'm destined for
greatness like I can I can go to the top
man I can go to any company I know I can
do it you know what I mean so I just I
went in there basically got the
recommended you know recommendation or
like you know the thing where I
could put that business in my resume and
say like yeah I did what development
somewhere else cuz you got to think
about it like this most legit companies
they don't want to be the first one to
take that risk
with you cuz they don't know if you know
how to code or not right even though I
know what the hell I was doing people
wasn't giving me that chance you know
like I went to tumblr they didn't wanna
hire me because number one and I have or
all the skills at the time plus I bombed
on the interview because I didn't even
know how to you know I didn't even know
what the hell I method was I didn't even
know how to explain it all right so the
guy I never forget this the guys like
what is the method I'm like now to think
about it like a method like seriously
and like I messed up on that question
it's like that's super easy that's like
a it's a function that's a so
function in an object leave it alone
that's it it's a method you ready for it
back then it was like I didn't know none
of this so then I kept applying for
like really big companies and I wasn't
getting hired which is why I tell you
guys apply to the big companies but
that's not your goal your goal when
you're just a self-taught developer it's
not to candles become
this is just to get a job that's it
that's the only goal your only goal is
to get ya your foot in the door and
that's a after that everything is easy
the biggest problem is getting that
first job once you get that first job
every other job is gonna hire you
because you already have experience it
means that somebody else took the chance
with you I know some people that don't
even tell companies like oh they've
never worked before
like they lie on their resumes they'd be
like oh yeah I work for this company I
have private clients I've been doing
freelance for three to four years and in
reality they've never worked in
their life so you know what I mean so
that's just how it is so it's up to you
how you want to do it you know I mean I
try not to lie ever on my resume or
anything because one day somebody's
gonna look it up and be like oh let's
call up this companies in did this
person work here and they're gonna be
like why we don't have no history of
this guy you know how embarrassing that
 must be they pull you to HR and be
like hey James
um you say you work for Google and we
found out we could actually called
Google like you know how crazy that
person must feel like you you really
call Google to find out like a it's like
okay guys I'm packing up my things like
place like that happens guys it's
not me lioness she liked to have is a
real life let me see
everyone keeps saying that if for years
when I'm I am 18 what the element will
be dead but I'm still gonna continue
yeah man just trust me man you know how
long they been saying like that
like a long time you know let me ask you
this if web development was going to be
dead in four years what do you think is
going to replace it people are gonna
walk around with sticks you know what I
mean like they're gonna be like
communicating with each other with
sticks or or if I came a super antenna
like I don't know how people are gonna
communicate like everything is in the
web now the web is the future every
other job out there even software
development like those things are iffy
you know it's like only like the best of
the best are gonna get the jobs for like
software development what development
really good people's gonna get the jobs
but the thing is that there's gonna be
so many jobs for the web like there is
now like there's not enough people to
fill it out like I come here man
like literally I go to imma show you
guys right now and go to Andy calm all
right I'm gonna show you guys right now
let me see if I keep that there let's
see let's say react all right is right
now a react close to me right
automatically there's like a company
that I've looked it up if I literally
wanted to go to this company tomorrow I
could go to this company without a
 thought in my mind and that's
6723 an hour so Mannion this through a
contract so in reality they're paying
$100 an hour and then this company will
pay me 6723 so 67 times 23 times let's
say 40
times 52 let me see did I do the math
right $139,000 all right so let's do
this right because that number seems
crazy 657 $23 right times 40 all right
that's how much it will make a week
right times 52 weeks in a year that's a
hundred and forty thousand dollars
$139,000 eight hundred thirty-eight
dollars plus forty cents for a job that
I could do with my eyes closed to work
for a company which would be super easy
because most likely the type of websites
that they work on is doing the same
things so meaning there's just a private
business guys dealer track right there's
a private business what they do is they
they create websites for dealerships do
you know how many companies are like
this around the world in the United
States alone there's freaking hundreds
of thousands of businesses that are
looking to hire developers right and
you're telling me $140,000 like that's
not good like that's what I'm saying you
know what I mean link and this will
react right they're looking for somebody
who knows react and not even a
senior-level they're talking about the
mid-level reactive over means any of you
guys can if you know react and redux you
could call yourself a mid-level
developer all you need to have is like
two three projects and that's it your
mid-level developer that's it that
simple
so that means right now if you know
react if you took the react and redux
course from steven grinder that's in my
description and you created two to three
projects and you live in New York you
could literally apply to this
and get 6723 an hour now let's look at
this through the taxes I was a a there's
a tax check after tax evening I'm gonna
give you guys the not for you know the
phone number how much you will get after
so let's say New York New York
all right let's say he grows pay
annually what was let's say keep it
simple a hundred and forty thousand
dollars right elderly all right single
let's say you're a single person let's
say total allowances of let's say to
keep the withholding fine that's who
cares nobody cares about the thing added
deduction no just keep it simple
alright let's see how much you leaving
with okay so weekly you get $1,700 most
likely what you're going to get is
bi-weekly so let's fix that up cuz
nobody gets paid weekly everybody gets
paid bi-weekly so I'm just giving you
guys the numbers man because so people
that talk about what development
give them this number tell them every
two weeks I'm gonna get thirty four
hundred dollars in a mid-level position
right and that's like okay is not
everybody's gonna get that job because
every job varies in every state is
different but you could see the
potential and you could see that's just
a regular job we're not talking about
going to work for Google where they
gonna pretty much rape you on the
interview
we're not talking about that we're
talking about a regular job this is a
regular company a regular business this
is not freaking top 500 company no this
is our regular business giving you
$140,000 all right so you know what I
mean like the people who are in this
thing and like I see a lot of you guys
in on you too a lot of people that
subscribe to me man when I tell you guys
like sky's the limit
sky's the limit man like right now I'm
looking at a hundred twenty plus a year
all right and everything is created by
web development I got my website I have
some people that I tutor I have what
else I work full-time and out to be
honest with you guys where I work at I'm
getting I'm getting underpaid think but
it's comfortable I'm ten minutes away
from my house so that's why I'm there
all right now when you know now that I'm
gonna be the head of IT whatever which I
didn't want to have to take that
position I'm gonna get way more money
and I'm ten minutes away from my house
you know what I mean like that's the
only reason why I decided to take this
job even don't get a paid way less than
what I would be getting paid anywhere
else
place the convenience the convenience of
me getting I could get there late I'm
comfortable I could go in there and uh
you know nothing that could do whatever
I want in the job because it's a job
I'm respect for him I'm not an asshole
but at the same time it's like if
tomorrow I could be like hey man I'm out
I'm out
you know I could get another job and get
away bigger higher salary and like so
much if I want
you know what I really like there's
nothing in this world like the peace of
mind that I have guys like him I sing
what a little star wars t-shirt
the same had a Yeti
like you know but I'm comfortable you
know like I'm being honest I'm
comfortable like there's nothing better
than to be able to say hey if I want to
switch tomorrow I could make 140k
literally I could go and prick and bump
into any company but I hey man minimum
that I'm taking is 120 MP was gonna pay
for me because I know almost
everything this almost nothing and that
I can't do literally so you know I don't
know what more to say to you guys like
if you really bust your ass and you
really go hard at this and you have
passion for this thing if you either for
the money you could really get a lot of
money a few out here but what's funny is
like once it get to that point where you
could get paid a lot of money then you
have that option to choose where you
want to go cuz you're like oh I could
choose this job how could you choose
this job which is easy and get paid a
little less but I don't have to do that
much work where I could go to this job
get pay a lot and do a lot of work you
know you decide on what you really want
to do you know so don't pay no mind to
nobody telling you about
what you know what the velum is gonna be
dead in four years
that's like I've been hearing that
actually my mom told me that she in 2001
like you know it's like really
so don't pay no mind to it alright let
me see let me see who else is in here
I'm about to head out of here man but I
just wanted to
give you guys a little thing man and
like guys signed up for coding phase com
oh guys just even if you just go in and
take the free courses trust me they're
worth it I just want everybody to sign
up just go in there man and like I said
if we get right now we got nine hundred
people who signed up for the the courses
the OU access past the moment I get
10,000 people I'm out of here I'm
basically doing this full-time I'm
quitting my job I'm working full-time
for you guys so that's when you guys if
you guys ever want to support the kid
the number is 10,000 people all right so
that's what that's what we doing right
now
that's what we're trying to get to but
yeah like I said I'm here to motivate
I'm here to show you guys the new things
like seriously man yeah I knew you're
just tearing you up in taxes hell yeah
yep where you go to listen man you go to
the Google office man if you guys never
been over there you've never been to a
big like corporation like that a lot of
times you don't even get interviewing
the big offices you get interviewed by a
third party like you get to go to the
big office after like the second
interview you know what I mean so you go
over there they running trains on you
like they passing you around like a like
a dot you know what I mean
that I hate data structures dis
algorithms that white board this show me
where you've been on for the fact the
the past five years what companies how
you work for it we're gonna freakin drug
test you like you gonna put your
Anti Doping we're gonna check if you
suck steroids if you took anything like
you know for me I'll be like you know
what
keep that I'm good I don't need to be
going to this
you know what I mean like I'm gonna get
paid the same as somebody who works
at Google no matter what I make the same
money as them the only difference is I
don't be like oh I work at Google
man Google could suck my fill in the
blank but yeah man all I'm saying like
I'm comfortable right now you know not
really not really worried about it David
David David David David David Connolly
Connolly Connolly Connolly your wood
outside you saw that that was a glitch
in the matrix kid I just got caught on
him you know yo man so be honest with
you I like having my own platform better
than you to me because you to me is like
you got to go through a process of
getting an approval like you gotta
submit things and it's like it's like
right now like I'm thinking about
creating a portfolio course right is I'm
gonna do that tomorrow and the day after
tomorrow probably like this whole week
I'm gonna knock that out with you to me
I will have to go to a process of them
accepting it in this and that in my own
website I just put it out that's it
listen code oh man
this a glitch in the matrix man you know
I will say this man I'm a glitch in the
matrix that's why I gotta be like David
Connelly Connelly Connelly seriously Eli
the computer guy
laughs YouTube I gotta see that I don't
think so yeah he's been saying this for
years
he lied the computer guy he's been
saying this for years like oh I'm gonna
leave I'm gonna do this and that
click B you know what I mean like people
be click being like crazy man Thompson's
hard man you know what I mean like I'm
eating I'm eating the the subscribers up
okay you know what I mean link the real
is back
the sauce is back okay we are here right
he's feeling the pressure you know what
I mean like the there hasn't been really
good content from Eli the computer guy
in years
like he's been around since like the
beginning of YouTube and like there's
only so much you could talk about
especially when you're home 24/7 you
know I understand why he he's home you
know his his wife had cancer and a whole
bunch of stuff but you gotta like if I
was he like the computer guy and I got
to the level that he got up to way if
you know I think it's like what like a
million subscribers or something like
that I will make that work like people
don't know how to work this thing
and it's like you know not to put it out
there like Chris Hawkes right now I saw
a video from Chris Hawkes and he said
something like all that if how you
coming def Mountain leaves him that he's
gonna have to quit you to because you
don't know how to you know he gotta get
more money into get motivated and
there's like to me I'm like like come on
bro like you telling me with all the
subscribers you got all the things that
you
working on you're telling me you don't
know how to monetize things you're
telling me you don't know how to create
content that people are gonna enjoy and
people have been subscribed to you for
years and you don't know how to actually
you know get your subscribers to support
you like then you don't have lower
subscribers you just have but you have a
whole bunch of bots that just subscribe
to you but nobody really cares about you
because it's like it's like right now
you know how many people I'm actually
signed up to patreon a month right a
month I'm 217 people 17 youtubers that
I'm signed up to patreon right some of
them are like $5.00 some of them are $10
some of them are like $1 someone are
like 2 or 3 dollars in total I paid per
month a hundred and twenty seven dollars
for patriarch like that like that
was a bill you know what I mean because
I support those channels right there's
people out there that are like me right
that if you like a channel you want to
support it right and I have a lot of
supporters here on my channel a lot of
people signed up nine hundred people
signed up to my website you know of
course I'm giving them good value and
giving them something it's not like a
patreon what patreon is like oh is I
hate donate money for me for no reason
just because you watch my videos on
YouTube
no I'm basically created a website where
I drop in good quality videos and a new
stuff every day there all right so
people like it people support it so all
I'm saying is like for Eli the computer
guy be like oh I'm leaving YouTube this
and that like bro like cry me a river
like you know this guy Eli's the
computer guy he was used to getting you
know probably a quarter million dollars
half a million dollars a year and now
because he probably got in debt you know
what I mean like he probably got in debt
where he told like that money was gonna
be there forever
thinking oh yeah I'm making money off
youtube like bro no like that could have
been shut down at any moment it's like
right now every time that I curse on a
video my videos get demonetised I can't
curse no more so this video that I did
for an hour which will probably would
have gotten me about $10 on YouTube
because all the views and other people
that that watched it I'm probably not
gonna get anything because I cursed on
it so every time that I curse on a video
I get nothing but do you see me crying
for it no it's like you know what I mean
yeah a lot of the guys they throw were
there the channels were and it's like
yeah I don't know I don't know what II
like the computer guy is gonna don't
like what are you - what is he gonna do
go connect computers somewhere connect
printers and like that like unless
he he was smart and he the money he was
earning all these years he has a lot of
savings and then he Co opened up his own
business that's what I would do you know
what I mean but let's see the new boss
in tune the new boss thing I don't know
why he quit like you build the audience
you build a channel for a lot of years
and then you just I don't know where it
quick
and it's like what ya deaf tips is
another one
Aryan beta he just came back around I
don't know you know but wishing the best
yeah $10 off unlimited content from you
like the computer guy but doesn't thing
what exactly is it that Eli the computer
guy gives people besides him talking on
on YouTube he don't make tutorials he
don't make advice like current advice he
hasn't been in the industry for over 10
15 years he hasn't been in the industry
so that's not an soon where this
developers who are here on YouTube not
mentioning no names that they're like a
hundred thousand subscribers but they
haven't been in the industry for over 10
years like they haven't worked a job you
know what I mean he's like that's like
somebody giving you advice about the
roaming times you know it's like
somebody comes in and be like hey man is
2017 but I remember when I was a Roman
and I used to be in a you know a
gladiator back in the days it's like
this what you do to become a gladiator
you look at this guy like what you know
a lot of those dudes that have been here
for a long time I look at them I'm like
bro you're not even in the industry like
you don't even freaking code you know
what I mean like a lot of these guys
don't even code they go on udemy they
buy a course right they create a
tutorial on YouTube and that's saying or
they'll be like that they take a little
course on udemy and then not even taking
they just skim through it and then they
come back to YouTube and talk about
frameworks and talk about that they
don't even use you know what I mean like
what do I think about Christian
Christian is a good it's a good youtuber
he he does what a youtuber needs to do
you know create cool content create
storylines of situations that happen in
his life like he knows what to do he's a
good youtuber you know
my top three programming channels like
quality quality I don't know I like
Chris I like Chris Hawkes channel
because he's real with it but lately I
don't know someone his topics I've been
really boring or really dumb like he
just did a video about progressive apps
and he was talking about responsive apps
responsive design and I'm like wait
progressive web apps it's not responsive
design at all so I was like wait what
so I don't know sometimes you know I
could imagine he's been doing it for
four years you know four years is a long
time sometimes it's hard to to really to
really find your own your own content or
like fine like new content to talk about
I know I gotta be hard you know what I
mean so I can't say enough Dan Barker
socks is this that is hard for years
sometimes you don't even know what the
hell to talk about after that let me see
who else oh I like I like I like the
real Casa Darrow and I like real tough
candy real tough candy because she has
like funny stuff on her videos that are
fun you know I have fun watching her
videos and then the real Casa Darrow
who reminds me so much of me like he's
like me and him could be like this like
best buddies like I see his channel I'm
like man I wish I could hang out with

have to be number one
just because this is my channel doesn't
mean that I have to be number one well I
don't even have to be on the list you
know it's up to you I just want to know
what the fans and the subscribers really
like you know what are we
we're basically we're adding where we're
basically saying our top three youtubers
web developer youtubers alright so we're
going you know one two and three the
people that you go to we're not talking
about like oh you like one thing about
this person you know you enjoy now we're
talking about the people that you you
know soon as you get on YouTube you're
like oh who do you check out you know if
you have to go check out one person then
you gotta check out the next person who
will you check out you know what I mean
three people hi bition is like cold
babes called babes calling face yes so a
lot of people enjoy icy they enjoy a lot
of traversing media I think traversing
media is killing me right now you know
what I mean so I definitely think he's
killing it for sure but it's also like
the same thing like you know some people
might come in to YouTube for motivation
some people might come here for
tutorials like you know what I mean like
you come here for tutorials it will make
sense for traversing media to go check
out traversing media because he gives
some how he gives out so much content
here on YouTube and there's good content
you know like he can't be mad at it it's
like a lot of content I don't know how
he does it but him is a lot of content I
mean of course he does this full-time
you know what I mean like it's not like
traversing media gotta wake up and go to
a job I don't think so cuz there's no
way that with all the videos that he
does he probably does this full-time at
his house and like you know that's one
of my goals you know he made it there so
I was like he's killed
Arina you know be a man keep adding
there's 37 people I want to know
everybody your top three and I don't
have to be in you're not your top you
know your top three just because there's
my channel you know yeah um let me see
who like phone from the function he's
good he's good too but I feel like
sometimes his topics they go over my
head you know what I mean like there's
certain topics I'm just like I'm not
interested you know what I mean like to
go in detail about certain things like
nah it's not really my thing
let me see rosemary she's she's alright
she's cool I haven't really I haven't
drank tup the rules very kool-aid yet
you know like she seems cool but I don't
know for I feel like for me to really
like her I need to have like you know
like feel her personality like her
videos to me not saying that they're bad
but to me they seem like too scripted
you know what I mean like - like I'm
gonna go in front of a camera and I'm
just gonna you know I'm gonna write down
an idea and then I'm gonna just talk on
one top again you know I don't know that
to me that doesn't call me you know I
like I like the Freestyle think that I
do here like you know I just come in I'm
like I get an idea all right cool I'll
make a video about it that's a I don't
put a thought to it and that's why I
like Chris Hawkes - okay
I don't see Chris hooks right in there
like today's topic is let's write down
the top five things that I need to talk
about like now I don't see him doing
that I see em like he just got on his
computer he got from work he's like hey
I'm just gonna make a quick video you
know so yeah let me see macchesney Shia
was really good too at some point he
fell off you know who's back right now
um
level up Tut is back right now and I
like his channel a lot he really has
really good quality videos and he
actually works for real companies you
know I mean he's in the industry
he works for I believe for meteor the
framework he works for that company so
he's like a real developer there's a lot
of people who are here on YouTube who
don't even call it like they code on
their own time but I am a strong
believer in in like if you don't if
you're not in the industry don't give
opinions don't give advice about share
in the industry because the last time
you was in the industry was in the 1990s
you know what I mean like don't give
opinions about when you're not in
the industry like you're doing stuff
from your house you haven't worked in a
business in over ten years don't give
opinions about it you know what I mean
you know and then this there's the
dweebs there's a couple of dweebs out
there too a couple of dweebs
youtubers do you know do that
you know high school they put them in
the closet
right in the locker room lock
them up is like left put the dweebs in
they're out of this I'm not hating on
not hating on the dweebs it's just just
