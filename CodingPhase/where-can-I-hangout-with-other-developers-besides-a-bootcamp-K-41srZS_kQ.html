again man coding fees.com your boys back
in night and did it again
guys listen today's question is hey man
first you you sharing your knowledge
it's awesome and I enjoy your content I
am in a position to go to UCI
extension coding bootcamp or continue
myself learning the reason I'm still
interested in the bootcamp even after
watching some of your videos on on it is
that I am lonely as AF can curse no more
guys
I'm censored okay so he says I need a
place to meet some people
IRL I don't know what that means - share
an interest in programming is there
anywhere I can do that
that won't cost 12,000 for a F bootcamp
man this sucks not being able to curse
um basically you can just go to meet up
man so let's say you meet ups right
like right now this is what I tell
people all the time you don't need to
spend your money on a bootcamp just for
the experience of feeling like hey you
want to be around other people that want
to learn how to become developers or be
around other developers like there's a
lot of meetups out here guys you can
just come here let's say let's find one
okay hold on man they changed the whole
page you see sometimes you know
sometimes this is why I get pissed off
like websites come in like you want to
search for saying why do I have to click
on something to go in and basically
search for an event okay but anyway so
you go to meetups
right and there from here you can see
web development see what's out there
right see right here is a Long Island
meetup Suffolk meetup this or things are
close to me know on Long Island
JavaScript group you know you got a fine
was going on in your area right and just
show up to these events and you know
sometimes I'll be honest sometimes it's
weird you like man I don't know who are
these people
where they come from you know what I
mean but it's fine
because at the same time it's like
that's what you're there for you you
want to meet up with other peoples right
and you don't need you know sometimes we
feel like man we need to to belong to
somewhere to be like oh yeah I got the
stamp of I'm going to this boot camp or
I'm part of this group guys that's all a
mental ding you don't need to have that
stamp behind you to basically be like
hey I'm more developer because I went to
the school or I'm a developer now I'm
hanging out with other developers it
feels good sometimes but it's not needy
you know you could come to a meet-up if
you really need it where you like man I
need to meet up with other people like
me go to meetups go to meetups calm
search your area see other developers
out there go to the events and yeah you
know that's that's the best way and it's
free a lot of times it's free sometimes
they might ask you for a donation $5
donation $10 donation you know you they
renting out a spot for you at least you
can pay is far out of send out that's
fine you know it's like you know most of
the time they have food and they have a
whole bunch of stuff so it's like in
reality you're gonna eat that up
I've been to places where people get
twisted you go over there to code and
there's people popping Heinekens and
getting drunk and you see me in the
corner popping champagne I ain't now but
I've been to places where people get
drunk on wine wining cheese you know so
you know there's a lot of places like
that but listen man you don't need to
spend $20,000 if that's the reason
that's a really bad excuse to throw away
$20,000 I'm being honest listen I'm
pretty sure you say hey you throw on
Craigslist hey I'm looking for somebody
to you know help me with programming or
or whatever somebody's gonna be out
there for less than $1,000 they'll be
your best friends
you know what I mean is like even myself
you need somebody to talk to
talk to me man like you know it's like
or just be in the community I'm not
saying like you're needing and doesn't
that because it does feel good I'll be
honest when you're around developers it
definitely feels good because other
people are going through the same
struggles that you're going through it
somebody might find the answer and help
you out and this and that and those are
the things that are good from a bootcamp
but the fact that is 12,000 to 20,000
dollars to me is too much because it's
like in three months that's like wow
that's like $4,000 a month you know what
I mean like for what to just hang out
with people like to me I just don't
think it's worth it like I'd rather just
you know if you really want to do it go
to like I don't know even know Community
College Community College take a
computer science course people think
like you have to be a computer science
major to take a computer science course
you don't have to all you have to do is
say hey I want to take this course
that's it don't let you take it alright
I'll see you guys later make sure you
subscribe make sure you like this video

lifestyle of helping you guys out pretty
much we're doing this full-time listen

long term okay guys I love you guys stay

you know if you smart right now today is
what today is uh
xx by the end of the month no more say
bye to the farm specials man you know
it's time for me to eat you know I can't
live off three dollars guys I can't live
over three dollars but if you sign up
now
that means forever you're one of the
users that been paying five dollars and
you're always going to pay five dollars
now guys you gotta think about it like
this you helping me out I'm helping you
guys out but at the same time you know
let's end this video cuz this was
actually I usually like to do 10-minute
videos but this was such a quick
question like you know it's like bro
like you want to hang out with other
developers have you ever heard of
meetups like that's the best place like
you're good you don't need to throw
twelve thousand dollars at people trust
me like buy yourself a new car literally
or you know go move to a city that you
know that has a lot of developers or you
know there's so many things that you
could do by yourself
brand new MacBook you know people are
always like man I'm still stuck on this
Windows bro you're about to spend
$12,000 you know I'm not saying jeez you
but this I've seen there's a lot of
sounds he was like I'm about to just go
to this boot camp I'm like what you
working with
nothing just this new this new was a
lean oval that I got I'm like bro just
go to the Apple store and just buy
yourself a macbook like that's the least
you could do to start you off you know
what I mean like stop worrying about
giving your money away to people all of
this stuff you can learn online this is
not science if you was doing like let's
say machine learning I would say hey man
you gotta go to a place where they're
gonna really teach you all this stuff
cuz you need the background in math you
need to really understand what's going
on but this is what development this is
not to me it's not science there is more
about understanding functions and that's
a and understanding how programming
works that's a in HTML CSS which is not
even a programming language it's just
like synthetic you know markup language
you know what I mean so whatever
alright guys I'm out of here give it bow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
