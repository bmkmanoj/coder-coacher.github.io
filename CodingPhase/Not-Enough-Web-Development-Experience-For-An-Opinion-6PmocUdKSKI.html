again alright guys so this is a response
to something that I was watching from
this guy's name Chris Hawks alright
witcha I love his channel cuz he
sometimes he says some that is just
plain honesty you know just being honest
with you like I see it all the time a
lot of people leave comments here like
oh you're talking about PHP you're
talking about laravel you're talking
about crystal Ling you should be using
kno jes but then when you you ask them
like men what's your experience what
experience do you have of you know
creating real live web applications then
they come to you and they're like oh you
know I've been doing a couple of little
projects on github I have a couple of
projects and give her but the frico camp
and this and that and it's like broke
you don't have to right to have an
opinion like that's to be honest with a
lot of you guys if you guys have not
made real web applications in real life
not talking about in situations of you
making a little project for github and
and following from freako camp if
you haven't created a real life project
where you have multiple uses you have a
you know
user authentication you will have a
payments in our gateway you have a whole
bunch of other that you need in
basically in a web application if you
don't have known none of those things
and you never built one like you
shouldn't be giving opinions on the
internet like I'm just being honest you
guys should not be saying hey use no
tears for this doesn't that if you guys
never used it in a real-life application
you guys cannot say you
don't have experience to give an opinion
moaning you don't have enough experience
for it like that's just being honest
guys like if you haven't built enough
applications you should not be giving an
opinion on certain things you know and
that's why I always say this from the
beginning like when I first started to
learn how to become a web developer my
whole my whole point of view of it was
just like yo I must stay quiet imma
listen to other people I'm gonna listen
to what they gotta say and I'm gonna
take the best parts out of everybody's
but I never gave my opinion ever was
like oh I more I only have two months of
web development but I want to give her
an opinion on line and be like oh this
is the best view Jas is the best or
whatever backbone was the best
at the time you know what I mean like
what a mind to be giving out an
opinion when I don't have experience you
know what I mean who the hell am I to be
over here leaving comments and saying
you should be using this isn't this and
it's like Brody have you ever worked on
this have you ever worked in a large
company have you ever built real-life
web applications you know what I mean I
saw it I totally agree with Chris halls
what he's selling is like he was
basically talking about a jungle or was
a django django Django all right
right Django which is very similar to
Ruby on Rails very similar to laravel
which is full stack web development what
frameworks right so when you're building
websites you don't want to
reinvent the wheel if you know somebody
already created a user authentication
why were you want to use something like
passport which is a clusterfuck
for nodejs like no Jas is cool to build
like quick API stuff but it's not up to
par way a lot of the frameworks that are
out here like Clarabelle Ruby on Rails
Django like it's now up to par you just
cannot even compare it you know so it's
like I keep hearing people like leaving
comments like oh you should be using ojs
your whole stack should be no Jas and
say bro you you have three
months making websites and you
think you you have the the
enough experience to even give a
opinion like bro shut the up in and
just learn just learn from time and
experience that's how you gonna learn
you leaving dumb comments out here and
I'm saying that Oh narrow super old Ruby
on Rails are super old letter bro you
don't know what the you're talking
about you know and that's just how I
feel about it you know I just think a
lot of people don't know what the hell
they're talking about they don't have
enough experience to give an opinion
it's that simple you know and then it
kind of messes it up for other people
because then they'll be there on a chat
room it's like right now somebody come
in here and be like the harry
potter framework is the best and then
everybody start following that until I
oh man the harry potter framework you
know maybe crystal Ling is not that good
maybe what Joe is working on it's not
that good because you know user XYZ he
left a comment saying the harry potter
framework is the best one in sight now
you're you're driving those people
in the wrong direction because you're
giving an opinion on something that you
don't even know you know what I mean sup
definitely agree with Chris Hawks in
that Lake you gotta have enough
experience for you to be able to just
jump in and start giving an opinion guys
like you know there's not a role about
just being a junior developer that's
another subject right there like you
gotta give guys who are senior level
guys who have been around for a while
give them their respect just be
like okay this person has been through
it he knows more than me because he's
been doing this for a long time there's
gonna be certain technologies that
you're you might know more than them
because most people don't have time to
learn a million different technologies
but you gotta give that person their
respect you know they have five
years ten years in this so you gotta
give them their respect you know what i
mean so that's all I'm saying you dig
anyway anyways man let me see what's
good what's good with everybody in here
Jerome is like y'all I just want to get
a job man and yeah you could get a job
bro just come here learn you know and
don't take everything that I tell you
that's gospel you know take what
i tell you go to chris hawks go to Chris
Sean go to Erin on beta go to go to Eric
go to everybody's channel go to simple
programmer go to everybody's channel and
get what you want out of it and then you
make your decision what works for you
you know what I say is not gospel what
what I say is I give you a more higher
level of things like I found this
channel which is was I think the coding
train or something like that which is
pretty legit
pretty legit I'm not gonna lie
guys I like the guy I'm surprised I
haven't found until now I think his
channels called the coding train or
something like that you guys search it
up on YouTube find his channel he's
pretty legit he's dropping some very
good tutorials and they're very
technical you know but like I always say
my channel is not supposed to be
technical my channel is hey you could go
and learn kno jes from a guy who's gonna
teach you know Jas in the technical way
or you could come to me where I'm gonna
talk to you like your friend lake I'm
not come in with big ass words that
you're not gonna understand I'm gonna
talk to you in a higher level
where it's just plain English you know
what I mean yeah the dude is pretty
legit I'm surprised I have a founder I'm
very surprised to have a founder
Thank You Adrienne I'd love to see girls
in here man I like to see I feel like
I'm bringing up the the you know the
population populations of girls up in
here you know cuz it's good to see more
you know more people of color more girls
more minorities is good man is
definitely good well Matt that's why I
told you that's what I'll be telling you
guys like you know a lot of people come
to youtube and they do a lot of videos
on YouTube but they averaging you know
ten percent of their subscribers me I'm
averaging you know half of my
subscribers or at least forty-five
percent of my subscribers you know
that's what I'm averaging out here you
know what i mean so when i drop a video
I know the views is gonna be at least
above thirty five percent of the views
you know and that's because people like
my channel they like me for who I am and
they're like how I explain things to
them
you know what i mean so yeah exactly i
got the squad up in here you know so
it's like that's the thing is like I
know like once i get to once i get to
that fifty thousand a hundred thousand
subscribers you know we gonna be golden
man cuz i know i could somehow make this
 into a living and i'm not saying
i'm trying to milk you guys cuz i'm not
but the only way that I would do it will
be like putting advertising on my own
channel but not making you guys paid for
it you know what i mean so i will make
it in a way where i will be able to
sustain myself but be able to do this
24-7 because that's what i want to do i
don't want people to be like oh I gotta
pay a subscription for this
I don't want to deal with that I don't
know have to pay for anything I know
there's other ways of making money just
enough to live I'm not looking to be
like oh I want to make a million
dollars that's not what I want I just
want to be able to pay my rent and if I
can buy my baby a little ps4
game once in a while that's it you know
so I know once i get to know a hundred
thousand subscribers i could make this
 into something proper you know and
i'm super excited to work by the end of
this year i should have at least 15,000
to 20,000 subscribers and then by next
year is going to be 50,000 so it's gonna
go like that you know it's gonna take a
23 year it's like a 23 year plan but we
get in there man or you never know we
might have a viral video that go up and
we just might start getting some crazy
numbers
yeah man I mean you know you know what I
mean can click like if I make a milli
fine cool that's great but that's not
the goal for me you know it's like I
just want to get to the bare minimum
where I'm like okay what's not bare
minimum right now you know right now at
this moment I'm making about 3,000 to
4,000 a month right and that's from my
online businesses and everything that
I'm making now if I could double that up
then I'm good then I don't have to work
full time then I could just focus on
making content and making websites for
you guys to enjoy and you know that's
the goal you know if I want to become
 millionaire I'll probably we
just start doing what other people are
doing here on YouTube just start making
 courses and just be like hey
guys by my course how to
print hello world like people do that
 all the time like they give you the
most the most ugliest web
application you can make or they make
like they charge you money to make a
 to the web and it's like you
can't make a website Adam out of that
it's like if I make a course or
something it has to be a complete full
project what a good design would a good
um you know user authentication
 databases a nice framework
that's the only way that we charge
somebody ten dollars four chords
bum I wouldn't be charging people I send
somebody charging for like on you to me
somebody was charging ten dollars learn
how to use Adam learn how to use vs code
it's like you charging people for
something that's gonna take you to three
hours come on man you know I can't do
that I can't I can't be a milker that's
how we call it in the marina
people that just come to the Internet to
milk it but yeah man if any of you guys
may want to check out my boys channel
king flip search on Google
search on youtube hit up the googles
check your boy king flip your boy is
nice man his channel is like about
everything and I just like the way he uh
you know I'm one of those people that I
like the way somebody speaks if I feel
like they speak to me as if I'm their
friend I'm just talking to them like I'm
talking to my friend I loved their
channel and that's what King flipped got
so if you guys want to check him out man
can flip man we supposed to do something
you know although collaboration I'm
waiting on him see where he's not busy
you know but your board came flip he's
definitely doing his thing milk bounty
here is the word you know yeah man yeah
man we gotta work on something for real
man you need to stop slacking I know
you'd be doing videos like a four in the
morning I can't I can't wake up that
early but we gotta do one at least you
know one day in the nighttime man you
gotta have at least one day in the night
time like after seven o'clock p.m. which
is I think you're in the central time
you like Mae West know so when it's like
seven year is six o'clock over there so
shouldn't be that bad
what's up with the snack channel I don't
even have slack I know your head I have
slack but I have it for work so I gotta
create an account that's personal so
it's like you know I usually look at it
if it's something from work you know I
know you guys you got the the slack
channel working but you know it's hard
man what are without Christian yeah man
let me know so try to get in on
Wednesday King flip let's try to do this

gonna i'm gonna try to jump on it and
ray I'm definitely gonna try to jump on
it I just I don't even have on my phone
I don't have slack on my phone I need to
get on it for sure yeah man the rocky
stag I'm telling you guys like I'll be
honest it's not bringing anything else
that's new besides of ruby on rails on
larimer right as far as the framework
it's not really bringing anything this
you'd be like oh my god is amazing but
what it's amazing is that you're doing
it in crystal language is faster than
all the languages out there right now
it's almost to the level of C so if you
guys look it up c is like you know the
high benchmark of everything it's like
okay see it's the fastest one and
basically crystal Lang is up there
but you know the whole rocky stack is
just supposed to be helping you guys out
introduce you to web development like
full stack web development not just like
okay guys let's build a little page like
no that's not really what development
that's just doing some in the front
end I'm talking about the full stack
meaning hey how to build databases how
to create relationships how to set up
layouts how to use template engines you
know all those stuff you who implement
it to every other language and every
other framework out there so yeah man
like Matt said man make sure you join
together man we in there man plus I
don't know yet I'm numb maybe I should
make a video about this but just because
you guys are here and I know you guys
are always my day-ones I'm thinking
about giving out five hundred five
hundred dollars for my 5000 subscribers
right not so every single one but you
know five hundred dollars for you know
for it giving me five thousand
subscribers so I might be doing that so
you guys tell me what you guys think I
don't know if I might split it up and be
like okay I give a hundred dollars to
five people or I might just give five
hundred dollars to one person yeah if
you join Christian if you joined up I'm
gonna set it up the same way how did the
courses i was given our free courses i'm
gonna set it up through where you gonna
add your email and your name and then
from there if your thing comes up it's
gonna be a random number if your number
comes up then you know i'm just gonna
give the money up
man I wish if I had if I had the money
like them and if I was like one of this
 youtubers kids these people here
who they made a lot of money and
that she always pisses me off when I'm
like I watch a lot of youtubers and I'm
like wait you got like five ten million
subscribers and you making twenty thirty
thousand dollars a month and you don't
give nothing back to nobody like what
the that's how I'm always like what
the like it just don't sound right

get something poppin and we all their
collaborations cross collaboration and
at the end of the day that has helped
out all of us because there's people
that go to crash on our Channel and
they'd be like y'all coding face
