it again man : face calm listen
alright so people been asking me what
are some tips to basically not get fired
right in the first job some tips that I
can't actually give you guys all right
very simple number one which is this is
something that a lot of people make you
know leave curse words in your comments
or in your console lot sometimes you
testing something like I'm guilty of it
I always use I gonna be like
top hat or I'll put a BS or
whatever a lot of times you do that and
you never know when your code is gonna
go to production sometimes little things
like that slip but I remember Kay a few
years ago and a company that I used to
work for he actually went it had a
comment was like I hate working
here thought out whatever so in his head
he was thinking like maybe nobody was
gonna read that but it happens that the
CTO was going over everybody's get login
so for some reason he found the fire and
he was like hey and he actually made an
example of him and basically said hey
guys this exactly what you guys cannot
believe and he said pick up your things
you better get ready and go to HR that's
it once they send you to HR that means
they're gonna give you a little goodbye
package where they okay bye-bye
alright so that's the way to get fired
another way to get fired quick is taking
advantage meaning yeah you're working at
your job right but then you have side
projects so you have side projects right
and if you work at a certain company it
doesn't matter what company it is and
they find out that you're working on
side projects on their hour
basically you're getting fired it's that
simple you know it's nothing more to it
it's like you know well even if they
even think that you're working on their
time they will fire you alright
so make sure if you're doing your side
projects do it at 5 o'clock once you
leave just keep it simple
save yourself the headache so
what's the next thing ok
also number three coming into work late
alright a lot of times you know as
developers were salary and we have like
a little special thing going on where
the employers don't really care what
time you come in as long as it's
reasonable and you actually state made
it
I'm song if you're coming in if your
time is from 9:00 to 5:00 and you come
in at 11 o'clock and then when you're
coming at 11 o'clock you leave her
father o'clock on the dot somebody at
one point they're gonna keep on seeing
then they're gonna be like yo this guy's
only doing like 6 hours and he not only
like that
he also ticking his lunch break so
people do notice those things right so
don't take advantage guys because
somebody will slit somebody will be like
hey why am i working eight hours and
this guy comes in and he only worked six
hours and leaves here on time but he
never gets here on time all right
another thing is basically copying
somebody else's code right sometimes we
do that all the time like you know we
basically go with we find something on
Stack Overflow or whatever but if you
copy another company's code like when
you go into somebody's source and
somehow you untie their JavaScript and
then from there you're going to copy
line by line and it's exactly the same
way and then for whatever reason the
other company finds out which is a
competitor or whatever
they will fire you at your company
because not only can they get sued but
it just looks bad man like yes you could
make the same thing with let's say right
now we could go in and have something
like treble right I could go in and make
Trello
a clone of it but I can't go into
triangles code and copy the code that it
has I have to rewrite it all over again
and make it my own words in my own code
it's that simple
all right guys and also number five is
losing control sometimes you dealing
with assholes and everybody knows that
like you work at a place and people are
just straight-up
assholes like there's no way around it
you know you can't work with them
whatever but you have to keep it
professional you can never take it to
the point where you're like you know
what let's fight you know what let's
start screaming in the office you know
what let's start cursing at each other
you cannot do that that's automatically
getting fired like it or not because now
you're basically building a hostile
environment for everybody else in the
office and they're like you know what I
mean why the hell do we have this both
of these guys or sometimes they they
might choose the favor you know what I
mean like they might choose like hey
Johnny Johnny's been there for four
years and you just came in here last
year they're gonna go for Johnny over
you so they're gonna fire your ass and
John is gonna be staying there what a
big smile on his face and most likely
you would never see that person ever
again in your life so now you lost your
job now you don't have the money in your
pocket and now you and your family are
living on the bridge all right it's that
simple guys just keep it professional
all right so I just gave you thing five
situations apart basically how to get
fired right away so all I could say is
guys just keep it professional listen to
