face.com
your boys backing out and did it again
alright guys so pretty much we're going
to start a new series this new series is
about how to make money independently
right so the title of is how to make
independent money from your web
development skills and what does that
mean you know I was like people probably
thinking in the head like oh man like
what like I'm kind of freelance I'm
gonna do this and I like no we're
talking about put your skills to use
alright let's put your skills to use
have you ever gone to let's say CSS
generator or like let's say gradient all
right let's see this colorzilla dot-com
right the person that built this he gets
a steady income from this website right
because this a major website everybody
comes here okay
everybody has used this before or like
let's say another one like CSS Matic
there's another one so you can see
that's advertising right here and the
reason why I'm showing this because I'm
pretty sure a few of you guys have used
a little a little micro mini micro tiny
little service like that right but
there's more angry tools gradient like
I'm pretty sure you guys have seen this
right you see ads right but everybody
use those right and at the same time
it's like how long does they really take
you to build something like that not
that long right but the end of the day
those guys are making money so I want to
show you guys how to make money like
that and other better ways okay so let's
get started
okay fine an industry could be
healthcare finance service many more you
know there's a lot of different
industries that you can find it doesn't
have to be just in web development you
know cuz even like right now
let's say somebody created a flexbox
generator I haven't seen
but one of you guys could build that
right but do you really have to get
stuck in just doing what development
stuff now you could do a whole bunch of
different things like these people that
do you know little applications for
Facebook and they make money of that
these guys that go in and create you
know income calculators and stuff like
that like they make money you know I
mean so those are the things that we
really want to focus on you know other
stuff that's not really dedicated just
for you know developers and designers we
want to build stuff that the general
public really use you know so find an
industry but at the same time you must
have some type of interest in it you
can't just be like hey I'm gonna choose
the bowling industry I found a way to
keep track of the pimples or whatever I
don't know I never play bowling but you
know what I mean like you have to do the
research you have to actually come in
and think about it be like hey like am i
passionate about this industry do I know
enough about the industry because the
whole point of it is for you to solve
problems you know that's why the title
says hey what problems can you solve in
that industry
if you're not passionate about that
industry you have no idea what that
industry is about or you don't have a
friend that knows what it and what you
know what they need whatever you're
going to create is gonna be meaningless
it's gonna be useless
so you gotta have some type of passion
for it so at the same time you gotta do
the research and I'm gonna continue
bringing this keyword up research you
got to do the research on your own to
figure out what are the things that you
can help out with okay now one thing
that I'm going to tell you everything
that you can think of can be done on the
web right you know somebody told me the
other day man I have this great
application in my head and but you know
I gotta send the text to somebody wait
you could do that and there's literally
API sent X API
this was the name truly Oh
usually Oh before there's an API for
that you could literally send text to
people you could come in and keep track
of people through notifications through
their phones and there's so many
different API is out there like
literally queue almost do everything
that you could think of through the web
okay
especially because everybody has you
know a big phone wisdom it's like who
has you know who's who's walking around
with an iPhone for you know what I mean
like everybody's using iPhone 5 minimum
you know nobody's using the iPhone 4
people have I four five six seven eight
like we were pretty advanced right now
you know it's like the no 8 no 7 like
people are pretty much walking around
with a laptop on their hands okay so
worried about a domain mmm what does
that mean you know cuz now you got the
idea like you're like okay I got an idea
but you're like man all the domains they
already taken everything has been taken
already I don't know what to do
guys start worrying about the domain you
know so what they they already took you
know how to order cookies in one button
com like who cares you know stop
worrying about that start worrying about
the domain name the domain name is
actually secondary like nobody cares
about that no more
you know why because now Google doesn't
go by hey is this you know let's say for
example comic books calm you could
literally search probably like comic
books and comic books come it's not
gonna show up right now like as the
first search result comic books
let's see ok make town comics
let's see DC comics Yelp my comic shop
dread it okay comic book calm is
somewhere in there in the front page but
look how far they are by the time people
get through here they're not looking at
what's down here I'm being honest like
it's gotta be rare that anybody's gonna
be like oh you
comic book calm and the only reason that
this calm is really there is because
it's probably been here since like the
beginning of time yes like this website
super old like you look into it and see
how was builders like he's walking
around with like Perl or something you
know what I mean like nobody cares about
the dot-com no more because it's it's
all about can people find you you know
and if Google decides to leave you you
know for you to get popular right and
you could become popular on your own you
can literally come in and do a little
marketing you could come in and share
some some of your your pages to other
people already product uncom I mean we
gotta go deep into all of that later on
but for now let's just leave it for for
last just focus on the product man
don't focus on worrying about oh my god
my domain is not there I'm not gonna
build it no don't worry about that start
simple if the project needs hundreds of
developers you failed
automatically now I bring this up
because somebody who are considered my
mentor the person who motivated me to
really do everything that I'm doing
right now is this guy code level style I
don't even know his real name
I just know him as levels dire like and
you would think like hey he don't have
a.com
he don't have four or whatever somehow I
found this guy alright now what's cool
about him is he made twelve startups in
twelve months right each one of them
were pretty much like dumb ideas I'll be
honest but it's the fact that he was
like hey man I'm just gonna work and one
month for each like little startup you
know selling stickers and stuff like
that like he just you know started
making money like it sounds really dumb
when you think about it but the dumb
things in this world are the things that
are successful the things that you'd be
like oh snapchat oh yeah like I could
have thought of that Oh
Instagram like oh yeah just upload your
photos and let everybody press like on
it yeah
I would have thought of that like all of
those things are already there you know
but those little dumb ideas are the ones
that really get popular so he came up
with this idea of nomads lists cuz he
actually travels all over the world
mostly through Asia at the time he was
you know backpacking through Thailand he
was like man nobody has a website where
you know people can come in and share
their their experience about how was the
you know the villa that they rented the
room that they rented the apartment that
they rented or how much did it cost him
to really live in that that city that
town that country so he pretty much just
created this right so if you go to his
website levels that I owe you will see
how he actually built all of this stuff
right he started very simple very very
simple and you know as the website
starts getting bigger and bigger
he started adding new things and then
after new things come up you know he
said you know what let's start charging
people so now Nomad list that I owe I
believe has fucka look 250,000 plus data
points which means it's like cities and
in areas and apartments that people have
reviewed over the years now I want to
see the community cuz that's where the
money comes in Missy people is it people
yeah so a whole bunch of people get to
so see it I mean anybody can join and
this website's so simple guys I'm
telling you ahead of time like you come
to this website you'll be like wait
people are actually members of this
website and it's so simple
yeah because it gives them value you
know what I mean like whatever community
they're from like they're pretty much
backpackers and and digital nomads and
freelancers who travel all over the
world but they make their money you know
what I mean so for him he's good
he makes up
like 60 70 grand per month just from
this website alone now he got this other
website which is called I believe his
hood maps that IO or dot-com hood maps
dot-com which is hilarious and it's
funny to me because I had the same idea
of like to actually come in and create
some type of map that shows people hey
this is a good neighborhood system bad
neighborhoods and this is pretty much
what he built you know the only
difference is he lets everybody that
comes to the website join and basically
highlight the area like hey Green is
where the money side or red is where the
Taurus is that blue is the blue collars
uni is the university kids and normies
is just regular people you know and
sometimes it's good sometimes people use
it for something else but um yeah so
definitely it's like when you think
about it it's ideas that are very simple
but are very profitable just because you
are a developer doesn't mean that you
have to work for a company 24/7 like you
know you always tell people you always
have to have an exit plan you know what
I mean like at some point you're gonna
be like hey I want to create something
cool like you know there's only so far
that you can go in your career as a
developer and be like hey yeah I work
for Google and then was next NASA okay
you work for NASA okay what's next
like what goes after that you know what
I mean like you gotta have goals and you
gotta have aspirations of things that
you want to do so there's a great way
for you to start that journey of
building things on your own and I'm
telling you from my own experience I've
actually made a lot of money on my own
like aside from YouTube everybody thinks
that I make money from YouTube guys I
make literally $300 from YouTube it's
kind of embarrassing
three hundred dollars you know what I
mean I don't make money from here like
there's no how pay my bills is not how I
survive but how
five is creating small services micro
services creating different type of
websites putting my skills to the test
all right think about it like this let's
say CSS generator right let's say great
engineer a generator or a border-radius
generator the creator of those websites
right he has both of those websites
right each one generates him twenty five
hundred dollars per month each one of
them right how much is that five
thousand dollars per month
all right now you come here you but I
okay what we gonna do we're gonna flood
the internet with micro-services yes and
no because you gotta think about it like
this like when you create something as
long as you give value to the people
people are always gonna come back no
matter what even though I know how to do
this it's easier for me to say hey
border-radius
generator and come here like this and
click on border that's radius calm and
come here and put in five and then come
here putting seven coming here put in
twenty three come here put in to
whatever the situation might be I don't
have to write all of this stuff you get
what I'm saying like it just makes my
life easier and this ads is right here
every time that I come here this guy
gets to eat because of me what's his
name Jacob Balaji let's look at Jacob
Balaji some guy he got a saying like
some guy just traveling the world
chillin like focusing on stuff that he
wants to build on you know what I mean
like he's not working for a company he's
not stuck anywhere he's out there in the
world building cool stuff things that
he's passionate about you know what I'm
saying so look at this like you know
you'd think about anybody
oh man like this guy gets paid to do
this yeah like he pretty much pays
himself for creating different you know
different things and just be you know
using the skills that he already has you
know
and this is why I want to give you guys
right cuz if tomorrow
god forbid i die god forbid something
happens to me I want you guys to have
this you know and be like hey man I
remember Joe same way how I look at
levels that I owe I want you guys to
look at me at that same level man Joe
put me on to this Joe helped me out so
pretty much I've become more independent
right
I'm not saying hey don't work I'm not
saying don't work in a company but I'm
saying like hey you don't have to be
worried about that like if you have
multiple incomes you don't have to worry
about Oh am I making enough money to
survive what if my boss fires me what if
this doesn't that now you never should
be in that situation you should always
have plan B Plan C plan D plan a friend
Z it doesn't matter
you got what I'm saying so yeah now
don't focus too much on the stack don't
focus too much on the stack don't come
in and be like oh man I wanna focus on
you know who's gonna be the best thing
that's gonna scale guys you don't have a
product yet who cares how it scales
right somebody out there is pulling
their hair right now and saying how how
is this guy saying don't worry about
scaling guys this website sliced calm is
very popular I use every single day a
lot of people use it every single day
you know what is it bill or Ruby on
Rails you know what is building on
highlight Jay yes like jQuery moderniser
hammer Jas like we're talking about like
very simple stuff you know yes it has a
little bit of no GS for API calls but
that got added later on that's not what
this website was built on you know what
I'm saying sometimes you got a prototype
things and you gotta build things as
soon as possible and that's what it's
gonna make you you know a better
developer it's not about hey man we got
you know the latest thing we got gold
lamÃ© and we have you know angularjs
with a mix of you know Redux with mole
bags both on the same website just to
say hey we cool
we're using everything now just build
something get your product out and then
from there you're gonna be good okay so
use whatever you know alright guys now
let's get started with this idea all
right you guys are seen in this video if
you've seen this this is probably the
introduction to the whole series this is
probably the introduction to you know
the course itself because there's gotta
be two parts of this there's gonna be
the serious time I'm gonna put on
YouTube which is everything that has to
deal with planning everything that has
to deal with the design part everything
that has to deal with the idea itself
we're putting in here on YouTube for you
guys now for those of you guys that want
to say hey I like this this content I
like what I'm hearing here I'm like what
I'm seeing and I want to build the
project also then you know you gotta
come to my website coding face.com and
that's what you're gonna get everything
you're gonna get the course you gotta
get you know the full project being
built plus every single other video that
comes with this series okay so I'll see
you guys later
it's your boy Joe love you guys take
care bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
