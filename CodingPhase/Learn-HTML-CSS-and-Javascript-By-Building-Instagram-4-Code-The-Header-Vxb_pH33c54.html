so we already set up the volume man we
already set up get and all the files so
now let's start coding right okay very
simple I got this image right and this
how are we going to make the Instagram
right we have to Lowe's just exactly how
I'll show you guys and let's get it
poppin all right so let's say okay do
this so remote let's start with the
header header way and then so it's up to
how do we have four links and then
inside of that we have four icon okay so
let's do that all right you can do it
like this
actually it's very simple you know
missing what exactly is it that it has
set off the home link to search the
lights and profile okay home links
search must losers copy this all right
so what I'm doing is I just copying this
stuff right so let's see home search
like profile all right so here we're
going to put the icon right so let's go
to front off of the aisle right and
we're going to come here we're going to
go to icon and then I say home
you click here come here come here
put it in here right then we got a
common search after that we want to come
search for blows a fridge yeah forget
this search and now we come here and
search Bulls done within from a heart
okay so we search heart heart it's like
that just the outline and then profile
we come back we say loser
this call let's see if that works
one mushroom yeah because remember we
got to put in the fun awesome link to it
so we come here in search CDN hot dog
song let's try this one
all right lay this one put it in there
it should be working on it yeah we got
the icon so this home we gotta put it
like that yeah all right now we've got
those four things alright so those are
the four links okay now let's mess
around with the CSS so some reason I
left is background yellow don't worry
about it we could change this to
whatever alright let's go
color adobe.com click here little
desktop Instagram layout basically let's
get all the colors for this right
yeah
you'll make us dinner yes mark
alright thankfully got all the colors
right
you see
all right so we got the little bit of
colorful histogram right now let's see
it this I hate that you got to sign up
okay save
all right so there's like the top of it
that Graham is light all right so we say
come back over here we say hey
background slight also I forgot you
could change it through here then what
we supposed to actually do the code
which is SAS supposed to come to the SAS
I see me back I should be changed
yeah now missing walls the color Heather
this was a color FAA should be changed
yeah now we need a CSS reset that's sure
please take this on doesn't really
matter put this on the top already have
all right so change them now we have
everything the right place you see we
start with no padding on top everything
starts from scratch
alright so we're going to say if I hear
what the heck the links inside of the
header we're going to make the width
just what if off the set and we want to
say display:inline-block right and then
we're going to say margin left - 3
pixels wide - six weeks
no are you please all right now what
we're going to do is a finesse a
text-align:center
so at the center the icon now we have
two icon the center right now let's see
what's the color of the icon
cut out the icons is like Effie a color
yeah you say that now
punch sighs let's do 20 pixels
incomplete little bigger than that
should be like 25 pixels yeah
now let's do keep adding say 12 pixels
total white that being affected by that
now display oxide in water box all right
now to adding its location
all right so we got that now that's the
header right there let's say pretty
similar to it because we don't have the
exact icons from Instagram now let's do
a little bolder has like a little light
color so let's say below the header we
do something like this
Boehner bottom one pixel solid
and collector CeCe that's like a grayish
I see that it works yeah yeah there you
go
now let's say I wanted to target this
thing all right I could say hey so what
I did when I set FA what I target was
basically I target every class that is
FA all right but if I want to target a
specific class like a say hey I want to
target this icon here that has FA home
or Fe search LSE heart I could go in but
remove that I'll go in here and say hey
and F a whole Leslie Hart one that I got
yet heart that's all actually heart
that's all let's go and let's make this
on color that's going to this color
right all right
you see well that does with that so why
not right let's do like this take this
matter of fact I wanted that when I go
over to box which is a remember right
now let's eat background right
oops sorry guys
yeah you see each one is a different box
but that's because of of the you know
because I'm targeting the anchor right
so there's an anchor and then we have to
icon the top of it so when I did the
hover on top of the heart and return
read it but I would like for it when I
turn it on go over the anchor for the
heart to go read so the way to do that I
will say hey I want when the heart is
hovered make F a make summer actually
heart
alright now that's your move touch from
here you see so long when I'm hover it
anywhere on the link the heart turns red
pretty soon pretty cool right alright
