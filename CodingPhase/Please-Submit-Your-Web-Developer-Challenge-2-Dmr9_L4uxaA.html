guys as far as the you know the web
developer challenge number two for some
reason I don't know it's lost I don't
know if it's the leader I don't know
what the hell happened but it's no
longer on on my channel so everybody
that actually submitted that what
developer challenge I don't have your
links can you guys please on this video
or even on any of my videos it doesn't
matter which video if you have the HTML
table page that you were supposed to
create for challenge number two please
submit it just leave a comment on any
video that you want so I could see it
and then from there we can start making
the video right now I know I think was a
lot Christopher Locke a lot of people
submitting right and for whatever reason
is not here it's not on my channel I
don't know if you yeah so to create a
HTML table right and then just display
data and just make it the best that you
can reign just make it look professional
make it like a nice page and then we
would choose the best one
okay that's the challenge for whatever
reason this thing I don't know why this
is happening but the video that I
created got the leading and then all the
people that actually submit it to it
they basically they added to the comment
section of that video but that video got
the leader so all the comments are gone
so now I can't even find the challenges
again so you could do either two things
leave a comment on this video or leave a
an email to me send me an email coating
face at gmail.com send it to me so we
could do this video today and we could
choose who's the winner for the second
challenge okay yes sir man we hear we
laugh and there's a quick life this is
just like a quick announcement
and yeah man I just want you guys to be
able to to come in and release your your
pages that you guys paid you know I
don't want you guys to make it for no
reason so I want to choose which one's
the best one I want to show every single
page to everybody here so I'm actually
recording videos right now as we speak
and like I said I just looked online I'm
like wait what the hell happened to this
live stream is not there no more you
know what I'm saying so it's crazy so
yeah man because I don't have to web
developer challenge
well the pages from you guys because I
don't have the comments anymore what I'm
going to do is I'm going to upload a web
developer portfolio now I didn't remove
it I'm trying to figure out I kind of
figure out if YouTube deleted a or what
the hell happened I don't know why it's
not there I usually have all my live
streams there and for whatever reason is
not there so I'm looking through all my
comments you know I usually see like
when somebody submits something I'll see
it on the comment section let me see
you're gonna see right now I keep
scrolling down
for whatever reason I can't see none of
the of the links that you guys sent me
it's crazy so I think the best way would
be to just send it to to my email guys I
don't know why YouTube is like removing
the links that you guys submitted I mean
it's good because it gives you guys
gives you time it could give you time to
actually come in and add this you know
so just matter of fact just email it
email it to me
coding phrase at gmail.com I don't know
why the the links are being deleted like
that sucks you know what I mean like
it's so much easier for you guys to
share your York open links through the
comment section but for whatever reason
every single link has been deleted the
deadline was supposed to be yesterday
you know yesterday I couldn't do the
video so I was like you still have extra
time but if you could do it by the end
of the day like maybe five o'clock send
me whatever you already have you know a
coding phase at gmail.com I know like
five six people I added their links to
the page and for whatever reason
YouTube's freaking deleting all the
links every single link like it's crazy
and there were like some really good
HTML tables man that I wanted to show
you guys it's like this from seven hours
ago to a while I was 14 I was gone one
day
that's crazy yeah man so just email me
the link to your campaign so we could
choose who's the winner of the second
web developer challenge okay so boy jump
back at it again right now I'm about to
record a web developer portfolio review
and from there we releasing today

choose which one is the best one
yes I don't have none of the links yes
sir
can you recommend a no js' course and
you me listen a half hour udemy course
I'm no js' course on my website where
you can literally get for ten bucks you
can get every single course that's on my
site go check it out we're building a
social network you're gonna learn how to
use nodejs now if you don't want to use
my my website and you just say hey Joe
I love you but I want to learn from
somebody else then I will recommend
what's this guy's name
Steven Grider has a good one but it's
like the myrn stack I don't know if
you're into that if you if you want to
focus just on nodejs I'm gonna tell you
right now how long we're going udemy.com
let me look to to my courses that I've
bought right now each others is legit
okay
the complete no js' develop of course
second edition by Andrew Meade that's a
pretty good course he's pretty legit man
so as far as nodejs
if you're not gonna buy anything for me
then I will say learn it from that guy
now if you really want to go under the
hood of no GS and you really want to
understand what the hell is no js' and
what the hell is VA what the hell is
Express how does those things work with
JavaScript how is javascript in the
backend then I will say learn and
understand no GS by Anthony Alice saith
that do it is it's legit he breaks down
those topics really really well plus
he's like one of the best instructors on
on udemy I'm surprised I wonder what
happened to him he hasn't released no
new videos or new courses since I don't
know maybe since like 2013 or some
but those videos that he has is like
really good when and what is the next
challenge well the challenge right now
we still on the second challenge because
we freaking lost everything we lost all
the links for whatever reason so what I
will say is you know this app keeps
crashing I'm pissed so um yeah
okay so the challenge is literally just
create a HTML table make it look nice
make it presentable of something that
you could be proud of and we would
choose which one is the best one yeah I
got a I got an iPhone here I go well you
got another iPhone here I'm probably
gonna have to use it for the live stream
whenever I do like this live streams
like doesn't gonna have to go with the
iPhone because you see you remember
yesterday house move everything worse in
the live stream like that was through an
iPhone like I don't know why you would
think like Google who owns Android who
owns YouTube will create an application
that works perfectly and it just doesn't
and it's like it keeps crashing you know
it's retarded
yeah I'm not a huge Android fan but or
iOS friend but I think I'm gonna have to
switch just not even switch because I
like having the flexibility that I have
with Android but I'm gonna have to have
the the iPhone here just for the live
streams because it doesn't crash you
know well hey it's app it's Apple it man
excuse me this Apple so you can't you
can't go wrong right so anyways guys new
portfolio review we're gonna be released
in the next hour so
we got a new video on lighting make sure
you go subscribe to that make sure you
go check that out and yeah man like I
said we're gonna be dropping all the
live streams here on coding face the
same way I've been doing which is you
know there's no way how I interact with
you guys but then we gotta have Lodi
which is gonna be just the content like
all the main content that I'm gonna have
like I'm gonna have stuff about how to
make money online you know what type of
jobs you could get remotely you know
it's gonna be outside of what
development is gonna be also including
things for what development right a lot
of you guys yeah I want to make passive
income so I'm here to help you guys out
I was like yeah always wondering Joe how
the hell do you get to do it how do you
stay at home how do you get to buy all
the you have how do you pay for
your and you don't go to work 24/7
as like bro
Lodi living off the internet man you
know what I mean
like I'm living off the internet the
Internet's my bitch you know what I'm
saying man listen Lodi man you know you
know how people we're saying uh you know
a few years ago like Yolo we bout to
make Lodi but we bout to make Lodi for
getting a national word out here you're
gonna say get the Lodi t-shirts get the
Lodi tattoos know what I mean Lodi kid
living off the internet man yeah man sup
I appreciate it guys I'll see you guys
later
make sure you email me the links guys I
need the links of the web developer
challenge number two which is the HTML
team table so we can actually see this
did you
what is your new channel inspired by 6:9
guy na na dhih was an idea that I had
before I even got on this channel I'm
gonna show you guys a little something
alright so I'm gonna show you guys a
little song so these are the channels
that I have under this account of Joe
Santos Garcia right before this thing
was a real web developer right this was
actually gonna be my lotta channel and
this this channel I created I think like
two years ago
like two years ago like I had the idea
of Lodi but like as you guys may know I
was working as a full-time developer
sorry have to the time to really build
it so that idea has been around since a
long time the only difference is that
now I say you know what I've been
wanting to do this Lodi channel for a
while and it's the perfect way for me to
actually create a new channel with
everything that I already learned over
the year you know being a youtuber in
the web development community right the
things people ask me John what was the
errors the mistakes that you made I'm
gonna make a full video about that right
now for me the things that I learned was
number one you gotta have engagement
right on your videos there's how the
whole algorithm works gotta have
engagement so you gotta have be forcing
people to constantly be like oh hashtags
day's over game leave a comment because
it is or leave a letter to the letter j
or or in the free game give a like
freakin do this this and that and you
know me I just come in do my content
want to be doing that you know I
don't want to be wasting my time with
that so you could either get your
channel popping like that with a lot of
engagement YouTube sees that and then
start showing your channel to everybody
or you could do it the other way which
is just create really good content and
keep the retention level high so on my
channel because of the live streams okay
because of the live streams the
retention level I'm going to show you
guys the analytics I'm gonna do a full
video on this probably this week because
I'm gonna I'm gonna also show to people
how to make money with YouTube how to
basically you know be able to make extra
thousand extra two thousand from YouTube
and I'm gonna teach you guys all the
tricks right so let me show you guys
this is a retention retention retention
watch time yeah audience retention okay
so look so because of all the live
streams and because I do so many videos
that are long and it's just me hanging
out with you guys and talking I did not
know like this was gonna really really
gonna like ruin my channel I didn't know
you know I didn't know no better
right and that's why you know a brand
new channel might pop up and have value
of better views than minds with shittier
content and that happens all the time
and the reason what happens is because
of this if you want to become a youtuber
think about this number if this number
is low that means that your channel is
not gonna go nowhere your channels gonna
barely grow even if you release you know
800 videos like me
right and 800 really good videos when
you do live streams like I've been doing
in long videos like 20 minutes 30
minutes half an hour videos what that
does is bring this dump this number down
this number needs to be above 50% which
means when somebody watches your videos
they need to watch your video for more
than 50% of the time so if the video is
10 minutes they need to watch them in
your video at least 5 minutes straight
everybody right if it falls below that
the 50% then now your channel and your
videos do not get shown to other people
you know you ever wonder like when you
go to let stage let's look right now
let's see I don't even know how to do
this ok new incognito window ok you come
here go to youtube search web developer
ok when I first came into the game my
videos were up here above full stack
above Krishan above everybody above
traverse media right right now they're
showing me laughs because you know when
you're live to show you they show you
here but my videos were way above
everybody ok
as soon as I started doing live streams
see like now I'm down here but I used to
have videos that were ranking all the
way at the top you see like this one is
another one that was good but that's not
even the ones that I'm targeting that
that keyword seen I got you came and
find those videos anymore right I mean
they show me here but you can't really
you know I was like this one ok so this
why become a worth develop in 2017 this
video alone was all the way at the top
all the way at the top
right and that's when I was getting my
views my subscribers I was popping right
the moment I started doing a whole bunch
of live streams then they just freaking
drop you know so live streams actually
hurt your channel this number right here
guys is the most important thing that
you guys got to really think about even
if you make a one-minute video right you
can make one with a one-minute video if
people watch that whole one-minute video
and you could say BS you could talk
 you could be clowning you could
be doing whatever the hell you you want
to do it on YouTube your video is
actually better than somebody else was
actually dropping real content grill
knowledge that people are looking
for because their videos might be longer
than the other people right so yeah
that's how it is ya know but um you
don't know JSI get the gland is supposed
to be a weekly thing yeah boy for me I
like to to be able to have on this I use
a YouTube well this channel like social
media you know what I mean I usually
like as if this was Instagram as if this
was Facebook where I just come in and be
able to talk to you guys and and hang
out with you guys live like if I wake up
right now in a mood to talk to you guys
I want to talk to you guys right my
channel shouldn't be hurt by that but
the way how YouTube looks at it they
look at it as if this was a full video
you know well the thing about Switch is
that nobody's on Twitch like the
audience is not on Twitch I'm not gonna
go to twitch because that's like me
starting from zero I'm not planning on
starting from zero like I'm putting so
much time into this channel and into
YouTube like for me to throw away a
whole year I'm not going to move
and to be honest with you guys you know
but anyways it's not it's not like I'm
complaining or anything that's just how
it is that's part of the game right
that's part of the game and what's cool
about it is I hey now I know you get
what I'm saying like now I know the
reason why I didn't know all this
you know like for the past out of six
seven months I was like you guys have
heard me complaining by killing me I
don't know what to do that uh I don't
know what's going on don't know why my
why the hell I'm dropping great content
but nobody sees it I create amazing
tutorials that people could really learn
you know and my does does not rank
and does not go no way that I'm showing
nowhere you know what I mean and it's
because of that if you don't have a
higher retention rate especially when
you do livestream it brings your numbers
down man so once your numbers are down
it's like think about it like this I got
800 videos right in the average because
of so many live streams is 20% right for
me to bring that that percentage up I
were to drop another 800 videos right
and then I need to drop another 800
videos which means a whole nother year
on coding phase of like dropping math
videos that nobody's gonna see like I
don't want to be doing that like you
know it's like I don't want to be in
here like talking to you guys talking to
you guys about something that you know
only like five of you guys is gonna see
you get what I'm saying when I know like
when I look like Leslie traversing media
traversing media is the perfect example
of knowing how many people are really
into web development out here so there's
like 300,000 people who are really into
it cuz everybody that's in there is
because they they're really
I'll here to work right so that tells me
that's the number that's out there
that's the number that I could reach
right now I will never reach it if my
percentage is sold so low you gotta say
because of my live streams yeah man I
dropped mad content man you know what I
mean like I dropped mad videos like mad
different type of videos over one year
like that's 800 videos you know what I'm
saying that's like what my average is
higher than everybody else like all the
other channels that you see out there
like literally when I look at the graph
my numbers are higher than them right as
far as like the videos per day I'm like
I'm like that three videos per day and
most people only drop like one video or
0.8 video per per day it's like I'm up
there I put in that work so it's like
it's time to start start getting in that
yeah and I'm like you got what I say so
I'm still gonna drop another 800 videos
this year all right
the only difference is I'm gonna drop
probably 300 videos here on coding phase
and I'm gonna drop 500 videos on lotty
right now knowing everything that I know
yes definitely
five minute videos are perfect you gotta
say like the average duration of people
is five minutes that's the average right
it's five minutes anything above that
then people start losing interest right
you gotta understand this now everybody
is like you and me right all of you guys
are here on this live stream we watch
the whole videos like if we are into a
topic like we watch the whole thing most
people are not like that the majority of
people especially you know how how many
fake like wannabe developers are out
there right so there's a lot of people
that wants to be developer
but don't want to put in the work they
want to come in and find those
one-minute videos that tell you how to
become a good developer in one day with
one-minute video like those are you know
those are people that really bring down
the numbers now because they click on my
videos and then they see like oh man
it's a 15 minute video I watch six
minutes
you know I'll watch seven minutes and
then I'll get my information from the
first six seven minutes and then I'm out
you gonna say people are are you know
like they're so like nobody wants to put
into work nobody wants to put into work
nobody wants to know the details nobody
wants to do know that you know they want
to see quick results they want to know
how to do this in one second you know
that's the thing yes sir man where's the
bad word yeah man it's SEO is kind of
ridiculous
the problem with SEO is like in reality
no matter how much you do like
you're it's out of your hands you don't
have control you know what I'm saying
like you don't have control of it
because Google tomorrow could change
everything but I oh you know what we
gotta change the algorithm again and
everything that you thought that was
working no longer works yeah
that's how this man but you guys I'm
gonna see you guys later guys go
subscribe to tamari literally all you
have to do is go to my channel right you
go to one of my videos click on the
video alright you click on any video
from coding fees right and then from
there just click on the channel name and
you will see this new channel channels
you need to subscribe to Lottie
subscribe man 439 subscribers man no
videos no nothing this is just straight
support subscribe I'm dropping the two
videos I'm dropping out what develop a
portfolio right here and then from there
