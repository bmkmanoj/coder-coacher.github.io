hey guys hear any noise you both go back
out again man : face calm your voice
back in I didn't did it again alright
alright so yeah I remember about
yesterday right when I came in I was
like super excited I was like a lot of
good things are happening in my life and
everything is popping off right after
that I come back in and find out that
the other kid that works with me
he basically quit and he got another job
somewhere else and I'm like wait what
right and we're like in the middle of
redesigning the whole website changing
the whole company around right and
basically that bomb just blew up in the
office
where it's like hey the other person who
is a developer there who helps out with
all the that's happening on the
website
he basically quit he put in his two
weeks notice
maybe like a three-week notice and now
he's leaving and I'm not mad at him
because it's being a clusterfuck it's
been very stressful in this this company
um you know the people are cool but we
came in at the wrong time before we came
we was here then with the final person
who spent years of not doing work pretty
much acting as if they were doing work
and they just left us a whole bunch of
 to do right sounds like somebody
took a on the website and left it
there for years and then we gotta come
in and clean it up and that's what we
would do it so this kid Joe he pretty
much got burnt out you know the last
remember I told you guys we need to to
release the website as soon as possible
because of some urgency that had
and basically he got burnt out
he was like kill I can't deal with this
 you know there was days that he was
standing tonight two o'clock in the
morning like who the hell wants to work
in a company where you're pretty much
the cleanup crew right and that's what
we've been doing when I came in here
the website was on Pearl it was a
complete mess and then from there
between me and my other partner we we
basically changed the whole
website to PHP larva we got like a you
know one or two headquarters like one or
two guys to help us out
remotely but 90% of the work it was us
you know so is happening that right
now we still got to redesign the whole
website we got to change it and put in
the new design and do everything right
and I don't know I feel kind of stressed
out because it's like now since he's
leaving you remember the last two like a
week two weeks ago when he was on
vacation like it's pretty much a scheme
but one of the cases coming a vacation
and if I can came back as I oh hey guys
I um I'm not gonna work anymore but I'm
not mad at him for that but what sucks
is for me because I'm gonna kill I
 hated being in charge of like
the IT department or being the only
person working on the I hated that
 I don't like dealing with it
because it's not a company where
everything runs smoothly every day is
some new every day is a new bug
every day something that's breaking
constantly is extremely stressful and
then now I'm going to be here like the
only one dealing with this
supposedly we're going to hire two
developers all right
the two developers are coming in are
completely junior basically junior level
developers one is straight out of
college never done what
element and the other one is is a he's
done web development but he most of his
thing is WordPress so like pretty much
I'm gonna have to teach these
guys everything everything that they
know and okay people don't say Oh your
asshole because if you're the senior
developer there you're gonna have to
teach them and that's how it should be
yes guys I know but the problem is that
there's so many issues and so much
that I have to do that is just crazy
like I will have to you know it's like
I'm gonna have to not only manage teach
but also build because things got
to get done so I got a building alright
nobody else is here is going to be at
the same level as me so pretty much
whenever there's a issue
everybody's going to come to me so not
only do I have to worry about my code I
gotta worry about everybody else's code
I hate that I seriously
hate that right and I'm really
 pissed off because at least you
know the other kid that worked with me
you know we would even things out like
okay he'll focus more on on the backend
side and managing other people and I
could focus on the front end and then
come in and help out when I Ravel too
but now it's like I gotta do everything
I was doing it like the past you know
week and a half ago where I was doing
two weeks of me running like the whole
company by myself I don't like that
that drains me it gets me
 really tired I come home with my
my hurting me like it's really
stressful and I'm really pissed off man
because like I was gonna quit a
few months ago and I was like yo this
 might not be for me you know I'm
about to leave and then with the other
kid he's like oh now don't worry things
is going to get better thing you know
just stick euler and stick it through
and you stay here and then on the first
opportunity he gets he leaves like you
know what I mean there's like somebody
telling is like oh man don't worry man
just stick it through just stay
here you're going to be fine and then on
the first opportunity you're the first
one to leave he was like nah man that's
just sucks
and I'm not mattering because you know
what he's getting it is going to be way
better than what he's getting here and
he's actually gonna be more powder he
has more opportunity to be successful
and live a pretty comfortable life and
and be good alright um even though we're
both getting paid pretty good you know
where he's going he's gonna get paid
excellent alright um which is going back
to the city like working New York City
like me right now to work in New York
City I live I live outside of New York I
live on the island and work in the Lila
so it's the same thing right if I
decided tomorrow - but I hate I'm just
gonna start working back in the city are
easily yeah 120k 140k like that's just
simple but the problem is do I really
want to do that do I really want to be
taking a train do I really want to be
 with 30,000 people next to you
constantly the rush hour like I
hate that alright so oh yeah that's
what my what developers lunch break is
about today we should call down a
loyalty or when do you leave when you
should be I don't know man I'm gonna me
I don't know I must stick it imma stick
it through cuz I'm the type of person
I'd like to finish the job and then
decide what I want to do with myself I
want to finish the whole web design like
the whole redesign and once we do that
then from there I'll figure out what I'm
gonna do you know maybe work remotely
though on a hey I want to work remotely
or I'm gonna be like hey you know it was
great great experience or you know I'm
ready to move out to somewhere else but
I really want to move to another state
like everybody here knows that everybody
here knows that I want to
so on an estate I want to move to stay
where it's cheaper where I can make my
money you know I don't have to work so
hard so many hours you know I feel like
40 hours a week just too many
