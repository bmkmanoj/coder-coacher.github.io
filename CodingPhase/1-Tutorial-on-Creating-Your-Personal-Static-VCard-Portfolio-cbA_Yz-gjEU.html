Cody face calm today we got something
special okay today we are going to
create a personal v card
personal v card is sort of like a you
know like a business card but just some
website right now it's also can be used
as a portfolio it's all up to you how
you want to use it all right now I found
this great design by ELISA yet who I
think is a great designer
I will definitely reach out to him if
you guys need to signs I know a lot of
you guys are not designers out here a
lot of you guys don't have you know a
background in design so it's fine you
know what you guys are doing is
basically development and you know leave
the design to the designers or if you
have a little bit of creative in you and
you let's say hey man I'm gonna dabble
in chill design you can also do design
but man sometimes we gotta you know tip
our hats off to the great designers like
a Lisa yet okay so I like the design a
lot because it's very simple very easy
to do and it's great for you guys to
practice your HTML CSS all right now
what I'm going to do is we're going to
actually come in we're gonna break down
this since this design sorry and then
from there what we're going to do is
we're going to build this with HTML CSS
okay and we're going to use a couple of
things we might be using react also so
it's also gonna be good for those of you
guys who want to practice your react
okay um let me see what else well we got
this page he also created a couple of
extra pages now I won't say if we're
gonna use everything from him while we
might use this certain some colors and
things that he has or his design and
we're probably gonna change a little bit
here and there because this is more like
a concept and my
be useful for every situation so we're
gonna build it in a way where we can use
some of the new wide things that he did
but at the same time not being exactly
how his design is okay now we're gonna
get started we gotta break it down and
yeah man the first thing that we're
gonna do is very simple okay we're gonna
come here
we're gonna go to parcel J yes if you
guys haven't heard of this you guys
gotta go check out my website I
basically created a full course on this
parcel J s for you guys to really
understand it this is great for those of
you guys that don't know how to use gulp
don't know how to use webpack and you
just say hey man I just want to hit the
ground running like I don't have time to
be setting up all of this things and
customizing and anything as my web
developer starter kit the only
difference my what developer starter kit
you could literally go in there in the
back and change a few things and
customize it accordingly to how you want
it this is just to build something very
basic very easy and yeah ok so we're
gonna get started
cool so we hear a parcel GS okay make
sure you install this either with your
on or with NPM after this is done the
next thing that we want to do is
basically create a folder okay
so we're gonna do this right now we're
gonna go to finder personally I already
have a folder called personal portfolio
I'm gonna move this to my project
section okay what's the issue show you
removed from iCloud move yes that's why
okay personal portfolio now you open
your atom let that load for a second
okay once this is done go to file open
okay let's go to code projects personal
portfolio all right so the first thing
we're gonna do is we've got a
right-click on the folder and gonna
click in here and say index dot HTML to
create that new file
all right now in here what we're gonna
do is come in and say HTML say head okay
say body and there you go we got
something very simple very easy now next
thing that we're going to do is we're
going to click create a folder that's
going to say source okay and then in
here we're going to put in two folders
one called Jes and another one new
folder call SCSS all right now now we go
we set up we're gonna create a new file
called index dot Jes and then here we're
going to create something called main
that CSS okay now the next thing that we
want to do is come here follow along
let's say for assets if we want to
install sass we gotta come here and
basically npm install no sass but before
that let's open this up on the terminal
and say MPM and knit ok package name
personal portfolio version 1.0 whatever
just click enter a whole bunch of times
alright cool so everything was good
what's the next step that we're gonna do
so we got this up let's do the no sass
MPM install no sass and then oops
close it here open it up here okay and
we're gonna say NPM install no sass and
then we're gonna say - - save okay okay
cool now in our index dot HTML we're
going to do a little something we're
going to pretty much let's create a
couple of folders so let's say in here
we got the source let's move our index
dot HTML inside of here let's create
another folder call I am G for images
let's move all of this images inside of
that folder of image okay alright so we
have that there so we have our source
there now let's come to the index.html
let's create a script tag okay do it
like this say SRC and then we're going
to say yes I see that and then J yes dot
or not that slash index dot JSP
now what I want to do is after this I
want to come into the index IGS
and we're going to come here and say
import and we're going to pass in the
location of our scss which is called
Maine that SCSS okay save that now the
next thing that we want to do is we want
to use I believe Parcells and then we're
gonna say Parcells SRC slash index dot
HTML okay so it says server is running
ok what's the issue and then to find the
employ provide a file name source of
string to process okay so let's just say
body background ready okay everything's
running now let's go to this location
localhost one two three four okay and
there you go so we have our basic setup
already set up for us with parse out J s
where we can come here and say blue save
it and technically is going to change in
the background as you can see
automatically so it has hot module
reloading guys haven't checked out
parcel j s go check it out on the
website we literally created that course
I don't know like a week ago where you
can understand everything that's going
on and it's pretty legit man it's pretty
legit I would definitely advise people
and recommend it for them to use parcel
J especially for projects like this they
are very simple okay now next thing that
we want to do is as you can see we have
our index.html or half the JavaScript
and we have the CSS here so we don't
have to do anything this was being
distributed to
the localhost one two three four over
here is our raw files and then from
there everything is fine okay so next
thing that we want to do is basically
look at the design so let's go to the
projects okay personal portfolio and go
into source go into images going to
personal vCard and this is the design
right here okay so the very first thing
that we're going to start with is going
to be building this section here okay or
maybe even creating just the background
you know separating this into two
different sections so have this like I
don't know like maybe 40% of the screen
and maybe 35% of the screen and then the
rest of it to be white so we could start
with that okay
all right to get the colors what I'm
going to do is I'm going to use
Photoshop to do this you can use colored
adobe.com where you could actually go in
there and upload the images indefinitely
you could get the colors if you don't
have Adobe but I mean reality doesn't
matter because I'm about to give it to
you anyways but in case you wanted to
use another design or you like another
color okay so let me see take this okay
we're gonna create a a file called C
variables that is CSS and here we're
gonna say
color 1 equals 2 beta
hey let's go into the main this came in
here and say I import okay and then say
variables I'll save that and this should
be fine let's see now
for this one we're gonna say color one
okay and that's just for now we just see
people like that foot up time beam and
we could see what else what are the
other colors in here that we might need
okay say color tool maybe later on we
might rename the names of the variables
but for now this is fine
okay it's really not that much colors
it's just like one same color you see
what else is saying here this is f EF e
all right yeah yeah you know so that's
all we need for now let me see from the
other images is there any other colors
out there Oh seems like everything is
the same okay maybe this is a different
color
okay and this is a different color okay
seeing color five all right cool I think
on this notice a different color
no they just okay this is a different
color color six all right
so we got everything so far alright now
the next video
are we basically gonna start breaking
the designs down you know start breaking
things by sections and say hey there's
the right side hey this is this is the
right side this is the left side and
then inside of dial we break it down to
this then we break it down to this then
we have this image broken down this line
here broken down this section broken
down so you know we got a lot of stuff
coming up man
I'm gonna try to do like two three
videos per day on this project so you
guys don't be like oh man we gotta wait
