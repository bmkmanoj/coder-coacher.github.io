up kids we're here tonight man
coding with Joe man and coding with your
boy Joe chillin chillin chillin chump
chillin just setting everything up
alright kids let's just hang out we're
here we live right now kids late night
session wow I get to co some stuff
alright so what I'm doing is I'm
basically right now building a dashboard
for the application that we are building
so let me see charts GS
alright so let's copy this Jade HTML to
Jade it's like this paste it here so
hard it right here all right so all
right so we got this div class box flip
this dear take this let's put out the
footer alright our good old hours
alright so the same dashboard pug 16
okay so 16 is giving us our okay it's
because it needs to be inside of they
inside of this block now npm run watch
now for those of you guys that are
curious why exactly i've been doing for
the past two days is I'm building the
HTML for our laravel project and the
reason why building is because I don't
want people to focus on building stuff
in HTML CSS so I'm gonna give them the
project files already completed and then
we could just focus on PR PHP in arrabal
that's it so there won't be no reason
for you guys to actually be doing the
work
you know what I mean cuz I hate that too
I'll be honest I hate that I hate when I
I got to learn something right but then
I'm there to learn let's say for example
laravel but then to learn laravel they
have me doing HTML and you're like wait
what I'm not here for this like I
already know HTML so yeah so that's the
whole thing kids all right
oh no what the hell why did that happen
okay so script okay was SRC put this in
all right I see what's the area Shore
chart is not defined
huh i refresh this page let's see what's
going on here see if this CDN is working
no but just not working so I got a copy
you from here
okay take this paste it there oh there
you go that's what I'm talking about
okay cool now let's look at this what's
the height 400 C 200 okay there you go
so it is just an example first dashboard
thought I had did this yesterday for
some reason I don't know why I didn't
save so h1 dashboard yeah I did do this
yesterday because all the styles are
there but for some reason okay alright
nice little pretty dashboard okay let's
see
I like line line charts
instead of bars so
oops all right cool so that looks good I
mean what'd you guys think what do you
guys think
okay box so give some padding around
this box 20 pixels now it looks a little
bit cleaner like that
now this h6 let's give it some padding
some whatnot padding margin okay cool
so that's what we have so far okay so
the user comes in searches whatever
searches our e-commerce lands on the
results page all the stuff is here then
they from there they click on which one
they like all right they also could
register they also could log in when
they log in it takes them to the
dashboard no matter of fact this is the
dashboard for the admin now I gotta
create an account page maybe I should
just make the dashboard the admin and
the count speech the same thing make it
look exactly the same so we could
actually save time instead of
rebuilding this thing from you know have
different views for each one what do you
guys think
let me see who's in here yo yo yo yo yo
yo yo we got what abou we got Dean we
got Remy we got LeBlanc oh we got I got
my penis we got her sweat Diaz we got
busy rent we got casey Brinegar we got
your boy Philippe
we got Neil Tom Tran a bunch of stuff
face FinTech I wonder if FinTech named
himself face FinTech for the channel his
name was FinTech before so they'll be
dope face FinTech Oh Joe has let's see
who else the senior cat D Neil Johnny
Jose Luis Alice that's sorta two very
close to my name my name is Joey Lewis
Santos Garcia and my baby's name is
Ethan Vincente Santos all right let's
see KC Brinegar what up Dean says yo man
I wanna be like you just gotta shave my
head and grow a beer and I was obviously
get better with programming a question
though yo there is a real question what
are you getting these projects from from
my head that's why sometimes it takes a
little bit longer cuz you know this
there's like a trick that a lot of
people do people find blocks right like
I could literally go to blogs right and
find projects to do write and copy it
and put them into into my tutorial but
the problem of that is that a lot of
people create projects that are not
realistic to a real business so that's
what makes my channel my
website different then everybody else's
is because I don't do stuff just to do
it but okay guys this is JavaScript this
is how you do JavaScript there's a
function that I don't do it like that
I come in I give you real projects and
then you learn like that because in
reality when you're gonna go working on
a company nobody's gonna come in to you
and be like hey can you build me a to-do
app can you sort this freaking array I
mean sometimes yeah a lot of times is
gonna be sorting a race but you get what
I'm saying like let those other
platforms do that for you me are gonna
give you real projects like this like
this project is I'll be honest and
there's gonna be so fun to do like the
part I don't like is during this part
the HTML CSS I hate to an HTML CSS cos
is boring you know they're like there's
no errors like there's no errors in HTML
like you know what I mean like this all
about designing and basically putting
things in the right places whatever but
that's easy but like let's say now what
we doing next I fix this yesterday this
gets me this gives me pissed off my
computer turned off last night I don't
know what the hell happened because I
fixed this so yeah you probably think oh
it looks fine no this space down here is
not supposed to exist let me fix this
before I leave umm yes so I was like I
like building real projects and all my
projects I get it from my head like you
know what I mean like stuff that I will
see that I've done before in other
companies or like something similar to
it okay let me see
index that pug what how is this CSS for
this page okay
HTML 100 feet VH let me take that off
okay that makes sense
no but where the hell is that thing
coming from it's in the body because the
thing is that you see this there should
not be a scrollable this
should not be scrollable at all so
there's some we're men somewhere some
something is messing it up it's adding
an extra padding and it's driving me
crazy okay so let's see admin it's not
that site header and half home let me
see where is this thing coming from is
it itched it's not the HTML see body
module global search body what I was
this body coming from okay so it's not
the sass weather how is this coming from
it's not supposed to be happening right
now
Kate admin section is the site
let me see do a global search for height
100 okay let me see what's happening
with this it's not supposed to be
happening okay there you go
there's no scrollable okay there's no
scrollable but now okay site Oh
maybe what the issue is I'm doing a
height 100 VH all right but what I
should do is make the header that's
because the head is already taking space
see little tricks like that and this
header is taking space right here all
right this thing supposed to be actually
like floating not floating on
position:absolute or fixed so let's say
position:absolute and I say top zero I
mean it's always top zero but let's say
with 100% okay there you go see
no more scrolling this thing is Center
exactly right in the middle of the page
ah there you go once again your boy Joe
done did it again oh my god but then now
we dinner with this issue on every
single page okay so okay let me see all
right I see what we got to do we got a
duel on the main HTML height 100 VH so
now every page the background it's nice
and pretty but now another thing that we
have to do is we have to find out what's
the height of this okay the height of
this and then we say what is the height
of this thing off header it's 56 so we
got to make sure that we had to put in a
margin of 56 know your padding a 56 on
all the sections so let me see where is
the admin admin is fine was a site site
section
we're going to do padding on the top 56
pixels so make sure nope got them that's
not the one
don't you hate that okay let's see
nope what the hell okay what's this just
uh oh yeah it is there but nope it's not
there either
okay we gotta figure this out so this is
ID off
okay psych section okay sigh section
batting top 56 pixels
okay that's the site section but why is
the header inside of this thing it's
supposed to be outside good ol issues
okay that's why this thing is not
supposed to be in here it's supposed to
be outside all right so that's fine this
is fine too but it's supposed to be here
now this thing completely messed up what
the hell just happened why did that mess
up
oh it could be because header is acting
as if it's supposed to be inside of site
section and that's not what we want we
want it to be separate and there you go
kids once again your boy Jonah and did
it again exactly what we want it now let
me take this mean includes does it mean
includes copy this and put it in our
admin layout and put it out here
now let me see if that works for the
admin isn't that pretty
where the hell is the to include missing
ok header is dere okay
why is headed behind that oh I see
don't that uh got him once again
I don't think I don't think I'm gonna
put that hat right there
it doesn't work what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna put something here that says go
back to back to site now let's see let
me see what you guys is talking about in
the chat room let's see
Johnny says do you use any third party
API in any of your courses yes
in this course and this is exactly what
we're building for the people that don't
know why I'm building I'm building a
website there's a project that all of
you guys are gonna be able to use every
single one of you guys so and then
what's cool is that you're gonna be able
to create it and use it at the same time
pretty much you're gonna do a search
same way I have been telling you guys do
a search on drip will find designs that
inspire you so we're creating a project
that is going to do an API call to be
hands and then Behance is gonna send us
back the data and the URL to the images
and then what we're going to do is after
that like let's say you search for
e-commerce right so here are going to be
all the ecommerce websites that you can
choose and then when you come here you
click on the little white box it's like
you check it right and then it stays
checked so when you check in it gets
added into a project right I don't know
if I should have a little pop-up that is
gonna say here hey which project you
want to add it to but it's gonna be
something like that right so you're
gonna be able to take a design added to
a
and then now like let's say you're doing
one of my random competitions whatever I
do right and I say okay guys build me a
sneaker shop all right you're gonna find
here the right designs you can okay I
want to find ecommerce and you're gonna
find all the designs and then choose
like a couple like five six or how many
you want to add it to that project so
now you could go in there and see inside
of that project all the designs that you
liked for that project that you're
building so then now you could come in
and start choosing like what are the
things that you like about each one so
like that you could get inspired to
build your website so this whole thing
is supposed to be like brainstorming
that's what I call the design storm so
it's like I don't know if you guys ever
did this again high school or junior
high school where the teacher would tell
you hey write down all the things that
you're about to talk about in like an
essay right and then you make like a two
little circles and choose which ones you
want and then in the middle you will put
anything star similar to each other or
whatever something like that I still
don't even know how to explain this but
I have an idea in my head right cuz I
always tell you guys go check you know
go check out B hands go check out
dribble mostly dribble but dribble and
Behance is the same thing but dribbles
API doesn't give us all the images
Behance api does so let me see me hands
net so I can come here and like do a
search so like let's say for example
phone now right and then you're gonna
get all of this different designs here
and from there you're gonna be able to
choose like okay I want this one I want
to keep this one
I wanna keep I like the color of this
you know so it's like you choosing which
ones you want
and you using it for inspiration so
inside of a list for that project
whatever project you're working on
you're going to be able to have this
thing right like all the images that you
feel like okay I like this design like
this design I like this design and this
is what I want to keep yeah I want to
get inspired by all of these designs I
don't know does that make sense
I mean does that make sense to you guys
do you think like this is a good project
I mean to me I think is a good project
is you're connecting to an API a third
party API you're also going to have user
authentication you're also gonna deal
with database and migrations so all the
things that you need to build a laravel
app you're gonna have all of that you
know so I don't know yeah tell me I'm
using good old laravel good Oh laravel
and then maybe I'll take this project
the same project cause it was like this
is the cool thing about having my
website is that when I build a project I
could build upon it for another course
so for example people that are using pug
they could watch this video on YouTube
and learn how to do it with pug HTML
then from there I come in on this the
design that I did for it now from there
I'm taking this design in this HTML I'm
putting it into lera create a course on
laravel then from there I'm gonna take
this course from laravel create a zip
file for the people who are doing the
react course and then tell them hey guys
now we're gonna take this you know
static static dynamic no this dynamic
website with Larry Bell and then now
we're gonna convert it into straight
react so you see it's like I'm reusing
the same projects and like upgrading
them for different courses because
that's exactly what happens in real life
like somebody might hire you tomorrow
but ok we have this website in encoding
NATO or I have this website in nodejs
now we want this to be made with laravel
or angular so now you're taking that
website that was already there and
basically converting it to react or
converting it to angular you know what I
mean
so it's cool
it's laravel hard to configure Mac hell
no it takes 15 minutes son go check it
out I have a video on my youtube channel
call search on my youtube channel go to
my youtube channel right and go to the
search and you will see man I'll do it
for you right now
I got I asked you to do look you
come to my channel what is it
what's my channel name I don't even know
coding face alright so the Tai Lopez of
web development that's funny
if any years title alright so you come
to my channel
you come here you search my sequel and
here you go install PHP my seagull and
laravel in 15 minutes
super easy very easy to do let's see
we'll have a a new subscriber yeah yeah
yeah you feel bad for that do Sam yeah
he's like here he sends me an e-mail
like yo man it's the devil the devil
don't want me to do my project like yeah
bro the devil has nothing to do with
this like just do your damn project like
young people are hilarious man people
find excuses on everything in this world
man
people are crazy man people are
definitely crazy out here alright so
let's get back to this
so I already did everything that we had
here oh maybe I should create like a
form let me see now I think I have
everything that I need maybe I should
chill for a little bit because it's like
if I leave from here then it's like I'm
about to start recording videos for my
website so and I wanna hang out with you
guys for lobing just a little bit longer
don't oh my god turn turn turn the
freaky the freakin bar of death right
here Lee it doesn't want to go away yo
what the like why are you coming
back
hey this thing is not supposed to be
scrollable like why is this still coming
back no matter what
I fixed it I fixed it the last night man
and I can't figure out from where it's
this freaking thing it has something to
do with with the height because I'm
using height 100% but let me see where
is the site okay so okay yeah
so it's the same thing so now we gotta
use calc all right 100 eh - 56 pixels
Jesus Christ
there you go no more it's freaking thing
is a little bar wanted to keep coming
back I mean don't you hate that when
that happens man
yes that's what I'm using 100 VH
that means 100 view height whatever the
height of this view is that's the the
calculation and the reason why I'm using
that is because sometimes 100 percent
doesn't work so um I give you issues of
depending on what the parent is so then
I will have to put 100 percent here 100
percent on the body or 100 percent on
HTML so that's annoying now if you use
want to say hey 100 percent this element
is 100 percent of the view height then
you just have to put 100 eh and that's
it yes and our height let me see what
else okay so we got this thing we got
the admin you know what let's continue
making pages so we got this all right
what else can we do to this thing so we
got the dashboard
maybe create a couple of extra boxes
here
so let's see let's go to the admin
don't-don't-don't
okay I'm just scrolling up and down cuz
I don't know what to do next
oh god sometimes the best thing to do is
draw things on an on a freaking notebook
and then write it down to see it the
things that you're gonna do but you know
me I'm not the conventional type of dude
I just do whatever I do you know what I
mean
I wake up I'm like okay cool I'm gonna
code I'm chilling freaky like I'm gonna
coat you know but I don't really like to
plan things out because all my best
ideas come up from the head like
spontaneous alright so we got this side
thing we got the content this is fine we
don't got to worry your body whereas the
dashboard that pug
okay let's create another one
okay
No okay let me see
okay what should we do
the total projects or projects total I
don't know okay close this close this
close this of an atom in content area
but this here projects total okay we're
gonna ch1 text-align:center large number
font size 5 REM text-align:center
okay
okay why didn't this work oh that's why
got him
all right projects total
do the same thing for total images see
yeah I'm confused what is the right way
is the right way to say projects total
total projects yeah tell me what's the
correct way to say cat deep No thank you
all right let's see Joe the area do you
ever work with XML files nope
I mostly like Windows and stuff like
that
you know Casey why don't you start
building stuff in the back end man
forget about firebase man I'm being
honest when I think firebase is like a
lazy way to introduce yourself to the
back end you know a lot of people be
like oh I'm gonna do this for firebase
it's like - why just build it yourself
you know
so you guys so start building some stuff
with PHP my sequel man cuz I'll be
honest like nobody I don't know I
haven't met a company that uses um
firebase at all the only people that I
know that use firebase are I call it's
like app developers that's the only
people I know that use firebase
I'm already in the first Facebook clone
project damn son come on time is ticking
finish that project man that that first
project so many people are doing the you
know let's look at analytics good ol
analytics right so many people are still
doing like the HTML CSS ok refresh this
how do you on the website right now
oh no this enemy games HD there's
another website that I have Oh Anna me I
have a whole bunch of my tech degree my

no I think this is from you too - which
one is it you see is it this one we go
to coding phase calm I guess everybody's
everybody's watching me in the
livestream or something
nobody is online right now currently
which is weird sometimes this thing be
messing up cousin look it's just a loan
from the web saying like it's not I'm on

Felipe's like yo I agree 100% with you
jump so what the Christian create
anybody yo bird K is like yo he is the
pioneer of a vegan web development
channel created his own luck Chris don't
create a deaf life clothing yeah you
guys are too much man
yeah you guys are a little bit too much
man
what's the difference between Christian
and a developer though because we all
know he ain't an engineer you guys are
retarded why you guys leaving crazy
comments like that
Oh God let me see I want to file a sign
funny man yeah there's like a crazy this
one's gonna be funny this is funny man
we can't miss this one so I created this
free tutorial right it's whatever you
want to check it out a lot of people
have taken this on you to me and they
love it
but renewer says there's a effing awful
tutorial i was holding off on commenting
but after you see you guys figure it out
it's true I'll be doing that sometimes
listen he goes like but after you say
you guys figure it out at night
you guys put that there yeah I'm sorry
but this is oh god is too much
this guy's too much then he goes a whole
lot does just want them one more piece
to the pie of each dead this is so far
how her stool is supposed to effing
follow when you don't go through the
atom installation the note installation
the gulp installation and even telling
us we're needing adobe login to I'm not
even ten minutes in and I already say I
don't know when to continue learning
with you in this interview and you can
see I don't have so hey it's free so
what do you expect but those aren't
excuses for half-assing you can't do way
better than this you have to understand
that people coming here don't have don't
have is stuff
I've been like to rouse I'm like mm this
is solving all this yeah I'm sorry
yo yo B was grazing oh my god man
Krishan again because I got hit krishana
schooled man
the and the laughs makes me laugh yeah
before this I was like yo he's the co
teacher from the hood figure it out nah
man
Abby look listen this is the thing yeah
he's right sometimes he's right
this kid is right you know cuz you know
I create tutorials all right like the
the stuff I put on on free for you
you're like us a YouTube whatever Oh in
my head is like okay these are the most
basic things like you don't have no Jes
installed like why are you trying to do
complicated stuff like
like if I'm a beginner I'm not looking
to build a dashboard like if I don't
know how to put a HTML tag I am NOT
looking for a dashboard to create right
so if you building a dashboard you
already passed certain levels of this
right so this is more like a a practice
this is not teaching HTML CSS this is
practicing HTML and CSS but this guy is
like you know he's like yeah I was
holding off on commenting but after you
say you guys figure it out like figure
it out you tell them you know not you
need me to freaking hold your hand on
how to register for Adobe like seriously
dude come on
and then he goes like how our students
supposed to effing follow follow along
when you don't go through the atom
installation the node installation the
gulp installation or even telling us
well we're needing Adobe login to I'm
minutes I need to stop I need to get off
this thing this this you see I'm
laughing right now that's our last one
almost every night like before I go to
sleep I go through everybody's comments
yes this days that people pisses me off
people say dumb things but a lot of
times man is just funny man there's a
thing here when I created this video
right that somebody left a comment like
hold on where is it I gotta find it

message like you know Joe my fault you
know I'm gonna I'm kind of soon as I can
I'm gonna pay you
I'm like bro don't worry about it I'm
not I'm not living on the bridge like
you know like if it's okay like you do
this out of your heart and I out of your
own you know you know how much you want
to learn you know what I mean like if
you find it useful you keep it if you
don't find it useful I'm gonna be here
like please guys don't leave you know
you know we good but I really
appreciated that people want to sign up
to the website and they're really good a
lot out of it you see me I work every
day here for you guys I come in I create
stuff content for you guys for you to
create content on my website I'm doing a
whole bunch of tutorials for you like I
think
it's the best deal you know like
literally you could go to team tree 19
tree house yeah team tree house cause
like $30 or something like that
Pluralsight cause like $30 that's
monthly right and then you have what is
a coke Adam II also - now they're
charging people you know it's like you
come to my website I'm giving you real
projects I'm not giving you like that BS
stuff like hey here's a to the lab hey I
want to Scotch that I owe and copier a
tutorial from there and then now I'm
showing it to you guys here and now I'm
giving you original content you know a
cure for this um see you man nah I don't
be like you'll figure it out there's
certain things guys look I'll be honest
my website is like no-nonsense type of
site like I can't hold your hand through
everything cuz there's the problem this
is this what happens with a lot of
websites they hold your hand through
every single step even the most easiest
thing and then make you lazy they make
you lazy to now use your brain in web
development programming in general you
gotta use your brain constantly this is
something that people forget like it's
mandatory it's like a requirement it
sounds dumb but it's a requirement to
just use your brain you know it's like
that guy that left that comment hey I'll
figure it out
yeah figure it out you telling me you
don't know how to look how to register
like literally there's a link on the
thing that says register here if you
don't know how to register there like
you know what I mean like this is not
for you I'm being honest like you
need training for like training how to
use a computer you need training how to
browse the Internet like this a lot of
stuff like you gotta have some type of
background you know at least at some
point you must have I used Microsoft
Word or something you know what I mean
like people people are there's people
that you know they're just lazy they
think you you supposed to take a
tutorial that teaches you like hey here
is how to frickin how to save a file
like you're telling me you've never I
mean of course I always do that anyways
I gotta teach people how to save the
file
but even that that sounds so dumb like
you know what I mean like you telling me
you've never gone to file and then look
up top like this is like user experience
101 like save file like you've never
seen that you know some people they're
crazy
so for you Ramsay Jordan not my Webster
is not gonna be like that man it's not
I'm not gonna be like hey guys here's an
app you figure it out I'm not gonna do
that to you but I do do i do do I do
tell people like let's say the
future-proof JavaScript I specifically
left a bug in there
so you can figure it out at the end of
the course after you're taking
everything in JavaScript and you learned
everything at the end of the course
there is a bug in there and the reason
why I they're not fixing is for people
to fix it on their own right because if
you cannot fix that bug you know people
send me emails like hey Joe there's a
bug on it I'm like yeah I left it there
specifically so when you look at it you
supposed to go and fix it right this is
the difference between my courses and
what other people do I don't hold hand I
help you out I teach you all the
fundamentals but throughout the whole
course I even show you where to find the
answers I haven't show you how to find
the documentation how to read the
documentation
to find references examples online right
because those are the things that you're
gonna need as a developer you don't need
me to tell you okay press command-c here
select here copy this and paste it here
we're command V if you telling me you
don't know command C and command V is
copy and paste then you need to take our
computer class you know what I mean like
those are the things that there's people
out there that be like oh you say figure
it out like like I was trying to be a a
ho no it's just like use your brain like
you this is this is a process that you
have to be a participant in you cannot
copy and paste this is not Netflix you
know what I mean like you don't learn I
mean have you ever try to learn a
language right I don't know if you guys
remember back in the days like English
in barreras or or like crazy commercials
that I will see like on TV like learn
how to speak English with this or learn
how to speak French with rosetta stone
and people just put on the the freaking
the high collars the the headphones in
and walk around the whole day for four
five six years with rosetta stone on
their ears and then you ask them
something in Spanish - Blake what poyo
like you tell me you've been listening
for five years - this rosetta stone and
you still don't know Spanish why because
you don't practice it you don't do
things that help you understand the
language understand how it works you
know what I mean so it's the same thing
as programming unless somebody helps you
out and teaches you like how to follow
along like you know how to follow along
how to use your brain and be able to
find answers me showing you every single
thing is useless which is what I say
about all of those you know free cocaine
coke addict me all those things are
useless because if you click keep going
to the next step that will give you the
sir and it's like what you know what I
mean I hope that was his name
let's see Ramsay Jordan did not just get
mad because I just gave him this answer
Ramsay Jordan are you still there
see I don't know why people I hope that
he's not mad and did I say something
wrong on this answer his his question
that's my question that I say something
wrong
call does that make sense to people like
I think that's wrong for people to ask
the question and then what they don't
like the answer disappear you know
but that's what I'm saying is like the
way how to teach things is the way how I
wish somebody would have taught me you
know what I mean to not waste time I'm
all about not wasting time
yeah like rosetta stone is good but just
like I said if you don't practice it
just because you haven't in your ear
doesn't mean that you know you're
freaking gonna learn anything you're not
gonna learn anything that's the truth
man some people just don't like it you
know a lot of people they don't like the
truth I don't understand why you know
you know somebody sent me also email -
right after I did the the thing about
that other kid clever programmer and
they're like he's like he's not that bad
he's great he's he's a good kid you know
don't pick on him and in this and I'm
like I'm not picking on him I'm saying
it's extremely retarded for somebody to
be charging $500 for stuff that costs
$10 right now you know what I mean like
I'm nice to everybody you know I'm nice
to everybody I give them the real real
deal like I'd rather somebody be honest
with me why would I tell somebody you
know when somebody asks me hey Joe
when I take your courses if I go in a
bus you know bust my ass this whole
month of taking every single course on
your website am I gonna be a developer
by the end of the courses what do I say
if you understood everything yes if you
didn't you have to continue creating
projects like I can come in and teach
you guys everything but then from there
you also have to practice this is you
know it's like right now I'm a
basketball player right I'm a basketball
player
I play for New York Knicks right just
because I took you to the park and I'll
show you how to shoot a basketball
doesn't mean you're gonna be in the NBA
tomorrow it just doesn't work like that
we live her reality guys we don't live
like this la la la where it's like hey
man we're gonna we're going to see the
Wizard right now
The Wizard of Wizard of Oz and we walk
into him and Joe is gonna come and emcee
tada you're a developer today no this is
a process it's a new process right
you're not a really really good
developer for at least a year to I think
even when you say somebody's a junior
developer a junior developer ain't
to be honest with you guys
you need developers just somebody who
just knows the basics knows the the
simple stuff and they got a job they
become a developer while doing the job
ok so right now if you come to my
website you sign up you do all the
projects that I have there yes you could
get a job but you still a junior
developer it from there you have to take
time building projects and working for
companies do you need to know shell
program to be a web developer nope not
at all
you don't need to know shell programming
it's fine but I mean there's no Graduate
developer there's junior developers
right
there's developers and then there's
senior developers right a junior
developers all of you guys are junior
developers right let's say an example
some of you guys might be made which is
just regular developers but a junior
developer somebody who knows the syntax
and knows that hey I could build
something all right and if I give you a
design you can build it if you know a
couple of things in JavaScript you
understand it a developer somebody who
already knows the stack knows how
everything works on the web right knows
all the things that he needs to do like
let's say if I give him a task I don't
have to worry about that person he's a
developer he's been doing this for a
while I don't need to worry about him a
senior developer is somebody who is the
go-to guy when things break when the
junior and the developer don't know what
to do they go to the senior developer to
ask questions that's somebody who's very
diverse and who already knows everything
and not even when I say everything just
knows like what to do has already been
through every situation out there that
could happen and it's not freaking out
because when you had a job you could
have a freakout moment you could go in
freaking put in the wrong team put in a
semicolon and now you deleted the whole
database what happens in that situation
right now who are you gonna call you
never call the developer you're gonna
talk to the senior developer and be like
oh my god I just deleted the whole
database he's gonna deal with going to
let's say AWS finding the backups
putting the backups back online like the
whole process he's the one dealing with
all of that you know what I mean yep
face FinTech said it everyone wants to
eat but few are willing to hunt I'm
still waiting for for what was his name
Ramsay Jordan I hope that you know
Ramsay if you watch this video or you
come back later on I hope that you
didn't get upset at what I said right
this is and this goes to everybody out
there no because there's a very good
question Joe I want to buy your
subscription but are you going to be
like figure it out on every course real
question no I don't be like figure it
out right I teach people everything all
the basics definitely we build projects
and real-life projects and then from
there at some point I'm going to give
you either quizzes or at the end of the
project I might leave something that's
still not finished that you need to
finish it because if you cannot finish
it that means you got to go back to the
beginning and rewatch the whole thing
because the problem is with people
people come in and like I said they
think that watching a video like and
taking courses like as if they are
Netflix good good thing Ramsey so I'm
glad that you here so like what I was
saying is like people come in and they
think that watching courses it's like
watching Netflix it's completely
different you have to come in and follow
everything alone if you don't understand
something what you do is you go back to
that video re-watch it again and then
you go on your code and you play around
with it right like let's say we're doing
a for loop and you're watching me do it
but you're like man I don't understand
what's going on you watch it again and
then after you watch it again you go to
you're all on text editor and then you
try doing then you try doing the loop
yourself right if you understood it from
the beginning then you go to the next
thing and you do it on your own time but
okay I know how to do a loop I already
know it and one thing that I tell people
it's not about remembering things it's
about knowing the concepts one thing
that you're gonna see from me constantly
is I'm always looking at the
documentation it doesn't matter what it
is you know either look in the
documentation or I'll look on on google
or w3schools doesn't matter what
language it is why because it's almost
impossible as a developer in knowing all
the different languages that I know to
remember every single syntax out there
right it's almost impossible some people
they do it I can't write I can't go in
there and be like hey I know seven
languages like this the languages that I
don't know how many languages I know I
know okay let's say let's count
even though HTML CSS on that languages
but HTML CSS JavaScript JavaScript PHP
Python golang Ruby Ruby not Ruby on
Rails what else
elixir what else do do I know that I
fused Perl so that's like nine languages
right there or C sharp C C++ thank you I
don't do you guys really expect me to
know every single cent tax no it is
impossible for that person to say hey I
know every single syntax know what you
do is you have the documentation next to
you and be like oh I'm doing a loop how
do I do a loop and goal and I look at
the documentation
okay cool I know how to code it that's
it and that's why I try to teach you
guys like this is not a thing of
memorization which is one of the reasons
- why do not like algorithms now because
they're not useful at some point but
because people spend so much time
remembering it they're like oh how to
remember this algorithm I gotta remember
this I gotta remember this I gotta
remember this and it's like it's not
about remembering it's about knowing the
concepts because every language out
there does the same thing it's just
different syntax you know the good
developers can go in and be like hey I'm
a PHP developer and I could still go in
and do everything that I need to do in
JavaScript hey I'm a JavaScript
developer I could do everything that I
need to do in Python
those are the things that people look
for and be like okay this person is a
good developer it took me a long time to
understand that but the more I code and
the more I learned things I realize I'm
like it's not about remembering it's
about knowing the concepts of
programming you could literally do
everything in pseudocode and then figure
it out how to translate it to any
programming language if you don't know
what pseudocode is pseudocode is let's
say we come here let's say something
very simple I'm gonna share I don't know
can you guys see this here write
pseudocode like this it's just comments
it's just writing it down let's say I
need to hike all this I need to I have
let's say Johnny has five five apples
right so Johnny
five apples right and then cam has two
apples okay now if Kim has more than two
apples say hey cam where you got those
apples
okay else say I cam I got you
or I can't must see you right so and
then you say okay I can't must see you
and that's it right now down here you
say if johnny has five apples or more
say Johnny you fat
stop eating so much else say good boy
that's pseudocode alright
simple you can take this right here and
translate it to any language out there
right let's say we wanted to say here a
thing
we could even go even deeper Nesta even
deeper we can say ok say can we where
you got those apples and then say Apple
know this for each Apple for each Apple
say Apple 1 say Apple 2 now we basically
came in with declare variables we said
hey we also did conditionals we also
said you know we printed out things we
also did a for loop right we basically
used the index of the loop here and all
of the stuff is just regular English you
can take this and translate it to
anything any language out there just
look at the documentation but you need
to know the concepts you got to know
that this right here are variables this
right here our if-else if-else
statements okay then here you're either
printing or you're you're echoing out or
console logging out right and then on
this you're basically using a for loop a
for each loop a while loop whatever loop
you want to use but then you're
basically coming in and putting in the
index of each one that's it
you get what I'm saying okay Harrison
says why doesn't cause you're not like
w3schools
I don't know you gotta ask them that
yeah pseudo cold man you know I was like
that's how you learn how to understand
the concepts you know that's it anyways
guys I'm about to be out of here it's
one o'clock I'm sleeping I'm gonna go
watch was it how to get away with murder
on Netflix alright guys I will see you
guys later
also your boy Chris Hawkes got a video
I'm about to wash that right now before
I go to sleep but yeah man have a good
night guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
