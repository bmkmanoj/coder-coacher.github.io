you already knows your boy joke back out
of the gang coating face.com
your boy is back and I done did it again
guys listen um I just want to make this
video I was gonna record it first but I
say you know what I think let's do it
live it's gonna be a quick little
10-minute video 10-15 minute video about
this um but basically you should be held
accountable if you promote a big connect
anybody that promoters victim bacon it
should be a held accountable for it
right so big connect if you guys haven't
heard about this it was a Ponzi scheme
from the beginning a lot of people was
like hey man let's promote this thing
because you know it's like the more
people that you come in and basically
signed them up under you the more money
that you make I mean it's a Ponzi scheme
that's how it is to everybody my mom
felt you know victim to that a few years
ago something called q.q bids or
something kwazii's I'm not alone the
kwazii's or it was something like that I
remember like back in like 2003 her best
friend came to our house and Gabe was
like a speech like hey man you can use
this thing whenever you buy something
online you get discounts this get saved
all you have to do is give us $150 right
and my mom signed up for it it's they
charge you like three months cuz every
time she called up to cancel it they
never let her cancel it so mind you
whatever her friend got money from
everybody that he she signed up under
right now it's crazy because I've seen
this done a lot of times I've seen
people come in and you know promoting
their channels guys that's the big
problem when you come in here and you
promote something to people like you
gotta do your research
okay I've seen people come in put it on
there you know on the descriptions and
like hey man you want to send me some
money on big connect or whatever
don't promote something if you don't
know what the hell you talking about you
know it's like you know it's like we
bring back Tai Lopez as a Tai Lopez it's
talking about bitcoins right now
and as I hate now Tai Lopez is an expert
you know there's people out here that
start talking about certain topics and
don't don't they don't know nothing
about right but I want to make this
video because this is crazy I'm gonna
show you guys a few people I'm not I'm
there's a couple of developers that I've
seen they put the links on the
description people signed up they make
money you know people come in and invest
money into it and now everybody who put
money into it lost all of their money
now what everybody's doing everybody
that made you sign up in and say hey man
you know you trust me go sign up to this
thing they signed up for it they
invested money put in like you know five
thousand dollars two thousand dollars
ten thousand dollars they put all their
savings in there thinking hey man every
single time that you know you put money
in you get 1% back daily every single
day it was BS man all they were doing is
basically they give you money they give
you like 1% in your account but that's
an account that you came and take out
your money right so it looks like you
your money is growing every single day
so you leave it in there and next thing
you know is like hey you lose all your
money when they disappear so that's what
happened now the owners of big connect
disappeared I mean they were already
like hitting like they were anonymous
right but what I want to put this out
there is anybody who promoted big
connect should be outed everybody who
somehow any youtuber either from the
gaming community either from YouTube
community or freakin twitch web
developers whoever the hell made you
guys sign up or influenced you to sign
up
they should definitely be held
accountable right if you promote a big
connect people should know like hey man
this was the the the piece of that
made me sign up that influenced me into
signing up soliciting luckily I don't
you know me man I'm very skeptical with
what everybody comes in and puts in my
face I do my research first right I do
my research I figure it out so anybody
that comes in tells me hey man you can
make money with this listen I gotta do
my research and figure out how it works
I'm not gonna put money into it you know
what I mean
now Bitcoin of course has been dropping
it dropped on the ten thousand dollars
the other day I mean it's big kind of a
Ponzi scheme or is that a scheme I don't
think so I think Bitcoin and blockchain
technology is gonna be very important
but certain companies like this bit
connect were definitely schemes man and
you know if you've seen anybody talk
about bitcoins or big connect just
straight-up out them man you straight up
comment on they're on this like
y'all you out here promoting BS man like
it's crazy I'm not gonna put out the
names of like the web developers who
I've seen this about three of them right
I'm not gonna put the names out there
and this isn't about drama I'm staying
away from that's why I'm not putting
nobody's names you guys should know who
they are if you felt for the scheme but
because and the reason why it pisses me
off right I'm very passionate about this
thing man I'll treat you guys with all
respect companies come in boot camps
come in everybody comes in and reaches
out to me and says Joe how can we get
you to I'll promote our product I'm not
promoting nobody's product right unless
it's like really really good right the
reason why I tell you guys about Stephen
gratis course is cuz that helped me cold
steel's course cuz that helped me
everything that I tell you is something
that's gonna bring value to your life
right everything that I come in I tell
you hate this is good go ahead if I tell
you hey go buy a MacBook pearl is
because it's gonna be good for your life
is gonna be something
right I'm not gonna tell you hey man go
sign up to this thing if I don't believe
in it and if I know that is a scheme you
know what I mean
so it's just crazy to me that so many
people fell to this thing like it's
crazy
you know there's like I mean from like
the well-known youtubers who are out
there I'm not gonna put out the web
developers you guys should know already
who they are but did this is like the
the cream of the crap this is are the
guys that I've been seeing them a lot
like a lot a lot a lot
you got something called Craig grant I
don't know if you guys were seeing those
commercials he was promoting just like
Tai Lopez online a whole bunch of eret
izing he stopped he disappeared now he
disappeared Trevor James he disappeared
you got this guy Glen Carrig with us
another one promoting it all of these
guys here pretty much all part of the
Ponzi scheme and what you gotta
understand how things work is is a a
Ponzi scheme a pyramid scheme is
whoever's at the top makes money off
every single person that's under them so
right under each one of these guys
there's thousands of people thousands of
people are signing up thousands
thousands thousands thousands and then
you know like oh no you're not blocked
bunch of stuff you're here man how you
gonna be blocked I see everything
you don't see yourself right here in the
video I don't block people man I'll let
you disrupt and you're my boy so you
good but um yeah man like it's just
crazy man it's just crazy that people
even even just like I just don't like
that man I don't like when people take
advantage I don't like when people come
in and sell you a dream I don't like
when people come in and do stuff like
you know you know like like that guy
what I was telling you guys like yo this
is selling them like a course for five
hundred dollars the dude is in a
freaking library he don't even have
money to buy the freaking course but
he's gonna take a loan instead of buying
a
a computer he's buying somebody scores
for $500 say you know how crazy that is
I will feel bad I'll be like bro take
that money here's the course for free
that's how I am man but it's just crazy
man like the way and how greedy people
are people want to make money so bad in
this world that they prey upon the the
people that just don't know better and I
really think like every single person
that has promoted this thing every
single person is gonna get out it and
you should also out them out there like
it's just their names I don't know if
I'm I will create the platform maybe I
could maybe I do do a Ruby on Rails
course on for free put this out there
and be like hey man so people can add
can add whoever put them on to this
pyramid scheme you know because it's
messed up people you know how many
people come in sign up to services like
this you know it's like right now like I
come in I'll tell you guys hey man go
sign up for you know the Harry Potter
calm and you know you're gonna make a
million bucks like I should be
responsible for that if you lose your
money in that thing I should be
responsible for that that's how I feel
about it I'm like girl because why am i
promoting something if I don't even know
how that works
why am I telling people to go check out
something that I don't even know how it
works or or if they're gonna make money
or you know like it's not right so
that's what I wanted to say to this big
connecting cuz I'm shocked I already
know this thing was a Ponzi scheme but
they pretty much disappear man like they
really just disappear like that's a is
like a crashed well you know big connect
crashed so the price price a big connect
is like is nothing right now so bring up
the chart
and they were like you know a few for
like I don't know for like six seven
months there was commercials everywhere
about big connect big connect and people
signing up and you know making sure that
people get to sign up into it so it's
just crazy man
let me see so this just happened you
know what I mean it was selling for 400
like the big big connect coins with
Senator $435 you know then what happened
was on the website as soon as you logged
in and said hey big connect is stopping
and services so now mind you there's
about a billion dollars into this
company so what they did was say hey man
you can't take out your money but you
could keep the Bitcoin and another
bigger the Bitcoin big connect coin
whatever the tokens Wow so then those
those tokens don't they're worthless
they're pretty much worthless like
nobody's gonna use that so I started
going down everybody started selling say
Amen we're selling this thing and then
once it was like official like yes big
big connect is officially a scheme it
just dropped down to $40 and I mean I'm
laughing now but you know went down up
to $15 went up a little bit and there's
like no coming back down nobody wants
this down to like $13 and it's gonna
continue going down I wouldn't be
surprised this thing is gonna be worth
50 cents
so then you got the the guys that this
order the main promoters you got Craig
grant you got Trevor on Trevor on James
you know and I'm sorry but I feel bad
that they even you know they black you
know what I mean like I really do feel
bad because it's like you know they got
swindle in in too
this thing and then now people's gonna
be a man the token black guys look what
they did you know the dreaded black guys
look what they did like it's messed up
man you know it's like I'm pretty sure
they got taken for a ride and then all
of these guys up here you know they're
the big bosses they make millions of
these people you know and it just sucks
man I feel bad I really do feel bad you
know for all the people that were under
all of these people here man
like yeah you seem that do it on your
feet man for really
they've been everywhere they've been
promoting like crazy there's this other
Asian girl to who goes out there you
know it's a couple of web developers out
there promoting this thing and it's like
yeah thank you if I was somebody who
came in and I put five hundred dollars
into that thing man thank you man
you know thank you for making me sign up
to this thing now you know I mean I lost
my money and now they disappeared
yeah crypto Nick exactly crypto Nick
deleted all his videos about big
Connecticut that's when you know it's
like hey man is a scheme and it's like
because it's a scheme I don't want to
have my name on it but bro that's how
the Internet is man the Internet
people's gonna look back on it and gotta
be like y'all bro we know you like you
know what I mean like it's crazy it's
pretty crazy right now man this whole
big connect thing and I just feel bad
for the people that put money man yeah
man maybe hundred thousand of everyone
and bounce yep I mean they support
supposedly there was a billion dollars
in into this company right just in
circulation money that was circulating
so everybody got paid a little while
right
so you gotta pay so you came in you
let's say for example you put in ten
thousand dollars and then you got one
percent of that $10,000 every day but
the reason why you was getting paid that
much is because
everybody that was under you was getting
signed up so they the money that they
put in that's how you got was getting
paid and that's how everybody above you
was getting paid then at some point the
ones that are at the top they say you
know what
I already made fifty million dollars I
already made one hundred million dollars
shut down the website so now the scheme
can't continue rolling so now everybody
I put money and everybody that's at the
bottom that was expecting oh yeah I'm
gonna get my 1% tomorrow that's gone
okay it got shut down you know what I
mean
so yeah pyramid schemes man oh yeah man
this was a quick video man whoever you
see with when links to big connect put
them on the spot man put them on the
spot and leave a comment under this
stuff man be like yo how are you
promoting this thing it's like you you
messing it messing it up for the
subscribers like you know what I mean
I'm pretty sure somebody signed up for
it cuz everything whatever you put out
there right and it works no matter what
there's gonna be one percent of people
that always gonna sign up to whatever
you put out in the world so if you have
a hundred thousand subscribers and you
promote something to write so people
like that let's say a thousand people
signed up for it and let's say I don't
say thousand people a minimum of $500
each how much money they those people
put in and that was just from you from
your subscribers
you never know saying like you don't do
that man like I come in and I'm just
honest with everybody man
I always come in out I just be honest
with everybody it's just not right you
should never try to take advantage of
people when people are you know in a
place where they trying to better
themselves and trying to do good things
you should not come in and try to take
advantage of that I don't like that from
title opens I don't like it from Grant
Cardone I don't like it from
all the other web developers who do that
are here like give your values but don't
take advantage give good content but
don't take advantage don't rape you know
what I mean like do everything that you
got to do but don't rape you know what I
mean like that's that's all I'm saying
but anyways guys that was a quick little
video quick little rent I hope you guys
enjoyed it um yeah man trust guy more
than man with any type of money alright
so see you guys later
just out them man whoever you see out
here promoting that whoever you see is
out here you see them on the description
with hey man big connect bro you know
what you was doing
you know you was pretty much leaching
off your your subscribers I don't like
that man anyways man I'm out of here
