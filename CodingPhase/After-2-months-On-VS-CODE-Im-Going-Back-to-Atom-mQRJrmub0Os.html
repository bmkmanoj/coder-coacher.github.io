again man : face calm alright so this
video is about basically me going back
to Adam right so for the past two months
I will say at the end of June I started
messing around with Visual Studio code
and that's because I feel like that's my
fault for letting the world influence me
like I love Adam and Adam worked very
well for me sometimes it was slow but
nowadays they fix that right so it will
get slow if you had a whole bunch of
packages and and just like for me like I
used to have no Clyde there's a nuke
lighter nuclei or I don't know
Luke ID or whatever you want to call it
from Facebook and that would make my
atom super slow so if I had a loan or
file like a JavaScript with a couple of
thousand lines and we just go slow and
then I realized I was like no one went
let me try Visual Studio code so I try
Visual Studio code and to be honest with
you guys it's not that good it's really
not that good you know there's a lot of
hype behind it and one of the main
problems is it's so difficult to get a
package in so like let's say somebody
who wants to create a package for for
Visual Studio code the process of it is
very annoying plus everything has to be
tied in with Microsoft because Microsoft
is the creator of this so now all the
packages that are on Adam can be ported
to as your studio code even though they
both use electron but it's just really
annoying
because even like let's say an example
let's say the formatting right
formatting sucks on formatting sucks in
how you call this and Visual Studio code
so it's like it's really a problem for
me because I'm so used to like being
able to beautify and just make
everything look nice and and half es and
then give me the errors and I don't know
right I'm so used to Adam because of
that because all of the good things that
gives me that now coming to visual
studio for a little extra boost of speed
between switching between files it's not
worth it because you know so much you
know it's like not all the packages that
are on Adam are on is your studio code
you know I understand a lot of people
like this this just so you : most most
of the people are Windows users because
they're used to you know getting does
the whole Microsoft kool-aid like if you
get the the you know Windows XP and
whatever will is it Windows 10 and
you're on that kool-aid then okay cool I
will say hey why not use another product
from Microsoft and and just use this
thing
right but I'm being honest guys after
trying it for two months and I was gonna
go you know on the bandwagon and push
this out there and I would never even
create a course teaching people how to
use add-on visual studio that I was like
giveaway I'm going back to Adam it's not
right for me to teach people in Visual
Studio code because original stole your
code it's not even up to par with Adam
all the features that I had you know in
all the packages I'm talking about you
know thousands of packages in Visual
Studio code that's on them a couple of
hundreds maybe so that's what I'm saying
man like I'm going back to Adam and then
what I will tell people is also check
out Adam beta
so there's the beta releases that
they're pretty legit
they're pretty legit and you can upgrade
the beta releases um as things come up
you know so I'm going to say they give
you an update so you get the latest beta
right and it is great it works it works
just fine it works just like the regular
atom but with all the fixin's are gonna
come in in the next two three months so
you're always ahead of the curve so
that's right into nowadays right the
reality is there's a little glitch it's
fine
usually the little glitches will be like
something that you wouldn't even notice
the only people that will notice is the
people are created atom it will affect
your your you know your time on it in
how you edit files you will get all your
packages everything works perfectly
exactly how it's supposed to it's just
now you're getting the latest version of
it you know before it even comes out you
know sometimes when they release
something on the regular atom the IO is
a version before or even two versions
before where they say hey this is stable
so there's no bugs in it right but to be
honest with you I don't care there's a
bug because this is just a text editor
I'm not trying to do you know like
Photoshop this in Photoshop for me you
know what I mean like this thing Adobe
After Effects like this is just a text
editor just give me what I need make it
fast which is what they did now and
that's it like they fix whatever it was
the problem that I had before which was
just speed everything else off Adam it's
like amazing you get the best packages
you get packages right away you get
themes you get UI changes
you can't even customize that well duh
the one from Microsoft is your studio
code so for me I'm really big on
customizing things I'm really big um I'm
saying hey there's how I like my things
that's how I like to have my colors this
how I like to have my functions
ah you know italic for I like to have my
you know high-quality right you guys
know I use standard Jes for my standard
for JavaScript you know I don't use the
Airbnb I use standard AAS I don't like
send my colleagues and that's how I use
it and then it shows me everything that
I need right there on the screen like
let's say if I have if I do forget to
put something and I say I put a
semicolon it shows me right there on the
screen on this line you put a semicolon
right or like let's say for JSX it shows
me all the errors on the screen I don't
have to look at the console not like
Visual Studio I don't have to deal with
all that shit right so I didn't think
nothing is official I'm going back to
Adam guys and I do apologize for the
people that were waiting for a racial
story of cold course cuz it's not coming
guys I'm sorry it's not coming I'm
switching it up to the add of course
because it has everything that you need
guys it has more than what people need
like you have every single language
that's out there you could have amazing
experience with Adam like it doesn't
matter to be crystalling it could be
JavaScript could be Python could be go
could be noted it doesn't matter what it
is like is amazing like they've been
doing their thing and the fact that they
upgraded and fix all those of problems
that they had cuz I think it was like
more like a memory leak where if there
was too much or too many packages on a
single instance of the atom then I will
just go super slow for no reason so you
have to choose like all four packages
and that's it to make it go fast so now
you could actually just have like 20
right now I have 40 some food packages
and everything was running smooth
I'm like whoa like they really upgraded
it like trust me so yeah guys I'm going
back to Adam and that's what we're doing
now kids like your boys back Adam
welcome back you thought it was over not
dot listen it's a whole new world right
here man would you click show more
you're gonna see everything all right

because I'm sponsored by them now you
leave me calm but it's crazy because
