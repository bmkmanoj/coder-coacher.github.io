know Superboy joke back at it again man
coding face.com I don't need it again
guys man we in here we live we chillin
all right I just wanted to let you guys
know man we already started the
JavaScript man JavaScript future-proof
who's approved javascript lized versa
right so if you guys haven't man courses
link courses and I'm doing it totally
different from what everybody something
gives you
as long this would JavaScript business
this is what a function is not I'm
giving you guys exactly what you guys
need to get hired to know what you need
and become a developer right so is
actually pretty legit man I wish
somebody would have taught it to me like
that because when you're coming from
like no technical background like you're
not a computer science major you you
don't have no idea about what
programming is and you're like I just
want to build a website I just want to
get started I just want to be able to
make things happen sometimes you get
overwhelmed that's like if I tell
somebody hey if you have no idea what
JavaScript is and I tell you hate jump
onto the JavaScript understanding the
weird parts right if I tell somebody
that and I go like hey man check out
this course and you have no idea what
the hell's going on that course is too
overwhelming even for people who who
know JavaScript know that classes is
very dense it's like it's heavy
of content right and content that
regular people won't be able to
understand so right now my goal is to
basically you know pick up Jodha
mechanic or Jane Doe the
marketing assistant right and teach them
HTML CSS and JavaScript in an easy way
the money way you know what I mean that
way
teach them in a way where they could
pretty much just pick it up and start
making things happen because one thing
that I'm doing also if it also died are
I taking a course right now is basically
I'm not coming in and telling you guys
oh there's an example here's the
answer's no I'm not doing that for you
guys I'm showing you guys how how to do
like my sane example I guess today I
finished the functions right
so I teach people what a function is
in simple terms right I'll tell you hey
this just a cold lock right and why is
the user for rain where is it useful for
so I'll teach you that way and then from
there I basically tell the students to
check out this exercise all right I'll
teach you how to build it I'll teach you
how to build a function how to declare a
function inside of a variable and then
from there what I just taught you I give
you an exercise where you has to where
you have to use your brain I don't have
to tell you hey this is how you do this
is how you do that no no no I just
taught you how to actually build the
function right you will have to use your
brain and say hey now he gave me this
exercise of creating a function that
prints out my name right you have to do
it on your own right that's something
that they don't do in order to Torrio's
over all the courses it's like they
teach you video plus video plus video
plus video plus video you can't retain
them and you can't remember what is it
useful for so I don't know I'm creating
my own my own formula of how to teach
people how to code and I think it's
coming out pretty well like it's pretty
 good you know
so I'm actually excited
yeah man I'm eating late man
I like eating late though because you
know what because this AC is to praise
you right now that that face is to
Goldie okay let's see let's turn on the
AC but let's put a little bit low
alright so why do I take lunch break so
late
number one it's 2 o'clock right so if I
come and get my my turkey sandwich then
I'm good till Oh No
6 7 o'clock at night to eat which is how
long it's gonna take me to you know get
home and then cook and do everything
that I got to do all right so I usually
like to eat late even though right now
so hungry I'm so tired I should be
eating earlier but it's fine
I'll take it Plus also too when I come
back it's like 2:45 almost 3 o'clock so
that means I don't have to wait too long
to go home you know what I mean like it
feels like the day passed by quick you
know when I eat lunch I never in or 12
o'clock I swear to god it feels like I
gotta be there forever so oh my god got
away another five hours to get out of
here you know but when I late at least
in say ok I only got two hours left you
know what I mean
you got a game the system kick even
though you're gaming it mentally but you
know for me it's just easier
yellow dye and accounting you know
Diann Perry what up I love seeing you
people in here man I love it I love
seeing you people in here man
cuz it just tells us like you'll be
getting a bigger audience and you know
we growing every day man
I'm telling you guys don't be surprised
when we started touching the millions
and people was gonna be very surprised
they're gonna be like how the hell this
guy did it you know especially when you
know when you look at it as far as views
and and popularity on YouTube and
like that
like nobody's looking for for no
youtubers that do code like you know
what I mean like ain't nobody looking
for those people you know what I mean
not to diss any of my friends or anybody
ain't nobody looking for nobody here
right nobody's looking for you know the
be like Oh was this guy's name
rice gum or or was this other
guy Casey nice that anyway you know
those are personalities those are people
that even if you don't like what their
channel you know who they are
you know what I mean I feel like I'm one
of those people you know what I mean
like I'm doing something great which is
teaching how to code but at the same
time I coming in I'm dropping the sauce
you know what I mean we in here sauce in
it do it sound positive which is the
main point of this it's just to do
something positive show people you can
do something else other than you know
the norm and to teach people how to code
like you know is it's not that hard
people come in and be like oh man this
 is so hard because I know how it
felt right I know how it felt and at the
same time I know how how hard it is in
the beginning to to pick up these things
but it's like you going up a mountain
right and then you're going up this
mountain and somewhere in the middle
that's like a club alright there's like
a club there's a couple of beanies
there's like you know all your friends
are there halfway there to that mountain
right and you're like oh man
at least we got to chill halfway there
so halfway there means you know how to
build something you know how to
basically use your brain to build things
through programming right but that's
half the battle right from there you
have to go to you know find a job then
from there after you find a job you
gotta basically keep on learning new
technologies new frameworks new
programming languages new paradigms you
know you got functional programming you
got object-oriented programming like in
the beginning you're gonna get the easy
jobs because you're a junior developer
they're like we can't get this guy
wouldn't trust this guy with the hard
stuff and that's fine that's the best
part of like learning how to code and
becoming a developer is those junior
years because they don't give you any
hard work
now when you become a mid-level senior
level developer then there's pressure
then this there's like you know
it's a lot of pressure because it's like
they want to they want to have you do
all the hard right so that's what I
would say to you guys like enjoy it
enjoy it right now right now all you
have to worry about is building a simple
page enjoy it you know
most New York City software development
environment like I mean this it's fun
there's a lot of people out here it's
very competitive in the sense of Lake
now everybody is as nice as me if you go
and you look into my comments right and
you go into my comments and you see
comments from people they'll be like
dropping hate those are the majority of
like the mid-level senior-level
developers and sometimes you get like a
junior developer right that would throw
something but that's how it usually is
right it's competitive everybody thinks
they know everything everybody is like
oh I've been doing this for five years
I've been doing this for ten years I've
known this pro framework since
alpha like that's what you're gonna bump
into here in New York all right and I'm
gonna make another video maybe today I'm
gonna make about it yeah cuz I was
thinking about that was like yeah I
should make a video about the snob enos
right people are so snobby when it comes
to like New York San Francisco
you know the tech cities right the tech
hubs like I feel like when I what I hear
people write like whatever with the
whole thing with even you yesterday and
he's like oh you know you say that if
you jest there's no jobs for it but get
labs in Adobe they're they're basically
they running view J yes and this and
that and dislike the snob enos of like
people from San Francisco like they
really think like that's the whole
country they really think that that's
how the whole world is all right I
wanted to make a video about that
because a lot of people will come in be
like oh no js' is everywhere or Python
is everywhere and it's like mmm no it's
mostly just like New York San Francisco
you're like
the rest of the world are doing other
 they're using Java they're using
PHP like you know what I mean like when
I tell people learn PHP is because I
know now everybody here lives in New
York or San Francisco or freaking Dallas
you know what I mean like I know you
guys live in other parts of the country
so I want you guys to get into a job as
soon as possible if I tell you hey you
learn something that there's no jobs for
or there's only jobs in a very small
niche area like what do you think is
gonna happen you're not gonna find a job
and the next thing you're gonna tell me
is you know you Joel you
put me studying the the
Harry Potter framework I can't find a
job with the Harry Potter framework
right they're gonna be pissed
off right my viewers is gonna be pissed
off and I feel like that that happens
all the time as far as like you know
people that that come from you know San
Francisco and you know Silicon Valley
like they really think that the whole
world works how it works over there you
know what I mean like even here in New
York like there is no jobs for view Jes
so you know just because like two
companies if I can have jobs for it
doesn't mean that the whole world should
learn it you know but whatever that's
another topic done we'll make a video
about but it's just funny to me how
people they're very snobby in this tech
cities is like if you guys don't live
here you know
y'all won't get the same thing
why are you
where do word word word sorry I'm
reading everybody staying I'm reading
your boy cam I'm reading your boy Matt
talking about this core link also too we
got you know we got getter as always get
her I feel get her it's always good
because it's like let's say you you you
chain right now right or let's say you
coding it's good to get them get her
because right there like you go ask a
question to somebody or like you want to
know something
and you have somebody that's gonna
answer it right away like I'll see
people talking and get her and it seems
like the most is like a mini you know it
doesn't matter what time it is
it could be two o'clock in the morning 3
o'clock in the morning the most that you
gonna wait for an answer is like 3
minutes because we all get a
notification on the phone so yeah
now this chord is good too I'm trying to
I'm gonna jump jump to this core to at
one point
well I haven't had the chance somebody
sent me a uh invite to the discord I
have a discord channel thanks to Barbara
I don't even know was my my discord chat
I love my my subscribers man you know
the one that I started was the Gator get
it was dope but yeah this cord is better
cuz I hear you could use your voice in
there and you could record like your
voice and send it out to people so it's
I got a large a large conversation right
how do you think someone create a
company like Squarespace well you gotta
I don't know I wouldn't be able to
answer that you got to know at least
JavaScript because everything is squares
faces is made in JavaScript give me a
second move okay Sandra Drive no
no this one trying to get that's what
I'm trying to get you see that that's
the new Maserati Maserati SUV I'm trying
to get that this is that I got right
here this ain't to that look
at that I'm trying to stuff it up
next year

Oh starving I'm starving
what I'm starving today why because on
Annie no breakfast give me nothing wrong
that all dates in there what about
getting these Griffin nothing up my dish

Jelinek see a lot
I'm just saying
but my mom sent me some attacks she
said
she told me she told me this
which is kind of true I will tell you
when I get in the car
she said stop looking for the riches
stop looking for the riches and stop um
you know going so hard take some time
off relax and I say you know what I
can't because I just have to go really
hard ever since my sister passed away I
feel like my life changed after she
passed away in December December 26
well December 27 actually after that day
my life changed
I gotta go hard like what the hell I'm
supposed to do just be some dude
at Wendy's nah we want to work hard in
this world one accomplice son I want
that when I die people know hey I helped
out people and people know oh he did
something you know I want people I'll be
honest up one people to cry for
me I feel like it I feel like if you die
nobody cries for you that means he was a
shitty person you know so that's that's
my goal
I want my goal is to leave a impact to
this world and when something happens to
me or passably or whatever somebody were
like damn man we miss them no because we
just not promised tomorrow's not
promised right and then as far as like
material things
I don't want let's see real things it's
not I wanted to I don't want it but it's
like this nobody is going to give me an
award
nobody's gonna Pat me in the
back and be like oh great job Joe
nobody's going to do that for me so I
have to do it to myself right I work
hard and I buy a lot of for myself
now those are my trophies all right like
this car for me going from a
Saturn Vue this is my trophy I'm like
okay you busted your ass last year next

common you spend I don't know
five times okay
all right
you good and on top of that for a yearly
subscription right
it's $45 so your your pain for
not for free but I don't know I believe
in investing in yourself right
nobody can do that for you like yes you
could spend hours and hours looking
through things on YouTube and I don't
believe it's possible you know go ahead
watch it through you to learn through
you to is gonna take the same quality
you know but
the fact that you're like man
to
the look he's giving me man I know you
could
you
you
Oh
guys you guys don't have to watch my
videos yeah collision
and I'm out of here I gotta go eat and
for him I love you guys
84 I see you keep doing your thing
but yeah man we in here man my driving a
Maserati not yet not yet we in the wind
up Benz though no no men be
Oh even more harder right
last year she was that my taxes was 127
all right so this year I'm doubling up
right plus I'm not spending no money I
only use spending on the baby and
that's it everything else I'm saving it
so what you think I'm gonna do with that
money right I got two things either buy
the house all right but enough I'm gonna
stay here in New York yeah
now if I don't buy a house I'm gonna
give myself a gift what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna go back and I'm gonna trade
this back in and I said okay guys
trade this give me the brand-new
Maserati SUV now once I touch them down
one then I'm good I don't want to go any
higher than that I just need a SUV cuz I
love being a nice of you I don't like
cars but if we touch down a SUV
I'm good after that you know what I mean
like after that anything can happen to
me man and I'll be happy I'll be like
that's a at least I made it I try to get
into the game I made it you know what I
mean so that's where we at Reina and
that's why I tell people like you people
so much oh man high school is
like you know like I don't know if I
should learn how to code man code has
done so much for me man Blake you
know where I will be I ran out taking
the train going to work as an IT worker
earning $40,000 a year
 struggling because the rent over
here in New York is like $2,000 so I
will be spending like half of my
rent and that's not even counting how
much I will get after taxes so you know
what I'm saying like it just takes time
guys nobody you know and at the end of
the day I'm still gonna always talk
about code because code there's so much
for me like even right now I got
a lot of money and just packing up
even if like you know three four years
from now I decided to just like get away
from coding I will still do my tutorials
online but I wouldn't work for a company
right
Mar can open up a Wendy's open up a
 Dunkin Donuts but at least code
got me to that point because me working
a regular nine-to-five job was not gonna
get me that money
when god forbid my mom passes away all
I'm again
there's people out there who their
parents got it yes they got this and
that I'm not getting none of that I
get a bill hey pay for a funeral
and here's all her bills that's
what I'm again I love my mom and
everything
it's like I don't have that
like I see people you guys should watch
out watch that showgirls my girl come
today this show
how did she graduate if a cop doesn't
work her parents pay her rent her
parents paid everything and there's so
many people like that in New York I'm
not even lying to you guys every
lip
um
they're rent is paid there
there's our
you know I mean
and for me to go to the next level I
gotta continue work
and I want to go
a entrepreneur I want to create clothes
I want to become a musician or something
I don't know you could use it to fund
your ideas you know but yeah man I'm out
of here man
