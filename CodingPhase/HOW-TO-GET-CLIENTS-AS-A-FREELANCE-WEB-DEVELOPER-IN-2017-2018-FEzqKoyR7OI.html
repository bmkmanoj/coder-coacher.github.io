back at it again man coding freeze calm
listen your voice back I didn't did it
again alright listen kids got the mic
out here we ain't here man alright so
basically like I told you guys I'm gonna
be answering questions that I find on my
website calling phrase calm and that's
pretty much the new format right I was
answering questions from Korra before
and I say you know what man let's ask
some questions that are people that are
actually here the people that actually
watch this channel right so let's do
like this whenever you have a question
come to the website : face comm register
find a channel write whatever topic it
is that you want to actually ask about
find it in here come you be few GS
nodejs react whatever if it's not here
you could come here creating alright so
pretty much let's get back to it so how
to get clients as a freelance web
developer in 2017 2018 so how exactly
can we can we get a client in 2017 right
now we are halfway there to get into
2018 how can we do this right it's very
simple guys like you don't have to be a
genius you don't have to be like a super
developer like all you have to do is
pretty much put in the work if you know
how to build a page then you're able to
get a job out there trust me especially
from the house man like it's not that
hard but um yeah so let's start it up
with this I'm going to share my screen
I'm gonna give you guys a couple of good
websites pretty much this is good
article that it shows you the 15 best
websites to actually find a freelance
job online right I've actually used a
couple of these I've used up work up
work is like the OG he does the grant
this is like duh this is like the
classic website used to be called
odesk.com millions of people come here
there's hundreds of jobs I mean hundreds
of thousands of jobs every single day
but of course the competition can be
pretty fierce guys there's a lot of
competition here and what sucks about it
is that there's like a whole bunch of
you know Indian developers who are
pretty much charging like $3 an hour or
$8 an hour I was doing show here it is
somewhere here you're gonna find some
crazy prices right so of course you're
gonna get the top level guys charging 40
50 a hundred you know but at the same
time it's good to get your face out
there like your is not guarantee you're
gonna find a job here but you could find
a job where depending on your skills
like let's say for a contract for two
three months you come to up work get a
contract start working for a company and
if they want to keep you looking all
right and my company will actually hire
I think like two people directly full up
work so yeah so it works right I've done
it before
all right now then you have top two well
top total I guess top tool I don't know
how you how you actually say this thing
but this is pretty much this like for
the guys are really really good like for
those of you guys that want to
specialize in something like let's say
you want to specialize in specifically
nodejs
there's a job for you here but to get
this jobs and to get even on the list
you're gonna have to take a test you're
gonna have to take a interview it's like
so much work to be honest I don't even
know if it's working like I did it one
time and I got halfway through the
process and I was like man
why am I doing this thing like yeah you
could work for like you know top
companies and this and that but it's
like the whole process is a freaking
nightmare alright so and to me is a
waste of time but for some people they
like this you know that I care I want to
take the test I want to figure out you
know find out if I'm in the top 3% for
me it was like when why am I doing this
it's like I'm doing work for free you
know that's how I look at it I was like
man I'm actually spending time doing
interview and spending time doing the
test I'm like man I could get Bing I
could getting paid for this you
know what I mean that's how I feel about
it
all right but for you guys I want to be
you know want to test yourself and be
like hey can I get in with top 2% go
ahead if you have the time and you have
a good week of like you know put in the
work and frickin try to get into this
this uh top 3% which is pretty much
 a lot of people if you go to
Korra they pretty much say is the same
 as everywhere it's just
but what's good about it it's like this
not that much competition because most
people don't want to come here and waste
their time and doing you know take a
test that's gonna take you to three days
sometimes they even make you create a
web application that might take you
hours and you're like why am i doing
this thing it's like I'm working for
free right but if you have the time go
ahead alright so let me see another one
you have elance.com
which is also like um let me close this
you don't really know your boys on
worldstar
it's also up work um I think they merged
it together now ile s so yeah it's not
Joey yeah so it now joined up work it
used to be different from old desk so
not are they they merge old desk and
elance.com and they merge they into up
work alright this also freelancer
I try this one too before but it wasn't
for what development it was for more
design work when I used to do designs
let me see what else the other one of
course Craigslist you can't go wrong
with Craigslist guys like straight up
you're not gonna go wrong with it like
you could come here to the gigs search
HTML right that's gonna be somebody that
needs to your skills alright so let's
see WordPress developer right
somebody needs a website $50.00 per hour
all right what else another one the
website designer an SEO like this is
easy they still ask them for Dreamweaver
which means like when you think about is
like that means they don't know anything
about web development so you literally
you could go in there and take advantage
like you could go in there and when I oh
yeah let me you know I've done this this
in this and by reality just like a
beginner right so you know you probably
get like gone off fixing $20 just to
freelance for this person uh what else
look at this web design agency you
looking for a full set PHP developer now
let's see this is close to my area
little island but you can do this with
any city you could come here and be like
hey go to let's say let's say in the
middle of nowhere
Missy gigs look at some gig right there
already this was saying no pay but for
you guys that trying to do
since shapes or you guys not wanted to
work like y'all want to work on a
website yeah when I have something on
your resume look this is great remote
you can work from your house you know
create this website for this online
Catholic school simpler right now of
course like it all depends on your area
right like I live in New York State
right so in New York that's definitely
gonna be a whole bunch of jobs now if
you go to like let's say Tracy maybe
Miami
I know Miami doesn't have a pretty big
you know what development scene but the
website edits to an HTML project battery
like this is easy so what they asking is
like hey can you edit my my project
gallery like it's not that hard guys you
guys can probably earn a cool $50 $100
just go in there and edit this guy's
 page it's not that bad so yeah so
it's like a whole bunch of different
stuff that you could do and of course
this it's not gonna be like up work or
topsail way you working for like you
know Amazon or you working for
creaking Google or whatever Facebook
whatever right you're working for like
small businesses so that's way to get
clients in 2017 now this is another way
right so we gotta go to some Google Maps
I'm gonna say Ridgewood New York it's
the neighborhood that I grew up are
right so let's say an example you want
to you live a rich would all right so
let this thing load you live here in
Ridgewood and you say hey I want to find
some clients you look around yet
neighborhood you say business businesses
alright see what actually shows up let's
say real estate ok that's a couple of
real estate not that many but it's a
cold one
alright so : real estate right let's
come here we come to their website let's
see if it's brand new website ok it's
not that bad most likely gonna need you
but you get the point
ok so let's see lucky real estate
mortgage so this is a real estate
company right um real a real estate
office you could see that they don't
have a website so you could actually
reach out to them and be like hey hi my
name is Joe Santos I was calling to find
out because I see that you guys don't
have a website you know I'm actually a
developer I live here rich would I would
like to maybe work something out with
you I'll help you I'll get you on SEO
you know get you all on Google Maps it's
you know nowadays everybody has a
website it's like if you have a business
you need a website right so you
basically you sell yourself to the
person so that's like one way to get you
know clients also to sometimes you could
go to different boards we're like Stack
Overflow write Stack Overflow Jack's
remote oh okay like this or no full
stack rails developer no office location
which means is remote this one's another
one senior back-end developer like of
course this for senior senior level but
sometimes you find here junior level or
mid level right so this is one place
alright
now sorry another place as good is Larry
jobs sorry this thing is loading right
here constantly there's always people
posting jobs you know remote keys
feeling developer Maribelle like this a
million jobs here like I'm not relying
see you guys there's so many jobs here
so long as you have a nice portfolio and
you can show that hey I can do the job
you're gonna get hired because we also
hire another person from this website -
Larry jobs so yeah man um I don't know
like you know now those are places where
I would say for anybody looking for
freelance work right now in 2017 like
those are places that I would look for
you know and that's like of course you
got in the equals go indeed.com and say
remove this remove okay so you delete
the area where as where and then you use
search of remote and then okay some
documentation specialist this easy
remote web content editor precision I
hired the Kishin calm so pretty much is
like even though this is a they need a a
bachelor's degree in reality you donate
it all they care about is like can you
edit the pages you know do you know a
little bit of HTML like this is easy
freelance work like this is not
complicated JavaScript this like easy
stuff like this a million of those jobs
out
they're all right of course there's more
complex more like remote senior systems
engineer but it all is all there
trust me guys like I found jobs that I'd
be surprised I'm like how the hell
people are not getting these jobs you
know like look at this thing
content right I want to tell you Consul
idea most of the time like all they care
about was like if the person know how to
how to write a little bit till they know
a little bit of HTML can they add a page
to a WordPress can add an image to a
wordpress page I you know there's a
million different jobs like you could
just work remote and just do freelance
work with the skills that you have like
it's not that hard trust me this guy's
that they go all around the world they
live you know free no freaking not free
but you know they're free they they're
out there they can only work remotely
from Thailand the work remotely from
Colombia they work remotely from you
know Argentina and like they just travel
the world just working different gigs if
you have no kids no responsibilities and
you're like pretty free right now like
when you could just do some easy
freelance work you know and just get
paid and not have to be attached to just
one job so at the same time you could
you know continue learning your skills
and making yourself a better developer
you know with time because that's like
one of the things that I did to like
when I was starting I was doing like a
lot of little gigs on Craigslist like
for free or stuff that people were
paying me $50 $100 they'd be like okay
you add this images to my page and I'm
doing or they'll be like hey can you add
Google Maps to my page and I will do it
that's a quick 100 dollars like you know
Amazon is not a constant work but at
least is something that
you could get by with you know as you
continue your learning everything right
so yeah man that's the video I'm making
for tonight man oh yeah right now I
wanted to see exactly who's out here in
the chat room let me see who's in here
Oh give me a second to chit chit chit
chit chit missiles in here man I just
bought cake grayness Elon Musk FinTech
who else is in here bunch of stuff max
Prager Casey oh who else busy who else
is in here and a Gibson who else is in
here
a Hadji - Rai oh yeah another place man
that people forget about this fiber guys
like I don't know who guys checked it
out but I almost forgot about this fixed
right fiber is like the biggest game in
the world but you can make good money on
here so like the same example ah where
is it programming in tech all right what
programming okay so
so they say like this right like this
guys stay like oh I will edit any PHP
you I'm sorry for you know five islets
right but then when you go into the
thing they start charging more and more
and more so it's not just five dollars
it's like you know it ends up to being
like a hundred dollars per page which is
not that bad if you know how to work
things right in and you know how to
promote yourself properly here I was
watching this interview about this guy
who who does all his work just from
fiber calm and like he got in it like in
the beginning when it was like you know
barely anybody here because now there's
a lot of competition there's a lot of
people trying to trying to get a little
extra money on the side you see you come
in it's like okay I will make any web
test HTML CSS JavaScript PHP or sequel
for ten dollars right next thing you
know this thing becomes fifty dollars
next thing you know this thing becomes
ninety dollars now you might think like
oh man it's only ninety dollars but what
you don't know is that this guy here you
know mr. ko he got like you know thirty
different clients in one day or like a
week so if you multiply let's say fifty
dollars time starting man you're looking
at a pretty chump change like a week you
know so a lot of people be sleeping on
fiber comm there's like one of those
websites where you can make pretty good
money
another one is toy say oh yeah I suppose
I WordPress and if you become really
good with WordPress you could come here
something for us right and you could
actually sell you your themes here and
pretty much you sell your theme right
you decided okay I'm gonna create a
theme for a real estate
I'm gonna create a thing for a
restaurant and then you sell your team
here and then somebody buys it they
install on their website plus now you
get to support them right so if they
want to be like oh I can install the
plug-in that you created whatever you
get I hate I'll charge you $50 and I'll
come in myself and and fix it for you
you know even though you you're doing it
from your house but you're pretty much
doing the work all right
and like this guy is here really kill it
right let me see I'm trying to see
bestsellers all right wait
what works I started super simple like
they're not that hard at all to do like
they should a simple man if you look at
this layout this is super simple you can
pay the designer to create this page for
you right and give you the header size
or fonts you pay a designer 50 bucks
right and then you say okay I'm gonna
create this this website this whole
thing this whole template for them you
create this thing you put it online you
sell it then from there now you're
looking at how much did this guy sell
eighteen thousand four hundred and
twenty one times sixty dollars you're
looking at 1 million dollars so this guy
Avada created this freaking team that
was made probably three years ago he
made a million dollars out of this thing
like I don't know if you guys understand
like the Hustle is the thing is just
because you you have a certain skill and
you say hey that's it now I know how to
code that doesn't mean you gotta stop
there guys
sorry that doesn't mean you have stopped
it doesn't mean that you gotta be like
hey I'm just gonna be a web developer
and work for a company and be a monkey a
coding monkey all day like no you gotta
have aspirations and me like you I want
to do something with myself I want to
get the skills I want to work in a
company for next next two years or
whatever and then from there jump on to
something else you want to jump into
something that where you're independent
that's the beauty about being a
developer being a programmer being an
engineer right because you're pretty
much creating all of this um this code
and sometimes you come up with cool
ideas like you might be working with a
client right and then you're working
with a client you like you building a
website friend but then in by creating
that website you realize they're so uh
neat that hasn't been filled yet right
so it could be like somebody hasn't
created a plugin for an example which
probably already created a gallery for
Facebook images right now you notice
nobody has that so what you do is you
create that and now you put it up online
and you sell it for $5 $10 $15 next
thing you know that becomes a huge oh
freakin sorry
a huge project and the next thing you
know is like you're making 200 300 K 400
K independently that's what a lot of the
Android developers iOS developers do
like they create small little projects
small little games stupid-ass games
stupid-ass little things where you say
hey I'm going to create a little
slideshow from all my Instagram pictures
and I want them to be put together right
those guys they make a killing because
they come in and they find a problem in
all the different websites or all the
different apps and they say okay I'm not
going to create this huge website that
does
everything I'm just going to create
something as small as this and just
create that little thing that other
people need to use other apps or use
other websites so they go in and create
that and charge people three five
dollars ten dollars and next thing you
know you're making half a million
dollars a year like you gotta have this
it's not just using your fingertips and
you know freaking type of all day you
gotta use this thing right here man
you gotta know that if you have a skill
you gotta make this thing work for you
you didn't come here and bust the acid
and you know spend all this time
learning all this code for no reason to
just work for somebody else you gotta
think about it like this yeah I want to
be independent I'm either gonna be a
freelancer create my own business or
create my own business model that nobody
has ever created you know those are the
people are become successful right now
of course the futures want to be a you
know Joe Schmo the guy who just has his
life very safe and they're like okay I
have my little insurance I have my
benefits I work for this company and I'm
gonna stay here forever if you're that
person cool stay there forever right
that's what you know I tell a lot of
people here on YouTube like hey man just
because you have a job and it's cool and
they're comfortable there don't stay
there forever
and like branch out start doing other
things because staying in one job is
it's not the answer like we're not meant
to stay in one place forever you know
this is not the 50 this is not the
sixties where you know you work for Ford
and you stay there till you frickin
retire and you break your back now man
you only live once and that's the truth
it's yellow out here you did so um yeah
man those are the websites that I will
say for you guys to actually check out
at the same time yeah man being here man
so right now what we gonna do is just
hang up in the chat room for a little
bit before I go to sleep yeah yeah cool
with that you dick
let me see using you right oh okay give
me a second
you can see the machines freaking people
on the chat room shared the chat on the
real quick with you guys guys it's crazy
if you want to do jQuery to jQuery guys
man if you got a question Maria go ahead
leave questions right there man you come
join the the website leave a question on
any of this I'm sorry I'm so tired you
leave a question about any of these
channels or create your channel I will
answer your question create a video body
you know it's like that's what I tell
everybody man it's like I get so many
emails I get so many private messages
and it's like I can't answer everybody
but at least I can answer the ones that
do come here and take the time to
register on the website in you know just
show love you know because I also want
to you know what I want this thing to to
be successful at the same time to make
it a community where we could actually
have a dialogue on and talk about you
know coding different libraries and
whatever right so but it's up to you
guys you know so any question that you
might have just go ahead registers and
send it to me I will answer it I will
create a video like that's why I think
I'm trying to do a question on every day
at least two to two to three different
questions a day so but right now only so
one so let's see nobody else is in here
now created I was an example when you
see who else is in here like just come
in leave a questions a car you know a
lot of people been sharing links which
is good but I haven't seen that many
questions here I think you guys should
definitely you know leave questions in
here and at the same time is good if if
you come in here and you see somebody
left a question you know the answer go
ahead
be with comet so like that not only are
they getting my question my my my
question my answer they also get in your
answers and you know look who make their
own choice on which one's the best one
for them oh yeah man let's see about the
D method the chat room is dead today man
seems like the chat room is pretty dead
today man I mean there's 41 people in
here but you guys talking about
that has time to do it with the video or
anything so yeah so I do private
tutoring yes I was doing a little
private tutoring before but I don't have
time for to be honest with you guards
man I got a I owe this guy my boy Jerry
an hour or two but after him I'm
probably gonna retire it cuz I just
don't have the time you were like right
now and I have to like sneak away to do
this video it's like I just had a baby
and stuff and was like oh man so it's
like I don't really have the time you
know and I'm super tired
yeah after upward before men but upward
the problems of work is that there's no
there's no limit to the minimum right so
somebody could come in and be like hey
I'll work for 50 cents an hour and
they'll let it slide and I think that's
completely like you know nobody
should be working for less less than $15
an hour nobody should be working for
less than $15 an hour I don't give a
 if you live in India I don't care
if you live in on the tree in
Africa I don't care where you live man
you should not be working for less than
$15 an hour because what you're doing is
you're messing up the whole system the
whole ecosystem of like you know what
development because now you're working
for pretty much for free you know so
yeah and that's like the problem was
like a lot of cars so they'd be like hey
why are you charging you know forty
fifty dollars an hour when I could go to
you know I could go to up work I'm
firing up a cool Indian who just would
charge me 50 cents like you know what I
mean life and then they mess it up and
I'm not going against you no Indian
developers and stuff good but they know
that there's a lot of them that they're
doing shady business they just like
messing up the whole system you know so
that's like the problem you know I
understand is different economies and
you could live okay somewhere else
working for five out of five ten dollars
a day but man if you over here working
for $1 $2 $3 a day well an hour whatever
like come on man get off the internet
Lee you know if you're not if you got
enough enough Oh freaking now this to be
online and be coding like you could be
charging more than that
like I don't care where you live doesn't
matter where like you should be charging
more than that yeah the quality of the
site is definitely not good that's for
sure
because a lot of times is like not to
bash I don't want to bash any developers
at all
you fight there's there's just way too
many it's like I don't know if you know
this just way too many being
done over there like everything from you
know from hacking and then there the
customer service day like hey hi we will
unlock your computer you pay us
20 dollars like they do a lot of shitty
 in India right now and I know this
is not their fault because it's the way
how the world is is it's kind of messed
up but at the same time it's like man
somebody gotta stop that
yeah yeah I don't know yes what is my
visit to marys it is made my night this
right here made my night ready so
sometimes in the chat room you find some
gems right so so Camp Perry says you
know I'm only getting paid eight dollars
eight dollars an hour full time should
give my head I'm sorry camp but if this
is real this is for table still
hilarious so they talk about that you
know they paying $15 an hour New York
City from McDonald said which is true
but everything is getting autumn well
you know automatic anyways it's gonna be
automated by robots anyways or it's
gonna be like hey you make your own
 McDonald's you you go into the
back you go to McDonald's so it's gonna
be so bad that you gotta go into
McDonald's and the Machine is gonna tell
you hey you want to go to the back and
make you hamburger like that's
how bad is gonna be but this should make
Marty right up so I am only getting paid
$8 an hour full-time shaking my head and
then yeah FinTech does like yo Camp
Perry $8 damn bro were you living in
India I'm sorry
Indians my fault but care goes like nah
Oklahoma I know it might not be funny to
you guys but it's just funny to me
because it's like there's some parts of
the United States which is like the
middle of nowhere it's like I
wouldn't be surprised a charging $1 out
there like
oh but now that as though I wouldn't be
surprised to go to McDonald's by next
year in the machine just cuz I hey you
wanna go in and make your own burger
like yeah because you know the business
owners don't want to pay people $15 an
hour so what they're gonna do is they're
gonna have one one they gotta
have the Tokyo black guy alright at
McDonald's right cuz this what they do I
