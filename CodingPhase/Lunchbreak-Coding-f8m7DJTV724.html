process man because I really wish I
would have had somebody like that when I
started from the beginning you know I
like nobody was here in YouTube nobody
was here on on the web period creating
content for my whole journey right
there's gonna be people are gonna find
my channel two years from now and then
they could go back to those beginning
videos right now you guys are have been
here since the beginning you guys seen
the girl if you have seen the process
and yeah man we just in here man like I
don't know I don't even know what's the
same in like I'm excited got them
fucking bottom garden goddamn fucking
water that's alright Saamy water
it's not until crazy
how long is good let's take a little
ride let's take a little ride back in
such a poor legend I forgot to bring out
napkins
so it was crazy man what was out here
getting wet that's what she said
I want you guys to do a little research
right now search this guy call
I think it's mustache Ian's money or dr.
moustache me search mustache like the
mustache right money search that on
YouTube right now
well now right now when when you get a
chance right after what you watch me
hanging out right I want you guys to
check that guy out he basically he was a
web developer look like a software
engineer right and basically he was
earning a hundred and thirty thousand
dollars in San Francisco for about five
to ten years right and every year he
will see half of his money he retired at
the age of 30 he downsized he bought a
house cash for about two hundred
thousand dollars he bought himself a car
that caused him like I don't like twenty
thousand thirty thousand dollars you
know that has about fifty sixty miles
per gallon and the guy completely
downside at thirty years old he retired
and all he does now is like cool shit
right now
I'm taking I'm taking that guy's example
and that's why I'm planning on doing
I'm downsizing right meaning
hold on give me a second gotta throw
some fucking garbage yeah so I mean in
the guy downsized he basically instead
of him spending a whole bunch of money
instead of him you know
wasting money and not knowing anything
with it the guy decided to just downsize
and his life is perfect now not like
perfect but at least now you don't have
to worry about you know bales or having
so much shit that he has to pay and I'm
playing him I'm doing that I'm moving
out of New York give me a few more
months I'm moving out of New York I'm
hoping to uh I don't know to the middle
of nowhere you know I might move to
Kansas now I probably moved to Arizona
or if not Arizona maybe Portland or
maybe like a little city outside of
Seattle or something like that right
or if not sexist I don't know I'm in the
air right now
I don't know where I'm gonna move but I
want to move to somewhere where all my
bills are $1,500 right everything that I
have to pay is just $1,500 I'm a
downsize get a nice place right and I'm
not gonna spend no money for the next
five to ten years and let's see how it
goes let's see if this plan works I'm
gonna bust my ass I'm gonna work really
hard I'm gonna work hard for you guys
I'm gonna work hard for private clients
that I have and I'm just gonna go hard
but I'm not going to spend money just to
spend just to throw money in the air
you know like I'm not going to do that
yeah my seeing me with the same clothes
once in a while it's fine
because I'm just not gonna go hard oh I
used to be spending a lot of money on
fucking clothes and buying shit I'm not
going to do it I used to buy a freaking
$2,000 $3,000 TV every single year I'm
not going to do that you spent about
alone $1,000 on freaking video games I'm
not going to do that we're downsizing
everything alright we're downsizing
everything for the simple fact that I've
noticed I keep buying shit
and when I buy shit I'm happy for that
moment and then I don't care about it
right so a reality is like you got a
rush when you buy things well at the end
you are the feel guilty you know oh why
spend that much money on that or I could
have spent it on something else I could
have did something better with that
money and I'm just gonna save everything
for my retirement I don't need I feel
like I'm what I'm 29 years old I'm gonna
be dirty this year I'm not gonna say I'm
super successful I'm successful
you know I'm successful out of all my
friends all the people that I know I
think I've got the farthest you know so
you know I'm successful in essence but I
think it's time to take it up a notch
this guy's that's why I want to I want
to do this for you guys I want to take
you guys through this journey not only
help you out through the journey of you
getting to where you need to be but also
showing you guys that show you guys
what's the possibilities you know what
can you do coming from what different I
want me to be a like a a case study for
you guys if you just see what happens
you know what happens when you bust your
ass and what happens when you just work
hard and what happens when you use the
tools that you have which are
programming and you basically create
cool shit create something for you guys
to survive and live in this world so I
want you guys to take me as an example
so there's no point of me just to talk
about it all right it's only to show it
there's no point of saying oh I'm doing
this I'm gonna go to this this meetup
I'm gonna go to this place now I'm just
gonna show it to you guys because it's
butter and I want to do for dinner with
you guys man anybody that's close to New
York let's try to figure out if we could
set up something this moment right this
motherfuck Jinja lie if you live in New
Jersey you live New York you live Long
Island you live in Connecticut if you
live upstate let's meet up somewhere
let's figure this thing out let's see
where can we meet up man
anybody knows a space that we correct
like something legit I'm not going to
the hood I'm not going to like it it's
like somebody's like hey man we got a
hole right here on fucking Broadway
junction and I don't know in Jamaica
Avenue I'm not going to the hood I was
saying where'd we go in there and we
feel like okay we're paying for a reason
I wanted that one you guys go in there
yeah I feel like oh your boy Joe he set
up something nice right so if you guys
know a spot a place I might I might
start looking up cuz I'm gonna rent it
out a spot for us
let me see it goes in here goes in here
got fantastic got Mike lead i fin tag
gotta themes to where it got the wrong
Smith skillful factor kid greatness Mike
Lee Brooks
Tommy walls but he got Dennis we got em
deal war who's saying
he works at a company I work at a
company kids I don't want to be putting
my shit out there in the Internet
now if you guys want to do the research
look it up it's somewhere on the
Internet
I just don't want to be put in my
business because then you know it's like
there's people who are nice like you
guys but then there's people who are
just like assholes who will start
fucking I don't know boycotting or
sending emails or be like oh my god one
of your employees cursed on a video or
some shit like that
like I don't want to be dealing with
that shame you know so if you want to do
the research go ahead find out where I
work at
yeah man I mean most of the classes that
I'm doing I'm doing it on my Windows
computer on my Mac computer sorry but
everything that I'm doing you can do it
on Windows like every single thing it's
just HTML CSS that's it for now right
and then what I'm going to do is on the
course is I'm going to do a video in Mac
and then I'm gonna do like let's say for
the installations I'm gonna do one a Mac
and one of Windows
I hate Windows but I'm gonna do it for
you guys it's pretty much the same shit
you know so yeah what upset well there's
like your damn ceiling napkins nah man I
just bought food from there I just
forgot to bring out napkins
yeah man his savings plus his wife bro
that dog he's smart man I wish my my
wife was a developer I wish she could
she could get into it man I love her but
that would be amazing if she was to get
into it you know this will be so much
money for both of us to be doing it you
know and we could retire early I think
people can retire I don't know what's
like a real realistic number to retire
like I don't know half a million
no not even cuz then you will have to
live on like $20,000 yeah maybe half a
million dollars I think you could do it
half a million seven hundred thousand
around there with that I'm my own thing
somebody can retire
don't come to a higher the higher
cheaper yeah I heard that high is
fucking dirt cheap over there but I
don't know I don't know if I wanna move
to Ohio I feel like for me Ohio seems
ratchet I don't know every like every
ratchet person that I've met has gone to
Ohio I don't want to go over there you
know I'm not saying to anybody's over
there in Ohio it's okay it's just I've
heard a lot of bad stories and the
people that I've known that have gone
over there are not the best people so
yeah
let's see
yeah Joseph man maybe me and you will
meet up over there in Texas man you
never know man
three cash sighs I'm super successful
now man I'm I I think I'm good for a
regular person I think I'm good for a
regular person I think I've done okay
but I could do better I know that for
sure you know I can definitely do better
but sometimes it's like you just gotta
be happy with what you have you know at
one point I wanted to be like oh man Wow
so when I was young I was like man I
want to become like Bill Gates I wanna
you know fucking create this great
company and this and that and then as I
get older I'm like man I'm just happy
where I'm at you know I'm happy where
I'm at and I know I can make myself a
little bit happier with certain things
that I can accomplish but I don't need
to be your fucking multi-millionaire to
call myself you know successful and be
good it's just like you know for a
regular person I think I'm a regular
person not a celebrity huh I'm not
I haven't done anything I'm not famous
I'm not somebody that people see in this
juvenile Joe only my friends okay well
if I go to Richard that's how I be
everywhere I go Joe Joe Joe without food
upset I see you I see you homie like you

Vegas
skillful Factor says yo what's up Joe
thanks for being real and a big
inspiration and yeah man like your
channel because he done did it you took
took to talk he walked the walk which is
rare on YouTube that's being true
I think this you're a 100% true not
everybody is like Carolyn working as a
developer people have been around like
there are oh I was a developer in 1996
and it's like that shit was a long time
buddy you know what I mean I was like
I'm not gonna come into YouTube when I'm
like 50 something and coming and be like
hey guys give you guys advice and shit
that I don't even know about you know
what I mean but I'm here man you guys
see me
so what about us we live down south man
I loved us in the south man I really do
love the sound the fact that you could
you know you can fucking pay your house
live good taxes is cheap a lot of places
don't even have state tax and like you
know people live in neighborhoods you
know what I mean like we didn't have no
neighborhoods where I grew up
I grew up on blocks you know what I mean
like I live on the block you know this
is a big difference between you living
in the neighborhood you know you go
trick-or-treating
we didn't go trick-or-treating man we
went to the corner store and the corner
store gave us like four or five cents
fucking candies and as I hear here's
your baby cry he is he a little a little
twizzler this there's a little fucking
25 cent on your fucking was it fresh I
forgot the name of it freshman to some
shit like that
that's a she's like I want to give my
kid a neighborhood feeling you know
something that he feels like oh I went
to my high school high school has a
football team
every Friday there's like a football
game fucking like I want him to live
that life you know what I mean so that's
where I'm moving
what's the time frame or intermediate
stuff probably Wednesday I'm knocking
out all the easy shit right now right so
I'm knocking out order HTML CSS and I
also advise people hey some people that
signed up for it and they're like oh man
I already know HTML CSS listen it's not
gonna hurt you to watch the videos
revise it because there's certain things
that you don't know you know discern
you know certain CSS tricks that I'm
gonna show that most people don't know
you know because it's not like a regular
this courses are not like like a regular
course where you're going to have
somebody come in and be like oh here's
so fucking CSS this is how it's done and
I'm teaching you guys the proper way the
things that you need to know not just
waste your time you know I'm not gonna
make this courses like 50 hours to say
okay you're getting fifty hours of
courses no I'm gonna give you concise
things where it's like okay you're
getting everything that you need to get
you started get you a job and that's the
idea
five million dollars on me if you guys
need five million dance to retire man
you gotta do something with your life
man because you're kind of messing up I
think five million dollars is a lot cuz
I'm not saying right now I'm gonna
retire but I think by 35 if I work from
now to 35 hard and I save about 700,000
I could retire just got a downsized my
life my car is gonna be paid off the
freaking city that I'm gonna live in
it's gonna be cheap most likely my house
by that time is gonna be paid off or I
might just be doing some crazy shake
living in Thailand moving to the
Philippines moving to fucking Dominican
Republic I don't plan on dying here in
New York I'm trying to get out of here
you know what I mean you know Arizona
tech scene is coming up that's for real
I've been seeing it for years they've
been doing a lot of shit there man but
the only problem that I have about
Arizona is like it's like a fuckin you
know Phoenix it's like a desert town
it's a desert city you know that's my
only problem with it because I love
having a bunch of trees around me that's
what I kind of wanted to move to Seattle
but I hear Seattle's expensive too so I
don't know come to Oklahoma man you know
Oklahoma is so cheap man I've seen an
apartment one time in Oklahoma for $400
you know what it is $400 man I could pay
10 years with that I could go in there
and paint ten years of fucking an
apartment right here for I want to pay
ten years of this shit
Vegas is my cheap - well I have a thing
against casinos
I have bad experiences and I don't want
to live in a town where casino is it's
like the main attraction I actually hate
casinos so I'm not going over there
yeah man

guy hallelujah right like let them be
they just human beings too like who

hotter than that bitches I'm not worried
about that and sorry sorry I'm using the
word bitch you know what I mean but yeah
Tyler is legit man it's cheap

to is there food is pretty healthy so
yeah
please tell me about WordPress team
development I don't know man WordPress
I feel like WordPress that's like a shit
the WordPress is still I don't know how
to say it
WordPress still in the industry right
but creating themes and seven themes I
think that ship sailed a while back like
that was maybe seven years ago 2010 if
you would have started in 2010 creating
themes for WordPress you would have been
popping you would have been good but now
with all this website is like wicks and
Squarespace like most people don't even
need a wordpress no more it's like all
they have to do is just get Wix or get
work on Squarespace they don't mean
anything else
you know what I mean so that's the thing
what I don't know man
starter back a scene a story here
but I got so many bad casino stories
that I don't even I don't even want to
talk about it I fucking hate casinos
that shit all casinos should be shut
down the gambling is not good
but here man I'm gonna see you guys
later man I already spent 30 out about
30 minutes with you guys and there goes
my lunch break all right I'll see you
