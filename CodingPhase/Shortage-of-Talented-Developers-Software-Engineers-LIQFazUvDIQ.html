man coding fees.com your boys backing
out and did it again alright listen
today's topic is 2018 software
engineering talent shortage it's quality
not just quantity all right so the
shortage of of engineers out there
according to this guy is it's the
quality all right pretty much you know
I'm pretty short this there's my my
opinion reading this article and
listening to this guy talk about this
I'm pretty sure where he's coming from
is the fact that there might be
companies out there that are looking for
a specific type of engineers okay
there's definitely engineers that you
know that know more than others you know
cuz everybody who's out there let's say
an example somebody could graduate with
a software engineering degree right
there cuz you know graduate with a
engineering in was an electrical
electrical engineering degree or
programming degree etc right you guys
fill in the blank cuz people create in
freaking degrees every single day but
pretty much what it means it's like
anybody could graduate from those those
degrees but doesn't mean that they are
actually coming out of those schools
prepared okay
and I think this is one of those reasons
why now self-taught developers are
really popular out here because when you
come out of college most of those
college students what they do is they do
the projects in their school and I say
they look to get an A they look to pass
the SATs when they was in high school
and they go to this four-year school
most of these kids they're not coming
out with nothing amazing they're not
creating projects on their own they're
just doing projects to fulfill their
their classes that's it so when they
graduate they're not even prepared
they're not really looking at the
technologies that's out there what
programming languages are popular you
know where are their jobs in in their
area etc right
they just not prepared and I think for
self-taught developers this is great
because at the same time if you are a
self-taught developer you could actually
come in and take those jobs right like
let's say somebody who wants to learn
Golding
let's say you've been doing this on your
own you are a front-end developer for a
few years and you say hey you know what
I'm gonna teach myself on going right
and I'm gonna get really really good
with goaling these jobs out there for
$180,000 for Golding right most of the
companies they looking for somebody
who's gonna hit the ground running and I
keep saying that to you guys I've been
saying that for a while and it was funny
to see this guy using that same term let
me see hit yeah so he basically used the
same term because that's what companies
are looking for you know he said right
here Gannett song of qiba an
international engineering IT recruitment
firm sold good core for example many
small and medium-sized companies do now
provide on-the-job training and it's
instead one employs to hit the ground
running but unfortunately the skill sets
that allow them to do their job in such
a manner are now being taught at school
there's a problem around the globe not
just in the United States all right
companies that demand software engineers
who can hit the ground running are
accelerating the talent shortage and
soaring salaries meaning you know they
paying more money out there but you
gotta be able to know this thing's like
I I know a lot of very good engineers
right even guys that I've seen in
meetups guys who have been doing this
for you know 20 years 30 years and they
know all the fundamentals but they don't
keep up with what's out there you know
like I'll go in there and I'll teach
them you know react or I'll teach them
hyper Apple I'll teach them you know
angular 5 or whatever and I'll blow them
out the box
do I have a engineering degree do I have
20 years as a software engineer out
there not you know what I mean it's like
say Kotlin codling is very popular right
now is growing up and you know so for
engineering and programming you know a
lot of people out there they just don't
have that skill somebody who self took
and I should he go in there and pretty
much just be like hey you know what I'm
gonna learn this and I'm gonna work hard
and I'm gonna you know really work hard
I was about to curse but I'm not but
yeah just work hard man you know and
just get this done you know one thing
that the guy he said a couple of things
in here which gave me this feeling also
of like a lot of people are mad also at
the same time like there's a lot of
engineers people who keep saying like oh
no this is great no there's a lot of
engineers out there people who we could
call engineers quote-unquote guys who
who got all the fundamentals who went to
a computer science degree they graduated
some of them even have masters they know
the whole stack they know everything
about you know hexadecimals and freaking
you know binaries it all the whole
shebang they know all of that stuff but
they super outdated right when you
graduate from school you realized that
hey man like I know the fundamentals but
now I gotta really freaking I know I
really gotta gotta learn this stuff you
know because in reality you know the
fundamentals and the theory but you
don't know anything of what's going on
out there you know like there's people
that don't understand what's going on
like you know there's people who that oh
yeah I know C so maybe C is close to
objective-c and that you you start
looking for jobs and like you realize oh
people now using objective-c know more
people are using Swift so there's more
jobs for developers that know Swift
because the company doesn't want to
train you the company doesn't want to
take that risk and be like hey man we
need to get this done but you know what
let's hire this guy in let's see if he
he co actually learned this stuff in a
month or two people get you know people
get fired all the time
you know because you could get hired and
then people see that you can't keep up
or people see that you don't know as
much as you should know and then you get
let go it happens all the time and a lot
of these people end up in boot camps a
lot of this people end up on you know
freaking going to school again taking a
what development course in a college
paying $500 for a course or on the
internet you know what I mean like those
are the things that that people do when
they're not prepared right and that's
what's going on right now in the
industry people want you know developers
and programmers engineers it doesn't
matter what the title is you know they
want people that can hit the ground
running people that they say hey man we
need to build this whole website and we
need to you know create the backend
create the front end set up the database
set up a nice structure that is going to
be able to you know scale later on
that's it that's all they really need
they don't have time for you to come in
and be like oh you know what we're gonna
train you for you know two three months
get you up to par like it's rare that
any company does that at all like I'm
being honest it's very rare that any
company does that that's why I tell you
guys you guys got to prepare yourself
you guys got to learn on your own you
know because the the fact that you're
here the fact that you are the coming to
my website you are the coming to you to
me you either coming to any website
that's out there and you're trying to
learn this stuff you know the things
that are popular out there for companies
currently right whatever is popular out
there right now you should be learning
it and the fact that you try to learn it
put your head of a lot of people because
this is what you guys don't understand
man there's so many people out there
looking for jobs like yes there's a lot
of jobs for developers but just like a
lot of you guys who don't have
experience there's people out there who
are graduating from you know really good
schools and
you know four-year universities and you
know they come out and they're like man
I just graduated for this university but
I don't know how to build a website
there's people like that they just don't
know how to build a website there's
people that don't know the backend they
don't understand how to I mean they
might know how to do certain things with
databases and you know doing migrations
and and how you call it relationships or
dealing with no sequel and etc big data
they might know those things but they
don't know how to build a website they
don't know how to build a web app right
there's people out there that know all
these fundamentals but don't know how to
build a phone application all right
but you as a developer you actually know
this stuff right so this is why I tell
you guys like hey man all these projects
that I have on my website or even the
fire projects that I already gave you
guys you should be building it I still
don't understand why people are still
sending me portfolios without any of the
projects that I told you guys to do like
you don't have real projects on your
portfolio you don't have real experience
you don't have clients you don't have
references you don't have nobody that's
gonna back you up how do you think that
you're going to get hired there's no way
that you're gonna get hired you know and
this is happening to a lot of people out
there you know here this guy he put in
like the the numbers for different uh
you know different cities so like let's
say a front-end developer Boston making
ninety seven thousand front-end
developer one hundred two thousand New
York and I'll be honest these numbers
are not for junior developers this is
people who know what they're doing this
is not just like hey this is what you're
gonna get coming out of college this is
what you're gonna get
learning stuff online no this is the
stuff that you're gonna get like once
you have a year or two in it because
there's been does this lie out there of
like people's telling other people like
hey man you go to this boot camp
you take this car you're gonna make you
know $100 an hour you're gonna make $90
an hour guys it doesn't work like that
man it's like a stepping stone companies
are not gonna trust you to be touching
you know a business code right they're
not gonna trust you so you have to start
from the bottom this numbers are here
are not for the the people that are just
starting you know sometimes people will
get lucky but you have to understand
that there is a big word in there in
that sentence that I just said lucky and
then we cut it down we say luck right
what can you do to change your luck is
to basically learn the things that is
popular out there the things that you
know other developers are now really
putting in that time like let's say for
example I'm working in a company right
I'm working as a developer and even
other developers that I know from
companies I've worked for right I'm the
only person that goes home and actually
studies and creates things on his own
time nobody else does that
you know what 90% of you guys that are
here on this channel you guys will get
jobs right now from those 90 percent of
of you guys maybe 10% of that 90 percent
is going to actually come in to your
house and study when you get home once
you get that job most people act like oh
my god I'm tired I don't want to look at
a screen I don't want to do this and
that
this is what happens to everybody they
want to hang out with their friends nah
there's a very competitive Korea you
can't just be like hey I got a job this
is great I'm kind of you know I'm gonna
stay home and I'm not gonna learn
anything that's it I got a job I know
HTML CSS in WordPress like yeah you know
WordPress but you need to grow you need
to start learning other stuff learn you
know PHP laravel so you could get a
better job in six months from now right
you could come in and say hey now I know
Larry bro you know what I'm
never for a year - you know what maybe
I'll learn you know something like Ruby
on Rails maybe I learned something like
I don't know that net right so you could
get to the next level
and you can start earning the money
that's here you know because if you
don't learn those skills you leaving
money on the table and you're getting to
put yourself stuck somewhere all right
one thing that I always tell people
never be loyal to a company because the
company is never going to be loyal to
you all right so what does that mean is
hey try to learn as much as you can and
the first moment that you get to get out
of that company take it if they're gonna
pay you more
you know people stay in companies and
they'll stay there for five years like
oh yeah I'm comfortable here it's only
20 minutes away from my house oh yeah I
like everybody here my job it's come
it's very comfortable you get very bored
because you've been doing the same
projects the same work for years you
know and then at the same time you're
only growing 3% maximum that's like a 3%
of like of an increase to your salary
per year and that's if the company want
to be nice there's companies out there
small businesses and medium-sized
businesses that if you don't ask for a
raise they're not gonna give it to you I
know people that have been in companies
for years and never got a raise like
years and and just didn't get a raise
they'll get a 3% race after three four
years and it's like wait what what were
you doing like you know what I mean like
why you put yourself in that situation
now like these numbers are very
interesting you know a lot of times
people come in and be like hey man you
know I want to do a web development
right you know this numbers for web
developer front-end developer they're
nice they look nice they look cute you
know they look like hey juicy you like
oh man out that's why I want to learn
right you think about that and you're
like okay I'm gonna get eighty thousand
dollars when I start most likely
you might just get 5060 thousand dollars
starting right then from there your
first year you go in you work you earn a
couple of skills then let's say for
example you get really good where
something like react or angular then
you're going you get another job now
you're getting like 75 80 because a
company is going to look at you and
they're gonna be the first thing they're
gonna ask you is how much were you
making the last company right if you
come in and say hey I was making $80,000
there's a chance the company might ask
you hey can you provide us proof that
that's what you was earning and it
happens there's people that they accent
like hey man how much you learning you
say I was earning 90 thousand and they
ask you for proof all right I'll pay
stub or any type of information and then
they'll match it or give you a little
bit more but what happens if you don't
have that now you're at you know you're
you left up and you're effed up and it
happens so you have to grow accordingly
okay and a company is going to pay you
accordingly to the skills that you have
in the years of experience that you
might have all right now like I said
though certain things here that I liked
about this article and certain things
that did not like about this article
because I feel like reading it I get
this feeling of the person kind of feels
like hey man this a very few talented
developers or programmer software
engineers out there and then everybody
else is like subpar and sometimes it's
not really true I don't think that
there's like you know so many engineers
that are not good or that don't know how
to code or whatever you want to call it
out there that's actually the minority
of people that I've seen there is a
minority of people that you'd be like
how the hell did this person get a job
this person doesn't know anything this
person doesn't keep up with the industry
this person is still coding us if it was
you know 1994 a lot of times you might
see that but they are the minority
from everybody else they're not the
majority okay so there was things in
here where I felt like man they were
like little shots to two people who are
let's say not the best engineers in the
world because this is something that I
think I don't think you have to be the
best in the world you should strive to
be the best in the world right everybody
is it's like basketball right and I know
people hate when I do this because they
were like man this is math this is two
plus two is four and that's it it should
be you know black and white but when you
bring an example like basketball it
doesn't make sense well it does make
sense so let me break it down for you
I'm breaking it down in a very simple
terms and something that we could relate
to real life let's say an example
somebody is a basketball player right he
goes to high school he was the MVP in
high school he was the MVP in college
when he goes to the NBA
right he goes to the NBA he figures out
that he's not as talented as the number
one guy let's say an example LeBron
James who people say is the best guy
best basketball player out there me I
don't know but let's say somebody says
he's the best player does everybody need
to be LeBron James to get the job done
no it just is not going to happen
there's going to be people who are
talented and we all understand that as
people who have that certain gift right
but not everybody needs to be the LeBron
James of web development or LeBron James
of software engineering or LeBron James
of whatever programming language you're
thinking of right it people just don't
have to be that right and there were
certain things here on on this article
that just gave me this feeling as if
this person feels like hey everybody
should be like you know the LeBron James
of of programming and it's like nah and
a team of developers a lot of times all
you really need is one person who is
actually the senior or the architect or
the CTO
or let's say yeah the CTO or somebody
who's really in charge of the whole
project he needs to be the LeBron James
right everybody else don't need to be
the LeBron James everybody else just
needs to be you know somebody good
alright somebody that's good and can do
the job because a lot of times when you
work in at companies it's not about
who's the most talented because you
can't you're just not gonna find that
all the time you're not gonna find
SuperDuper quadruple talented people
you're just not alright what you're
gonna need is extra hands right there's
people who are just programmers there's
people who are just developers there's
people who are just engineers people who
just can get the job done
right if you give them a task or you
guide them they can get the job done
that's a now the person who is like the
LeBron James of the team needs to be in
charge of the rest and be like hey guys
you know what you guys are actually
doing like this there's actually a
better way let's do it this way and he
guides the other developers now everyone
needs to be the LeBron James of
programming okay
so that's the thing that I kind of you
know for against this because it's like
you know there's a lot of companies is
gonna pay people very well out there for
being you know whoever's like the top of
you know the top of the game but it
doesn't mean that everybody else is this
fish right fill in the blank you know
just because they're not LeBron James of
program if that's aI don't know if
that's like a simple way to explain it
to people right because you just have to
have one person that's like super duper
talented and it's really good and then
he'll have that person guide the other
developers all right guys so what I'm
gonna say is if you want to become a
developer you want to improve your
skills you want to get the latest Tech's
out there right the latest programming
languages you want stuff that you can
actually
put on your portfolio you know skills
that you're gonna need for your job
we're not talking about stuff that
you're not going to need we're not
talking about theory we go into some
type of theory but I give you real-life
examples real projects stuff that you're
going to be needing as a developer if
you want to get those things man check
out my website coding phase comm I'll
make it super affordable for everybody
my courses are super cheap you know
and they're cheap for a reason I'm not
looking to become a millionaire I'm not
looking to coming here and give you guys
like hey I want to charge an arm and a
leg I know what it is to become a
self-taught developer and I know how it
feels like when you're in the beginning
and you're lost and you're like man I'm
spending so much money and I'm wasting
time let me help you get on your way
to where you need to go up man like
listen man you come into my description
you check the links below alright and
automatically you're gonna see there's a
link to say hey 50% off on everything
that I have for my website if you say
hey all I want to learn is PHP Alera
bail this thing becomes $20 hey you want
to learn build a restaurant web app hey
this thing becomes you know twelve point
five all right this thing becomes ten
dollars per month all right so it's
something very simple all right but
what's cool about this is like I make
this thing affordable for everybody I'm
making you know really good this is like
me sharing all on my skills on one
website you know like if you want to buy
a course independently that's great if
you want to come here and say hey I'm
just gonna bite the all access pass and
get access to all of the courses then
you can also do that all right man okay
so I'm gonna see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
