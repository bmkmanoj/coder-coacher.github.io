I don't know why but I'm hype all right
guys
big announcement you know I know it's
supposed to be the lunch break specials
the lunch break chronicles the web
developer chronicles but big
announcement
Jesus Christ all right
so big announcement kids what's going on
let's start it up by by saying what up -
everybody here man um I'm just happy
life is good you know life is good life
is good
all right so tonight we got whoa hold on
we got a couple of big announcements
right tonight is the last day of the
programming mentorship experiment right
it's literally the last day all right
now that's going to be huge because
we're going to see what everybody
actually built this past two weeks let's
see what we're they up to
so what part did they get stuck on or
that they finish it so let's see what
happens right that's what's going on
tonight tonight at 8:00 p.m. on the WB
Jones experiment all right yeah so
that's what's going on all right that's
one one big announcement so we're
finally gonna end it the mentorship
program is gonna come to a stop no more
till maybe a few months from now and you
know I'm gonna do another video where
it's gonna be you know where are they
now in a few months I'm gonna contact
everybody else and I'm gonna ask them
hey how's everything nice where are you
now you know to me that you guys find a
job that you guys gave up that you guys
did whatever that you guys have a kid
that you guys got married whatever
happens to them we're gonna do a little
video of like hey where are they now
they're gonna put their faces on a
little milk carton so yeah that's all
announcement all right now the other
announcement is I'm gonna continue doing
the rocky stack but they're not gonna be
the main focus and why is that because
from what I'm noticing a lot of you guys
are not up to that level to where you
guys can start learning a experimental
language or a brand new framework like
you guys it's obvious you guys are not
risk-takers and that's that's fine you
know like that's my audience the
audience is not the audience that I have
is not people who are risk takers or
there's gotta be like hey man I'm gonna
try this new thing that's coming out and
listing this you know coming out crystal
Lang and that's fine because a lot of
you guys are just here to like hey man I
just want to learn how to program how to
become a developer and all I want to do
is just get a job
cool so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
give you tutorials that's gonna get you
a job all right and you're probably like
yeah duh that's what we've been won in
this whole time but at the same time
like I'll be honest that's not what
excites me you know it's not like I'm
gonna wake up like oh my god I'm gonna
create this vanilla JavaScript tutorial
because that's so boring to me right but
at the same time I understand you guys
are still at that level which I guess
still trying to learn the Dom you're
still trying to learn how to work them
so if jQuery you're still trying to
learn you know like the simple stuff
that to me it seems like super simple
but for some of you guys is like oh man
like this thing is like hard
I need the basics so I'm gonna give you
guys the basics alright I want my face
on the milk line yeah so um yeah so
those are the two big announcements that
I feel like today are very important
because at the same time I was like I
want to give you guys what you guys want
you know what you guys want and what you
guys need so that's what I'm here for
you know cuz at the same time like I've
seen how you call this my channel
subscribers drop this whole month and
that was like an experiment that I did
you know most of the the other youtubers
stay not doing that they're not taking
risk they're not trying to come out
their box and create cool shit they
creating the same shit that they started
with from the beginning to maintain the
same growth of subscribers they're not
building anything Neil then I add a new
new content they're pretty much still so
you're gonna get the stale flux of same
subscribers the same amount the same
thing so you know what I took a risk
this past month the analytics came in
the numbers came in
men lie women lied numbers don't lie so
basically you know people are not
feeling are more advanced tutorials and
more coaching what they want is you know
everybody wants the simple tutorials
basics you know they want to know what
are the top five frameworks what are the
top five javascript libraries what are
fucking the latest in fucking trendiest
fucking framework so you know what if
that's what you want I'm gonna give it
to you guys yeah you know so I just
gotta I'm not gonna go against the wave
you know so I'm just gonna give it to
you guys and I'm still gonna focus on my
coding face.com
website which is going to be my number
one priority and yeah but as far as
YouTube I'm just gonna give you guys
what you guys want and you know give you
guys tutorials that's gonna get you jobs
right away I'm gonna give you videos
that's gonna get you a job instantly you
know so it's like yeah I you know cyber
sound sighs nonsense don't go with the
wave but the problem is that the
channels not growing because of that
because I'm going something I'm doing
completely different shit then what
everybody else is doing which is
sticking to what I first got here for
right a lot of people love for some
reason they love my my let's build
Netflix which to me it was literally my
first video my first tutorial and my
worst tutorial but people love it
because it's simple it's easy so that's
the that's the goal and I'm like you
know what man that's what people came
here for that's what they want to know
they want to know all the basics all to
say you know that they need to know
from a day-to-day to get a job because
right now you know there's no point of
me giving you guys advance stuff when
you guys are not even halfway there you
know what I mean and a lot of my
audience is not experienced developers
so it's a disconnect so I wanted to try
it out this month to see you know I
could have done no js' and say you know
what I don't want to do no Jess and I
could have done Ruby on Rails which both
of them if I would have done both of
them you know the subscriber count'
would have went like crazy I wanted to
try something new I wanted to see what
what was the audience like what was the
audience with are people following the
trends of what they see online in the
sea oh man I mean decom hate this you
know 5,000 jobs for for nodejs
if they're following that then and they
don't understand that what I was trying
to teach them was the basics that you
could literally learn once you learn one
thing in one language you can learn in
other languages too you know because
once you know how to code once you know
how to code it again in every other
programming language out there so that's
what I wanted to teach you guys but at
the same time I realized because the
numbers are there that people don't want
that people don't want that because
everybody that's here they're brand new
developers so if I come in and I tell
them hey check out crystal lang
check out this or the rocky stack which
is super cool and a lot of people who
are are advanced developers guys who
have been around three or four years and
they send me emails like yo man this is
so cool I'm glad that you made it
but then my audience is not that that's
like a minority of my audience my
audience is people who are pretty much
completely beginners right so if I'm
come here and I'll tell you hey guys
check out crystal Lang because you're
going to be able to learn how to
programming every other language to you
guys
I understand what you guys see you guys
see like oh man
Google crystal Lang online there's no
jobs for crystal link and which is true
but at the same time you were to learn
the fundamentals so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to teach you the
fundamentals in languages that are you
know popular out there for how you code
is to learn to basically get a job so
that's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna go
with the wave we kind of give you more
JavaScript tutorials more nodejs
tutorials more HTML and CSS tutorials
even though there's like a million other
people doing the same chain but what I'm
gonna do is you know me I'm gonna come
in and sprinkle that shit sprinkle that
shit on top of him be like okay this is
Joe's way of doing it you know what I
mean so we're not gonna go against the
wave you know you guys wanted it yeah
basically yeah screamed it out loud and
proud we want the same shit that
everybody else got I'm gonna give you
the same shit
alright so we're not gonna go too far
from the same shit that everybody else
is giving you guys we gotta give you the
same shape because that's what people
want to see people don't want to see the
cool shit people don't want to see learn
OH basically a programming language like
right now somebody tells me hey man you
can learn to program with Python but
there's not that many jobs for Python
for junior developers but once you learn
it through Python you're going to be
able to learn it through any other
language I would say cool I'll take it
but the people have spoken
and they said no we don't give a fuck
about that what we care about is that
shit that's going to get me a job if you
see PHP and there's a million PHP jobs
show me PHP so I'm gonna give you guys
PHP alright you want JavaScript I'm
gonna give you JavaScript for
we gotta give what the people want you
know what I mean so that's what we had
that's the big announcement do a mil
globocide type video I'm about to make
one yo now but for real so the whole
plan of this is just I don't want this
channel to grow and continue growing how
I was before and I'm not just doing it
for the views I'm not doing for the
money am i doing the first subscriber
count I'm not doing it for me like I
said I'm doing it because I know what I
got on this channel and I know what I
could give people you know the flavor
the little sauce that I give into this
shit right so if I come from left view
and start giving you some shit from left
field that you don't want it's obvious
that you're not gonna want you know
right other people it's not gonna want
that so it's like it's a numbers thing
you know what I mean the analytics came
in people want they want just the basics
they don't want no advanced things and I
noticed that from other youtubers to
where it's like the best the videos that
get the most view the videos that get
the most subscriber count'
and more subscribers in the whole
shebang is basically video star so
simple that so regular developers to be
like oh my god who the hell watches this
shit you know what I mean
but it seems like that's what people
want to see so for me I'm gonna be like
you know what let's give it so you know
because of course we could sprinkle a
couple of advanced things in there you
know hit them with a little crack on it
but at the same time we can't go against
the wave man
and people want to see you know they
want they want to see me do the same
thing that everybody else is doing
meaning like the same type of tutorials
but with my own flavor that I'm gonna
give it to them know what I mean so
that's what we do it and just have fun
with it
this still is still fun I think
JavaScript and nodejs is still fun but
it's just like I mastered that you know
what I mean like I already mastered it
it's like once you master something you
don't want to do it constantly
especially because I do it every day at
work so like when I come to YouTube I
usually like to do stuff that I don't do
on the regular basis like in my job but
at the same time it's like hey if I'm a
brand new developer if I'm somebody
who's thinking about becoming a
developer why would I be watching
something that is advanced or something
that is experimental instead of watching
something that's gonna get me a job you
know why am I gonna sit here and spend
25 minutes 30 minutes even and now we're
doing a tutorial when what I want is
something that's gonna pay off at the
end most of you guys don't won't
understand most of the things that I
teach you guys to the Crystal length
until a year two years three years from
now you know those videos are gonna be
there I'm still gonna finish the whole
series of crystal Lang so when people
you know more advanced developers and
other people come back like you guys a
year from now two years from now ya come
back and buy oh shit look what Joe was
doing a year ago you know what I mean
like now it makes sense to me so that's
what those tutorials still gonna be
there but we're gonna hit you guys with
the shit that you guys really want
at the moment which is tutorials that
are the basics tutorials that's going to
be talking about situations at a job at
a position and pretty much simulate all
the job experience which is what I'm
gonna do I'm not gonna do tutorials like
a lot of people be like oh let's do it
reduce to do it
app whatever to do tasks or whatever to
do app because everybody does that but
I've never been to a job where they tell
me hey guys can you guys film your to-do
app I never heard nobody tell me that
right so what I'm gonna do is I'm going
to give you our tutorials on things that
I do everyday things that I've done in
past jobs so like that I know that those
things are things that you're going to
be using in your day to day are
basically day to day job right so
you know what I mean so that's what
we're gonna do you know I really
appreciate we got 45 people in here you
know we got 17 likes which means people
are so lazy to just click a like they
like the video but they don't want to
click like but it's ok you know it's so
big announcement is fine we're gonna get
back on the road we're gonna show people
what we made up we did an experiment
experimental month right so this is a
month where things went downhill it
wasn't like a one bad and down here it
just went down because of the growth so
yeah I went down like that and then now
it's gonna go up back again so it's fine
people take a little slump once in a
while like you see me I'm not hurting
I'm good but I still want this channel
to grow man I know what I could do with
this channel I know I could blow a lot
of people out the box on YouTube because
there's a lot of weirdos and and
freaking corny corny developers out here
who are who are just like I don't know I
look at the channels and I'm like oh man
like a lot of these people they're
pretty much wack they got no personality
they got no swag they got no sauce they
got nothing new like I swear to God I
think and not to shit or anybody or even
if I do miss your name it's not I'm
throwing shade at you but um I really
think out of everybody here between me
and Chris Shawn we're like two all-stars
I'm not even shitting on anybody I'm not
saying that everybody else is doing
baddest it's just we're doing something
completely different when you look at
our our channels they're completely
different and they're like okay people
know what we're about you know
you go to Christians Channel is a vlog
and then at the same time he's giving
you gems he's giving you new things
right you come to my channel and then
somebody might come in and be like you
know a 16 17 year old 19 year old 20 old
you know somebody in the early 20s my
coming here but I oh sure this dude he's
just like me he talks just like me he
got the same swag as me he's buying the
same shit as me
he's young like me he's out here doing
his thing you know so then they relate
to me and then I okay I fuck with this
kid he's not here talking about all this
crazy shit on on YouTube but they could
relate to me you know what I mean so cuz
I get emails all the time like ill son
they're like yo son I love your channel
love what you're doing keep doing it
people relate to me right so there's not
that many people on YouTube doing this
as far as like web developers who even
have a personality who even show who
they really are without just like coming
in front of the camera and like greeting
points and be like editing everything
now and be like oh yeah this is how you
do this then this is the best
programming languages this is what it is
to be a front-end developer this is only
like I'm not sorry
you know lettering say to everybody but
it's like a lot of people are pretty
much doing the same shit there's no
there's no swag there's no originality
so I know what I got when my boy Chris
song got it's totally different so I
definitely want this channel to grow and
continue growing and the only way to do
that is to give Google what Google wants
so we gotta give the Google the googoo
gaagaa we're gonna give him the what he
wants which is the same type of videos
nodejs but in my own way I'm gonna break
it down so easy that anybody could
understand nodejs I'm gonna break down
JavaScript so easy that you're gonna
look in a day and you're gonna be
what the hell was I doing you know it's
like like yesterday I was just giving a
tutorial level tutorial I was tutoring
somebody you know a private tutoring
session that I had with somebody um
which you guys could do too if you guys
you know yeah let me know if you need a
private session I will give you a
private session of course it comes with
a price because I'm doing someone shit
and then it would be crazy for me to
spend and now were two hours telling you
guys what to do or how to teach you guys
everything for free it doesn't make
sense to me especially when I'm about to
have a kid
so it's like every hour every extra hour
that I take away from my girlfriend I
want to be able to say hey babe look I
got away from you I got away from the
baby but here's a little sign so it
could make sense for for them you know
what I mean it's like I'm busting my ass
and doing all these videos on YouTube
but here's a little sign so you could
know that it was worth it
you know so yeah so going back to it I
was tutoring somebody and then I was
explaining to them you know
display:inline inline-block
display:block display:inline-block
position:relative and broke it down in a
way where you know anybody could have
learned this thing and I'm like you know
what that's how I got to make tutorials
that's how I got to make the tour is
where I'll break it down to people in
such an easy way that anybody can pick
it up and they can understand what's
going on so that's where my focus is
gonna be on all right now I'm still
gonna try to finish coding phase comm
which I know a lot of people was like
god dammit what oh fuck is coding phase
comm why I can't register everybody
leaves me the same comments trust me
it's not you guys it's not only you guys
is everybody
but it's hard guys it's hard to do this
shit and then
do Conan face that com+ at the same time
it's like what I'm doing Koda face.com I
feel like I'm doing work because it's
laravel and now my job is liable so it's
like when I get home I don't want to do
not ever again you know what I mean so
that's the thing but I'm here to give
you guys what you guys want what you
guys need and that's the big
announcement so we're doing a 360 you
know we we did some experimental thing
this month you know we did the
mentorship experiment which to me was a
success because everybody has definitely
improved kind of wish it would have been
more people would have been able to see
it because they would have learned a lot
out of it they would have noticed that a
lot of the people who are on the
mentorship program are on the same level
as them and then they can feel they
could relate to somebody else out there
and see the things that I tell them they
could take it for them and be able to
understand and say okay
oh yeah I do the same thing as her or I
do the same thing as him it's like now
they could relate to them you know
that's why I created this mentorship
experiment so to say that you know
everything has been great you know
everything has been good and now we just
gotta take it to the next level kit you
know now let me see let me see what's
popping on the chat room alright make
guys to build complete websites don't do
yet another guide explaining what other
elements are basic CSS and JavaScript
does yeah I know um I want to do an
amazing front-end design I'm working on
putting a portfolio can I use real brand
yes you could use real brand for your
tutorial for your portfolio sorry
there's no that's how you build a tribe
bro yup yeah go with the wave and then
do something different yep that's what
I'm trying to do
weenie hand-holding yo that has a little
hand-holding is good yeah you guys are
too much man you guys are definitely too
much let me see what else you could do a
video where we can build something for
our portfolio yes that's an idea that I
want to do because I always tell you
guys build a real estate builder how you
call is a restaurant build a digital
agency so I'm thinking about creating a
real estate and then from there build it
together with you guys
word is a year we come to the channel
because one we fuck with your
personality in your approach and that's
true
thank you I appreciate everybody that
comes here man I really appreciate it
you guys know I love you guys like I do
this thing for for a reason yeah do more
or less bill tutorial it's more
practical and gives idea of what's
respect in a real world or no cool yeah
that's exactly what I'm gonna do
Jonah all of us are beginning some of us
are working developers I know and you
know it's like that's why I feel bad
sometimes I want to ask some advanced
things but at the same time it's like oh
it's like this more like there's more
people who are beginners than you know
experienced developers in this channel
let me see
snatch that shit yeah
it's joe leaving PHP then for ruby or
node umm not I'm still gonna be working
with PHP like PHP pays the bills kids
right you know we have to work with PHP
no matter what somebody just brought out
the Breaking Bad and Joe he's about to
go Walter White on coding you did
[Laughter]
whatever in Dublin wood it's what it's
well it's my my good Irishman I love the
Irish accent okay video froze or just me
now we want assembly man assembly so
advance people go crazy here for Haxby
what they wanted they will have set
faster horses Henry Ford that's true
he needs an antenna on top of the bends
yes you're shaving it
you're being too close to your chin
you're being is to start where your neck
starts now your chin
okay professional I need I need some
beer some people who could show me how
to shave my beard please give me a good
tutorial Uncle Joe's going to get some
corned beef on right now and my company
that they do full-stack JavaScript so
that is what I'm heading for react no
yep that's cool cool thing about it we
can learn from the master who the hell
wouldn't want that yep what is this big
announcement you gotta watch the video
from the beginning buddy give us a
lessons in view Jas I'm sorry man I
don't know people from here they kind of
know how I feel about view Jas is like
if UJS is not good kids trust me it's a
copy of a copy it's like you can't it's
like people are jumping on it because
this is the new thing on the block but
trust me is not worth it
yep I'm going back to the roots going
back to the original things
keep up the good work bro let me see
Chris and you'll bring the vlog style to
the coding community yeah man
bro Chris hog shits on you he is more
realistic say this is a and I say this
as a friend man listen I'm not gonna say
nothing about Chris Hawkes cuz
everything that I already said about
Chris hooks I already said it in like
other videos he's good he's good he does
his thing but kid man this there's a
different level of all-stars in YouTube
man when it comes to this YouTube game
this is a different level bro like
dislike you know learn code Academy
which is high level youtuber right high
level these def tips who is another high
level youtuber then there's um was it
what I think is touch plus or I forgot
his name but he's up there and they're
from there I'm telling you right now is
between me and Christian then everybody
else I'm sorry and this is not
alienating everybody and shitting on
everybody but they're not on the same
level as us man I'm being honest there's
like a top-five right there there's a
top five and then from there everybody
else is just they're here because
they've been here for like four or five
years we blowing them out the box
compare it to our metrics to them when
they first started compare their metrics
to us
we're like blowing them out the box like
no lie look it up look at how much they
were making and how many subscribers how
many views that were gaining and like
2013 2014 compared to our first year our
first few months so he can't shit on the
kit because I'm doing my thang it you
know we killing them and like sometimes
I laugh about it I just I'll be like yo
I do watch their channels and shit like
that but
I'm sorry man but me and my boy Chris
Chris Sean man we killing them right now
like literally like we're we're taking
this to another level it's not just
being able to to code yes you could code
we all know how to code we all know how
to program we all know how to use the
same fucking tools same react same view
J as same JavaScript saying no PHP is
saying no GS we all know the same shit
but as far as youtubers the YouTube
level we bring any higher than that
you know like we we want to bring it up
but simple programmer let's bring it up
to simple program those been around do
gap got books got freaking how you call
it books are courses on online freaking
a blog a website and he's it's taking
him like I don't know like five almost
ten years to get to a hundred thousand
subscribers no matter how you look at it
there's something there's a disconnect
between the peoples on YouTube and in
the youtubers so when you see that
there's a disconnect so when it comes to
other other youtubers right nobody's
messing with us so let's just leave it
at that you know
khalessi let's see what else
who's in here who's in here
Joe giving up on y'all now I'm not
giving up on ya I'm just saying I know
what's my audience and I know that my
audience needs the basics because that's
what people want those are the videos
that got me to where I'm at so me giving
them more advanced courses and more
advanced languages and tutorials doesn't
make sense without big code without
without what I what up are you doing
prior to touring yeah I am
from hood some money we got this fan
word we ain't here man I started
learning to code after watching your
videos man see that is great I love
seeing that I love seeing that a lot of
yeah you know you're starting to take
this more serious because of me or but
just maybe because of me because you see
me and you're like okay cool if he could
make it I can make it you know what I
mean like that's the point of the
channel
Fonfon function is a great channel
yes sir my boy Rick Hernandez
without--without what up that's what I'm
saying man that's why I started this
thing man because you see he just say
hey Kota face you keep it real man
remind me of my homies that's all I want
to do if I remind you of your friends
I'm good
cuz that's the point of this channel I'm
supposed to talk to to you guys like I'm
talking to my friends you know what I
mean so yeah man that was the big
announcement today we're going back to
the basics we're not giving no more
advanced topics we're going to go I mean
we might give advanced topics once in a
while because we also we can be still
you know but as far as tutorials I want
to give you guys two basics I want to
give you guys everything that you guys
need to succeed because it's like a lot
of you guys are not up to that level
where ya can start learning more
advanced topics you're still in the
beginning and a lot of the tutorials
that you see online and courses they're
not teaching you in a way where it could
you know they sorry they breaking it
down for you guys in an easy way they're
not breaking it down for you guys
yeah man so that's my goal my going to
break it down for you guys in a very
easy way man FDS FDS without you know so
that's what we do it right now guys
we're we're basically doing our thing
and you know let me see-oh what it says
here
since can't compare was it 2014
well you can't compare YouTube is much
more popular now than back in 2013 so
not quite comparable actually it is
because what people don't know I'm not
just brand new in YouTube like I was
doing this a long time ago I had another
YouTube account which was about music
where I used to do um basically news and
shit like that for fun and back then
like I got to a hundred thousand
subscribers right away in less than a
year and a half of course it was a
different topic it was more about music
and it was completely different but I
know there was a lot of people in 2013
2014 I know this now there's a bigger
audience in in michaelis in web
development but trust me if I was around
at that time if I would have taken what
development seriously back then I would
have been like yo you know what I'm
gonna take it to the next level you know
I kind of wish if I would have known the
things that I know now in the sense of
like how things work I would adjust
before I show my channel before I sold
it what I would have done is I would
have just kept those a hundred thousand
subscribers that I had and just renamed
the channel into something else and
deleted all my music channel or my music
news and videos that I had
because that's what the other company
did they came they took it they pretty
much deleted all my videos and they kept
all the 100 thousand subscribers that it
took me a year and a half to build so if
I were to known that now I would have
just done that now would have been like
I want to cap that channel and the
leader on my videos and just rename it
into something else but it's cool but
yeah man now it's time for my lunch I'll
see you guys later
I'm excited about this new thing that
we're doing now and yeah let's get back
to the basics let's get this thing down
let's learn how to build websites from
scratch together and let's do it a
proper way man you know you already
