man coding fees.com your boy is backing
out and did it again listen guys I have
a very good topic right now and is you
know I think every developer every
Journal developer that's learning on
their own should make a youtube channel
and you're probably thinking like wait
Joe why would they make a YouTube
channel
why will they record themselves in put
themselves out there well I think is
very important you know a lot of people
find you because of social media or
websites like this you know like for me
a lot of people hit me up I have a lot
of companies that hit me up and even
people that just you know randomly hit
me up like hey we found your channel we
found your you know your Twitter your
Twitter we found your Instagram etc
right and they hit me up all the time
like oh oh you're looking for a job are
you doing this and that we like to do
some contract work what you like to do
some freelancing you know most of the
time I just be like hey man I don't even
have time for that right now but thank
you for the offer
but for you guys as junior developers I
think is really good because it gets you
exposure it really gets you out there
and not only that that you get to learn
a lot you know sometimes people are very
hard on youtubers right so like let's
say an example you are a beginner right
and you create a tutorial for JavaScript
right sometimes you might not have all
the best practices or whatever's the
latest thing out there right because
you're a beginner right but it's still
good for you to actually put your your
code out there
in the things that you know one because
you could look back on it and be like oh
man Wow look at the difference the
growth of me from back then to now all
the things that I know right I wish I
would have done that from the beginning
if I wouldn't know you know I would have
been coding and just pretty much keeping
track of everything I did for the past
five six years all right so that's one
reason another reason is like let's say
you create a tutorial creating a
tutorial forces you to actually go in
and really know everything about
whatever subject you are talking about
you can't just be like hey I'm just
gonna come in and just freestyle it and
try to figure it out without no idea of
what you're doing right so this is great
for those of you that want to learn
something like let's say some one of you
guys want to learn es6 really well right
you can come in look at the
documentation of es6 practice it a
couple of times and then make a video
body make a video about the things that
you learned the things that you actually
you know the things that you found that
was difficult the things that you found
that were easy and pretty much it will
help you to remember all those things
and not only that it will help other
people who are just starting to learn
that that topic that you basically
created for example es6 alright so I
think is a very good platform for
developers to come in and just record
what they do you know keep track of
everything like github is great at that
tool because you could actually create a
project and go back into and be like oh
wow man I did this project in 2013 now
it's 2019 right for example and you
could just go back and be like oh wow
look what I was working on a stupid
to-do app you know what I mean but you
look back on it and you realize like man
there's a lot of growth you know what I
mean
so definitely I would advise people to
try to you know get out there man like
don't be scared you know like I was
thinking about creating a YouTube
channel years ago man I've been doing
this since 2007 2006 I've been on
YouTube right and the reason why I
didn't want to do it was because I was
gonna be judged by you know the smartest
people out there and be like oh man
maybe they're gonna make fun of me maybe
they're gonna be like oh you don't know
anything maybe they're gonna be like oh
this dis and they're like if I make a
mistake they're gonna be like oh
my god his kid is so dumb whatever and
when I think about him like man that was
so dumb like who cares what anybody
thinks you know what I mean like who
cares about what anybody's gonna say
about you out there in the comments or
on the world like who cares about that
man like I'm just documenting my life as
a developer you know what I mean or I'm
documenting things that I'm learning as
a developer you know this a lot of
youtubers out here who if you look at
the videos the first few videos were
horrible right but with time it gets
better and better and better and you
actually see how good to get with coding
with time and it just happens it that's
how it is like this is one of those
things that it's just like basketball
man you know what I mean like if you
don't practice you're not gonna get good
all right so when you create a tutorial
when you create even the simplest things
out there not only are you helping
yourself but you're also helping other
people you know cuz you're making a
video which is gonna reinforce the
things that you already know and then at
the same time you're helping other
people's that they haven't found the
answer for something you know what I
mean so I would definitely advise people
like create a channel doesn't matter
what it is it could be just your name it
could be and it doesn't have to be like
a specific topic just share a video you
know you're working on something share
it you are learning something share it
you know save it even if you put it on
private right even if you put it on
private after a while you be like oh man
I'm not happy with this video and you
put it on private don't delete it keep
it put it just put a private for
yourself just for you to be able to
watch it so you could go back into time
and be like man look at the growth man
look at the improvements that I've done
excuse me over the past few years so I
will definitely check that out man like
check youtube out man give it a chance
you know don't let nobody swindle you to
not do it like it's fun man YouTube is
definitely
be fun you know and the reason what I
was saying this is because I'm making
this project for for the simple blog
which is just a crud for laravel but I'm
explaining everything about laravel for
the people that have my PHP course
alright and I'm building this other
project like we did it through playing
the PHP and now we're doing it with
laravel as just cruddud right we're not
doing nothing complicated with just a
simple crud but going back into all
those things that i learned years ago
and now explain it to other peoples I'm
like reinforcing it again like there's
things that now that I forgot but this
things that you don't use every single
day like you're using on special
occasions but you still gotta explain it
to people so it's like now I'm like okay
this is something that I don't need to
know every single day I don't use every
day but now explaining it to others I'm
like oh yeah like there's a good case
for this for certain situations right
and just reminded me I'm like Ben people
should do this like you know cuz this
there's a lot of times that you know
you're building stuff and like let's say
right now I haven't touched Ruby on
Rails and probably like a good year and
a half I haven't touched Ruby on Rails
I don't this rails 5 I don't know all
the new things that rails 5 has right
the last one that I was using was real
for something but now I'm like man I
should go back to Ruby a row because
probably these things that I must have
forgot because I haven't put it to
practice you know when you create
tutorials and you create videos online
like you know you don't have to put your
face out there you could do it like
traversing media I'm pretty sure like
one of the the best things that he has
going for him is the fact that he gets
to learn in and call new things every
single day because he's doing this
things on YouTube right and I feel like
he gotta be like super knowledgeable by
now because of all the things that he
has to learn every single day and go
through documentation create
oh you know crash courses and doing all
this stuff like it's like you reinforce
it you know so you don't forget it you
know think about it like this it's like
hey if you know how to ride a bike but
you never ride the bike again the next
time you get on it you probably know how
to get on it but you're gonna be like
going from side to side because you
don't really know how to balance
yourself but with this with coding if
you come in and you practice every
single day and then on top of that
you're explaining it to other peoples
and passing the knowledge down to other
people like it doesn't even have to be
YouTube you could literally do this for
a friend of yours a friend of yours
that's interested in it sit down with
him be like hey man let's go over this
let me teach you how to do this like let
me teach you the basics and then not
only are you helping him you're helping
yourself to get to reinforce all the
things that you already learned alright
so I was just creating this video cuz I
saw this I was like man and I felt this
at this moment I was like man this is
pretty cool like I was very privileged
to be doing this right now and it's
thanks to you guys cuz I'm like man I'm
creating this course about laravel I'm
also reinforcing little things that I
already know and it's like I'm using
this as a reminder and I'm having fun
with it you know what I mean so
definitely man check it out man give
yourself the opportunity to keep on
learning when it open up a YouTube open
up or twitch open up boy I don't know
whatever account you know what I mean
like record yourself put it out there or
share it with a friend and that's it man
alright guys if you don't know about
this man check out my website man
coating phrase calm man listening I have
the best courses out there right now
literally all my courses is you know
then the top of you to me we definitely
got over 10,000 students between this
website and you to me we're pretty hot
right now man if we was to be you know
we hot in the streets right now you know
what I mean like we're very hot right
now man you get you know if you sign up
to my website for a subscription you
could buy a course if you want to you
know you automatically when you
used to link of my description you get
50% off of everything doesn't matter how
much it is it's 50% off because you use
the link but if you say hey I'm gonna
sign up for the ghetto access pass you
use the link below and you get access to
every single course for a month for just
$10 all right and then from there it
just renew again and you could continue
that subscription until you finish
everything like this is great for people
who are just getting started in this and
like let's say for example your new
developer you like you don't even know
if you're sure you know I have five
people hit me up and they subscribe to
the subscription and then they're like
mandate you know cuz they like all I
want to do coding this good jobs it's
this and that but they don't want to go
out and spend you know 50 $100 $200 $500
on a course or whatever it is because
they're not even sure if they want to be
doing this you know what I mean like
this is a great place for you guys to
start and come in you know see if you
really want to become a developer like
the way how I teach it is gonna keep you
engaged at the same time I do in a fun
way creating real projects that you can
use for your portfolio real projects
that simulate what happens in in real
life at a job and yeah and like if you
feel like hey I don't like this this is
not what I want to do that's it
you cancel it pretty much what do you
spend ten dollars to realize hey this is
not for you now if this is for you
you're gonna continue with this
description because there's a lot of
things that you're going to learn
through this whole website like I'm
telling you guys man all right to be
honest with you guys I'm like I don't
even know what more to say like if I had
this opportunity to learn this and this
actually so much better deal then all
the things that I did before like even
you to me like I bought a lot of courses
guys like over my lifetime I've bought a
lot of courses on udemy and I don't
regret it because I learned a lot you
know what I mean but this is such a good
deal man for literally ten dollars the
price of one unity course you're
getting over 20 courses in every single
day I add more videos more courses more
projects to each topic so even the learn
HTML CSS more videos got added to it
the laravel course more videos are being
added to it right now so once you learn
PHP you learn how to do things by
yourself now you learned the framework
and after learning the framework then
from there you continue creating
projects to reinforce it and not just be
like oh yeah you learn the framework
because you follow along a tutorial as
if it was Netflix and then once you're
done with it you're like oh I don't know
what to do now we continue building
projects so you could get better and
better and better because this is not
something that you gotta become a
developer from one day to another guys
this is a process you gotta give
yourself at least six months to be
really good you know one month to learn
the syntax of any web programming
language that you want right and then
from there you're gonna give yourself
time to build projects and build things
that is gonna make you a more better
developer yeah you could get a job as
soon as possible right you can probably
get a job once you finish a few my
courses and I'm just being honest you
could literally get a job after that but
to be a really good developer programmer
whatever you want to call yourself
engineer you have to put in the time
like this is something this is a
lifetime's work you know what I mean so
it's like you could get a job as a
junior developer and get hired you know
somebody's gonna give you the
opportunity because you look like
somebody who has good projects on your
portfolio and you know what you're doing
but at the same time you have to
understand to become really good it's
gonna take you sometimes this is not
something that once you're hired it
doesn't mean that you're good it just
means you got hired and they giving you
the opportunity you're gonna get even
better at work but at the same time you
have to come back home and do other
projects not just the ones from work I
know it seems crazy like man even after
I get hired
I gotta still study I still got a bill
yes that's just how the world works you
know unless you want to get stuck in the
same job forever and getting paid the
same
you know minimum amount that you could
get for a junior developer that's fine
for you you happy there that's fine you
don't have to study you don't have to
learn anything up beyond whatever that
job has for you but if you say hey man
right now I got hire for this job at
45,000 50,000 next year I want to get
75,000 well this whole year while you
working you have to be here on this
website or on udemy or wherever you
decide it's your choice you have to
decide to continue learning to basically
get better as a developer so the next
level and the next time that you get
higher another company is gonna be a
higher pay all right guys so yeah man
check out the website coding phase com
you can find me also on udemy comm check
me out man all right I'll see you guys
later man leave me a comment let me know
what you guys think do you guys think
this is a good idea too for people to
create YouTube channels and share their
their knowledge and also to share their
skills as they continue to learn all
right I'll see you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
