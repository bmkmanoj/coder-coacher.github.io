dictionaries okay so dictionaries are
very important in Python in every other
language out there this is very similar
to JavaScript objects - the fact that
you can't add our methods to them also
very similar to JSON so what we're going
to do is we're gonna come here and say
something like this user and then say
user equals tool curly brackets
so instead of using square brackets how
we did with array we're going to use
curly brackets okay so all you have to
do is hold shift and you should be there
all right now we got to basically do
like this and you're gonna come in and
have a key and a value okay so you're
gonna come in and say this is a user his
name I'm gonna say his name is Joe okay
and then we're gonna come here say age
is 30 then we're gonna say occupation or
legislation city we're gonna say Queens
okay let's say family members okay
family members oops
family members we're gonna put in let's
see an array and we're gonna come in and
see janya Janita
ethan oops
let's see what else Johnny Janita eating
margarita which is my mom and then we
have wifey which is LV okay so we have
tau so basically this is a dictionary
right as you guys can see we have a key
and we have a value for that key
all right we can also come here and put
in you know other dictionaries inside of
the dictionary just like how we had
listing side of list we can also have
dictionaries inside of dictionaries okay
so we're gonna come in here and we're
gonna say okay family members and what
else can we put in let's say skills okay
so we can say skills and then we're
gonna put in here another dictionary in
Saturday so we're gonna say something
like this PHP let's say expert let's say
something like go let's say mid oh let's
say HTML and let's say expert and that's
pretty much it
now as you can see we can actually
structure our data for this user way
better with dictionaries thing just
having an array okay or what we call it
a list right cuz list is just a list of
things alright but when you need to
actually structure something you want to
say hey this is the name this is the ace
there's the city family member scales
like you want to be using a dictionary
because you have to access of having a
key and having a value now how do we get
access to each key inside of this
dictionary very simple we're gonna put
in user okay and then we're gonna say
brackets and then we're gonna put in the
name of the key so let's say if I wanted
to get the age all I will have to do is
you say age just like that like in a
string you put it inside of the brackets
and then now I could print this out or
say print user age okay and we run this
and it says 30 if I wanted to get access
to family members
and I say family members come here run
this you see Johnny Anita eat them like
very tiny LV now how do I get access to
eaten very simple just how we did with
you know multiple was a
multi-dimensional arrays matrix okay we
literally come here and put another
bracket and then say the index because
you have access to the array here
already and then now you want to get
access to a certain index so you say 0 1
2 and then now we have that so you see
we got eaten okay so how do we get
access to a dictionary inside of a
dictionary pretty simple let me delete
this and I'm gonna come here and say
skills alright so now we have access to
this dictionary so how do we get access
to go all right we do the same thing put
in brackets because we already have
access to that right here so we say okay
we already have access to this
dictionary now I want to have access to
the goal key so I come here say go and
then as you can see it says MIT I was
the dual HTML
we'll say expert okay pretty simple now
let's say I wanted to reassign something
here right I want to say hey I want to
change let's say city ok so I'm gonna
come here I'm gonna say city all right
and let me copy this here and got a
reassign it I'm gonna say user city and
I'm gonna change it to let's say middle
Barry okay
so now I run now as you see if we say
user city is now Middlebury and if we
check on user the whole dictionary will
see that actually city got changed to
Middlebury alright same thing that we
could come here and change family
members we could come here and say
family members and then but in the index
of two for Ethan and then when we change
that we're gonna change that sort of
metal barrier so we're gonna say Jo H
City Queens family members Johnny Anita
Middlebury as you can see okay same
thing that we could do for let's say go
I wanted to change that I could
literally say like this I'm gonna say
skills ok skills then I'm going to
choose go and then I'm going to say I
want to change it to Middlebury ok and
now you can see skills PHP go got
changed tomato berry so that's pretty
much it as far as the basic self
dictionaries now you guys understand
that you can pretty much putting any
type of data type in there and just
organize it the way how you want it okay
so many dictionaries and lists they go
hand-in-hand for example if you wanted
to have multiple let's say users instead
of just one user you will use something
like this you would say hey I have a
list okay and then inside of this list I
have multiple dictionaries alright I
didn't show you this before of adding a
list inside of a dictionary because you
guys still did not know what a
dictionary was but you who come here
take this and go like this and say horn
change this to Cindy
and pretty much if you come here in
users now you have all that data so
Allah make sure this is users using the
reason we have in this error is because
down here we were seeing user skills go
middlebury
so that no longer exists it's no longer
user its users so we're gonna comment
this out and we're gonna print users
again so we're gonna run and as you can
see we have an array a list a list with
a bunch of different dictionaries inside
of them so you got one user here
one user here another user alright so
dictionaries are very important guys so
I'll get used to them I'll see you guys
in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
