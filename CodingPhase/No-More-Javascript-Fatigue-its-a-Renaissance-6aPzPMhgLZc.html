today's topic is hey man it's no longer
JavaScript fatigue it's a JavaScript
Renaissance like I don't know where
people be coming up with this terms man
like you know they try to paint paint
like you know something that's negative
into something positive all the time
I mean people still don't understand why
people call it JavaScript fatigue the
reason why people call it JavaScript
fatigue is because they're tired of
every time that you just learned
something
you gotta relearn it again and you gotta
go ahead and freaking learn a new
version learn new things that is gonna
break your old code like people are
tired of that okay now let me share this
article with you guys I'll bring it up
to the screen so you guys can know
exactly what I'm talking about
so heal JavaScript fatigue scratch stack
it's actually JavaScript Renaissance so
this is what they said here on this
article way basically Chauncey Larkin
and he's probably a super cool dude
super smart guy this is not a shot to
him this is not a shot to anybody that
works with web pack but it's just the
fact that every time that basically a
new library comes out a new version
comes out soon as you learn it something
new pops up hey we got any subscribers
um so every time that you learn
something something new comes out I want
to know exactly when was the last
version of web pack three wet pack three
release release so on June 19 so like
basically six months ago six months ago
Shaun T Larkin also announced
webpack 3 was released and it had new
features and a whole bunch of other
stuff and I mean it says no braking
functionality at all ok that's cool if
it doesn't break all right but even at
that right even if it if it doesn't
break when you upgrade you know people
get tired this man like you know what I
mean like every single time that you
just learn something you got to relearn
it again because it's not just hate is a
new version and that's like there's a
couple of things that are gonna change
all right so they released a web pack
for which to me is it's one of the worst
things that have happened to web
development period right the moment that
people say hey man will let's jump on
web pack everybody gotta go through web
pack personally that puts a stop to so
many people right from learning this
because it's not only do you have to
learn let's say let's walk it down down
the line how this thing works
you gotta learn HTML CSS then you got to
learn JavaScript and after learning
JavaScript you want to learn es6 now to
basically compile es6 you got a go and
also learn how to use webpack with
either gulp or not web pack our Babel
Babel Babel whatever you want to call it
you gotta use that to basically compile
your JavaScript so now you got to go in
there and fall into the world of ok now
I gotta learn a task runner like
gold-bug aren't most people use a gulp
and then from there you gotta say okay
if I want to do that you know nice
imports and all the cool stuff or the
latest features of JavaScript right now
you gotta go and use webpack and if you
ever build any type of like web pack
config file from scratch you know that's
like that's like a two to three hour
thing that's not something that you go
in there but I want to add this
no sometimes they could take you up to
like four or five hours setting
everything up how you want it on your on
your you know development environment
right instead of using something that's
simple right and that's why I still love
gulp I'm sorry I still love gold people
hate me for that oh man this isn't that
no go up already set up in a way where
it's okay here's a task here's the
streams this is what happens in order
and thought out I say you got your file
back out when you dinner with webpack if
you go in there there's so many
configurations the documentation is some
mess right the documentation of webpack
alone it's a mess if you go in there
like they have so many different
examples of different ways that you can
use webpack like it's ridiculous right
and I'm just
you know like what is the next thing
gonna come right to me I'm really
waiting for the next one because webpack
is not a right there's too much
configuration there's too much stuff
that just a beginner has to learn just
to use webpack and like most people
gotta take a course on what pack you
know most libraries all you have to do
is look at the documentation now to
learn the web packing learn everything
that's in there you need to take a
course I've seen people create courses
that are like eight hours long on web
pack alone you get what I'm saying like
why is one library like so big so many
things and then what's up by that the
whole ecosystem everybody want to follow
whatever web pack is doing it's like hey
you gotta use webpack for this if you
want to do this and then you want to
have the you know freakin import all the
cool stuff that javascript passes like
you get what I'm saying like people are
tired of that you know and let me reset
the the chatbox and you know the
viewercount cuz sometimes people things
like oh we a zero now we got a couple of
people in here live you gonna say but
sometimes I'll be forgetting to actually
reset the view your account but um yeah
man it's crazy like you know and it's
just like with everything else every
time that you finish learning something
so unless you if it has to do with
JavaScript you know most programming
languages they they do a major update
like once a year you know or maybe it
once every two years and so I was like
whatever you learned you know is that
okay cool whatever I learned now I don't
need to read re freaking re upgrade my
skills in the next two to three months
now with JavaScript it's every every
month and a half something new comes out
as a new version of this so now yeah I
gotta go in there look into the
documentation learn this stuff again you
know it's all cool they added a new
feature it saves me one millisecond
you know what I'm saying like that's why
I personally I'm like slowly but surely
stepping back away from JavaScript
because it's just to me it's not
sustainable it's not it's not a place
where where I don't know for somebody
who has a life for somebody who has
things to do in their lives like I can't
see somebody going in there and and just
like hey I'm gonna learn everything
that's out there in JavaScript you can't
because every time that you blink 30,000
new libraries came out and then just
because somebody has 5,000 stars on
github everybody thinks oh this is
popular you must learn this you must do
listen that and it's like no you know
what I'm saying like a while back I had
somebody will send me oh yeah you could
do this with webpack I'm like certain
things that you do with webpack is a
headache and a lot of times they they be
errors that you're like wait what the
hell's going on here because it's such a
big library and then you go into the
documentation the documentation looked
like a mess let me see if I could show
you guys the documentation of webpack
and then it's like right now they just
released a new version of of webpack
where I don't even think is in the
documentation yet which people don't
understand is like if you don't have to
documentation for it whatever new
features that you're releasing why are
you even releasing it because it means
people won't be able to use it properly
and all its gonna do is gonna be
breaking their code breaking their there
you know there are whole freakin modules
that they already have set up like you
know the whole setup right so it's just
like oh man like once again here you go
you know so I just wanted to make this
quick video just seeing that on the
articles like hey man it's no longer
JavaScript fatigue you guys you guys are
wrong about this you guys it's not that
you guys are tired of JavaScript is a
Renaissance
these are Renaissance and it's like nah
bro it's not about a renaissance it's
like people are coming up with stuff
that don't need to be here that's just
being honest justice the plain truth you
know people are recreating the wheel
constantly in JavaScript it's like if
this already was made six months ago
and what is the point of recreating it
again six months later you get what I'm
saying and then sigh oh yeah we're we're
just adding a couple of things that you
know what you used to use or for plugins
now you don't have to use plugins now
you could use it directly with what
packing this doesn't
you
you get what I'm saying like I don't
know if it's just me or boy am i buggin
out where I'm just like yo I don't want
to hear where a new version of whatever
comes out I just don't and it's not like
oh man people you know when I was
younger in the game else like oh you
know older developers they're so old
they don't want to keep keep up with the
newer things it's now keeping up with
the newer things it's like you're
focusing more on constantly relearning
the same things over and over and over
again instead of building things right
most of this developers most of the
developers are building libraries and
building a whole bunch of new versions
of XYZ right instead of building new
products new things that's going to
change the world new things that is
gonna make people lives easier it's like
they wasting time or recreating the
wheel constantly it's like hey who can
build you know if last year it took one
millisecond to to freaking export this
files how can we make you half a
millisecond three months later and it's
like
okay so how fast is fast you know what
I'm saying like I just like is it just
me oh oh oh is it like now the front-end
world you know javascript in general is
like literally just like hey let's make
things more complicated constantly right
I thought the reason why people create a
frameworks and libraries was to make
people's lives easier right instead of
using vanilla JavaScript but now every
time that I see a new version of
anything that has to do with JavaScript
it makes me hold on tight to vanilla
JavaScript it's like vanilla JavaScript
I love you like here you go over now the
JavaScript I love you buddy you know
what I mean because every single time
they coming up with something recreating
the wheel I'm just like you know what
yeah I can keep that and I'll come back
to this vanilla JavaScript you get what
I'm saying so it's like I don't even
want to know I don't want to know about
new versions don't send me no
notifications don't send me a message
don't send me an email don't update me
on anything right unless it's something
new if you're recreating the wheel for
2018 if you're recreating the wheel and
you're just adding the same things that
were already created six months ago and
the only thing that you're doing is
adding it to the main library don't tell
me about it
don't make it a new version make it like
a update make it like a three point one
point five or whatever right like those
updates nobody cares about right but
don't say hey let's just talk about a
new version to get people excited and
then when they get there is like we
recreating the wheel again we're doing
the same things again like people don't
get this like people are tired of that
like nobody wants to stayed the whole
day just looking at JavaScript
constantly and recreating the wheel all
the time you know like somebody says
barrier of entry into the field is hard
enough and it's not even that it's hard
enough it's more of like people are
making it more complicated than it needs
to be at or like like look okay
you gotta learn react write react
doesn't make your life excuse me make
your life easier angular doesn't make
your life easier but to get the full
features you gotta use Babel alright
then you gotta use plugins then you
gotta use like a whole bunch of stuff
like and it's like man
like I really just like coldest with
just regular JavaScript like I really
don't I don't want to keep up with it I
don't want to keep up with every single
two weeks something new is coming out
that is overriding what was last week
and somebody sent me a message where
they were talking about hey Joe have you
checked this out they thinking about
recreating react router and I'm like
wait what like didn't they just do that
the other day like they just created a
new version a react router and I thought
we we all said okay cool this the way
how we got a do routing system with
react and it's like meh
we're bored we're bored with the version
that's there now we want to do a new
version so you could spin another week
and a half you know studying again the
same react router and it's like what you
know I mean like that's why I a lot of
people focus more on on the back end
right right you know
the front end is cool kiz' front end
it's easy to get a job you for his job
right but what is happening now is like
people are coming in making things more
complicated than it needs to be so now
the barrier of entry is higher right and
somebody say hey this is great this is
very foot of industry now we're gonna
have to keep the smartest and the people
to actually stick around and it's like
does it make the industry better I don't
think so all right what
does it just makes it super annoying
because it's like hey you need
JavaScript but now every single week
somebody comes up with something new and
JavaScript that everybody got a relearn
the wheel you got what I'm saying like I
just I don't know man you know I love
JavaScript - man I love JavaScript but I
just don't love all these libraries
every single week I just don't you know
I just really I really don't care about
every new version anymore it's like okay
a new version of the same thing that was
doing you know the same thing on the
last version it's like oh cool great
whoopty-doo
you get what I'm saying so I mean
hopefully somebody understand what I'm
talking about in this and appreciates
this video and the frustration with a
lot of developers that are out there
because you know a lot of times people
don't want you to have this type of
opinions they feel like hey man if
somebody created something cool we got a
you know rally behind them in you know
give us give them the you know give him
a big thumbs up and you know support
them and it's like yeah I want to
support everybody but the same time it's
like the ecosystem of JavaScript is such
a mess like
I don't think they understand like when
you go to other programming languages
it's not like that
there's like more high colors it's more
structure like no people come out with
libraries you know for like people will
say okay we're using this library and
look at Python too right
people use Python to - how how long who
knows how long for how long they've been
using Python to write in Python 3 came
out and people still using Python - you
get what I'm saying because people love
that that version of Python and now they
everybody's coming along to Python 3 you
know but at the same time because there
was breaking changes people just didn't
just jump on it and say Oh
kumbaya everybody come by yeah we just
you know we all know we wasn't like that
you know sending people who's into
Python it's not in there like that
going down the yellow brick road just
because a new version came out it's like
nice this thing works it works you gotta
say like we'll get to that that latest
version in the low while you know what
I'm saying like that's how people they
think us if you creating projects and
creating products like this was
important this idea of like everybody
wanted recognition in JavaScript I feel
like everybody wants recognition right
everybody wants to recreate the wheel to
say I was the first one to do this it's
like no no you didn't the last guy who
did the same thing already did it so
it's like every 2-3 months somebody's
recreating the wheel stop doing that man
like that's why people don't want to
mess with JavaScript like experienced
developers do not want to touch it
JavaScript right and it sucks cuz that's
not like the entry to web development so
it's like you have to do it no matter
what but it's like every time that you
come in you gotta get used to the idea
that hey and just in a week and a half
you blink that's a new version came out
so everything that you learned last week
is I Hey out the window new stuff coming
out yeah like you don't have other
things to do like you don't have a life
you don't have kids you don't have a
wife you don't have
you people act like people don't have
personal hobbies or personal projects
that they gotta do and somebody might
say hey Joe but you don't gotta update
you don't gotta upgrade
yes I don't have to lobby or upgrade to
anything but it's just the fact that we
are recreating the wheel like most of
these people are not creating anything
new
you get o saintly it's like stop stop
freaking trying to get get up stars and
now trying to promote things that you're
not creating nothing new when you create
something new that revolutionizes the
industry then it's like we should rally
behind it but we shouldn't be out here
supporting libraries who are just
updating things for no reason constantly
recreating the wheel constantly let's
recreate the wheel every single day I'm
just saying what do I know
you know what do I know that's just my
personal opinion but it did it did hit a
chord when I come into the article and
it's like hey man it's like you version
a wetback I'm like oh cool I don't care
about it right but I like to read I like
to read on what exactly it's on the new
version see what they're up to see that
they add anything new anything useful
from what I'm seeing I'm like nope not
really and then as I came in by the way
by the way anybody who says there's
JavaScript for Teague in the industry
say no it's not a JavaScript fatigue is
a Renaissance it's like that's like the
big fu to everybody like hey guys this
is not this is not a fatigue people are
not tired this they loved is this this
is why they come to JavaScript people
come to JavaScript to spend their you
know every month and a half
relearning the same thing that they
learned last week you know this is
exactly what they do you know I mean
I love learning I love learning new
things but I want to learn things are
different I don't want to keep learning
the same thing I don't want to keep
learning I don't plan on learning the
next framework that does the same thing
they react us I'm not planning on
learning the next framework that does
the same thing that angular does I'm not
learning the same framework that does a
few GIS you know I spent like five hours
and a half doing you know huge is when
it came out the view - I did you one
which a lot of you guys don't even know
about right I use view one because I
used to follow a lot of like you know
Larry cast and Clarabelle so I messed
around with it for a while but their
view too came I was like wait am I like
in the matrix in my The Twilight Zone am
i doing the same things that I just did
last week was for angular am I told the
same thing that I just did with react
wait five hours in who's gonna give me
my time back you know what I'm saying
like a five hours and I said eh I even
paid for what's this guy's name
Maximilian's course of UGS I was like eh
five hours into this am i doing the same
things over and over again
I got projects to build I got things to
do sorry X turn it out I say you know
what not for me let that go for whoever
wants to go next and the more you become
experienced you're gonna realize
everything that I'm telling you it's
100% true kind of sucks because it's
like you love learning but it's like if
people are not creating new things
they're not creating stuff that you can
say oh this is rebel revolutionary like
this is changing the the world it's like
don't even learn it like you're doing
the same thing over and over and over
over over over over over over over
hey we could do a song over over over
Oh
/ / / / / / / maker I get thrown out of
this you gonna say like we just like in
the loop right now man
I forgot what show was that that was
like a the guy was trying to leave the
town and every time he left one side of
the town he ended up on the other side
of the town and it's like wait I mean a
loop you know what I'm saying so anyways
guys I'm outta here Superboy Joe and
yeah go to my website kobi5.com
I love react I love JavaScript I love go
pile of even what I love for what it is
right
I'm not planning on learning this new
one you know what I mean so anyways it's
your boy Joe back at it again and before
I leave I know somebody's gonna say Joe
but it just really no breaking changes
but it's not about the breaking changes
is the fact that there's constantly a
new version a new thing coming out and
then now I gotta spend my time to go
into the documentation and then on top
of that it's a haze the new version and
the documentation is not even there so
it's like hey there's new stuff here but
you figure it out you know what I'm
saying like I don't know anyways man I'm
out here's your boy Joe back at it again
Koloff is calm go check out the website
guys we knocking out like this on a new
project they react it's freaking legit I
wanna curse blah it's that bad that I
wanna curse on my go this is effing
legit you know we got this project going
on right now a lot of people are loving
it because we're doing everything from
react router we working a little bit
with no - yes
we're basically working with Ajax we're
working with api's we're doing
everything man in just one project okay
come in come check it out we got a
slider how to build a slider with you
know all react all the good stuff
you know coming here got the basically
that's the details page we also have
cars and trucks page
we got filtering all of this on the
website go check it out coding fees.com
stop slacking man it's literally one
little thing you come here so your
browser you come click on coding
face.com you know you could go ahead and
buy courses on your own which I wouldn't
recommend because you actually spend
more money like that just joined a
membership man just come here click on
courses you find any course that you
like let's say on this one
right even though learn Python it should
be free you're coming here and subscribe
for thirty four twenty sorry you're
coming here and rolling the courses get
all of this courses in one shot right if
you come here and you click enroll
through this course and then from there
you say hey I'm in the coupon code just
