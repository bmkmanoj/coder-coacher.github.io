at it again coding face.com
your boys back and I done did it again
one more time I didn't did it again we
here we live kids without without what
up let me know who's coming in who's not
coming in you know we trying to do this
daily at least once in our you know once
a week maybe once a week once a day you
know do a little quick live stream with
you guys you know how I do it man
do alarm says 120k salary this year or
bus let's get it yeah man good luck man
if you could do it do it no I know a lot
of people who would not even qualify and
somehow they swindled their way in into
the industry in you know they they gate
those those large salaries and they
basically learn on the job you know so
it's like why you can't do it you know
what I mean so you got this man
let me see who's in here we got two
alarm we got Andrew Warwick we got
Matthew Smith we got max fading Carlos
we got Camp Perry Steve and Freddy
Martinez so you guys know for the past I
don't know the past few days I've been
working on the new Ruby on Rails course
I already finished the Ruby course which
pretty much talks about everything that
you need to basically work on Ruby on
Rails okay so this is pretty simple
we're gonna do a little quick app a
little quick simple app that you guys
can pretty much you know use this
example as how easy and how quick it is
to come in and start working on things
you know what I mean now we're just
gonna create a very simple crud
live just to show you guys the power of
Ruby on Rails and the framework now this
is like I said to you guys
Ruby on Rails is great for startups Ruby
on Rails is great for people that trying
to create new products out there people
that is trying to come in and do as much
as they can with a small team you know
what I mean so let's get started man and
then from there we're gonna start
answering questions and just have
conversations you know how to do it you
know so let me see if I could bring up
the screen okay I want to make sure I
set everything up this you know me I
freestyle this this I wasn't gonna do a
app and I just said you know what let's
do it I just turned on the camera I say
you know f it let's do it oh okay so let
me clear clear my screen let me come in
here and let me close a couple of things
let me share my screen let me see let me
see who's who's in here man
all right let me see how can skip share
my screen with you guys all right cool
so let me see refresh cool so this is
not working and that's good because it
means that turned off everything okay so
let's say we wanted to do something very
simple like a block right you know most
of the time and other frameworks you
have to go in there build it yourself
you know and do a whole bunch of stuff
that to be honest as a developer is very
repetitive you know you got to set up
the route set up you know the server set
up the view set up all the little things
like that man like it's just repetitive
right it's like you're
constantly doing the same thing I mean
as a developer you're always gonna be
have to do a lot of stuff that you've
done before so let me see I'm trying to
set up the the thing to be good and you
guys can actually see okay cool
so I mean all we need is this much of
the screen so it's fine all right so we
have this application we're gonna go to
CD I usually set up all my projects
inside of a folder that is inside of the
root okay
and it's name at the root is side of the
home of my computer so you know how you
have your username my user name is Joe
Santos Garcia so that's the folder that
I'm in right now okay so I say something
like this going to see the projects and
then inside of this project I come in
I'd say rails new and we're gonna say
rails blog okay and there it goes
go ahead buddy hurry up install it's not
gonna take that long okay that's it
we're done everything is done man now
the next thing that we're going to do is
something very simple we're gonna say
rails we're gonna go inside a folder
first gonna say see the rails blog and
then close click on LS to see what's
inside of it and then from there what
we're gonna do is we're gonna go and say
something like this rails G for generate
so rails has a bunch of generators that
does everything for you if you need to
oh there you go that's what I'm talking
about so if you need to come in and
create like let's say a model you can
literally generate if you
to create a controller you could
generate you want to create a migration
you can generate it like anything that
you could think of you can generate it
so let's say in a situation where you
want to create something like a blog or
something that's already pretty
straightforward right a wheel it right
now wheel it right now so okay so let's
say you wanted to come in and say rails
G and then you say scaffold and then
after scaffold you put in the name of
whatever you want to build so usually
you want to create something in plural
so they're gonna say if I'm talking
about articles or I'm talking about post
or I'm talking about
I don't know photos you wanna say photos
all right in plural so I'm gonna say
rails G scaffold photos and then I'm
gonna come here and put in a couple of
different options for the scaffold so we
want to have a title okay we're gonna
say this titles gotta be a string then
from there we're gonna say we want a
description and description is gonna be
a text and let's see what else what else
can we add to this string description
and I think that's about it for now I
mean if we wanted to go in we could add
a category but I don't think I want to
add that right now we're just gonna keep
it simple so right there rails
automatically generates all the files
for you so it generated migration
generated the model generated some tests
in case you want to start running tests
on on that feature right you got the
views you already created all the HTML
files for you so you got index edit show
new you got a partial which is a form
you got to see you got tents units
helpers you got J builders let's see
what else
you got s CSS files so you got
everything all ready for you alright so
the next thing that we're gonna do is
we're gonna come here we're gonna say
rails server and there you go
booting up and now that's it
so your server is already running on
localhost 3000 come in it's telling you
hey migrations are pending meaning you
have some migrations that are still
waiting for it to go in alright so all
you have to do is come here and say hey
I'm gonna open up a new terminal which
opens up the same location where you was
at so if you open up a new tab on the
top you say shell and the new tab and
click on new tab with settings
automatically it starts you off in the
same location that you had this window
on so you don't have to go and find the
folder that you was at ok so next thing
that you want to do is come here and say
break DB migrate and Ruby rails actually
runs with sequel Lite automatically and
sequel Lite is like a database just like
my sequel just like Postgres just like
MongoDB but the only difference is that
this runs inside of one single file
alright so your whole database is just
one single file this thing is not
supposed to be super powerful it's not
supposed to have millions of lines this
is cool
because this is just like hey I want to
start building something and I don't
want to worry about setting up the you
know my sequel setting up MongoDB like
you're just working off one single file
this is just for development ok so now
we have reg DB migrate and then now we
come back to the browser we refresh and
say hey it tells you let me open this up
a little bit for you guys
it says yay you're on rails so pretty
much you're using rails 5 and we're
using Ruby
to point 4.1 now if I come here and I
say articles okay no route matches for
articles okay but to come back if we go
into our folders over here let me
there's another project that I have open
I'm gonna click on file open make sure I
want you guys to see this how easy and
simple this thing is so we got rails
block you're gonna open this up I'm
using atom for those of you guys that
are wondering what do jÃ´ use you guys
should already know I use atom that's
the best for me okay alright so we're
gonna go into controllers and currently
I mean I named the photos all right
which technically was a mistake but we
could actually fix that and the reason
why I wanted to show you that is because
it's like hey if you make a mistake this
is how easy is to like grow back and say
oh shoot I made a mistake you literally
come here and say rake DB and say roll
back and automatically whatever was in
the database gets dropped and gets
reverted and let's say you messed up me
like oh man it wasn't the right thing
that I wanted to do I could say rails D
which means rails destroy and then I say
scaffold and then after doing scaffold I
could come here and say photos and
automatically all the files that got
generated before get destroyed okay now
let's do it properly let's say rails G
and we're going to generate a scaffold
again but because we really want to do
like a block something very simple we're
gonna say let's a post okay plural and
then we're gonna come in and say title a
string description
and there you go automatically
everything guys you know ready and then
let's do the same thing that we did
before rate DB migrate okay so now we're
gonna come here and I'm gonna say post
automatically everything got generated
for us now you probably think hey I'm
seeing this this is just a blank page
that says post yes but now you're gonna
see the power from your rails bring this
down so you guys can see what's the
routes okay I'm gonna come in I'm gonna
say title I'm gonna say top ten
frameworks of 2018 I could come here and
say this is my list of all my favorite
frameworks okay
create a post and that's it
automatically we have our post setup so
as you can see it'll be like posts and
then has the ID and if we come back to
slash post I could see all the posts on
one page if I come here create another
one to say and top youtubers 2018 I come
here and say I love everybody
alright create post we go back and as
you can see we have that list and all of
this is already saved inside of the
database like now I mean this thing is
like super simple but you gotta think
about it like this everything that you
could think of everything that you could
think of it's pretty much a crud create
read update delete right let's say you
have an application that you're building
for doctors
and doctors need to be able to create
new files for their patients that's
creating the moment that they need to
see the pages from the other files for
the patients that's reading the moment
that they have to come in and change
like I say the patient says hey I moved
from you know Connecticut to New York
that's updating in the moment that the
patient says hey I want this to you know
be gone I don't want you to have my
information then that's called the
leading right so that's the crud any
application you could think of you're
always going to have to create read
update delete this is something that's
repetitive
through our web development like
constantly right so what's also cool
about this like I said everything got
generated for us okay so we can come
here and say hey you know this page
looks horrible I'm gonna fix this up so
what I could do is I could come here and
say I'm gonna go to assets all right I'm
gonna go to stylesheets and I'm gonna
come in here and I'm gonna say I want to
edit the H once so currently let me see
that's h1 yep so I can say I'm gonna run
sass so I can say body and then nest
inside of it h1 and I'm gonna say color
red font size to rim
let me see font weight 100 I don't even
know if this this fantastical 100 but
save that and we refresh the page and as
you can see automatically our CSS even
though we didn't sass it gets compiled
and we get to see everything now as far
as does this look like laravel no it's
actually opposite laravel looks like
rales Ruby on Rails came out first the
creator of PHP floppy HP but creative
laravel decided hey man this thing is
amazing what I'm gonna do is I'm going
to come in and basically copy it and
make it like you know a conversion a
translated version of Ruby on Rails but
for PHP that's it all right so it's
pretty easy pretty legit all this stuff
is already set up for you like I told
you you know you have your assets you
have your controllers if we go inside of
the controllers you can go in to post
that controller as you can see
everything is already set up for you you
know and the index page you do a post
that all finds all your post you know on
the Deaf show deaf show which is just
show the show page it basically it
displays all the different all the
different post by individual post okay
you got to create so all your
information is in here close up you can
put in different formats if you want to
do it that HTML that JSON let me see
what else you can update you could
delete you know all the cool stuff I
mean there's like a million things that
we could go over but I just wanted to
show you guys how easy it is to just
come in and just like spin up our
application all right now that's about
it is that easy
okay I mean there's a whole bunch of
stuff that we're doing on on the course
for Ruby on Rails but I really want you
guys to get used to you know the idea of
having to code in the backend like you
could come in and you know create the
most beautiful website but if that
website has no backend like it's pretty
much useless like you can't save to the
users information I mean sometimes you
can use third-party stuff like
you know CloudFlare or you know wasn't
uh CloudFlare what's the other one
the AWS one you could use stuff from
digital ocean like firebase yeah you
could use firebase to use that as a you
know as a back-end but that's like
hacking that's like hacking it for no
reason when you could create your own
back-end and you have control of it you
know what I mean so yeah man let me see
let me close this up so this was just a
quick demonstration show you guys like
what it is man you know you get a lot of
cool stuff that in reality is gonna take
you way longer so come in and you know
to build stuff you know so yeah man it's
boring
yeah man I mean if you if you don't like
to code it man
you know like I always say three nights
of programming of course it's gonna be
boring if you like to program then all
this stuff is cool man the the best
programming language out there for any
developer is really Ruby on Rails like
not Ruby on Rails Ruby just because it's
just so easy man like there's so many
things that you can do with it
that in other languages you have to go
in there and create like a whole bunch
of stuff like do a for loop to do or you
know a crazy nested loop like where Ruby
is just if you speak a video say is
boring to use firebase yeah firebase is
prettier I don't know I've never liked
it I've never liked firebase because it
seems like is good if you're like one
person right and you have a phone
application you what you're working on
and you're like man I don't want to deal
with the backend I just want to focus on
my iOS app
right it makes sense but if you're like
a developer like a you know front-end
developer and you like saying hey man I
just don't want to touch the backend you
sound crazy you know what I mean yeah
man I had to had to get a little haircut
you know what I mean so I had to man
your boy was woofing out here
I wanted to let my beard grow I've been
wanting to let my beard grow to like
down here for like a I don't know for
like five years but I haven't been able
to do it it's like it starts getting
itchy I'm like nah man cut that off real
quick yeah Ruby on Rails is legit man I
think everybody everybody should try it
you know what I mean like everybody I
think everybody should try at least once
so you can understand web development
man you know cuz it's the easiest way to
understand it you know especially coming
from somebody that doesn't know anything
like if you don't have knowledge of like
HTTP and you know the protocols have how
everything works like and you just focus
on just HTML CSS then you know you
you're gonna pretty much like miss out
on so much actually just you know came
in here randomly I was about to go to
sleep literally I was like man I'm about
to go to sleep I feel so tired today I
don't know why but I said you know what
let me come here come chill with you
guys I actually made a video on a new
program that I found that has been very
very useful and I think a lot of you
guys will be able to to use it get a lot
out of it so I made a video about that
right after I finish this video I'm
making a video about some portfolios
that people have been sending me and
I've been saving them you know everybody
that has sent me an email about their
portfolio if I haven't done them yet is
because I'm saving them for later on so
today I'm actually doing a couple of
those portfolios are reviewing them you
know it's just like you know I have to
take my time with it you know what I
mean I see using w3 school CSS in class
right now do you think bootstrap is
better I mean I don't know bootstrap
does the job if you're creating
something like let's say in an example
right let's say right now you have a
very good application that you want to
create right you're like man I have this
application I want to create before
anybody else creates it or you want to
create the the code base of the
application like let's say in the back
end but you don't have time to be like
oh I'm gonna design something i'ma come
in and and build something like this
isn't that like a framework like
bootstrap or even Beaumont IO or
semantic UI like those frameworks are
great for that you know what I mean cuz
it just helps you like those frameworks
you usually are use for coming in and
prototyping you know why are you
thoughts on CSS great I mean I have a
course on CSS grids on my website it's
pretty legit it's legit but I think
people are misusing it like people are
using CSS grids for things that they
don't need to use CSS grid you know what
I mean like you know there's certain
things like you have to go in there and
and try to remember order the new
properties from CSS grade right and I
see people wasting time taking them like
you know two days to build something
that could take them like 20 minutes
with just regular CSS and like you know
like setting up your layout like this
things like I look at a design and I
could look at the design and be like
okay I could use this year could use
float ciacco use flexbox here I can you
see a
gret here I could use different
techniques of CSS right but most people
that I'm seeing right now online and
like even youtubers they build in their
whole their whole pages with CSS great
or they're building their whole pages
with Flex boxes and it's like what was
the point of that especially because you
guys don't see the behind the scenes you
know what I mean like when I come in and
I make a video I don't do what most
people do what they do is they they
basically create the whole application
or the whole page itself on one side
right and then on this screen here the
one that you guys see you see them
coding and then on the screen right here
which is what you guys don't see is they
have the full complete course or the
full complete page and then what happens
is you might come in and you might be
taking a CSS great course or a CSS
whatever tutorial and you start seeing
the instructor come in and do everything
like like that that quick it's like oh
man he knows CSS greats like crazy but
what you don't see is the fact that this
guy took like two three hours setting
everything up for his whole layout to
work perfectly with CSS grids now
there's certain techniques in CSS that
you don't even have to think like it's
automatic you know what I mean like you
have a div here right let's say an
example a header and you know this
header let's say something is floating
that you want to float right that could
be they're floating and you just put in
the right position you fix it up
automatically and that could take you
two seconds to coding right but if you
start thinking oh you know what let's
start using Flex boxes in saline and CSS
grids for this little simple thing now
you're spending time looking at the
documentation looking at the the right
properties that you want to use looking
up do you want to use are you
flex and flex begin whatever like do you
want to use a fraction do you are a user
a percentage do you want to use a pixel
like there's so much stuff that people
just don't see and I think like once you
start playing around with it then you
start realizing like how long it takes
you you know what I mean it's the older
process easier and faster for you then
use it use your older process right like
for situations like pages that used to
do right most of the time whenever I
used to use bootstrap was just for the
grid meaning if I need something in
different columns like I would say okay
this columns gonna be like this is gonna
be 25% of the screen the middle column
is gonna be 50 the other column is gonna
be 25% that situation is perfect for CSS
grids all right but that doesn't mean
I'm gonna use CSS grids all over my
website no I'm just not gonna use it
like that
sorry yeah I'm over here eating freakin
some lemming stuff like lemon drop cuz
my throat is killing me but yeah man any
other questions man so do you think that
you should connect different ways for
Responsive layer seasons great flexbox
yeah think so I think this definitely
needs to be multiple ways of doing
things like doing it just one way
doesn't make sense you know like using
bootstrap just for the great currently
now since CSS grits came out makes no
sense but if you're using bootstrap for
all the other components that I already
did and like it already has like let's
say you want to create a quick
application you like your are just I
want to focus on the backend bootstrap
is perfect because you don't have to
worry about oh I'm gonna build a menu
I'm gonna build the styles for the forms
I'm gonna build the styles for this this
and that you know but it all depends on
the situation you know well if you're
gonna use it just for the grid don't use
the bootstrap no more like just use CSS
grids sorry I'm just reading everybody's
comments right now somewhere Road says
have been working on social media page
choice today really helping me to put
things in perspective I will so samos if
you can do the after you done with our
do the Saar project which is a building
a portfolio that you can use to build
your own portfolio where you can see
where all the different techniques that
I used to build our website I use you
know floats I use positioning I use CSS
grids and you will see what are the
right cases for them
Michael thank you thank you man thank
you for the motivation man no you guys
motivation you know you guys motivate me
any advice to a balanced learning this
different techniques and also applying
what you learned what I will say is
learn the basics of CSS you know what I
did in the social media course that I de
learning HTML CSS that's the basics of
CSS like you supposed to know that
people like I said people are thinking
that hate you're gonna throw away floats
in the air you're gonna throw away using
whips with percentages because you're
like oh you don't need this no more so
you just worry about flex boxes no you
still need those things because as a
developer you need to decide when is it
that you want to use those techniques
and when you want to use flex boxes and
when you want to use CSS grids and
whatever comes out next you know what I
mean two three years from now our new
property for CSS is gonna be added so
you got what I'm saying so just keep on
keep on freaking learning everything
that you need to learn you know what I
mean it's don't just stop and be like oh
I'm gonna just use this let me see you
rock on your face thank you thank you
guys
bootstrap four uses flex boxes yeah but
that's exactly what I told you guys it's
like every situation is different like I
found myself that using flex boxes and
certain situations when I want to
animate something doesn't work properly
flex boxes and like let's say you wanted
to do certain animations it just doesn't
work properly you know and I'm noticing
that too from CSS grids so it's like if
I know I'm gonna have to animate
something
I'm just not using those things
also too it's all about you know like
was fast for you you know what I mean if
you're gonna go in them like hey man I
gotta start looking at the documentation
of flex boxes and it's like a million
different properties and different
options that you can use just to align
something to the top right of the screen
it's like you get what I said like don't
even waste your time like and if you
know how to do it with a
position:relative or if you know how to
do it with you know float:right whatever
you know gets the job done that's it
they got the job done you know let me
see do you find Java or C++ useful in
what development nope I mean yesterday
we have Dave King who was telling us
that in Squarespace they use they use
Java for the backend I mean it could be
it could be useful but I just don't I
don't see it useful like every everyday
type thing you know what I mean
like it's cool for learning programming
I think you could have an easier way if
you know those languages then when you
start using something like JavaScript
you're like oh yes I know C++ is like
you know so JavaScript should be easy
what do you think about ionic is the
future with for example PWA mmm I mean
ionic spear and for a long time I mean
is it the future I mean they've been
here for no time I don't know if they're
the future you know what I mean I think
react native has a better better way of
doing things than ionic especially
because ionic uses angular like excuse
me angular is like annoying there's so
much stuff that you need to to learn
from angular like you know like
different V bind is maybe repine ng
Aptus ng that ng whatever ng your mama
I mean like you got you got to learn a
whole bunch of stuff man
scopes on ng scopes are freaking what
else and ng directives and orders crazy
stuff like it's a lot if you look at the
documentation of angular it's a mess -
it's like humongous it's like they put
so much features into that that
framework that is like is good to find a
job and stuff like that but to me
personally it's just so much work man
it's like you know I've been trying to
do the angular course but it's like it's
gonna be taking so long just to get it
done I'm like man I don't even want to
touch the angular app you know to create
that that course cuz I'm like man you
know like let's say Ruby on Rails Ruby
on Rails is fun right so I don't mind
spending two weeks working on a project
cuz you know even when people come in
here and tell me joke man - you know why
you quit coding I'm like bro I code
every week I code every single day cuz
all the stuff that I'm doing or the
tutorials or this courses I'm coding
constantly right so there's certain
things that I leave for last because I
just don't want to touch it
personally I don't want to do it now
Ruby on Rails is like I'm like great I
must spend the next two weeks doing Ruby
on Rails that's fine I don't mind it you
know the read wasn't a reactor no js'
course I'm really dragging my feet to do
it because it's like there's so much
that you have to teach the person you
know before they even start coding
anything that's useful you know so
that's the problem you know what I mean
so it's like for you to teach somebody
no Jes it's not like something like you
go come in and pick it up in one shot
which is why I tell people all the time
is that you're man
people think just because it's
JavaScript yes you know JavaScript but
you don't know no js' nodejs is deep it
has a lot of stuff and people think that
express is just no - yes
no Jes is different it has this a lot of
stuff that you gotta deal with you know
the file system the way how v8 engine
works like there's so much to it then
more than just the Xpress like every
tutorial that I see out there people
just talk about Express and it's like
expresses I kind of whack
it's like a pretty wack framework but
but that's my opinion you know what I
mean so yeah as far as like different
things like I'm definitely dragging my
feet to do that no js' course because I
don't really want to do it but I'm a toy
because people needed you know there
might be somebody who lives in the city
and might want to create something with
nodejs
you know what I mean but at the same
time man I don't know a wheel it right
now you know what I mean
let me see Kelvin Davis like yo you just
reminded me I need a shape-up word man
peace Joe what'd you think about Python
and Django
I think Python is a great language I
think Python for what it is is amazing I
think for all the things that you know
that they working on is like Jay I want
you guys to check out this kids on
channel he's doing some pretty cool
stuff technically I was supposed to do
our interview with him today
let me see and you know me man I'm
always I'm always supporting the new
people especially if they got good
quality it's like why wouldn't you want
to like you know work with them or why
wouldn't you want to promote their their
channel man so his name
John G Fisher he's been here a couple of
times on the channel he's actually one
of my subscribers and you know he
started he started his on his channel
and I think I was like the first
subscriber like you know today we're
gonna do like a little collaboration but
he got some some really cool stuff man
especially for you guys that that want
to get into Python so let me see I'm
gonna tell you right now he got one let
me share this I'm gonna share the screen
with you guys
he got a series on Python I mean I don't
think it's a series I think it's like
more like tutorials that he got it's
like this one's a J's like create a
neural network that classifies diabetes
risk in 15 lines of Python so what it
does it basically goes over the data you
know depending on the person's history
to see if they they have a risk of
getting on diabetes right and I think he
users tensor tensorflow I believe it's
tensorflow I think and basically he goes
over it and runs the code let me say
Mutis runs the code and automatically at
the end it tells you like how you know
what what are the the chances of you
actually getting diabetes you know and I
mean I was in the full video but it's
very interesting you know I definitely
think that what he got is something
legit so Brawl see if maybe link up with
him you know cuz I've done
Python I've done Python but Python for
you know web development which is what I
tell you guys all the time like my
skills in 99% of the time it's all about
web development you know I haven't
really gone deep into like machine
learning I haven't gone deep into you
know like big data and like trying to
figure out things from just from data
like that's not really where where I'm
at you know what I mean I got I focused
on one thing which is web development
but if you guys are interested on that
check out his channel his channel is
John G Fisher check him out man supposed
to do a live video with him at 7 o'clock
maybe I should take a little a little
nap now and you know just chill out for
a little bit before I hang out with him
you know but you know me man I could be
here all day I wouldn't do a 24 hour
live stream man see how it goes man 24
hours of coding phase man don't be crazy
though right
24 hours are just like walking around
talking all day you guys see me wake up
freaking go to sleep have it 24/7
okay listen I think my celery garlic
Novecento pays important Kassadin who
treat me the savage sue sue mainland
yeah yeah you ladies are thirsty but I'm
monitoring be what I made you to be
there ChIP chip chip chip chip sorry
about that my mom hanging me up gotta
check up on mom dukes you know what I
mean but yeah man it's a quick little
livestream with you guys man
yeah 24 hour livestream man
probably hear me snoring a sign I want
to do that I wanna I don't know if I
should do that like late night a 24 hour
livestream yeah
yeah Matthew Smith man you got it
you got a freakin how you call this you
gotta actually I don't know man
I will say you gotta figure it out like
I told you you gotta go line by line you
when it comes to JavaScript you got a
debug every line you gotta go line by
line and figure out where was it that I
broke you know cuz at some point it was
working so if it was working before then
you got a go line by line and figure out
what was it that you added that actually
made a break
you know multitasking kids live
streaming's answering emails you know me
man you know people sending me the
portfolio's okay see what they got
but yeah man
damn hello from Iraq for real
Iraq now you lie Manny what the hell you
doing in Iraq you Araki how does it I
repeat you Ricky I don't know the same
or you like in the army try to build a
site in 24 hour stream like an
e-commerce or something call it all Joel
24 Joe 2400 24 yeah you guys are crazy
what should one do between courses
basically try to build it yourself
whatever course that we did try to build
your your own thing Eric key okay Eric
key that's what's up man
shout out more people from Iraq wiing
here man I hope you safe I hope you good
you know what I'm saying
I'm sure if you answer this already but
how long do you need to learn Ruby on
Rails to get a remote job I mean there's
really not a date guys like distinct I
always tell this to people there's not a
time on this thing you know what I mean
it's not like hey man it took me four
months to learn this right it's not
about that it's like do you have the
projects that is gonna get you hired you
know what I mean it all depends how long
it takes you to build those projects if
you go hard and you come in and build
like five solid full-stack projects
right in one month and you could do it
meaning you work full-time in your house
knocking that out by the end of the
month you're gonna get hired that's it's
that simple now if you go and
procrastinate in black oh yeah
I'm gonna take some tutorials and then
I'm gonna work on a project you know one
day of the week and that project is
gonna take you you know if you was
working full time on it it's gonna take
you eight to seven days so that project
is gonna take you eight weeks if you do
one hour or like if you could yeah if
you do one hour per day or one hour per
week I'm sorry so it's like it's all up
to you you have to really go in and bust
your ass and just work man
honestly I thought I was doing this
longer until I saw the first thing I
ever signed into was starting October if
you do eight hours a day seven days a
week for the three months that I've been
doing it KMC anyone knows how to install
nodejs on an Android phone I mean
there's probably somebody out there then
also how to do it you better be
self-motivated and free from
distractions to work remote wants to
learn how to work remote deal with
people up work but also to you can find
clients like let's say check on
Craigslist right check on Craigslist
there's people that want websites right
they're like man I need a website for my
music site I need a website for my pics
areia I need a website for whatever
right if you come in and you you contact
them and tell them hey man I want I want
to you know build your website I live in
Montana but you live in New York and you
want to freaking do their website just
tell them like hey man I couldn't do it
from my house I can get you the website
as soon as possible and I'll charge you
less than what somebody that is gonna be
charging you that that lives over there
in New York City so you know it's like
that's how you get like good clients
online you know what I mean
what should I learn
after HTML CSS JavaScript jQuery and
Ruby on Rails
I mean it's after that it's not really
about learning after that is about
building projects you know sorry to like
keep on repeating this but you know
don't fall into that world of just
learning and learning and learning and
learning no guys try to find something
be like okay cool I'm gonna start
building all my projects right that's
what I want to do you know so that's
what you guys should she started looking
into Joe is it possible to free no Joe
is possible freelancer can get the same
salary as much as a regular job yes it's
possible I know people that make even
more money than that then somebody who
works full-time but you gotta be
somebody who's no you know what I mean
like now to put myself out there but if
like somebody comes up to me like I say
a company and be like hey man we want
you to work on this this and that and
you know whatever right I could put out
there and be like listen man I have a
very popular YouTube I have a very
popular website for me to take my time
out of here and work on your project
then I have to make more money than I'm
making over there so in a situation like
that they will pay me more than somebody
who's getting the job regularly you know
going in nine to five you get what I'm
saying is the same thing as guys that
like the guy who created Redux right I
think his name is like Dan Abramov or
something like that he's got basically
hired by Facebook I'm pretty sure he
makes more money than somebody who just
came into Facebook because he has a very
popular library and he's like a very
well-known developer you know what I
mean like it's all about your resume you
know so if he was to get hired by a
company remotely he could come in and be
like hey man I need to make 200 grand
and if they really want him then
pay him the 200 grand which is like pain
to two salaries for one person so he
could do it do you think learning data
structures data structures is always
important algorithms I think is
important but it all depends on what is
it that you're going to do you get what
I'm saying like I don't know how to
explain it sometimes but I think people
spend so much times in algorithms
instead of building things like I know
people that be like I could solve any
algorithm you could give me but you ask
them hey what have you worked on they'll
be like nothing they've never worked on
anything meaning meaningful anything
that you could be like oh it's worth
anything like let's say so what's the
point of you saying hey I could you know
solve every algorithm out there inside
okay cool
you have great memory you it's like you
know people that come in and tell you
hey man I could solve the Fibonacci
sequence or you know where my eyes
closed yeah because you already
memorized how to do it you spend so much
time on memorizing things instead of you
actually coming in here and and bumping
into our new problems right because it's
like let's say you know whatever Publix
or tree sorting whatever right if you
remember if you remember those those
aren't sequences right you come in and
and you try to remember how to solve
those problems every single day of
course you're gonna be good at it and of
course you're gonna solve it right but
at the end of the day what have you
built you get what I'm saying I was like
telling Dave shank yesterday about that
because I think in a lot of companies
that that do that they'll be like oh we
gotta do a whiteboard interview and
we're gonna put somebody to to the test
and it's like is dumb because number one
you kind of miss out on a lot of people
who are talented and
are better than people who actually come
in and remember every algorithm like you
could go to a job interview and just
spend so much time remembering how to
solve something and remember every
single algorithm that they can throw at
you and yes you could get hired but
you're not except you're not as
experienced as a developer who has a
bunch of applications done it's like you
can't even compare that like I've seen
that happen all the time
you know I've seen it happen like two
people that just graduated from college
and like they could come in and be like
oh yeah it's like I went to this
prestigious School but you know they
have nothing to show for no projects no
nothing except like oh I could solve
algorithms oh I went to the school
whatever but then at the end of the day
when you come in and you tell okay cool
can you build this application it's like
now you gotta train them for like three
months until they actually good so it's
like you gonna say like I'd rather just
have somebody who has a lot of
experience and don't know any algorithms
I mean all of us know algorithms some
type of algorithms but I'd rather hire
somebody who comes in with a full
portfolio of like a whole bunch of
different applications which means I can
throw anything at him instead of relying
on the idea of like oh this person is
good at taking tests you know cuz that's
what it comes down to I've met people
who are super smart but they can't you
know they either get nervous they go
blank in an interview they they forget
things but that doesn't mean that
they're not smart they're not you know
they can't solve the problem you know so
see a lot of
looks required to offer a reference to
your work that's why the portfolio of
work is here is everything even if the
designer website is made up they want to
see what you can do yep
I met said we spend most of the time
debugging and breaking our heads against
other people call communicating with
others collaborating doing things on
time estimating like that let me
see happy Monday brother word avi do
says in high school I make only
algorithms yeah I mean it all depends
where you at man
but I will say try to focus on building
applications build something you know
build an application for doctors build
an application for inventory you know if
you like sneakers build a website that
sells sneakers if you like you know you
like sneakers and you say ok I'm gonna
build something in the backend that
keeps track of the inventory for a store
like those things a company looks at it
and but I all cool this first thing is
like ready to work if you come to me and
be like hey man throw me you know I've
seen situations where we were
interviewing people and people would
they like you know I remember seeing
this kid like right before the interview
and like as we walk in him - to the room
where we're gonna interview him he's
like going over a piece of paper where
he has all the different type of
algorithms right and I guess in his head
is like oh they're gonna give me some
algorithms and you know go in there and
I'm explaining how to sort this tree how
to sort this bubble how to sort your
momma right so so he's like going over
the paper like nervously like okay as
we're walking he's like this walking and
like going over the paper and I
like this kid is like straight out of
college like I could tell he's straight
out of college so whatever after we
interviewing him and when I okay cool so
can we go over your your projects on
github and the things that you've done
and all of the projects that he had were
like dumb stuff like really dumb stuff
like things that you see on tutorials
that people put in like that makes no
sense that I think to me makes no sense
like you know like let's say he I
remember this he had like a project
where it was like you can throw in like
I say essay right you have an essay and
then his project it was done I thinking
in Python it basically goes over the
whole essay and finds and finds like
whatever word you put in so you could
say find a word car right and we look
into the whole file and find how many
times the word car got used and I think
that's cool that's fine there's like a
cool little trick you show your your
best friend it's like hey man you want
to know how many words how many times
you use what or how many times you use
but on your on your freakin essay this
is cool and it's like to me is a waste
of time because if you go into a
position of a web development how about
having some websites you get what I'm
saying
like you want to come in and look like a
superstar you don't want to come in and
look like you're a beginner you know but
that's my opinion
you know some people might look at it
but oh no this is great you know you
know how to do some algorithms you know
how to sort through you know all the
different type of texts and you know put
things into order and tell you how many
times I got used it's like we could see
how logistically he eat things and it's
like those things are cool but it's like
Lodge like logistically for me
it's like I need somebody who's gonna
hit the ground running when I'm working
in a company I don't need you to come in
and ask me every question every single
time you go what I'm saying like that's
what happens with those people like
they've never used web frameworks
they've never used anything like they
come from like a computer science major
and like a lot of them never really look
into the web but they have like the
foundations of computer science which is
good but at the same time it's like if
you're not doing software and you're
doing web like you should try to learn
things from the web and you should try
to build projects for the web instead of
just doing like little things like that
you know what I mean so yeah like the
basics of algorithms I'm not saying like
don't learn algorithms my point is don't
spend like hours and hours and hours
like you know I've seen channels here on
YouTube that be like oh man let's go
spend time on Co worse I was at Cold
War's calm or let's go freaking go spend
time on or on whatever website that that
asks you to sort out it's like hey could
you tell us how many times the the
letter e got used in this paragraph like
you're wasting so much time and it's
like people don't even have any projects
on their portfolio and they aren't you
know on YouTube channels like that or
websites like that like you're wasting
your time like build stuff like that
really matters that's gonna get you
hired because as a junior developer you
want to show that you're more than what
somebody is expecting from you
getting to blockchain I mean I would say
going to getting a degree you know I
think it will definitely I feel like it
would be so much better for you but yeah
man I'm about to start heading out kids
all right I just came by show you guys
some little cool stuff and talk to you
guys for a little bit all right
I'm out of here see boy joke back at it
again coding fees.com
go check out the website go check out
the Ruby on Rails course guys is legit
we working on a lot of cool stuff so
yeah see boy Joe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
