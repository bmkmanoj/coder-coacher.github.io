thought I was doing bad for a second and
that's that yo you know I'm sorry that
you know the quality is not that great
the audio might not be great man but I
would probably got to do another video
about this but this is just how I feel
right now at this moment yeah okay so
for the past few months I've been doing
YouTube and I've been noticing on my man
I understand why I'm not growing like
you know I see some other youtubers who
are just blowing up and like and I'm
like I know I'm doing everything right
I'm dropping constant content all day
I'm fucking creating cool courses I'm
creating cool content for people people
are relating to me whenever I go live a
whole bunch of people come show up when
our freakin drop a video I get a bunch
of comments but then I'm like men
why is my channel not growing like some
other peoples and I'm like what's going
on what is it that I have to change what
is it that I have to do all right great
listen to this so um this whole time
like man I must suck of something cuz
I'm not doing good you know I'm seeing
people gain this crazy numbers and
subscribers and I'm like y'all they've
been here for like a year bum like I've
been here for you know half of the time
that they've been here and then some
other people have been here for three to
four years and I'm like now they blowing
up they're getting you know like hundred
thousand subscribers and I'm like their
channels is not that great how is it
that people are finding them right
then I get I get that cool I get that
cool I get that contact all right I get
contacted and somebody comes to me and
tells me hey Joe we love your channel we
will promote your channel we will get
you to the next level and then the
person comes tells me hey we actually
been doing it for this this and this and
this other youtuber so other people that
I've been like oh shit man you know like
I need to get today to the next level
all these fucking people have been
paying for this shit like and I know it
was it was weird because when you search
web developer there's only a handful of
people that get shown right or whenever
you search in JavaScript or whatever
there's a few people right so then like
how is it that these people are getting
you know $30 and $50 and $100 and
subscribers and I'm like we're doing the
same type of videos and we're supposed
to show we show up at the same videos
that they show up it just didn't make
sense
but now the boiling guy we don't got the
plug man we don't got that plug for the
low low if you know what I mean
but it's just funny to me cuz I'm like
man I was really kicking myself I'm like
man I don't know what I'm doing wrong
I'm like I'm doing everything right and
I'm like wait dude came through and was
like yo listen it was like a email that
I don't even check and then I'm like yo
it doesn't make sense that me with
a views as this other people do I get or
sometimes even more and then I like fit
subscribers 100,000 subscribers 37
thousand subscribers right so it didn't
make sense and I'm like there's
something wrong with this system right
and now I know those be paying for
promotion those be paying for promotions
and in groups they pay for promotion and
in fucking Facebook they pay for
promotion on on YouTube and it's like
that shows me like I'm doing fucking
amazing because if I'm fucking pumping
the same views in the same fuckin in
even more I'm just saying
and for all you guys man you know the
real cash Darrell um you know tough
candy y'all doing good your boy
Christian y'all doing good you know Eric
y'all doing good because a lot of these
people who you think like man how are
they doing they that she just made my
day
like I could literally go in and be like
okay cool I'm about to start paying my
sick to pay my share to get my promo
right but in my head I'm like man I'm
fucking killing the game right now
because it's like I'm doing the same I'm
pumping the same numbers that this dues
is doing we're a hundred thousand
subscribers right imagine me with a
hundred if I got a hundred thousand
subscribers right now
on the low-low great just a hundred
thousand two hundred thousand eyes right
on me it's a rat I'm letting you know
right now it's a wrap like straight up
it's a fucking wrap because it's a hit
and I was just like man that shit just
made my day man when dude was like oh
yeah we do this channel we do this
channel we do this program or this
programmer like oh okay I see how it is
they've been got the cheat codes man you
know what I mean like didn't make sense
when you go to social play then you
start looking at the channels I'm like
wait what happened here that this shit
just went up you know what I mean and
it's like us the real YouTube is the
dudes that's here pumping content and
putting in you know I was sweat into
this shit we like getting the same views
we gain the senses you know a little bit
of fucking
people that many fucking subscribers it
does YouTube don't show when it comes to
what development and technology it does
they don't show that many those videos
to everybody to the general population
so for you to be able to be shown to
people who are not specifically
searching for web developers you have to
be like grey in the fucking face right
you have to be paying for that shit
and I'm like oh I so now she Mason you
know they got the cheat code man they
press
sorry to
yeah it is
now it's not a right it's just funny
this
like come on check the number ones on
this shit
it's mean Krishan and I love everybody
here I love everybody that's doing it
but you know right now number one number
two is like that me and Chris song right
now we battle it for that number one
spot
because if you're buying subscribers and
you buying views you don't matter you
know what I mean so that's what that's
what I'm saying right now though to me
that's very exciting because now I get
more motivated my whole word
doodles already got the cheat codes
dude's got the cheat codes here on
YouTube man it makes sense there's no
way is like Reina when I drop a video I
get at least 35% to 40% of my subscriber
base to watch the videos right and then
it doesn't make sense that if you have a
hundred thousand subscribers how is that
you only get one percent that'll make
sense if you got 40,000 subscribers how
the hell you only gain 2,000 views it
doesn't make sense
so it's like now we got him you know
what I mean so on the low-low I could be
number one out here
I could literally be number one out here
now we gotta do this on steroids
you know what I mean now we gotta test
we gotta test Christian we gotta test
Christian see if he's on steroids that's
my boy yo that's it man
I took the fucking crown you know what I
mean
shoutout to my people that you know yeah
I was here from the beginning we got the
crown we bringing it back to the hood
[Laughter]
you know what I mean like it's a rap we
found out we found out is this is like
the fucking The Wizard of Oz and you
look behind the fucking curtain now I
wasn't talking about Christian that's my
boy I'm saying in general like these
fucking people out here doing the cheat
codes pumping steroids steroids on the
subscribers man you know it ain't kind
of it made me feel a certain way where I
was like man there's something weird
going on man
because I know I'm busting my ass I know
I'm doing a lot of work and then a
couple of those is just dropped one
video and shit go viral I'm like wait
wait wait a minute they got the cheat
codes they press left right left right
right one r1 r2 l1 l2 triangle square
fucking unlimited subscribers
oh man and then I was like you know what
man
maybe I should just fuck up the game and
just flood it what if I just decided to
be like yeah you know what I'm a
flooding I'm gonna throw $5,000 into
this let's flood it out semester you
know mess with their head throw $5,000
that ain't nothing to me
I'll throw five g's right now and be
like yo let's see what happens let's
make this shit to a million subscribers
but it's just funny to me cuz I'm like
man now I feel good man now I feel like
I know I got the crown on on this shit I
know I got this crown already what the
fuck 84 is like what the fuck just
happened
holy shit Joe broke the internet there
is a moment kids there's that moment
there's that moment you know you start
looking around you be like yo you
remember where you was at with Joe found
out this is like 9/11 this is like you
know your kids is gonna be telling that
story but like you're my dad was at work
when Joe found out you know like shit
it's a real moment right now kids
oh man there's a moment kids we're going
and hard this year man you know this is
just validating me you know cuz it's
like you know when you do a lot of work
but you like man I don't know if I'm I'm
doing a good I don't know what's going
on I'm not getting you know that's like
that's like when Kanye found out the
other day like Beyonce Beyonce is out
here not going to awards unless she wins
it so then they fucking him up cuz
they're like you know they gotta give
the word to beyond saying even though
Kanye deserved it you know that's that's
the type of shit that's happening right
now right now is like hey man there's a
reason why niggas that's I'm going to
honey but it's just funny to me man this
is like one of those moments man there's
like one of those moments man when I
just enjoy when I'm like okay cool we
found out if for those of you guys that
down here that I just got here
you know I've been saying for a while
I'm like man I understand why YouTube
not throwing no love to me you know I've
been busting my ass working hard you
know I do my videos I hang out with
people I actually do innovative shit
that people copy and it's just been like
man I should be like I've you know at
least 50 right now at least 50 all right
so I'm like there's something going on
and I'm just like I might work
it's like 317 somebody sends me an email
like y'all
we like your channel we like what you're
doing we got this promotion for you you
know we do this for this person for this
person for this person for this person
then I go to the page and I see all of
them they're promoting the shit out of
it and I'm like oh word it's like the
cheat codes dudes getting the cheat
codes out here dudes don't want to work
hard those do not want to work hard at
all man you know what I'm saying they
want everything like instant instant
instant gratification where it's like
okay who's getting the most views who's
getting the most subscribers who who's
getting the most attention on YouTube
was getting the most of this right and
it's like man for the people like us
Casa Darrow tough put on I keep saying
tough cookie
tough candy Chris Sean you know Eric and
shit there's this other kid man I forgot
but there's a couple of people here man
you know and a lot of you guys too that
are thinking like oh I should start a
new channel man dudes out here got the
cheat codes man dudes out here is paying
for it they don't want to do the work
they got the stimulus package right now
you know what I'm saying like we working
hard we we know what it is to to go and
get stuck at and 500 at that 500 level
where YouTube don't want to put you past
that and and you barely get past that
and then once you get past that they
give you a little bump next thing you
know you're like at the 1500 mm mark
then they start slowing you down then I
you guys been doing good but that's all
you're gonna get
you gotta get a video that's viral all
right a video a viral that is gonna get
you 50,000 100,000 views
so for you to get that you actually cut
either do some crazy shit promote the
shit out of it or for some reason get on
ready and show up on the top of the page
right which most likely it won't happen
because you know how some people will be
hanging the shadow other people's on
already so what's the best option now
you got like Facebook now you got other
blogs will you come in you're like hey
man here's some money they got like half
a million's you know half a million
likes half a million fucking fanbase a
million fanbase and then I don't know
where they put you there and I'm like
okay I see how it is you know what I
mean
so it was like oh king you know so it's
like right now I know I already got the
crown though cuz I'm like worried I did
so much work and I knew there was
something that was like the certain
limit that you can't pass and I'm like I
don't have no stimulus package I don't
have no viral fucking pose I don't have
no viral reddit account I don't have
none of that shit I have me I have
myself you know hard work like I always
save me hard work pays off at the end
and then I'm just like man this is funny
to me
I'm serious don't man do this out here
you know like I don't know man like
that's like you know I don't know that's
like a freaking I don't even know how to
describe it how to describe the feeling
of it the feeling of like you busting
your ass and you like you know you doing
shit right
but shit is not coming to you and you're
like man I should be beyond where I'm at
right now cuz I've been doing a lot of
work and I know how the internet works I
know what people like I know the type of
person I am that anybody who watches me
that's it they're instantly attracted
either they gonna hate or they gonna
love me automatically there's no middle
ground right but I don't get shown to
those you know new subscribers new
people and I'm like wait now this should
make sense people got the stimulus
package people got the steroids they got
the same shit the Armstrong guy they
gave them that little bump you know what
I mean
everybody want that juice well you know
this a video this is a good video that I
found online then I'm gonna post it up
later on today where it says you know a
lot of people get the juice right you
get that juice but you don't got that
sauce when you got that sauce that's
just stays there when you got that juice
is like you who got the juice real quick
that's just gone it's like you know it's
like when you you I'm playing Super
Mario right and you jump look cut the
star
you caught the star real quick give you
a little head start right but now she's
gonna get crazy because if your boy yeah
this is just funny to me I'm sorry guys
I'm making this shit you know I'm making
this shit just just to be funny but the
whole point of the video is that your
boys been killing out here and I wanted
to say thank you to everybody that's
been here since the beginning
you know those days I was like man on
earth I'm a continuing boy listen I
don't know if I should do this thing you
know what today was proven that your boy
got the crown out here like from now on
a lot of this little little no loot
right little bro all these little kids
man they gotta go like this you know
give them the salute I'm just saying
they gotta give the boy this look like
especially now like if I wanna man I
kind of feel like doing it but I don't
know if I'm gonna do it
if I go in I drop five stacks it'll be a
wrap I don't care I'll drop five stacks
for the next six months every five and
every month I'll throw in twenty five
hundred dollars into it for six months
straight then you see your boy half a
million subscribers you know I'm just
saying I'm a numbers type of guy man and
I respect people you know not only by
the numbers but who they are and the
type of people that they are but at the
same time it's like you know something
validates you they're like okay you got
this much he got this much but then when
you find out that's like man it's like
it's like Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa
out here this dudes is over here hitting
that shit through the neck like whoa
so game your boy King Philippe is like
yo it's a game bro nothing we're all
trying to win now even Gary we be
pumping that shit it's just you know I
guess I'm from the I'm from the error of
like hard work where you know you wanna
you want to get to certain places by the
work that you put in it's like today
somebody told me hey Joe I want to
donate you some money throw some money
at you
I said now don't do that I want to earn
it go to coding phase comm sign up for
the subscription
let me do tutorials and videos and give
you good content for that money don't
give it to me just to give it to me let
me earn it right
let me just earn it so a lot of these
people don't want to earn it
that's why I was like man how the fuck
is this chaos I mean you guys should
know some kid who's not a fucking
developer how is he charging people five
hundred dollars per session when it
doesn't make sense but when you inflate
your numbers then as are you as a viewer
you'll be like oh this person got a
hundred thousand subscribers and he's
this isn't that he must be a logistic a
fucking legit developer but when you
find out this kid
he hasn't even finished college he's
never worked in his own life and you're
like there's something wrong with it you
know what I mean it just I don't know I
like people who work hard that's why I
like Chris Sean and I can his movement I
like what he does I like the real castle
Darrow people dropping good content
people dropping good shit here on
YouTube shit that's different people
that's not copying each other you know
and that's what I'm gonna continue
throwing their names out there you know
even if I if I come in I start hitting
the juice tool I'm still gonna pump them
up no matter what cuz I want them to
grow and get bigger than where they're
at right now because they deserve me you
know what I mean so it's like a lot of
these guys who have 40 50 a hundred
thousand subscribers they looked at us
who are branding their own brand new
youtubers they're like oh you guys only
got like five hours and subscribers you
only got 8,000 subscribers I'm not gonna
do no no collaborations with you guys
you guys don't barely have any views
yeah you fucking dickhead because you've
been fucking puppet that shit through
your neck Nick I'm just saying I'm out
fuck it take
just get tight at the fact that people
instead of being positive and being just
real there man fake and then on top of
that they act like they all of that and
I'm like bro if you think the little
money that you got you can fuck with the
kick
I couldn't literally start going like yo
spend $5,000 every fucking month just to
mess your whole shit up for being a
snake and I'll let you eat after that
you know what I'm saying
man I think I think I'm - I'm - her
finish some somebody left a comment the
other day is like man I love the fact
that he's so good man I don't try to be
hood guys I I just I try to be nice and
you you guys know me it's just like man
when people front on you and then you
find out that that the reason that they
were throwing on you is because you
basically don't have as many views or
subscribers as dumped and then from
there after that they come to you and
you find out that they don't even have
that many subscribers you know what I'm
saying like they buying shit man I put
in work for this shit you know what I
mean
just swagging it out here man I'm just
saying though I cook up a walk on the
grass kick that's how I do it I walk in
my own grass shit man I'm just saying
man it's hilarious man that's what I'm
saying King flip that look that's
another thing man your boy can flip his
channels legit right his channel I'm not
even lying his channel supposed to be
out there YouTube supposed to be
promoting the shit on his channel
because he got good content but when you
find out that it's not even about
counting anymore it's about who's
pumping the juice right now then it kind
of disappoints you you're like man the
game is fucked up that's what I'm saying
can't flip the drop in that shit
everybody should be subscribed to that
kid
but you know how the world is voice oh
yeah we got the juice kid you
little baby out honest a fairly those
problems I'm just saying though man
that's the future that's Ethan okay baby
Kenji
yeah just connected to the Wi-Fi right
now it's connecting right now reconnect
it oh there you go now y'all get to see
a boy in HD such a boy out here live
from the credit a handle with it
what happened to the main site the main
site is put on hold like I told you guys
I'm taking this shit to the next level
main size is put on hold because number
one nobody was posting anything that's
number one right number two I basically
say you know what I'm going to pay
somebody to finish coding phase calm how
I want it because I don't have the time
but your boy got the money to pay
somebody else so that's what I'm gonna
do so that's the idea behind it right
I'm gonna pay somebody else you know I
got myself a little a little Indian team
you know shoutout to my Indian peoples
you know I'm throwing that to them so
I'm just saying you know
main site is on hold we got coding phase
comm where I'm gonna put all my free
courses there which is exactly what I
want to do with this channel more I
wanna have YouTube for what YouTube is
for for advice advice just regular rants
you know me shit that you could enjoy my
opinions what else
tutorials but all the courses all my the
courses and tutorials that I put in a
lot of hours into I'm putting them on my
website I'm not even gonna give it to
YouTube no more because you two don't
even show my my videos on the top pages
I don't when I drop a tutorial so
there's no point on me putting it there
so it never gets found so now I will put
on my website where I can promote my own
website and say hey go to coding phase
calm because most people go there you
know what I mean so now it's all about
the courses and the free courses in the
premium courses people decide what you
want to take you know I know people be
freaking signing up on some real estate
man people becoming tomorrow at my
channel you know they come here on the
low-low
and be like hey we like them but we're
gonna give them a dislike look it's like
some people they expect you to be
talking just about code I can't be a
robot man I can't just talk about code
that's why it's a YouTube channel a
YouTube channel supposed to be it's
supposed to be like you know as YouTube
you share your opinion share your life
share you know certain shit but people
expect us to be like PR tutorials and
I'm like y'all go to coding face.com
that's what all the tutorials is gonna
be if you just want you know technical
stuff that's where everything is gonna
be technical when it comes to youtube we
in here doing crazy shit dad you know
we're like Oh
got down dad hit with the juice you know
I've loved life man I hit him with it
yeah so that man yeah so the whole drive
from from work to the house yeah so
little baby Kenji yeah so wifey
man I'm just developer man I'm just a
real developer I'm just somebody who's
here enjoy himself when you two right
now for the people that be like oh man
he's not technical enough this coding
face.com go to kono phase comm you're
gonna get free tutorials free courses
you're gonna get premium courses for the
ones that take me 8 hours 10 hours 20
hours to make those somebody gotta get
paid for that cuz 20 hours is 20 hours
kids the ones that take me 2 hours free
free courses automatically
yeah that's what I'm saying word we
doing this shit laughs that's what I'm
saying I'm the first one to do this man
man the first one do anything I'm
abusing the life I think I feel like I
abused the life feature like it's like
hey I got the what developers lunch
break right then I come home some days
are doing what I'm driving then I have
the late-night which people love the
lateness because we just hang out so say
we got a squad man you get money doing
live videos though sometimes because
sometimes they don't even do
monetization with a monetized station on
it when it's live you know so that's
just how it is man I don't even know do
you guys see commercials when y'all
watch my live videos I always wanted
that back because I've never seen a
commercial on a live video that's what
I'm saying
mr. Darrow man you gotta go live I'm
just saying man I live a hike man you
know I might and all day people people
act like I'm not people act like I'm not
a real developer but it's like I live
like I'm like you know what I mean like
if I wasn't I don't know what job will
pinion this much you know if I wasn't
good I don't know what will pay me this
much to do it
oh you got a survey okay
were sad its k cashing in on them since
it's Portland all that sense but hey
guys I love you guys man but the the
moral of the story is we found out we
found out that they're scheming it we
found out that the people who who was
frightened of us in the beginning and
now that we surpassed them we found out
they'd taken the stimulus package
straight to the neck you know what I
mean like getting that plug right there
into the neck you know paying for
subscriptions on fucking subscribers
paying for views so it's like now we
know that's what I'm saying now we know
now we know who who's out here doing the
thing
who's out here just faking it faking it
for you too we know now no Eric is one
of us Eric is one of us that is out here
putting in real content real work and
YouTube don't put don't promote them and
it's because the way how YouTube's
algorithm is you gotta have one video
that's viral right you gotta have a
video you either gotta be poppin on on
my Nicholas like ready you gotta be
poppin or Facebook you gotta be popular
on Twitter you gotta be poppin somewhere
right where you gonna get a lot of use
there then YouTube is gonna look at that
and then say okay this this is the video
that everybody is watching so let's
bring it up to the top so when they
bring you up to the top on YouTube then
now you get all the subscribers because
