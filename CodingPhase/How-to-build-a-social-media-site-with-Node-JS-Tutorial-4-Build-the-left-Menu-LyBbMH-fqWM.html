we're going to break down this design
into multiple sections so first of all
what we're going to do before that
because I realize this color with a
white background doesn't make this stand
out so much so what we're going to do is
when I go to gradients and I want you
guys to look for the purple berry
purple berry I think that's the name I
don't know I really love purple for some
reason but it actually works you got two
good gradients that could work which
would be this one that's right here or
this purple berry will be perfect for
the application so we're going to come
here put this here okay
we're going to take
one copy it put it at the end paste it
there and there you go now we're gonna
copy this never copy the one that says
filter that's always gonna give you
issues so don't copy it copy everything
besides that and then replace what we
had with what we have now and then there
you go
see now the white really stands out okay
so let's get started first of all we're
gonna create three sections it's gonna
be one section here a section here and
one section here so let's do that now
I'm gonna come here close up all of
these because we don't need them no more
okay so we have our app container
I mean delete everything side move this
outside okay select all and now in here
we're gonna create multiple sections so
first of all we're going to say section
section ID and the ID that we're gonna
put in we're gonna say left menu
section okay we're gonna copy and paste
this a couple of times we're gonna call
this one content area and then this is
gonna be messenger okay we're gonna save
that alright so there you go
now here we're gonna break this down
into sections okay here we're gonna have
a logo section okay and then we're gonna
break it down to let's say groups you're
gonna call it groups for now okay so
let's do this right now
one side of this when I say div class
account okay or count drop down alright
breaking this down by section so we got
a logo of the website then the name of
the account and then the icon okay so
we're gonna basically create three
there's certain different dibs I say div
or we could do you just use Emmet and
you see diff and put in logo copy this a
couple of times okay so we got the flow
go Dave
name and then icon okay so there you go
now the next thing that we're gonna do
got this div here make sure we got that
section okay so after the account drop
down okay after that count drop down
we're going to create the groups so I'm
gonna say div class and let's say groups
yeah groups and in the groups we're
gonna have a title and then the group
now
Euler we gotta come here and say group
are you gonna say they've title okay put
in a title here and be lower we're gonna
put in a ul and then some allies okay
so let's say link link link save that
okay we have everything they're gonna
make sure we have this like this put in
logo so put logo here let's say Joe
Santos okay icon just put an icon now
let's come here and let's look at this
so we have app container okay we got the
sections so what we're going to do is
we're going to go to the CSS on their
app container we're gonna come here and
we're gonna say display grid let's save
that okay and then we're
to basically say grid template columns
and we're going to do something like 15%
and then 30% we're gonna say 65% and
then we're gonna add 20% to the last
column okay so that's going to do if we
right-click this and inspect it is going
to make three columns one that's gonna
be 20% while 15% another one that's
going to be 65% and then the last one
which is for the message is going to be
20% of the way
okay so gonna go like that then becomes
smaller as you resize the screen but
we'll worry about that later on
okay for now let's just finish doing
this thing okay so first of all we have
the logo icon here so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to go to font awesome go
to icons okay I'm just going to put in T
I'm gonna choose this even though this
is not the the icon for toku we're just
gonna use this one okay copy this we're
gonna paste this inside where it says
logo alright
whistles getting started okay woof
we'll CSS we're gonna copy this and
we're gonna go to the main that s CSS
we're gonna come here and right below
this we're going to add left menu and
account drop-down and then the logo so
we will say left menu okay
I say account drop-down and then after
that we're gonna put in logo and then
for the logo we're going to come here
and put in the logo of what was it that
we had fao FS how the class started fa
feet fa b actually fa b so used to the
old school font awesome but there was
just FS or fa now is fa b they want to
be bougie all right okay so we're gonna
say font size let's say three ram save
that okay let's see what's going on see
why the love was not showing up okay
okay
Paige okay is there but not
showing up missing the network side
did this show up let me go back to sire
font awesome copy this paste this up
here let's put it right above okay and
there you go we got the logo alright now
the next thing that we're going to do
make sure you fix this this is actually
an ID so put the ID okay and there you
go all right now the next thing that we
want to do you're gonna say we got
cannot drop down we want this to be
display flex so we want it to be display
flex or they could all be right next to
each other we're gonna say justified
content Center aligned items Center okay
and that's your Center it now let me see
what else we want to get a little caret
so come back to the icons we're going to
say we're gonna search for down so this
Chevron click in there copy this alright
now we're gonna come in here where's
this icon and I pasted out there we're
gonna copy this where it says logo fine
you're gonna say FA Chevron but outside
of icon and we're gonna say like this FA
Chevron matter of fact I think we could
do it better by putting this in here
like this taking this cut it out pacing
it over this alright matter of fact no
let's just leave it there for now maybe
later on we'll figure out better wait
but for now this is fine so keep it in
icon the Chevron then a font size put it
at 0.8 rim and there you go okay next
thing that we want to do is to
is this
okay so the Missy
okay we're gonna do the same thing that
we do here let's play flex in all of
them
you
make sure
you
we even use the split grade in here
I don't know if we should yeah I think
I'm gonna go with this play grid so
we're gonna go to where it says account
instead of this we're gonna basically
say display grade we're going to say
grid template columns I'm gonna say
repeat repeat
I forgot the so it's three and then each
one of them we want it to be 20 pixels
or 1fr so I say three 1fr
this way
I hold on to some
I miss okay there you go
that's what I wanted I wanted them to be
like that
and I wanted them to be centered so I'm
gonna copy this from here and paste this
right here close the property putting
name and there you go
okay I'm gonna put in four grid template
columns I'm just gonna do this
better 1fr I say three fr and one are
far there you go all right that's much
better
yeah that's exactly what I want next
thing that we want to do for now we're
going to put in a padding around this so
we're gonna say padding 15 pixels let me
see let me make sure it's looking decent
might be a little bit smaller yeah now
15 pixels is fine
okay so 15 pixels
okay I'm gonna bring down
logo make it a little bit smaller than
that now it's much better next thing
that we want to do we want to put in a
border all right so this border I'm
going to say it's gonna be like a little
like great so to do this I'm just gonna
use color picker
real quick
take this from here and on the Left menu
are we gonna say border all right
butter right one pixel solid and then
put in this color okay there you go we
got that little nice solid line we might
want to make it a little bit bigger than
that so maybe three pixels
that's that's good maybe two okay data
so border is gonna be two pixels and
then the next thing that we want to do
is we want to come here basically for
the title on the groups so what do we
have we have groups then we have group
and then title so let's do this right
now just gonna put this down here for
now we're gonna say groups the group
title and then groups group title and
then what do we do here we want this to
be font size let's say 1.2 Ram font
weight let's say a 500 should be fine
and let's say text transform uppercase
there's actually a little bit smaller
than that say point seven okay make this
a little bit thicker so put in a 700
okay now for the groups we're gonna say
padding 15 pixels okay all right so what
do we have here so we got the groups and
then we're gonna say ul ul Li we're
going to say padding say 10 pixels zero
all right something like that should be
fine let's put in some so font size on
this
so font size say 0.7 rim color is going
the same as the border that we have here
so here we're gonna say color pace that
in save that it's a little bit too light
so let's make this a little bit darker
okay copy that paste it here need a
little bit darker than that copy paste
okay that's fine it's still a little bit
small so let's put this at eight
maybe this one to eight
you
let me see some of your title like this
pattern 10 pixels do the same thing for
the title so they could all have to sing
spacing and that's fine for now
alright so we are good we are working on
the main layout and yeah I'll see you
guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
