at it again man coding face.com make
sure you subscribe make sure you like
this video and matter-of-fact man make
sure you check the web style coding
phase calm your boys back
check the resources alright listen I'm
going to tell you guys my PHP story and
why am I gonna say it as well I got a
little comment where you know Trump
supporter which is funny he has Benny
you advised mu developers to learn PHP
to find a job easier that you learn PHP
at first are you still a PHP developer
what back in languages can you code now
alright let's break it down so when I
first started in this thing I was just
doing fronting pretty much just
transforming a PSD into HTML and CSS
that's how I started then from there
started messing around with some
JavaScript some jQuery right now once
you get to a certain point and you're
like oh man I wanted to get a couple of
clients you know everywhere I went
everybody was talking about WordPress
WordPress and I'm like damn man what the
hell is WordPress so I basically I
downloaded all the freaking library or
the framework whatever you want to call
it and that was my first introduction to
PHP matter of fact no the first
introduction to PHP was a long time ago
and back then I was just like I don't
understand this I'm gone
I left that alone right so that
fast forward to when I started learning
how to code the proper way right
so pretty much I decided you know I had
this client who wanted me to build him a
website for it was like a movie right
and pretty much what I did just build it
with WordPress and I was like oh man I'm
a developer now I'm doing you know I'm
doing the front end I don't even know
anything front-end or back-end it was
more like oh I build the website for
this person right come on you I was like
man this thing is great whatever times
goes
on and I come back again and started
making another website WordPress and I
started noticing a lot of limitations in
my head back then I thought that was PHP
I thought that's how PHP was I thought
that WordPress was PHP I was like super
beginning back then right so I kind of
left it alone and then the whole
industry started talking about no genius
this nodejs that and everywhere I went
everybody was be like oh man PHP sucks
PHP is the worst language out there
I was like man PHP I'm not touching
PHP because that is old everybody
says that it's old and you know I'm
listening to everybody in the internet
because I didn't know better I wasn't
working in the industry you know I
didn't know that when people put
comments on the Internet it's more like
their opinions it doesn't mean that's
how it really is in the industry it's
more like a personal opinion it's like
if I hate c-sharp I could go and leave a
comment be like oh man don't are
c-sharp man that's for four squares and
losers right but the industry actually
use c-sharp there's more websites more
companies that use c-sharp then of
nodejs
so yeah you know what I mean some but
whatever so basically I stopped even
trying to get into PHP I stopped and I
was like all the way in the beginning in
the beginning of my career that was from
year one all right I have five years on
this thing I had five years in the
industry I had five years working as a
developer five years making professional
websites so from year one to year three
I didn't touch PHP ever again
because I'm the intern everybody's like
oh man I don't want to deal with this
right but that puts so much limitations
on me because number one I didn't know
my sequel number two every time somebody
will come to me but I hey can you build
this in the backend or use this
framework like laravel or CodeIgniter or
right I would be like now all I could do
is just the front end I could make the
desire for you I could build the HTML
the CSS and some jQuery for you that's a
now from there I went to another company
where they were making millions of
dollars right and advertising was an
advertising company and they were all
just using PHP and I was like man I
thought PHP was dead and nobody you know
nobody care about this thing my was like
2013 around that 2013-2014 around there
and I was like man this is cool I
thought it was like pretty shitty and
nobody uses it and like no major company
is using then I found out that I'm
losing out on so many freaking jobs I
realized I was putting myself in a
little box where I was just like hey all
I know is HTML CSS and JavaScript which
I wasn't expanding my mind as far as
like programming learning different
languages learning different databases
my sequel put on Postgres sequel server
or you know even my goal to be a whole
bunch of different technologies that I
was just missing out on just because I
kept listening to everybody on the
internet and that was like on team
treehouse I used to be on team treehouse
forest all the time and people talk
about PHP and I was like man now that I
think about him like I should have been
doing this from the beginning
because even when I on my first year
when I first started looking for a job
there was a whole bunch of jobs that
said PHP and I would just go right over
it because I don't know no PHP I don't
know anything the backing I don't know
about my sequel so now fast forward now
basically almost all my personal
projects I do it on PHP laravel right
why because I love Ruby on Rails but to
be honest with you guys
Ruby on Rails is is like something that
and
not gonna say is dying but most
companies are not gonna basically put
money into Ruby on Rails so like let's
say if I wanted to look for a job for
Ruby on Rails I have to be like
extremely good in review or else you
just don't get hired for it to become a
ruby developer you have to be like a
 senior level with like five
years of experience being a back-end
developer or more and I don't have that
you know so I have like two years of
back-end development but in total of
five years of like as a web developer
right so that's why I choose laravel
right because there's so many companies
that's hiring there's so many companies
that is constantly sending messages like
man we want to hire you we want you for
this and that like everybody knows I'm
good with JavaScript like no lie I don't
want to like put myself up here but this
not that many people that could
with me in JavaScript like I know that
she like the back of my hand like
straight up now PHP it might have BES in
PHP probably not because there's
probably guys who've been doing this
 for 10-15 years you know what I
mean like time does make a difference
when it comes to development and
experiments well yeah man so that's like
my story of PHP so that answers
everything like do I advise new
developers to learn PHP yes because it's
gonna open doors for you like a lot of
doors like when I learn PHP that thing
just the gates were open for me straight
up like I felt like I couldn't learn any
other language out there I could learn
any back-end language after PHP it's
like right now working on on crystal
lang crystal lang is not the easiest
language out there and I'm I'm
getting really really good on it I'm
getting so good that I'm making
tutorials on it and like I'm doing
 great you know what I mean and I
make a lot of money in my company
because I'm a PHP laravel developer you
know I mean if I wanted to I could go
remote because there's a million jobs
that are remote which is what a lot of
you guys want right so yeah man
definitely learn PHP and that's my PHP
story man yeah I almost didn't learn PHP
because I kept seeing on the Internet
PHP sucks or PHP is dead
or PHP is the worst language PHP is slow
it might be all of that but there's
money to be made you know what I mean
like I work in PHP is now our favorite
language but when I get home I work on
something cool like crystal you know
what I mean I'll work on something cool
like nodejs or electron I have our
electron app that I'm working on - you
know what I mean so yeah make sure you
subscribe make sure you like this video
