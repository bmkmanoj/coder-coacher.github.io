again man coding face.com you boys
backing out and did it again
guys listen we have a very precise list
for you guys this year the top 20
developers that you should be following
according to the people's all right now
this list is basically made of 8,000
people who actually filled out this form
you know people got a comment from you
to me people who are coming from YouTube
people who are coming from my web site
people are coming from Facebook groups
people who are coming from social media
all right this is not just people from
my audience this is people spread out
all right
more than half of the people are out of
my audience this is literally people
from you know from online right and
people who actually come in and are part
of the community so we want to give them
voice okay so we got to start this like
this we're going to start with Duff
honorable mentions all right then I'm
gonna give you the top 20 and then after
that we're gonna go into a little bit
more deeper behind the scenes of this
top 20
funny coding channels he must follow
2018 okay so top honorable mentions we
got John Morris Centex Black Knight
coding West boss Christa freelancer all
right so let's get to it
top 20 Ricky Garcia four point five
percent of the audience like this
content the net ninja of 4.9% like this
content start here FM five point seven
percent number 17 real tough candy 6.1
percent it's number sixteen Michael
Thomas six point five percent number

function with twenty four point three
percent of the audience like in his
content number three coding tutorials
360 38.2 percent of the
is added him to his favorites okay
number two coding face 66.5% it's gonna
be controversial but hey it is what it
is you know number one which is
traversée media which to nobody is a
secret that traversing media had a great
year this year so congratulations to him
you know more power to him you know and
I hope everything goes good man 2018
hopefully you know we have a more how
you call this a more fair list and like
I said from the beginning I told
everybody I sent it out I sent out
emails to every single one of these guys
here everybody that shows up here they
got an email from me either message a
comment email something they got
something from me alright and we did
alive so you guys have you know are
basically my witnesses alright so we
basically reached out so everybody live
and we told them hey man share this link
with your audience but as you guys may
know you know a lot of times most of you
know 99% of every developer who is on
YouTube is pretty much thinking like
everybody's trying to feed off them and
trying to steal their audience and you
know pretty much there's no community
here alright so hopefully with this list
next year everybody decides to come
together and as a community we could
create a poll same way how Stack
Overflow has their yearly poll well I
want to create one I want to create one
because we all have a great you know we
have a huge audience man like we could
literally come in and get data from them
find out exactly what they want what
type of content they want today one more
tutorials so they want more you know
personality you know like one thing that
you're gonna notice here is of course
traversing media is number one because
he's given so much content someone's
great content for everybody all right
now me myself you might say hey Joe is
your pole you came out number two but
you got understand more than half of the
people that voted on this pole know
they're not my subscribers only like 400
people from my subscribers actually
voted for this pole then everybody else
is from emails from you to me which is
just random people it's not people that
they are signed up to me that just
people who are pretty much just random
but they've heard of my channel somehow
right so they enjoy the type of content
I come in I feel like what I bring in to
the table is the personality and at the
same time just the realness which people
they like and you know at the same time
you got coding tutorials 360 you know
this other channels here on the list
that have way more subscribers than name
but as you can see the community
attaches more to him they like him more
than those other youtubers who have
greater or numbers to him
so it shows you from this a data that we
have here is what exactly is that people
care about you know because the whole
poll said which ones are your favorites
you know like you might have a channel
that you might go and use for tutorials
and use it as a reference or usually
like documentation but doesn't mean that
you connect with that channel one thing
that coding tutorials or six years you
could tell he connects with the people
alright people could connect to him and
you know they like his content so out of
this list you could take in that if I
was looking from the outside and I would
say hey people want more content people
want more free content right that's what
traverses media's here they like the
fact that I come in and share my
personality and share you know who I am
so they care about who this developer is
and they care about the things that you
know coding tutorials 360 comes in and
brings to the table so everybody else is
he
you know everybody brings something
different to the table some people are
more for vlogging so I'm people are more
for advice some people are more for you
know tutorials people use their channel
as documentation but we must agree in
one thing is hey there's things that
people are looking for right on their
channels to consider them their
favorites okay so what I would say is
take this list look at the things that
every single one of them have this is
not a top list of who's the best who is
the most popular who has the most
subscribers this has nothing to do with
that it has to do with who are the
people connecting to more all right and
who's actually providing them more
content and better content than
everybody else you get what I'm saying
so I hope that everybody enjoys this
list I hope you guys really come in next
year and you know when we sit down next
year or next December we could have more
youtubers because pretty much the only
two people that actually responded back
was the real kasih Darrow
and Ricky Garcia besides them nobody
else responded back so that's I'm dumb
you know what I mean like I come in and
I try to create a impartial list I come
in and go out of my way to make sure
that I'm bringing in people who are not
on my subscribers list at all and just
to have a more decent and more fair list
you know cuz this is data you know this
is data that we can all use and come in
here and you know give the next year a
better content for everybody all right
so love you guys I'll see you guys in
next video I hope you guys that are
watching this you guys go check out
every single one of these shows all
right the everybody here has something
different everybody you know they either
talk about Python to talk about vlogs
they talk about
tutorials they either talk about their
lives or you know how they became
developers like every single one of them
has great content so go check them out
especially the honorable mentions
usually when you have people in the
honorable mentions this is like the
heading you know the hitting secrets the
guys that not everybody know about but
one of you guys actually voted for them
to be on this list so yeah I'll see you
