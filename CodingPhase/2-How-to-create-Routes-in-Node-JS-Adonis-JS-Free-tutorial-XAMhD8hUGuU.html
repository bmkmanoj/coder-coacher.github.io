again listen we're gonna start with
routes right so we have all these
folders here right so you probably like
what the hell is all of this stuff like
it's confusing right don't worry your
body you're the only way that you're
gonna learn this is by actually doing
the coding understanding the framework
as you go when you try to understand
everything before you start building
anything it becomes too confusing so
let's keep it simple right so we're
gonna go to app right we're gonna click
HTTP and then I go to routes so you
probably asking yourself what's a route
right if you don't know what a route is
it's pretty much when you say something
like you know youtube.com slash coding
face that's a route on the YouTube page
right so it's just pretty much once you
add this here you're basically saying
hey I'm routing this address to this
page or this address to this API core
like you know that's what it means it's
pretty simple you just you know it's an
address on your server right basically
making a call to your server and
basically the server returns something
back let's say if I go into google.com
slash Google die JPEG that will give me
an image or if I will go into google.com
slash duo YouTube is gonna give me the
YouTube page you see what I mean so it's
just an address all right so we already
did all of this now let's do this let's
create some routes right now the route
that we have is the original route which
is the slash which it means just pretty
much the home page right so right now on
the home page we have this if I come
into resources views inside the views
folder that's where basically the views
are
pages are all right so you have a master
template this could get a little bit
complicated if you never dealt with the
templates but pretty much is just let's
say an example there's a master template
there's the the home page right now what
it's saying
inside of here basically in this block
show the content right so the content is
this this little thing so if I come here
and I delete this I'll say h1 now o
C says hey world
alright because we actually changed it
now let's say we wanted to do another
route all right so let's add this let's
say instead of welcome let's keep the
welcome but instead of when you go to
about we're gonna create another
template so let's duplicate this to
welcome so to pretty much just copy it
what is already there and just naming it
about now let's change this to about
page all right now when I come to slash
about it should give me oops sorry I
don't save just okay now when we come to
about is going to give me right things
that would go further great it's the
world development nothing's perfect
alright so oh yeah when you go to about
it's going to give me that page and it's
the same thing for contact now I have to
duplicate this make a copy of that
and create contact
alright alright you see now we have
basically those routes they are here
we're basically saying okay when you
from the user go to whatever google.com
slash about rendered or about PSO listen
we already got through this you know a
simple route three little simple routes
right now make sure you subscribe you
make sure you like this video let trust
me the next video is going to be super
easy and I'm going to be explaining
what's going on with you know the
template engine and what the hell is the
master template and what the hell is the
you know the child blots what the hell
is there's the end blocks you know what
I mean like so make sure you subscribe
and make sure you check out the next
video alright man Wow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
