back at it again man : face calm listen
your boys live I'm doing this really
alive from the park live with the wifey
in the back because that's how we do it
we try to make as much content as
possible for you guys right the fans the
viewers the people that see me yeah they
can see you we got this all right
so we're going to talk about you know
just YouTube today right you know it
kind of sucks that you know you see how
I am and how supportive I am with
everybody on YouTube like you know I see
a new channel color you know popping up
I try to reach out them but I hey man um
you know I'll give you a little
promotion and help you out so you love
because I know how it was to you know be
in the beginning would be like under a
thousand subscribers right the only
person that I haven't gotten the chance
to talk to I think it was her name
gooseberry you know I wish for her
nothing but the best out here in YouTube
you know she's doing her thing and yeah
man but even to this day I still don't
see it from like the quote-unquote
big-time youtubers guys who have 50,000
60,000 and 100,000 90 something dollars
and subscribers like they do not show no
love to nobody out here is you know it's
like everybody comes here and like it
pisses me off cause people calling here
and they think of YouTube like a
business even like a lot of the
subscribers to that come to my channel
and they might leave a a crazy comment
be like oh man you're not an authority
on your opinion is distance and that
guy's this is YouTube like this is why I
love YouTube I love you too because it
gives everybody a voice and it's a cool
community is a cool place for people to
actually hang out
get to know each other like you know we
all love to code we all love to you know
create cool stuff so that's why we here
alright but you know it kind of sucks
and I kind of sucks that other youtubers
who might have a bigger audience who
have been here for a while don't do that
for other youtubers and especially
coming up there's a lot of guys that
these feelings as a business they see it
as a as a way to make money and I feel
like yeah you can make money on YouTube
but that shouldn't be your goal that
shouldn't be the only thing that you're
here for like you know like those guys
didn't go to VidCon didn't go to none of
the the conference's they don't go to no
meetups little meetup their you know
their view words you know it's like I
don't know right I understand some
people might say oh hey everybody's busy
everybody's just trying to work and try
to do their own thing you know you do
what you do I do what I do but to me
that sucks
I think that is stupid because like
a lot of people worry so much about Oh
am I gonna lose viewers am I gonna lose
subscribers and it's like no buddy
you're not gonna lose viewers or
subscribers you're actually gonna gain
new subscribers because the people that
watch me don't watch you you know and
vice versa and at the same time school
like we all love to code we all love to
talk about coding and programming in
general so why not collaborate why not
help each other out why not help other
channels like I don't care about me I
know a lot of people's not gonna like me
because the sauce is too real people
don't like that they don't like will not
come in and do that alright they don't
like that they don't understand the kid
and that's fine but you know this
channels are pretty cool out there this
the real tough candy her channel is
pretty legit like I'm a big-time
youtuber and
bump into her videos why not give her a
little shoutout Chris Sean Chris honest
super positive so giving people the view
of a brand new developer right why not
give him a shout-out for it why not try
to actually do a collaboration with the
kid you know help him out take him to
the next level why is that and I was
like I came into this game with like 30
subscribers and I like that name that's
why I think it's not supposed to be like
a place that people look at it like a
business plan right then as opposed to
coming here think of it hey hello
business I have a brand my name is Josh
live I have weird and isn't that like
it's not supposed to be that at all if
you got a brand you got a friend
that's simple people breaking their
necks out here looking at your kid they
don't know how to act right here man
they see somebody with camera like man
what the hell he's doing man I mean come
on youtuber man that's what I do
I knew YouTube I just happened to deal
with what developer right but yeah man
so that's what I think guys
I don't know what you guys I think
people should do more collaboration
people should be more positive and look
at this little corner right angles
beautiful right there's a little spot
there's no spot right here
good a got wifey out here man positive
vibes man who you know was gonna these
guys didn't put their wifey out there
like that
they don't grab the wifey by the neck
put on the red lock put on a headlock we
don't do that I love going you know they
don't share that you know the human side
is like they all want to be a robot sick
visit tsiyon cold this is how you do
this man be yourself man stop being a
 clone your name but how do you
say man
gross also lots of other youtubers man
yeah you bring here for three four years
land bike that's cool
that's great show love back a little
people it's supposed to be a community
go to VidCon man go do meetups like when
was the last time these people have done
a meter thank I think above the other
you know what pains you to words right
I'm probably going to be the first one
to do a meet-up I'm planning to go meet
up here New York City and then somewhere
in the summer was when I stay I don't
know if it's Callie we're gonna be Vegas

people England now might be a wintertime

love to other people so people show love
to you positive vibe you know you don't
have to show love to me man but so lots
of Christian so love to you know tough
