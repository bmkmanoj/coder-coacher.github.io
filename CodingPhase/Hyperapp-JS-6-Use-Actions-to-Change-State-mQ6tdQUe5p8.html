here and pass down actions and what
exactly is an action right an action is
a way to manipulate the state so what
we're going to do is up here we want to
create another property called actions
all right and then we're going to pass
down an object and inside of that object
we're going to have properties for each
action that we want so far only one is
plus and minus so here what we're going
to do is we're going to create a
function so we're going to say like this
I'm going to use the arrow function I'm
going to create a function and then
we're basically going to pass down the
state and also actions all right state
in actions all right now here what we're
going to return is we're going to return
an object with something like this we're
going to say title then left leg let's
leave title a law let's say total and
then for total we're going to say state
that total plus 1 okay we're going to
copy this and we're going to come down
here create another one but we're going
to say - yes a minus 1 and this one
you're going to call it - okay so you've
stack right now the same way how we did
up here that we passed down the state
down to the components which are up here
right
but remember our functions are down here
our components each one has a function
down here so what we're going to do is
we're going to come here I'm going to
say actions actions right and we're
going to say actions and we're passing
down the object actions so it's coming
from here
passing down through here going through
here to the header and making it
available for the header down here so
we're going to come down here and say
actions - and we basically have access
to that that plus plus action in the -
action alright so let's do something
else with this tool we're going to pass
it down to content area I'm going to
pass it down to buttons area all right
because we want all of them to have
those actions okay so what we're going
to do is we're going to come here we're
going to say actions on all the
functions passing it down okay and then
also to let me see what else we're
missing anything yeah we got to pass it
down through here to little components
on the props so let's take this copy it
alright now we have access to those
objects down here okay now the next
thing that we want to do is we want to
say for the buttons we're going to do
something like this I'll click alright
I'll click well I'll click we're going
to say something like this will say
actions dot -
and then for the other one we're going
to do actions + save that Cu compiled
everything it's fine
one good way to basically debug this and
make sure that everything is working is
to put a console log and we can see if
anything shows up on the console log
alright so that saved a compiled
ok let's click here so same plus that's
fine now the counter is not changing
because we basically have it so static
zero here so all we want to do is make
sure we come here and say state that
counter alright or let's say state that
total alright so every time we click on
plus basically this action is going to
go through write this function and then
what it's going to do is going to take
the state and whatever the state is the
state total if it's zero is going to add
a 1 to it so we save this and every
refresh automatically goes up - goes
down
alright school we got two negative one
okay that's fine alright so yeah man
that's how you work with actions guys so
it's pretty cool because it helps you
keep things organized
now we could come here and create
another button down here and let's say
for example we wanted to create one that
just resets everything back to zero so
let's say your friends area is five but
let's come down here let me see where is
it the car
area okay cool so for this one you're
going to come down here and paste this
down you're going to see reset okay
and we're going to say actions dot plus
but we want to actions that reset and
we're going to create another action
down here I take this and say reset okay
and we're going to make the total to
zero now one thing doesn't get to show
you guys before was how to work with
style you know how you want to do some
inline styling sometimes well we're
going to do that now so we're going to
say style and we're going to pass in the
equals two curly brackets and then
inside of it we're going to pass in an
object so what we're going to do is in a
safe style and then I'm going to click
enter this so I could have a little bit
more space and more organized so let's a
style use a background here background
and then you're going to say red save
that so you can see that changed the
background cool alright so that's how
you mess around with with like the
styling the same example is just the
same way as CSS all right let's say we
wanted to come here and change this
right and we say we want this to be lets
say padding-bottom let us say 50 pixels
alright and let's say something like
this border radius
and you say five pixels all right of
course this thing looks ugly but it's
just for you guys to get the idea let's
say we wanted to do this with JSX
how will we do this because you see if
we were to put in the the - which is a -
in JavaScript this is going to give us
errors so what we're going to do is
we're going to say like this and we're
going to come here we're gonna say
padding bottom and I'm going to say 50
pixels of course you have to put it into
a string 50 pixels and then down here
you will say border-radius you will say
five pixels all right but for whatever
reason let's say an example you want
your numbers to be more dynamic you
could actually come here and just say 5
+ PX and we can concatenate your your
strings like this is good
depending on the situation what you want
to do like some type of animation and
you want to change it around so let's
say an example we wanted to have
something here where we will say
something like this we'll say state okay
state state times okay
state that total times and let's say
something like times 2 right all right
so now we have like a more dynamic
you can see starts changing and we go to
do animations through here so you can
say something like this transition and
we could come here say or just to see
how we will do it with regular CSS only
difference is instead of using border -
radius will say voter and then basically
use camel case on radius all right so
let's say oh let's say point five
seconds piece in and out that saves that
okay so it could be a little bit more
smooth alright so yeah man this how you
play around what I just wanted to show
you guys that and yeah let's move on to
the next video
boy joke back at it again I didn't did
it again man
I came up with this new course hyperope
jas course guys if you want the full
course you don't want to wait for the
videos on YouTube make sure you go to
the website you know coding face.com is
going to bring you here to the store
there's going to be a whole bunch of
courses of course you can just sign up
for the ghetto access pass and yeah
whenever you use the description below
and you use the link to layer guys
