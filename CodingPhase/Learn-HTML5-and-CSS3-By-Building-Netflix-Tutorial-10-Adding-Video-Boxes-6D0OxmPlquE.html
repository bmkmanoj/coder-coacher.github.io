again so there's what we left off we
cleaned it up a little bit now we're
gonna do below this we're gonna do
another section in that section we're
gonna have for manufacture boxes in
those five boxes we're gonna have you
know images of videos from like you know
Netflix you know okay
so let's build this I start this wave
right here they've ID closing video
section and if I can I can leave this
all right
remember this you know a small letter
capital letter okay
lowercase uppercase all right so let's
say now we're gonna make a row so our
role is just a row and just exactly what
what it says is just meaning is gonna be
one row from you know the full width and
then inside of it we're gonna create
video boxes
all right so let's say video for now all
right all right I see what this looks
like
for now it doesn't look like much so
let's say start copying this let's copy
this five times two three four five
right all right now let's make sure this
thing they in line together side by side
so let's start with the Styles ID video
section and then the video section and
we say wave 100% background let's say
black now for the row let's say with 100
and let's say let's see what happens
yeah they're all in there okay so let's
see
video boxes can I sing background
already and let's say whiff is gonna be
you know you're gonna divide five you
know oh yeah 100 divided by five pretty
much so you say woof is okay twenty
percent and then a padding now might
affect a margin of two point five four
five percent you see but when you do
this okay
you gotta put this display:inline-block
C but when you do that and don't fit
properly so let's say we gotta bring
this down so it could you know fit in
perfectly because what it's doing is
saying okay 2.5 2.5 2.5 so it's like now
when it comes to here it doesn't have
the space so let's bring this down to 15
and I remember all of this gotta add up
to 100 right but the reason why it's not
it's not fitting them properly is
because it's you know
let's show let me show you this fabulous
remove the margin technically supposed
to go perfectly side-by-side but you see
that is because this there's a space you
know white space between here and here
that's white space so the best way to do
it would be
you remove the white space by going on a
roller thing font size zero now let me
sing size zero height I'm gonna say 450
pixels because this is font size zero
now every child inside of it is font
size zero so now we lost the text that's
inside that says video so let's fix that
now we say font size just put this 16
pixels now we get it now we got it back
okay what else
now we do margin 2.5 see now if it's
perfectly see what I mean now
technically we who actually do 17.5 and
then we say hey nineteen point five and
then with the one two three
see what happens 17.5 to the left that
could work but that's not what what I
really want what I want something that's
even so like let's say for now let's
just stick to 15 and then you know keep
it this thing margin:0 top and bottom
but if I give it 2 point 5 4 over so now
we have a separate ok so cool now let's
add another background to this another
box by saying let's do this video 1
let's name this tool
now say let's get this a couple of movie
posters I don't know my antenna so slow
right now okay so what we gonna do is
for every single video we're gonna go
and put in a new background so let's do
this video on let's just get this from
here
right
see now we have the video there alright
let's do this we got that let's remove
this okay copy
well what I'm doing right now is I'm
clicking here and pressing command C to
copy now when I come here command V it's
just copy and paste not doing nothing
special
all right let me see what else now let's
copy this again let me put this a little
bit yeah to make it a little bit
different all right copy this video to
another movie poster
let's get another one
I copy this video three
coppy
you just copy and paste into your to
address
never heard of the smoking what the hell
is this okay cool
copying this
it's video 5 yeah here we go
all right now
it's going here and this make this h4
right
now let's also do this so video boxes so
there's video boxes h4 margin:0 color
well this is just white yeah I can just
say white now aside of video boxes let's
do a padding padding means space inside
of the box so let's say 15 pixels okay
margin is outside border you know what a
water is then padding is the inside of
it so let me say when you say 15 pixels
of padding what you're doing is you sing
okay give me 15 pixels of padding inside
of the box when I say 2.5 margin 5% of
the margin means give me 2.5 of whatever
this width is from left to right and
then just give me 2.5 of that but in the
outside of the box so that's what margin
is so it's pretty much you have an idea
what the box model is you know what I
mean so let's see what else can we do
you got again
it's not this there's something called
border-box box-sizing
okay you know css3 it has a lot of stuff
so you almost can never remember this
and everything ok bought a box yeah I
know it now we back to it
what border box does is it basically is
subtract whatever the padding is inside
from the box that's pretty much it so I
make sure that even though you're given
a padding inside it calculates every
single thing from the margin the padding
even the border so everything could be
even okay so now we got that let's say
that's cool yeah now let's change the
titles let's say okay I think it's
tenting Pacific Hiro the classic Star
Wars and I don't know
all right having a tissue here
wondering why
Oh
problems in the text it's not enough
space so that's the issue right now okay
so let's see let's inspect this thing
what is the problem
sometimes in CSS there's always like a
little issue that you know it's gonna
get you annoyed but no we could do for
it right now we're gonna figure that out
on the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
