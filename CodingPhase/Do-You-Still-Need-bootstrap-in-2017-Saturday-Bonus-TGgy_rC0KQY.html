bought your back out of the game man
listen to all the trees yeah calm and
I'm out you're not cold as hell because
he already knows when a time we gonna
talk about bootstrap right so somebody
left me a comment say hey I learned HTML
see it says should I learn bootstrap
because everybody's telling me hey learn
bootstrap before you learn JavaScript
number one guys
bootstrap is not a light blue strap is
not something that you need for your
development you don't need to add all
like let's be honest bootstrap is only
for prototyping what does that mean that
means let's say right now your back-end
developer and pretty much you don't know
anything about HTML and CSS or you have
no creative skills like you don't know
about colors you don't know about how to
design pretty much what you do is
basically you use the bootstrap themes
or bootstrap templates and you know just
for prototyping it doesn't mean that
your Western is going to end up like
that so I will say hey just if you know
HTML and CSS you're good all you really
need from this shot is just a grid the
grid is really helpful because you
basically have media queries which help
you build responsive design so that's
how I use it I just use a straight for
the grid I don't use it for anything
else besides that so I will say guys
just if you know how to build something
out of a design like I say like I always
tell you guys know the drill will calm
find a design that you like copy it
create something new animation and
therefore they just get inspiration out
of other designers and then just rebuild
them in HTML CSS and definitely you know
learn JavaScript like I already told you
guys that but you know don't believe the
hype don't believe that people telling
you oh you gotta learn this strap this
Mac people all you really need is just a
grip understand what you know css3
media queries understand how to build
you know a layout from the grid that say
all these are loans based
the grid endoscopy all right guys anyway
