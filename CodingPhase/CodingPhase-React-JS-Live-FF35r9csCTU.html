was like choppy let me know if it's
choppy right now I see let me see
yo yo yo you
can you hear me now can you hear me now
can you hear your boy is it choppy or is
it let me make sure that you guys can
see me good we try with my phone coding
phase live yeah that looks good yeah so
I'm good I'm good G I'm good you good
you good you where are ya
coochie coochie coochie coochie gang
Gucci gang good again all right so what
am i doing right now
what am i doing today I'm gonna share
the screen real quick all right let me
see see what's going on go hang out no
sometimes to the computer
you know I'll be leaving it on I got
away too many videos way too many videos
on my computer my computer's like
running on maximum Reina
so anyways I'm working on the timeline
currently so that's what I'm doing right
now kids see it was really good
let me see if I could get the pop-up so
I'll see you guys in a chat room yeah
let me see who's in here who's in here
right now we got Michael address oh we
got Adam Smith Kevin Davis Dennis white
JC Rodri sundar vinash Adam Smith
Alex Machine dual-arm it's good to see a
lot of people that have never seen
before so I'm really happy for that I've
never seen dual arm I've not seen
Harrison guitar I don't think I've seen
Adam Smith or maybe he changed the icon
a sign but no see you know so it's like
it's good I've been that shadow I don't
think I was singing finish so you know
always thing 18 is in here so cool man
all right so what am i working on so
this is the new timeline pretty much
you're gonna be able to say hey I want
to see front-end and then from there all
the courses will pop up and then you
know if you completed it you could click
on and say ok I completed this I
completed this well like I can say hey I
already know this already know that
so yeah so let's see okay
so currently what I'm doing is I'm
keeping all the data here okay so have
I'm not using a back-end for now so I'm
keeping all of my data in just regular
files and what's cool about that it's
like if I have a misspelling or
something like that you guys are able to
change it for me right cuz I'm gonna put
it on github and you know if you guys
want to do a pull request and fix
something that you say hey Joe I think
there's a little bit a little bit off or
maybe we could make this a little bit
wider if it looks good then I'll accept
it you know okay so let me see react is
quick and easy so we have this thing
here let me go - where's the timeline
that Jes so what I'm going to do here is
I'm actually gonna loop over each each
item okay so let me see I'm gonna create
this up here I'm gonna say this top run
and and loop equals to this front end up
buying this a and then here what I'm
going to do I'm gonna say well I gotta
import the data to him so let's say
import and I'm gonna say timeline data
from okay
you know and then index Tijs
okay save that scroll down yeah man
now don't worry man Carlos you know you
could get the the lifetime later on
and I'll try it I'll try the yearly see
how this year goes and next year if you
say hey man I think it's a better saving
to just come in and get the the the
lifetime then you got the lifetime you
know but yeah we got a lot of cool stuff
coming up guys that's for sure
okay so let me delete this
because now what we're going to do is
we're gonna loop over every single every
single item so I'm gonna take this head
out and then I'm gonna say this stock
front end loop trigger it okay and then
where is it and then loop knitting here
we're gonna say I'm line beta hey
timeline data
I'm map and then the side of this we're
gonna pass in a arrow function okay then
here we're gonna say return and this is
where we're gonna pass in by JSX what
this is going to do is gonna loop over
all of the data now stumbling J yes the
way how it is okay tumbling data and
then I say timeline data back in front
end yeah yeah and then so yeah so I have
an object and therefore inside of this
object I'm gonna put in each one I'm
gonna have fun and I'm gonna have in
front in back in full stack what else
I'm gonna have front and back and full
stack game development mobile
development software development machine
learning so all those things that you
see here
currently I mean we have a lot of
front-end and back-end and full stack
development courses game development
we're gonna start that tool pretty soon
mobile development we're gonna start
with react native software development
we're gonna start with electron machine
learning we're gonna start with Python
and that's gonna be like in the next few
months you know for next few weeks you
know so we're just adding everything in
water you know I'm knocking out all the
front end they're knocking out all the
back end then all we have to do is just
put together the full stack and then
probably jump to game development or I
mean people want the mobile development
which is you know react native so we
gotta give it to them
all right now so we're gonna loop over
this thing let's see if it works
save that I'm gonna control see blue
yarn run a watch my computer's running a
little bit slow today that's because I
haven't turned it off in like a month
and a half sometimes you got to turn off
your computer guys like I've been
leaving it on and not only that do I
have like videos rendering in the
background I got like a whole bunch of
stuff I got PHP running I got no Jes
running I got Ruby on Rails running I
need to start closing up a couple of
things from here
I got table plus running a source tree
running so what's good
what everybody man okay let's see if it
worked
nope error okay so what's the error
let's see time to debug can every
property map of undefined
okay so timeline data hmm so let me see
why isn't it going through timeline data
lose the timeline
timeline data boy timeline data so
that's being exported we've seen the
index J yes timeline data I see
see that's how you got a you gotta learn
how to debug kids
I'm gonna go console.log figure out
where's the issue so I'm gonna say
timeline data yes to see what's inside
of that this run we see what's going on
console.log so okay so we do have it in
here wait what hold on what's going on
this is only return this is returning
this it's not supposed to return this
so tumbling data data indexed IG yes oh
that's why don't inner just getting it
from Tom line from Chris's GS
you know the way I'm doing is I'm
importing important data or well indexed
ideas right so index dot GS is like the
home of both of these so courses and
timeline that GS so the reason why I did
that is because in case I want to import
multiple different data all I have to do
is let me see timeline all I have to do
is pretty much just out of here and say
question is Veda so I don't have to keep
on importing multiple different lines it
will be just all in one single line you
got what I'm saying that's why I'm doing
it like that right we good now the issue
was over here I was actually on timeline
no index Nijs I was imported timeline
data from courses Jes and that wasn't
what I needed to be doing you know what
I mean so let's go back to this thing
uncomment this out I'm gonna save this
starting time Monday tada front-end time
map and then basically going over every
single one
all right
so let's see ah nothing is being
returned oh sorry
we got to return this so we got to
return the map - save that all right
cool so let's see what's going on there
you go that's what I'm talking about
all right so we got all the courses
there now the next thing that I want to
do - this is basically we're gonna come
in and say like this we're gonna put in
porce okay so we basically calling this
variable course so every single every
single course inside of this array of
timeline Jes okay so we got this thing
so every single object inside of this
array it's of course so you can name it
item you can name it whatever you want
so I'm just gonna name it exactly what
it is of course so I'm gonna say course
I'm gonna say course got title and then
here is where we're gonna do a low Sun
interesting so do some load JSX magic
okay instead of using it like this we're
gonna use a tick okay and then now we're
gonna say something like this when I say
Dallas I
and interpolation and then we're gonna
sing side of this let me see
like this okay
eat it or incomplete okay so depending
or was actually on the status of it then
we're going to actually add a class of
completed so let's say check
okay so check and then here we're gonna
say horse my status it was complete it
the Eagles complete it is gonna say
completed if not then it's gonna say
incomplete so save that okay
all right cool
so now the next thing that we got a dual
depending on the status kind of the same
thing right here so I'll say like this
so that should be good it should be the
same thing or I could just literally
have just said Horace that's that is and
it's kind of hilarious scanner hilarious
Peter angry and um if you look at my
last video Peter you're teaching me
something that I already know you know
that I think you should go look at my
last video that was doing life and
realize why I just don't feel like doing
it like that alright
you know everybody has their own way of
coding you don't have to Co like
everybody else you know everybody has
their own little thing you're not I mean
I actually like having the binds here
because this lets me know like what
exactly I'm using on this component now
is it the best way who knows but is a
happy that I have I like to look at the
constructor and then I see exactly which
which ones I have here you know what I
mean like so yeah man so when you're
trying to teach me something is like
Braille is like you know you're not
teaching me anything
all right so let me see that's like you
know that's like somebody who comes in
and tells you hey man you shouldn't do a
for loop when you could use a add a
filter or you could use a a four for
each or you could use a down map like
bro like everybody has their own way of
coding like you can't if the job gets
done you know hush alright so let me see
so we got free to fool JavaScript I
already did that one missing what's
going on with the data Oh course is that
J is Tom line creature proof got copy
twice okay complete
yeah man now that's like it it was like
when people come in and be like hey Joel
you know you could do this with flexbox
and I was like yeah you don't think I
know that you know what I mean like
sometimes people they want to sound
smart as eyebrow like you telling me
something that I already know do you
know you could do that would CSS grid is
like yeah but at the same time and it's
like I do in my own way I don't need to
do every single thing that comes out you
know it's like every single new tool any
single new way you got a do it the new
way because it's like it's like nah man
that's like I'm already used to doing it
like this you know what I mean all right
so let me see what else you got
classname thumb style
background-image:url okay so this is
from the course is this is fine okay so
what we have left okay we got this we
got courses okay click on courses shows
you this got the reviews okay got the
timeline so the timeline we're gonna do
it I don't know if I should do it in a
switch statement or maybe just use react
router so in case people come in and say
front end up here you'll still keep
track of their state yeah man check link
is working when I was channeling is
working I don't know if I'm gonna have a
settings section
yeah nah I definitely I don't mind where
people come in and be like hey you could
actually do it like this like it works
but then was like sometimes people would
just come in and be like pshh like they
want to be so smarter than the other
person and there's like brown like you
really don't understand that I've been
doing this for so long before you even
know what the hell was coding like you
know what I mean it's like come on man
put some respect with my name man oh
three yeah going there like go in there
like baby like yo put some
respect my name oh my god angry a man is
not cool best practices man people need
to stop people need to stop with best
practices man like to be honest with you
man you do know like every single year
people come up with new things like oh
this is best practices you do know that
right and it's like bro
if you if you go and follow every single
thing that says best practices that's
like your bro like like the amount of
stuff that you have to recode the amount
of stuff that you have to read change
because somebody on the internet says
best practices I've seen like the worst
things out there things that take you 20
minutes to do instead of doing it a
certain way which probably saves you
more time and people will be like oh
this is best practices like who came
where's the book was the book of best
practices
yo it's hilarious man all right um yeah
so let me see Oh Tom line let me see
what else yeah quick what else do I need
to do I want to have like a section when
they click phone in I wanted to actually
show up here um like a question of like
how many hours you're planning on doing
per week you know you know best
practices can work man but what I'm
saying is was best practices to one
person it's like it's not best practices
to other people you know it's like
people come up I could come up with my
own way of doing something and I could
say hey this is best practices right and
then next thing you know everybody is
following that and it's like there was
actually other better ways you know what
I mean it's like if somebody comes up to
you and be like hey man you know it's
like we don't want you to put anything
here don't bind anything right somebody
comes to you and tells you hey man we
don't we just don't want you to bind
anything my question would be like hey
oh why wouldn't I you know what I mean
like it's different ways of coding man
that's like right now if I could
literally come here and be like hey you
know instead of using a map how about I
wanted to do a for loop here you know
what I mean like if I come here and say
hey I'm gonna do a for loop how many
people are going to cry on the internet
and be like oh my god
you're not supposed to do whatever with
a for loop you're supposed to do it with
a map you get what I'm saying I hope you
understand what I'm saying like you know
it's like come on man
anyways maybe I don't have time to be
talking it's like I can't change
people's minds to have their you know
use their own brains I was like you do
however you want to do it
Yuko however you wanna call your if
you're better than whatever I'm doing go
ahead go ahead man it's funny how every
single time is like somebody comes in
like literally like trying to teach me
something like that I know you know what
I mean like okay so let me see learn
HTML CSS and by the way just in case
people worry on my react course I
literally explain bind and I explained
the arrow function you choose however
you want to do it you know it's called
different styles all right let me see so
we got front-end development there's
something I wanted to do I wanted to do
like a question okay so right below this
section I want to put in there if I'd be
I'm
I'm finding the time estimate or hours
per week to keep it simple all right so
okay we got this to use a h3 all right
okay so
many hours per week thing you put in
know how many hours per week what should
I put man how many hours per week how
many hours per week can you medicate now
change it later on
input type okay how many hours can you
devote all right
okay type 'text past name input type
text' class name should I name this
hours so let's go to Tom like the SCSS
front nh4 why should I put this okay so
we got check got item
okay not there you will choose path week
oh the president
just sent me a message on this court Joe
are you teaching live no this is just me
hanging out man I'm not teaching I'm not
this is just me coding man this site I'm
just coding I'm building my own site
I have no no specific guidelines I have
no high collars I'm not using types
crave I'm not using
yes l'ainte I'm not using none of that
stuff like this is just me coding this
is just me having fun building my site
you know it's just me chilling all right
so I'm
okay there's how many hours per week and
you devote this we're gonna take it from
say butter session transition should I
use this yeah it's gonna be the same
thing
okay so front-end age four hours all
right okay say H 3 fontsize to ram on
weight and hundred looks okay
bottom-5 rim king i was per week
all right so the hours change classname
hours
you
Harrison what the Harrison said Harrison
said if you have a second what is the
opinion of a transition for what
developer to being a software engineer
is the efficient learning path
if the macro goal is to work on a
start-up as a developer as a noob I
think you could always jump jump to
other different branches of development
so long as like you prepare yourself
because you know it's very different
from you know what development is one
thing what development is very
repetitive what development is pretty
much doing the same thing constantly
right software development a lot of
times you gotta have depending on the
app that you're working on you gotta
have a certain you know certain amount
of math which a lot of people who web
development don't have is the same thing
as data scientists as like you you have
to actually go out your way and it
really you know I'm working in those
fields in and try to you know better
yourself you know in those fields
because a lot of people they don't know
math like the mostly half is like
algebra you know and probably they
haven't gone to a class like let's say
calculus two or three or linear
equations like they haven't done any of
those classes or even matrixes and like
there's a lot of stuff right so
depending on the application that you're
working on you gotta have some type of
background in it so you can always jump
like it's always gonna look like let's
say you are a developer what developer
at a company for four years right and
then you say hey I want to become an iOS
developer as long as you have your your
projects and you know how to coding and
you pass the the interview questions you
have a really good chance of getting
hired because you already know what's
the process of being a developer and
like working in a team working you know
working with gay or you know like all
those things that is still part of
development doesn't matter what branch
it is if it's gaming if it's you know
mobile apps software development but
like I said you have to get into certain
languages like also - you got to like
Java C sharp what else I mean even
Python you could create some software
out of it it's this livestand bits yes
it is live sir we're live we're just
hanging out we just hanging out we just
chilling you know hanging out with the
peoples on a Saturday morning you know
just just chilling coding coding away
answering questions when people ask me
questions you know get into I'm learning
stuff from people in the chatroom it's
gonna be like we you see a coding man
you know I started yesterday guys you
know like all I know is jQuery you know
you know that's all I know I've been you
know I started six months ago you know
I'm not really a developer I'm just like
some dude that you know I just fake it
you know everything this whole room is
it is in VR this is not real this is not
really my house there's not really my
lights this is not really my computer
you know I was like all of the stuff is
rented you know
everything is free guys you know my
accent is fake I'm actually British you
know I mean but what if I came one day
with a British accent
you know people be like whoa like Joe is
not from the hood Joe was not Joe ain't
got the sauce Joe is like straight from
you know from London London in town you
know what I mean like I'm from London
I'm actually a marketing guy you know I
know nothing about coding you know you
guys probably could teach me more than
what I know I just started yesterday I'm
six months in guys you know that's like
the Slovakian careful guy's name he goes
like listen man I think you you've been
around for six months yo sometimes you
find stuff online like you'll be like yo
man people are like like I just started
yesterday guys I'm six months in you
know what I mean I never touch any real
money out of this I'm I'm just here you
know I'm bamboozling people you know I
mean I'm fake so let's go everybody
Saturday man inside of the man do you
use
yes I use Redux but only when I need to
I try not to use it constantly like if I
don't need you know to have like a
global state to keep track of everything
like I don't think for this website even
for this website was like thinking about
it was like yo I don't even think I need
I don't even need how you call is like a
back-end for this because my back-end in
reality is like the only thing that
people got a registered to is actually
um is the the teachable calm for you
know for the hosting services nobody
else need to sign up to anything to the
website so I was like you know I don't
need a back-end I could literally just
spun this whole application with just
regular no GS nothing too crazy and
actually just be like yo keep everything
on a browser you know either keep it
through sessions session storage and
like keep everybody's options to layer
you know if like hey man if you freaking
cleaned up your your cookies or you know
you can't you clear your cache that's on
you you know what I mean like you know
the reason we're all sounds one hat bro
this is what I call this model this mine
is my you know my little west coast I'm
in my West Coast vibe you know straight
home
chillin straight combo kick straight
from a comp oh you know what I mean
you know I mean so yeah Joe have you
heard of about dr. Rocking
I'm taking computer science they are
using this program not having used it to
be honest let me see do you use Parcells
to set up your project no Parcells good
for what it is like if you want to spin
up something real quick it's fine but I
don't know man like that that you know
we did that portfolio page and I was
like I don't know if I'm gonna be using
Parcells for everything like I use if I
want to show somebody something real
quick or react but then at the same time
it's like why would you use this thing
too when you have create react app you
know it's like you could use that other
than parcel I don't know it's weird you
know what I mean like I will say it's
weird
parcel Jes is weird I mean I have it
there on the website some people like it
some people don't
you know what I mean so yeah man like
be honest with you guys I rather use my
web developer starter kit because I
could actually go in there and like
going there and just like customize it
however to how I want you know I mean so
yeah anyways man let me check something
real quick let me check my emails so
what I'm attic
let me see what people send me today I
got a whole bunch of portfolios I got a
review man I'm sorry to everybody that
been hey me up man like you know I
behind me up and let go you my thing
dad
sorry guys I gotta check the emails we
gotta be here live
don't
they're not
money may money me you guys should
definitely check out this guy call our
money back yo money back yo his stuff is
pretty dope man he's killing the game
right now money meant money meant money
made money meant money my money my money
so what you guys gonna be working on
this weekend man let me know I'm
interested interested interested to know
what the hell you guys is out
we're happy was hot man yeah I was
filing your portfolio tutorial on
YouTube was great both were you planning
to edit ended with another video yes
there's a whole bunch of videos man
there's a whole bunch of videos you go
to my website man like it's all there
it's free
take advantage you know the reason why I
put it in is because I was seeing that
nobody's watching it you know what I
mean
so if nobody's watching I'm like you
know what I'm not gonna put on YouTube
I'm gonna put it to the people that go
to my website and that's what I did you
know so that was the whole thing about
it I was like you know what I'm just
gonna instead of doing that I'm just
gonna you know money made money made
money man
Oh God so many emails emails people send
me emails guys I ask you - most emails
but it's like if you like asking for
like your homework hey come on man I
don't got time for that man
you know those be hitting me up like
y'all was like hey man I got I got this
homework that I got a dual like bro like
you don't think I got other stuff to do
like for real man I actually helped out
I can give you an advice but as like
duals as I can it's like I gotta do this
PHP app for my you know for my
programming class or whatever and it's
like bro like I got to do I got
 to do I can't be doing your work or
even at that when people send me like
their projects in a zip file
I'm like bro I'm not opening your zip
file like I'm being honest you have to
go out your way and upload it somewhere
github Heroku or something so I can see
the project I'm not gonna go in there
Endor
npm install and run your whole project
and debug your project I can't
I just don't have the time you know what
I mean yeah this this whole bunch of
issues what Parcell man i Parcells go
for what it is but it doesn't even give
you like correct answers like or like
hey this thing didn't work because of
this you know like it doesn't do that
for you
money money
you finished
Craigslist app no I haven't started it I
gotta start it up on this week I got a
lot of stuff to do man yeah I'm just
trying to finish this this website just
to get it done you know give people the
new upgrades and then from there I could
start working on this react react the
course building the Craig slurs app was
react and then yeah I just got that song
in my head man I got that song it's
called I forgot the name of the name of
the song boy is buy money back yo and lo
baby like that song is hot it's fire man
I would play it but then Google will
probably brand me you're saying
yeah the blog app is already done
go to the website he's already done in
there that's already finito it's just a
simple crud
to the site man guys haven't been there
in a while man let me see how many
people I got on the website Raymond out
of the early Saturday see how many
people we got on the site right now
let's see let's see let's see we got a
few people what's today's date February
3rd got a few people in there definitely
got a lot of new users yesterday so
that's always good
amen
you guys got to start
applications man it's in the the blog is
in the Ruby on Rails course go to Ruby
on Rails you will see it there it's the
last project the last section of of the
course yeah man that's why we're here
and that's why I put myself out here man
you know so people get could get
motivated you know I get a lot of hate I
get a lot of hate right and there's a
lot of people that be like I just don't
like this dude or oh I'm smarter than
this guy oh I'm doing better than this
guy there's a lot of people who hate on
me but at the same time like I know what
I'm doing I'm doing something positive
um basically motivating other people to
come in and be like yo if this guy could
do it I could do it you get what I'm
saying so that's what I'm doing out here
you know so I really appreciated that
you subscribing you're coming through
you know there's a lot of stuff that
you're gonna learn here man like if
you're you're trying to get into the
industry and you pretty much you're just
trying to get in and like and like you
know you're trying to get in as soon as
possible
like this is the best best website the
best YouTube channel to really be with
you know cuz a lot of times people
coming here and they waste a lot of time
man you know like let's say for me like
when I started learning to code like I
needed to get a job ASAP man I didn't
have time to go in then be like hey man
this this is go in there and look at
every you know computer science theory I
got one point I was like man maybe I
should goes back to school to go and
learn computer science I was like you
know what I don't have time for that you
know what I mean like that could have
been good if I would have been like 16
17 years old and I would have found
coding and I would have had any type of
support
you know I would've came in and said oh
cool I'm gonna go to school and study
computer science you know cuz I have
time the point is like after you like 24
after 24 25 years old like you got bills
to pay you got things that you got a do
you got a you know you want to hang out
with your family you wanna hang out with
your friends like all you want to do is
get your job you know and you learn
everything as you go right and that's
why I think this this website in this
channel is Golding it you know is like
is getting people to the point that
they're higher you know it's like you
could fall into the deep end right you
know like we could fall into the deep
end and be like hey man was faster for
each loop or for loop or can we do was
better at for loop or a while loop it's
like to be honest with you you can fall
into the deep end of that if you're into
it you can fall really deep into that
but when you just out here you like you
know I need a job I need to start
working on e I'll learn this stuff as I
go then this this freaking thing this
website this channel is perfect for you
cuz I know what it is to be like hey I
just need to start working I can't spend
time you know pondering on like hey man
do we bind this do we do we do an arrow
function here that we did now I don't
have time for that you know I mean like
it's like if you have time you have time
and Peter I'm just playing with you and
just bring that up but it's like if you
fall into that world of like man you
know it's like what's the most efficient
wait what's the fastest way what's the
best practice what's the like all this
stuff you could fall into a deep end you
could literally spend two three years
and never find a job you know you could
literally fall into that deep end and be
like oh man I'm trying to be one of the
smartest guys out there me I never
aspired to that what I aspire was to
just come in and just keep growing as I
keep learning right
growing as I keep learning okay so
everything that I do it has to have you
know a budget at the end of the day you
know what I mean has to have a back you
know I don't go and learn things if it
doesn't bring any type of money to me if
it you know like that's just how I am
you know what I mean and like I think a
lot of like developers developers like
you know a developers developer right
right like they'll probably hate the
type of person that I am right they're
like oh man you're not supposed to do it
for money
oh man you're not supposed you're
supposed to do this for the love and
doesn't that and there's like when you
start breaking it down and you you split
up the the people and you be like you
haven't been where I've been you haven't
gone through the struggles that I've
gone through you you you know you live
from papi and mami papi and mami buy you
everything papi and mami take care of
you I had no papi you know what I mean
I'm out here in this world my mom never
helped me out with I'm literally
everything that I do is on my own and
there's a lot of people out there like
me you know what I mean so it's like you
know a developers developer will be like
oh man he's doing it he's doing it for
the wrong reason it's like nah man this
is a job this is not a thing with like
it's not a cult a spiritual cult where
it's like we dream we eat we lived we
freaking we breathe code it's like nah
it's like I come in here is for a guap
right I go in there for the guac right I
could have been doing anything in the
world if there's money in it that's
where I'm at you know what I'm saying
because I need it I didn't have the
options of just sitting down in like hey
let's figure out you know like what's
the what's the most efficient way we
don't have time for that you know
there's people like me that just don't
have that time you know it's like the
main reason why I tell people don't go
to boot camps go into a boot camp is not
for everybody if you're somebody who is
already in debt if you're somebody who
who
trying to you know better yourself and
is like you don't got that little
cushion like a lot of people got
cushions you know what I mean like
there's people who got cushions you get
what I'm saying like it's like a little
Johnny decided to study sociology right
and he goes to college he has a hundred
thousand dollar debt right decided to go
to let's say University of Pennsylvania
all right let's say Penn State comes out
of there were a hundred thousand dollar
plus freaking debt right he has he has
that cushion where he's like oh yeah
he's like oh I messed up that there's no
jobs for sociology can you hold me down
can you send me to a boot camp like
that's not me that's not my story you're
gonna say it's like you know it's like
exactly I don't have a three-month
cushion you know that's just not me you
know same so it's like I feel like this
channel is not for everybody to be
honest with you you know probably out of
you know a hundred percent of the people
are coming here about 45 47 percent
subscribe the rest leave because this
channel is not for everybody this
channel is not for the dudes who's like
me what's the most efficient way what's
the fastest way to do this it's like nah
bro like this is what's the most
efficient way to get to their back
that's what I'm here for you know if
you're here for you're here for that you
get what I'm saying like there's plenty
of channels I always tell people guys if
you really want to get more intellectual
when it comes to coding and in learning
to code go check out our fun fun
function right he's a guy that could
really go in there and explain to you
like really deep you know everything
about JavaScript right he he has the
time you know he has the time to do that
you know it's like if we were to put his
background and my background like
head-to-head and we did like you know
how they used to do back in a you know
back in the days like us two circles and
yes like hey this is fun function this
is Joe Santos Garcia aka coding phase
right our backgrounds are completely
different they're barely will be
anything in the middle right that we
have that is compatible you know it's
like I don't live in that world you know
what I'm saying like I just I don't
unfortunately I wish I did I wish I I
would have had you know you know that
freaking private school you know I could
have been like hey man I got accepted to
a four-year school man I got acceptance
of Syracuse right which is not even like
the best way is like still a pretty cool
University here in New York and I didn't
go you know why I didn't go because I
was like I'm not gonna put that debt on
myself and on my mom when I know we
don't even have money to be be going to
all this stuff yeah a Venn diagram right
so it's like I just don't have that you
gonna say like I'm not in that world I
live in
in the struggle I live on like y'all we
we survive by any means you know what I
mean
I just happen to do it legally and you
know and I happen to be somebody who's
interested in technology but anything
that I would have decided my mining I
could have made money on because when
you against a wall and you like kill
there is no backup there is no there is
no I know how you call there's no
cushion there that's it you know what
I'm saying like you know it's like when
I see people when you know I see on the
news like kids to bad things and like
people rob people do all this crazy
stuff I'm like man people don't you know
it's just like that movie scarf is like
you need me to be the bad guy so you
could point your fingers and be like yo
that's the back alright but you don't
put yourself in the shoes of the bad guy
right you don't know his background you
don't know you know all the things that
he went through you don't know you know
he probably didn't even have no parents
went to a shelter to shelter like
there's certain things that people just
don't put themselves in other people's
shoes you know I was watching ty Lopez
just to just to watch but he said
something that that's exactly why I
can't ever win because he said something
like oh I don't put myself in other
people's shoes and it's like wait what
like you know it's like how can you not
put yourself in other people's shoes you
gotta put yourself in other people's
shoes so you can understand them you
know I was like the same thing with you
know where whatever a clever programmer
when I was like 10 I haven't like bro
you just charging too much like his
audience is like all Indians like most
of the people that are his his uh his
subscribers are like all Indians
Southeast Asians and a lot of those guys
don't even have money like that so it's
like they support you they come to
YouTube and support you but then you
don't support them back and give them
something that they could afford guys
cannot afford $500 course you can want
to see and it's the same thing as me
like I know
what's my audience like if you're here
for the debate of like what is the
fastest thing what's the you know it's
like hey man somebody wrote the best
practices yesterday and you got a jump
on it tomorrow
and it's like that's not what my channel
is about
That's not me you gonna say like you
keep that you know yeah I tell people
all the time man if you feel like you
were smarter you know more than me
man go ahead keep that well I know I go
to the back you don't know saying like I
go to the back I'm you know you ever
heard of this is a great line man my
favorite all-time i'ma tell you right
now this is I've been wanting to get
this like tattoo this there's a crazy
line from from Cameron for those of you
guys that don't know Cameron is my my
favorite rap all-time
but and the reason why I gravity so much
the hip-hop is because they telling
stories that resonate to me you gotta
say like that I could listen to like
I'll go in and is like you know I will
you know you look into the background of
Elon Musk right I don't look up to Elon
Musk he's like I could respect him but
me and him don't have nothing that we
can you know we can relate to so this is
mine and I think I should have tools
like once in a while like just bring it
up here on the channel
so I am maybe I'll curse on this video
so camera said this is a great verse
because it's so true this how humor in
my whole life it's like go ahead stupid
go with them chicks I'm a dirty
little piggy I'm a with them breaks
better yet the bakery
I got pies and cakes nigga stink
doublings turning five to eight I turned
eight to twenty twenty to a hundred
hundred to a thousand that to a hundred
thousand in front of housing close to
more dog no one's allowed in I'm copying
everything I'm done with browsing it's
the top down black palm calm get your
 rock ma like a scene rockmar like
and I'm extra scary CEOs or the front
ain't necessary a secretary
order information getting necessary they
love they love like 14 for February I
play them like April Fool's before I
slide off I could be a March 2nd sound
like July 4th Halloween or Memorial Day
at you more real be at your memorial be
one year from today all yeah I think is
peace and peachy I'll leave you recent
PC all my bitches rock christening to
your BCBG round phone eNOS get the
heebie-jeebies
you get one sound like you're around
phony dudes those who earth is not like
you you start getting shivers you like
man you know it's like I can't be around
this dudes you know I'm saying
you know I mean but it's like think it's
a perfect thing it's like those think
that doubling is turning five to eight I
turned eight to twenty twenty to a
hundred one hundred to a thousand a
thousand to a hundred thousand do in
front of housing you can when I say like
if you don't know what that means you
don't understand what that is then this
channel is not sake like everything that
I do is for a reason you know what I'm
saying like a lot of people they just
don't you know we are how you cause I'm
compatible you know saying yeah so let's
go back to coding man yeah all my
courses focus on projects they don't
focus on like the syntax like I have a
whole section in the beginning of a
syntax and then at the end we built a
project and then we have multiple other
projects that basically they follow
along with things that make you
understand them more like let's say you
can come in and do the HTML CSS then
from there you come in and do the
Builder responsive app then from there
you come in and you do advanced the
assessed and from there you learn sass
like a pro which basically takes CSS and
makes it easier for you you know all the
things that you have to do with CSS you
cannot do it
you know you could target elements
easier with sass and you go add like
little functions definitely you have
Park template engine which pretty much
what it does it helps you write HTML
like static HTML like easier because
it's like now you're using a template
engine so you don't have to constantly
keep on changing each page then from
there you learn future-proof JavaScript
which is just basically all the the
syntax of JavaScript that you need
be proficient right there from day you
learn jQuery and the reason why I put
jQuery is because you need to learn
jQuery because a lot of the jobs as a
junior developer they are expecting you
to already know jQuery you know people
go online but at OU I don't even own
jQuery and it's like bro if you're a
junior developer most likely you're
gonna have to you know edit or change a
couple of things that are in legacy code
you know order the the websites before
2013 we're done with jQuery or even to
this day this a lot of websites being
done with you know with jQuery so you
gotta get on there definitely you gotta
build a restaurant web app which teaches
you hyper hyper mts which is a easier
way to like learning a react so we build
a full single page app and then after
that then we you learn basically react
ES and build a full real estate filter
page right so that teaches you
everything about react and how to work
with forms how to deal with global State
how to deal with local state so all
those things you learn it you know what
I'm saying so
your courses have a path to follow yeah
that's exactly what I have the time line
and that's what I'm building right now
I'm rebuilding the time line to be a
more I don't know like a better
experience a better experience for
people and then they could actually find
out how long it's gonna take them to
finish the whole the whole path you know
cuz people come in and be like oh I'm
gonna I'm gonna learn this I'm gonna do
this and then they put in one hour a day
and there's like you put one hour a day
it's gonna take you six months to learn
all this stuff right you put in three
hours you might make it like two to
three months right and not only that
that you have to build to build a
portfolio you need at least one month of
building you know four to five different
projects in each project if you created
a project that you're putting on your
portfolio and it took you a day that
means that's not a good project being
honest with you it has to be a project
that takes you a week minimum and that's
how you know if if it's actually a legit
project because if it takes you that
long that means you're putting a lot of
work into it you don't want to show
somebody your portfolio and have like a
whole bunch of little apps that took you
oh this one took you one hour this one
took you three hours like nobody cares
about those I'm being honest on yeah
oh yeah man yeah that's the thing
people like you know I don't think
freako camp is bad I don't think Kok
course was a KOCO is no coke addict I
mean none of those places are bad but
the thing is that you gotta build things
you gotta build projects to really
understand it's like I could go in and
follow along everything from a frico
camp if I didn't know anything by the
end after you do like you know 2030
hours inside a frico camp you still
don't know how to build a website you
know cuz if you follow alone just follow
along it's like oh yeah you got the
answer but then later on after five five
problems later you don't remember what
happened on the first project on the
first problem so it's like you got a
building so your brain can start
thinking of how to break layouts how to
program how to code you know yeah man
definitely the V car has a lot of CSS
stuff that you know you could definitely
put in that work can you imagine working
for home they are making forty five
thousand a year that's the dream man I
mean right now I could do it I was
telling my wife I was like yo like once
I finish paying off my car like you know
I still got like another I don't know
maybe like 45,000 left to pay in my car
like once I finish paying my car then
you know I'm gonna take some time to go
to the R for like a month or two you
know gotta get the baby his part his
passport you know rent like a nice
little Villa for like $800 a month you
know be right next to the beach you know
kind of hard
ml350 2015 sports how you call it like
with all the all the different features
whatever features they have every
feature every single thing that comes
with that car I have it and I was gonna
get I wanted to get another car I was
gonna get a Maserati but because I was
gonna have a kid then it didn't make
sense cuz even now I'm like yo what all
the stuff that we have in the car like I
feel like I want to get like a big
suburban like what's the name of like a
Tahoe cuz I have I'll be carrying you
know the baby see carrying the freaking
the stroller and a whole bunch of stuff
and it's like you know
yeah man
Dominican Republic is cheap bro
Dominican Republic is cheap cheap cheap
guys
why not
moving to no handyman lets me man I
ain't moving to no Haiti unless I don't
know I wouldn't even feel comfortable
moving to Haiti to be honest with you
it's like I will feel bad cuz like so
much poverty there now how can you you
know some people that still lived it
like they live like really bad and then
you live like in a mansion or something
while people around you is like starving
like that's not right stay any platform
just use mine use my web developer start
a cape man you own that joint yes sir
own it own it listen you know leasing I
always thought that you know leasing was
gonna be cool but leasing your reality
is just renting a car like my car is
mines you know what I mean I got to
whatever I want like the other day the
baby dropped something on it
I was out cool whatever it's my car if I
would have been leasing I'm gonna oh my
god don't drop anything on the seat like
I don't care but definitely once I
finish paying that off
you know by the end of the year I think
I can throw like an extra 20 on it to
try to like just freakin finish pain and
off as soon as possible because when you
own something like you owe it to the
bank or whatever it's like that's like a
ball boring change
you know it's like a ball and chain on
your leg is like you can't really go
wherever you want because you still got
to pay that car off yeah I just don't
like leasing leasing is I find leasing
is like just renting a car that's not
your car you know it's like you know
when people come in it's like I see a
lot of people that I know that be kind
of stunts they're like man
so yeah just pulled out the new whatever
the new m3 whatever and I'm like bro I
said it's not even yours man you Lisa
Nash it for 300 bucks I'm paying almost
$800 for my car like you know like I'm
not I'm not freaking looking at your
leased car like oh you know I hate when
people do that and be like oh I got
these new cars I brought you least a
 like you rent the Nash it in two
years you got to give that back and
that better not pass no miles that
ship better not have a scratch if not
you're gonna
yeah man yeah I got pantyhose let me see
what's going on with this thing
if you know better baby you do better
let me see what's going on with this
thing
lemme see was going no let me see what's
going on Babel that RC gave me some
issues plugins
so let's guy was gay was gay a hundred
bucks up a hundred bucks
now I'm not balling man I'm just a
regular
man letting everything I do is fake out
here
that's not really my car and everything
is rented you know what I mean your fake
everything I do is fake man I really
have a sadder view that's what I really
have you know we let it be you know what
I mean let people think what they want
to think you know
let me see okay see if this thing work
y'all run watch Oh what the hell
turn off my magical obsessed man gulps
ass is annoying
sometimes I
really annoying is it cold or just his
face amen
you can be bowling man I think everybody
could get to the point where it's like I
mean when you think about it what is
balling and when you think about it
boiling is when you get to a point where
whatever you want you could get right
now there's definitely guys who are just
like get it to another level where say
hey man I want to buy an island but it's
like do you need an island you get what
I'm saying Lane there's a regular person
of a regular human being need island
know you know I'm saying like that's why
I was like I get Thai sometimes when
people they try to abuse it when
it Prada you know they try to do too
much we can't miss a wetback failed
missing class properties transform okay
so what's going on with this she was
going
with this thing missing class properties
transform see what's the issue with this
debugging
see the be able to RC be mood that our
see what's going on with this thing
you
okay so transform class property full
strip types for object that's read
spread yes 2015
okay so we got presets okay
Saida presets we put in the plugins
presets
all right watch let's see if it works
okay still give me same freaking problem
missing class properties transform what
the hell why isn't it working your
presets
okay
okay work try transform classifies
the plugins that I helped was including
pack aside JSON just one okay let me see
sometime this web pack thing be annoying
be annoying as hell that's for sure
Danko DeFazio audiences the church
people check in in between prayers
and
the our Columbia's cheap with this thing
it worked ok console.log front end this
tower prop see front end look so what
the hell is going on
built module bill failed syntax error
missing class property transformed oh
isn't this working
okay so is one if it's seen react this
stage zero yes that's what I have but
let me see
it's a wetback run watch still look yeah
it gets frustrating sometimes man yes it
has a babel RC file but semi module
fails syntax error missing class
properties transform so I'll try to
figure out
why this is not working can you see our
new run watch as he who works nope Jesus
Christ what the I hate like this
certain things in JavaScript like I hate
it like because it's like you got to do
so much stuff man
okay Jesus Christ what is going on okay
let me look at this thing
make a look at the code okay run and
loop is not working because of the type
of syntax that we have but what's going
on with this why this thing is telling
me webpack failed with exit makes a call
to module bill fails syntax error
missing class property transfer form let
me see impact I can fake we try to get
in here see
is 2613 presets ignore can't be able
that are see let's see if we try putting
this at the top debugging it wait to
pass the Saturday debugging stuff from
freaking Jesus Christ
you
so we trading with a overseas which
stage there were to be after es2015
compiles it okay so something inside at
the web pack that config okay so let me
see what's the loaders
yes 2013 that's annoying
alright so I know it when you you have
something that's supposed to work but it
doesn't work and you're like wait what's
going on
why isn't this thing working and it's
like now I don't want to work okay I
gotta ask
your thoughts on the web developer
starter kit would increase calm got a
fixed step just in case somebody bumps
into that issue later on
okay so package.json edit okay alright
so I'm just adding a couple of things
Babel plug-in transfer class properties
all right I just wanted to show you guys
the other way of doing it they're like
Joe I don't know what you're talking
about binding this and and that so I say
you know what let me show it to to the
guy guys I also have this court here if
you guys want to send me questions
this Court is perfect especially when
I'm live because it goes directly to my
phone it's like you're texting me you
know what I mean so basically you add
this thing here okay you gotta also add
the way of the people that are see so
you gotta put into plugins plugins
transform class properties you add that
okay then you go to web pack that config
you go to
rulz options presets then you got es2015
you got stages a row okay everything is
good okay so we refresh this all right
so what exactly that I just do I just
added a couple of changes and it was to
show the guy that text me from this
court what exactly I was talking about
with the other key P tur he was saying
how do you like why do you use bind and
this is just like a preference this is
not like this is up to you if you want
to do like this usually I do it like
this for certain reasons like if I wanna
you know I just want to keep track of
the things that I have like the the
functions that I have in this class I
usually just like to keep it here right
now you could do the same thing instead
of binding it you can literally just
come here and go like this say the name
of the function and then you say equals
two and then you use the arrow function
so now when you come down here and you
say this that front end loop you don't
have to actually bind it to up here okay
but that's up to you that's if you want
to do it that way okay
so I just wanted to show it to the kid
like what the hell exactly we was
talking about in the beginning of the
video and like this like multiple ways
of doing this like I've seen this thing
done a whole bunch of different ways so
the ish the error that I was getting
before was
was this which it says missing class
properties transform so if you don't
have your people that are see set up in
a certain way like you gotta have
plugins like this isn't like a default
you know what I mean like this isn't
default this isn't something default
that comes with Babel like you have to
set up the plug-in and say hey I want to
use this this doesn't come by default
alright so that's one of the main
reasons to why I don't use it like that
because it's like now you you adding
extra complexity to two things that
don't need to be more complex you go to
say just to save you from not writing
that buying this you know saying like I
don't know I find myself a lot of times
that like yo the annoying
annoyance of setting something up the
doesn't wait more than just doing
something quick like we had to set this
up on the plugins here we had to set it
up on the web pack we had to make sure
we added it to the package that JSON so
we had to add it here just to pretty
much safe run and loop here instead of
saying this that front end loop equals
to this that front end loop find this
and that my friends is why I say is it
worth it was it worth did we save time
did we get anything you know I was like
sometimes whatever like man people be
like it's best practices it's like who
came up with the best practices who's
the one that says this is best practice
you get what I'm saying like I don't
know what you know how it is man
anything is a JavaScript it's all
confusing javascript is not confusing
it's just now people make him more
complicated than what it needs to be
born to gamble got my picture as his
icon is that Bob bugs nice just I'm
literally been coding for like every
single day is like my eyes is watering I
need to get like but the cold I've I
scenes my eyes feels dry as hell but
it's fine plus the baby didn't let us
sleep at all last night so we're like
zombies Rainer yeah
to gamble you're hilarious man let me
see what else yeah so let's get back to
coding okay
cuz I still gotta get this done so we
got this thing here okay when I click on
this I want to be able to pop up let's
show this area here how many hours per
week can you devote all right you know
and just to show you guys like you know
a lot of times you might think like Oh
react as difficult reactors dis and that
no it's not
you literally all you have to do is go
to react documentation right like you
don't even have to be an expert like you
don't have to remember every single
thing so you got hello we're introducing
JSX component handling events okay so
let's say I'll click all right so let's
say this right handling click so let's
say for example we wanted to pass this
down we say ok we're gonna create a
click event right so if you just by
following the documentation you want it
to you can just literally say hey I'm
doing a click event so use like ok I'm
handling an event so automatically you
see Oh unclick so now you come here so
ok cool so that's how you do it you come
here you say on click ok then you say
choose
this choose the tools whose path alright
so as you can see this handles the click
when that's clicked it tells you hey
prevent default you can set it up like
that like you can pass in the event and
then you can say prevent e4 and just
constant lock whatever right so what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna come here and you
know just for Peter should we just do it
now I'm not in the mood for that I'm
just gonna do it how I like to do it so
I'm gonna say is that let me see okay F
equals to this choose path I bind this
hey cool so now we got this so this that
choose path and then we're gonna say
bind no I know
and then here we got a pass in it is
that we just clicked and I'm gonna save
that did I even create it
no I have a creator
I've only got an error okay choose path
I don't know that I create it already
Oh click no I haven't created it
okay so we got choose path and we're
gonna say console.log works youtubers
box and fights the word put that mean
face of like yo dudes trying to get our
refund on day 29 after he does every
single course on the website as I came
