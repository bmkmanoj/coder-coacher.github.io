been so shrieking focusing you know this
YouTube thing and focus on everything
else in my personal life that I've been
doing like to the African Way so best

phone you know burning phone yeah cuz
you know that's what we do we buy phones
out here we phone phone balling right

wall of this one plus two is a
piece of don't buy this Chinese
phones man their piece of stay with
a Korean even if it blows up in your
pocket but yeah um yes all right change
the freaking phone and whatever so

time and I see everybody's talking about
elixir this and this and that you know
what ever elixir man I'm not messing
with a lecture
I don't care by mixer I really don't
like I don't care about functional
programming not a functional programming

mean so i suggest you guys do the same
thing yeah i don't have to buy from you
to me there's other places and stuff for
its entry house whatever you guys decide
to do but keep learning never stop
learning because if you don't learn
things you just freaked me you stuck in
the same level while other people that
are out there like me that you know they
bust ass every day and keep on learning
keep on learning keep on learning until
they reach a certain goal where they
happen like right now where I'm at I
feel like I'm not happy there because I

it reminds me too much as the fronted
you know how in the front angry you have
to worry about 30 different browsers

native like something works one or my
iphone but then it doesn't work on my
android so if it works on the android my
