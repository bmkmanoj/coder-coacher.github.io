back at it again make sure you subscribe
make sure you like this video
man all right guys listen so I just
bumped into this question on Quora uncom
it's no js' declining already right
people are asking that and I don't know
if it's declining or there's just a
certain need for it right and a lot of
people come up with this new new ways to
you know measure things and be like hey
this is popular this is not popular this
is what's going on in the industry this
was not going on in the industry and
like everybody always come up with
indeed a comic to me I think in vidcom
is is a good way to somehow measure a
little bit well the jobs that are out
there on nodejs or you know any
programming language or any technology
right but what do I really think I don't
think that even with indeed comrade it
can't tell you the right the right
answer of this right is no genius
declining already and the reason why I
say that is because if you look online
and let's say we go to an vidcom and say
no js' right now let me see you try to
find normal withholding exact words you
see me try to look online give me one
sec oh well as I work in exact phrase
all right okay so it says there's 5740
jobs which is not bad for no js'
developer which is actually pretty good
all right but sometimes you can't go by
the numbers of and be calm
at all for one main reason that when you
go online and you search nodejs and you
say no js' all right it could be an OGS
job or it could also be anything else
out there like sometimes companies do
this and they start putting in keywords
online on their advertising on their you
know on their freaking job listings and
they say hey no Jes we're looking for
somebody who knows no js' Python Ruby on
Rails started off right when it comes to
those things it kind of messes up the
numbers because now it starts giving
jobs to know des as if it was an OGS
position were they looking for no js'
developer so to me it kind of messes it
up right because this is not a great way
to know if it's actually declining or
right I think in the last few years it
has gone up right but then at the same
time there's companies who are just
noticing Adam whereas I hate nodejs is
great but there's a lot of other
technologies are you know programming
languages frameworks that are actually
just as good or better for our business
right because no GIS is not good for
every business out there no js' is good
for certain type of dog businesses that
might use its functionalities because
it's written in JavaScript doesn't mean
it's it's simple because you think
yeah I'm gonna have so everything's
gonna be JavaScript and we just gotta
hire everybody who knows JavaScript and
everything's gonna be super dandy and
everybody could speak to each other
because at the same language sometimes
that doesn't matter in a business
sometimes it's like right now and like
we search no Diaz's a PHP programmer
comes up but still they're still looking
for nodejs it still shows up with all
you know nodejs and it's like it kind of
messes up the numbers but like I was
saying like I don't know if it's going
down almost declining or not I think a
lot of people like it I like it too
I wish there were a more stable version
of nodejs something that instead of them
changing it every you know every four or
five months and we'll say hey this is no
J yes this is what we're going to have
for the next year the next two years and
you could be sure that this is going to
be the language that you're going to
learn there's going to be the framework
that you're going to learn you're gonna
have all these tools I will agree with
that but right now for me personally I
think node.js is unstable is you know
sometimes you download a package and you
like oh yeah I'm working on this library
and then next thing you know they update
the library and now everything breaks
and that can happen in other languages
and frameworks but this happens
constantly with nodejs this is why
people constantly have to use wasn't nvm
or alphabet beneath where is like you
got to keep track what version of know
you're using because of it
right so if I'm a business owner I'm
gonna choose something that's solid
something that's gonna be like hey this
is the language there's gonna or the
framework whatever that we're gonna use
for the next five to ten years so a lot
of people are noticing that and I work
in industry I work as a full-time
developer I know companies that have
specifically said hey we're not gonna
use no GS because it's not stable it's
not something that we can say hey and we
choose
this version this is the best version
for the next three to five years or even
more sometimes companies create
something that I hate we're going to
stick with this for the next 10 years a
lot of times nodejs is not that it is
good for you know startups where or like
let's take a quick project or you know
something like that but I don't know if
it's great for you know a major business
to say hey we're going to run everything
- no no Jas especially when you don't
have a legit framework there's not a
legit framework out there like Ruby on
Rails or let's say something like
laravel like there's nothing out there
like it right for nodejs there's $1 -
yes but it's literally one guy building
this frickin thing he can't do it by
himself if the community wanted to go
behind them and help them out that
Adonis tears will be an amazing
framework but right now
I just don't see it now is that hurting
nodejs and one of the reasons why it's
declining yes I'll say it declined a
little bit declined a little bit because
the height is not there no more you know
if you want to join the hype you're
gonna join the hype of goal goal and
you're gonna join the hype of crystalman
you're gonna join the hype of elixir
length well whether it looks about out
of office like Erlang or elixir right so
that's what I think
all right now yours no simple job back
at it again kono face.com listen
sometimes the numbers like you know when
it comes to samples like that no jsk
could be in a decline right now and not
everybody knows it because like you
searched nodejs online you think oh yeah
this there's a whole bunch of jobs for
nodejs developers but when you look
online it's not it's not really just no
js' they have a whole bunch of different
skills that they're looking for is like
right now
perfect example architecting utilizing
JavaScript build automation tools grunt
gulp nodejs so now they put nodejs on it
right automatically even though this
position has nothing to do with nodejs
all they care about is they do you know
how to use npm right and somehow now
this gets attributed to know GS
there was an interview on I think was it
happy hour javascript happy hour the
podcast where they were talking about
only one out of five people are actually
using NPM for nodejs apps right
but somehow nodejs and NPM gets put
together and then now whenever you going
to say oh do you know how to use NPM now
all they say is do you know no js' but
reality you don't even need to use
node.js for that position
so now nodejs is getting those numbers
attributed to it so it's like it kind of
lies what's really going on in the
industry all right because like all this
stuff is like there's a whole bunch of
jobs for front-end jobs and somehow they
always put nodejs so you know no js'
there's like the job is not for no dias
the job is for a front-end developer and
hey do you know npm all right guys make
sure you subscribe make sure you like
this video
your boy is back wow GGG you already
knows your boy Joe back at it again man
listen make sure you subscribe and make
sure you like this video man by the way
if you want to know exactly what
questions I took to become a web
developer they right there in the
description it's no secret it's nothing
crazy is no secret gift that I had it's
just pretty much I took the courses
they're pretty cheap they're like $15
beads on specials and just this mask
