back again calling face.com man listen
let's get this man let's get this
Netflix project going man that's how you
gonna learn HTML CSS trust me everybody
could go in and teach you you know every
single thing that you could do with CSS
or every single tag that's out there for
HTML the reality of things is if you're
not building something that you're gonna
care about you really not gonna
understand it you know building a cool
page for like let's say a Netflix app or
whatever
Netflix website like this is something
that you're gonna understand how
everything works and then on your own
time if you want to learn more of you
know ask you you know you find different
problems then you continue and searching
for more tags or more CSS Styles because
there's no point of you know I'm trying
to learn everything in one shot and then
you don't know what to do with it it's
better to say hey I want to make this
you know this image change changing in
the background and then animate to the
left and then change to another image
you know creating a slider when you get
to that point where you want to make
that then you're gonna continue
searching for it and finding you know
the right way of building things but for
now this is a great stuff
trust me all right so we're gonna start
by refining this stuff like you know
let's clean it up a little bit like you
see this font right here this thing
should be instead of serif it should be
censored so we're gonna change them to
Helvetica right so we're gonna come and
say hey all the header
hashtag hair and then all the links
inside of me all the anchor links inside
of it text-decoration:none
and then let's do family a vertical cool
alright but you see how when you go on
top of it you don't know if you're
actually highlighting it let's see if we
could change that and say okay I'm gonna
teach you guys a little something called
you know pseudo alright so header a and
let's see hover whenever you hover on
top of it change the color so we're
gonna say color already so okay what's
going on let's see why it's not changing
let me see if we do this might be
something wrong with weird
left manually oh okay that's why you see
this is basically as being very specific
so for me trying to say hey the header a
changed the color this over rights
pretty much so let me go back into it
the thing about CSS you gotta remember
too is that like let's say I could have
this here on top and basically this gets
overwritten down here left menu ula I
because it's the way how the code gets
read by the computer and the browser it
basically goes from the top and then
what I was below it over writes this so
like let's say here I'll say left menu
you see so because this both the same
thing but because this is below this
this over writes it so now instead of
white it becomes red you know I mean so
like let's say let's do this hover so
now when I will you hover on top of it
turn red you see but the best way to do
it for all of them is basically we say
okay left menu a:hover let's do this so
I could go for both of them let's put
this down here and say left menu hover a
comma and then you say okay you're gonna
copy this and then we're gonna do right
menu
so now they both go hover on top of it
let's see why it's not working we are
because of the important on it we got
our important overrides everything so I
must say you wanted to make sure colors
is there no matter what and nobody could
override it you basically put important
and then no matter if even if it's down
here this won't overwrite this so remove
that it's the only problem with this pin
you know sometimes little errors like
that is gonna happen bottle
understanding that's something with the
website you know this freakin website
sometimes be acting up that's not my
fault all right
so both of them and that was working
right cool all right let's keep on
cleaning this up let's see I want to do
the same thing to this dog but I want to
change them instead of having a I say
button one hover background
RGBA
say rgba 0 0 26 you're gonna do the same
thing football for them
see what's going on well it's not
changing
but your hover that's why I know this
right I know something like that messing
me up
you see so now when you go on top of it
your hovers and changes color now let's
say buddy for this one you want to
change that let's say let's separate
this thing instead of doing the same to
football let's say each one is different
see if this one will see boy - pixel
solid rgba six
which Iceland and is working
but
for whatever reason it's not still
showing okay yeah yeah so we just
cleaning it up making him a little bit
better adding a couple of little things
in there so that's good all right yeah
we got hover what else what else can we
do to this make it a little bit better
let's look at the necklace more
and I see this this was right already so
I see that has dropped down right so
let's add this class to this so now we
we have that ass retsoor just like the
website okay cool yeah all right so I'm
seeing a little bit
you already know make sure you subscribe
trust me videos is gonna get way better
as we go Amanda's my first time creating
this very sweet ads but trust me we
gonna look back on this video so we
gonna oh my god it's videos are
 great
