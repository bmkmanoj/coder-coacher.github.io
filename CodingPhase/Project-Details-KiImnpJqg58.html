phase comm listen so now we're going to
go into the project itself what exactly
is it that we're going to build I told
you the different examples that we can
take inspiration from and try to see how
they created their you know there's
little micro services that they built
for other people but how can we do that
for ourselves so this is something that
I've been wanting to do basically
coinbase is it's basically it's like a
service where you could buy and sell
different bitcoins right and it has an
API to show you charts and you know the
price that of a Bitcoin over the past
year in the past you know four or five
years it gives the order information
right but one thing that they don't do
is tell you how much profit you actually
made I know it sounds crazy it sounds
ridiculous is like why don't they have
this very simple thing well I don't know
I guess somebody forgot I don't really
know the answer but all I know is that
ten million people actually signed up to
coin base so that means that a lot of
people are actually online looking for
this how to calculate your Bitcoin
profit how do you do that right so
that's what we're gonna doing we gonna
solve that issue for everybody we hear
problem solving guys you know say we had
the guy create a CSS border-radius
generator
it saves the time for a lot of people
we're gonna save time by creating this
let's go into it okay this is going to
be a regular landing page right and it's
gonna have all the keywords you know
like calculate Bitcoin profits calculate
cryptocurrency profits all free right so
those are the things that we're going to
focus in the landing page but for now
I'm just gonna give you this little
diagram of how things is going to work
first of all we have to user the user
comes to the page he puts in a date he
puts in how
must expect all right we don't have to
have to sign up for anything we don't
want them to register to anything we
just want them to come and use our
service hey come here
alright we calculate the total profit we
do a API call that I'm I'm gonna give
you guys the link I'm gonna give you a
lot of informations once we get into the
project itself of the API pretty much
after we do that we basically we
calculate the total profit we show it to
the user on another page we pretty much
could use the same page because we're
gonna use react it's just the page is
going to change and we're basically
going to show them some ads and at the
same time we're gonna show them the
profit the total profit that they made
okay so for example somebody comes in
let's say my name is Johnny right so
Johnny came in in July 29 2015 he bought
one Bitcoin at 290 dollars and 35 cents
right how much is that right now
currently okay is that $14,000 so how
much profit is that all right that's all
we going to do we're not gonna do
nothing too crazy there's not very
complicated the idea behind this is to
creating a small service for people
right there's a lot of people that are
not tech savvy like me and you they're
not here to come here and be like oh man
how much is a Bitcoin and let's
calculate it from you know two three
years ago to now and it isn't that
people don't care about that they just
want to google it and say hey I want a
Google Bitcoin profit calculate my bacon
profit right so that's what we're gonna
give them the answer for that now let's
come back over here to this area so once
we give them the number right let's say
for that's just for one transaction they
bought one Bitcoin now they're like oh
cool
this is cool there's a nice little
service and it's great it's free we
don't have to do anything now if they
want to keep track of all of their
transactions then we have to sign up for
something right in the same page we're
gonna have ad
and we also going to have a link to the
affiliate service to coinbase right
coinbase pays you $10 per 100 dollars
that somebody use like let's say
somebody buys $100 worth of Bitcoin you
get $10 for that now now everybody's
gonna sign up but once every two days or
once every three days depending how much
traffic you get somebody's gonna sign up
with coinbase and because they use your
link you're going to get money back all
right
now what we really care about is the ads
all right most people they don't have ad
blockers they're not like me and you
where tech-savvy we have ad blockers on
on our browsers and this and that
personally I don't but I know a lot of
you guys do yeah so basically have
blocks right so people don't have that
now those are the people that we really
want to target right well when it comes
down to it the people are going to be
searching for the stuff they're not
gonna have a blockers they're just the
casual user you know the mom-and-pop who
you know somebody told them hey you want
to join and you want to buy some Bitcoin
here go to coin Bazin now they don't
even know how much profit they made all
right so that's our target audience okay
now we basically give them two options
hey we let them create an account where
they can add all the transactions for a
fee which means we could say hey we're
gonna charge you let's say $2 $3 $4 a
month right for you to be able to use
our service because this is such a dumb
service that right now currently at the
where we at right now and the service
that we're giving them this is such a
simple thing that you can't come in and
be I hate signup to us for $20 a month
now you give them something so cheap
that they'll be like yeah cool I'll sign
up for that
who cares it's $3 you get what I'm
saying like so now for $3 they sign up
to your service you know this is gonna
be thousands and thousands of people are
gonna come in now everybody's got a son
only a few people is gonna sign up right
but because this thing is so hot right
now you're gonna get a lot of traffic
all right now because you're getting a
lot of traffic does that means that a
lot of people are gonna sign up but it's
really a really small percentage
compared to the amount of people that
come into the website and actually use
the service and that's fine we make our
money from the ads that they see and
that's fine so either way either they
sign up or they don't sign up we still
make money now it's just going to make
you a millionaire
probably not but from this little thing
if you get the right audience you get
the right people you get you know the
right momentum this little simple app
can become a multi-billion dollar
company literally like this how things
work you start with a very small idea
you see how it works you see how the
market I just wave the people want it
isn't on demand if they want it then you
Skelly now you add other features to
this yeah now we have okay you could
check your transactions hey you have
litecoin now you can add litecoin now
you could add aetherium now you could
add a whole bunch of different kurtal
cryptocurrencies so you get what I'm
saying
like pretty much sky's the limit but you
have to build this prototype and get it
out there and that's what we're going to
do all right so I'll see you guys in the
next video I hope you guys really enjoy
this and trust me let's just do this
were you gonna see how this thing
actually works and how you could
actually make money and then you call
apply this to other ideas that you can
come up now like I said don't try to
build something that's humongous
something that you know man what if
Facebook did this did that nah those
those type of plans those are another
plans that is gonna make you successful
right you want to be able to make five
to ten different little projects like
this that each one of them is making you
two thousand three thousand dollars per
month and then you're gonna have all
that money stack up you know what I mean
like 10 projects like this make
you $3,000 each you talking about
$30,000 a month you get what I'm saying
that gives you the freedom that you want
and the freedom that you need you know
not only can you come in and become a
successful developer at a company but at
the same time as you working in a
company you have all of this other
projects that are building on by
themselves you know they easy to
maintain they're very simple you know
the site goes down you can fix it up on
your lunch break you know what I'm
saying like is that simple that easy now
I'll see you guys in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
