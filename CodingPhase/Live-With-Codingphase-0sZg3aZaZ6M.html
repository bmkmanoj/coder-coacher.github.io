world tour right now yesterday I was in
Iceland the day before I was in Alaska
today Antarctica you know what I'm
saying yeah was good was going my
peoples man right now I'm just here to
hang out let's chat let's chat with my
with my chat with my chat pupils yo can
okay cut okay
ask me questions I'm here man today I'm
here for you guys I got time today cuz
you get what I say I had time yesterday
I got time today cuz gnarnia a word
yeah man a JavaScript chorus man it's
legit man if you if you're a brand new
developer the JavaScript the future
proof javascript explains everything you
need to know about JavaScript now does
it have everything no it doesn't have
everything because there's the problem
sometimes as junior developers when we
start in this thing right we try to
learn everything and you think like man
why does this guy know so much more than
me
and it's like well this guy's been here
for like four years
you just started pace yourself give
yourself that time to grow
you're not saying like notice guys come
in and become superstars in the first
you know the first year the first year
is just knowing the basics get to do
everything that you need to do don't be
coming in here thinking like hey man
you're gonna create a JavaScript library
on your first year like it doesn't work
like that all of these guys are creating
you know like damn Abramov creator redux
are the guys that created our react the
guys that created angular even freaking
was this guy's name or even you like
he's been doing this for years
these guys don't just wake up one day
and be like I'm super nice in JavaScript
and I'm gonna create a library that's
gonna change the world
guys it takes time pace yourself alright
learn everything that you need to do to
get a job actually get a job which is
what I tell people you expand your
knowledge right this there's something
that I can come here and teach you guys
in courses now I'll teach you all the
things that you need to get the job
right but this things that only a job
can teach
alright there's situations that only a
job can put you in right like let's say
for example a I don't know a client or
your employer says hey man we need to
create a I don't know a super fast way
to connect to a goal and back-end that
returns back a MongoDB you know results
in a JSON or I don't know I'm trying to
throw like some crazy abstract situation
but only the job is gonna get you to
that point
only the job is gonna put those
situations at your face it's gonna be
like hey man let's build this alright
you have six months to build it and I
said hey that's when you're gonna come
in as a developer all the things that
you learned in my courses you're gonna
basically put all of those things
together to solve it but you gotta
understand it just takes time to get to
that level plus even when you get hired
nobody's gonna come in and give you a
whole bunch of difficult situations that
first people I've seen people that they
get spoon-fed for six months like it's
rare that you go into a company and they
give you the hard things to do when
you're a junior developer is rare
because they have to be you know they
have to be careful if they're gonna do
something as complicated or complex
whatever they're gonna give it to
somebody who's really experienced right
for you they're gonna give you easier
tasks like hey could you fix this menu
hey could you go in and align this page
right hey can you go in and you know
create this form that you know connects
to the database you know little things
like that and then as you start showing
that yes you could do it then they're
gonna give you the heart of things so
right now why are you trying to get into
the industry you shouldn't be trying to
look into mastering
Oh JavaScript like everything about
JavaScript because it's like a task that
takes years you're putting yourself so
much pressure for no reason
somebody sent me a comment which
explained how to how to get a job as a
JavaScript developer and everything that
was on the list there was a lot of
things that was there that was good but
then there was things that were there
that was overkill because it's like hey
to get the job you don't need all of
this stuff like all this stuff is like
things that is gonna take you years to
master you get what I'm saying
so get your first job you don't need to
master JavaScript check that your
courses which won't show you start first
DM cess which one should he start with
well if you look at my page on the top
right there's a page called timeline so
if you go in there you will see
everything is in order from the very
first thing that you should know and the
very first thing they should take which
is a text editor and then from there how
to work with the console you know
console logs and all that stuff and
they're from they start going down down
the list so basically you know just get
nice you know but just go to that page
it's called timeline
team treehouse is not bad the problem
with team treehouse is that they're
outdated right
they outdated in the sense of right now
let's say right now react 16 came oh
come on
right or angular 5 comes out right it's
gonna take them six to seven months to
release a course for it because their
courses are really high-quality videos
but the problem with that is they take
so long to create a video like one of
their videos because it's you know they
got a lot of animations they got a whole
bunch of stuff that makes it look nice
and looks cool but at the same time it's
like who has time to to wait 7 months
for team treehouse to release a video
you get what I'm saying like it takes
them too long to keep up with the
industry this industry every single
month something new comes out right so
if you're one of the people that want to
be on you know the bleeding edge and and
being out here with all the latest
frameworks and learning what's now
what's out now like you can't go to team
treehouse at all late you have to
understand like their their basics are
good but they're outdated like a like I
don't even know how to explain it like
they're outdated trust me I went in
there and I was like wait plus they
don't even build freaking websites they
don't build anything they just teach you
things from the the documentation which
I hate that because when you learning
stuff like learning to code you can't
follow documentation like I do it in the
beginning that's what I do in my course
especially with Ruby and PHP like you
have to teach the people the syntax
right you have to teach them the syntax
but then at the end you come in and
create a real-life project something
that they would do in real life
team treehouse doesn't do that team
treehouse just says okay cool
here's the whole syntax that wasn't the
documentation we explain exactly how was
in the documentation and that's a good
luck go build something and then you
weren't dumb like wait what what do I
build you know that's when people always
say oh man I've been trying to learn how
to code for six months a year but I
can't build any different scratch
because you haven't been building
anything all this place is what they
teach you is the same stuff that's in
the documentation but how do you put it
together you get what I'm saying
let's say when you sign them how long
should I get access cuz you always say
yeah okay if you sign up like currently
right now I'm nine my house of course I
need to be in front of a computer so if
you sign up now then um I should give
you access in like the next hour it's
gonna take like an hour and a half to
get home so like an hour and a half you
could have already access and like I
said guys for those of you guys that
haven't signed up today is the last day
for sixty five percent off and the next
time that I'm gonna do sixty five
percent off my be like give me so it's
up to you if you want a way to make
that's on you
you know what I mean like you if you
feel like hey man you know what I'm
gonna I like to learn how to code but
I'm gonna try this in me we go wait for
me I'll let you know it may when when
I'm dropping another sixty five percent
you have to go use the keyword there's
the promo code the promo code is 65 for
no ya 65 for New Year's
no year no s 65 for New Year
can somebody type it down for him I came
in type on this 65 number 65 and then it
says for fo are New Year you put down
the promo code and you Gucci you that's
it and it has to be your capital there
you go
well let's see should I learn Kotlin if
you're looking to jump into um Android
development
I will say yes right now it seems like
order the companies are switching up
from from Java they jump into to Kotlin
whose goodie Joe I live in New York
there are three times as many Python
jobs so I study Python over Ruby on
Rails I mean do the research I live in
New York too from my research there's
not that many jobs as a web developer
this this something that you guys got to
understand you got an estate which um
which branch you you want to get into
when it comes to development you could
do Android development you could do iOS
development you could do web development
you can do applications development
applications development meaning like
applications for businesses then you
have to do the research depending on
that if you're looking to get into web
development there's like this jobs but
there's very very few compared to Ruby
on Rails now if that's all I'm talking
about web development and this alone is
why I tell everybody here this channel
is about web development this channel is
not the programming programming phase
this is not programming phase this is
like coding phase maybe I should have
called it what phase or something like
that because a lot of people sign up or
subscribe to the channel and they think
like this is like one of those channels
where they focus on every single type of
language and every single type of branch
of technology like I don't I don't focus
on the other things because when you
come in you know not gonna say no names
but there's people who they are
applications developers right and
they're giving opinions on what
development these guys who are you know
software engineers but then they've
never worked as a web developer but
somehow they giving experience as you
know giving an advice to people as if
they were
let me turn this off I want the car to
turn off yes so they're giving advice as
if they were web developers these guys
who are junior developers who just got
jobs do you know like two weeks ago they
just got a job and be giving advice as
if they've been here for years so it's
like you got to do the research and what
exactly is it that you want to do and
where is it that your talent is going to
be better off you know what I mean you
know 47 people make sure you give likes
every single person here give this video
I like I want to see 47 likes out of 47
people come on guys coding forever loves
the drama now man this is not about
drama district this year I am going to
whenever I talk about other people I'm
not gonna mention them you guys figure
it out you guys know who you think it
falls on you know what I mean but I
don't need to be mentioning to people
like my channel this this is thing one
thing that I notice is like you know I'm
already I'm getting to a point where
your boys getting big right and like me
giving giving shoutouts to people or
even mentioning people that I think are
doing at the service mentioning their
names it's not good for me it's not good
for you guys because at the same time
it's like we given them light alright if
you want somebody to fade away you just
don't you never give them no night
that's it you let them fade away but I
will explain them I'll say I'll be like
hey guys people are charging you arm and
a leg people are giving you advice and
from they've never done web development
like that's that's the thing for me like
those are like the the critical things
like I don't go and talk about iOS
development because I just don't work in
that like I've done a couple of apps
but does that make me an expert does
that give me the right to give people
opinions on where to go what languages
they should learn to to become iOS
developers is like I've never worked
that you know what I mean I've never had
got hired so it's like I will be at the
same level as you guys you know it's
like yeah I'm a developer I've been
doing web development for years but if
me and you go to the to an interview for
iOS development right and we go we both
go in and be like hey man we study a
freaking Swift on udemy right and we're
going for the same interview me and you
have the same chances of getting that
job because me and you are completely
junior developers we have no experience
in in iOS development you get what I'm
saying so but I'm really big about
giving the right advice to people and
I'm all about money I'm all about
helping people get jobs I'm not here to
elevate your mind like you know to me
like here's how to save you a
millisecond doing a four loop like this
know if you're looking for those type of
content that's not the place for you
here this place is not for that this
place is for the things that's going to
get you a job that's it
and when I say like elevate my iconic
you know what I mean like like I don't
know like this channels out there that
they give you stuff like hey man let's
create your Raspberry Pi let's let's do
this with a Raspberry Pi list let's
install no js' inside of a Raspberry Pi
and and do some you know put an emulator
inside of a Raspberry Pi like I'm not
going to talk about that I'm not gonna
teach you that because that's that
doesn't bring you no money
it's fun but it doesn't bring you money
you get what I'm saying
yes I'm just trying to be honest out
here guys I want to be honest 100% with
you guys I want to just help you guys
out I wanted you know I want to make it
that all of you guys get jobs and then
you say okay once you're in a job you're
gonna notice that everything that I told
you is correct and a lot of the things
that people was telling you was BS
that's just how it is I get so many
emails you know I think I'm gonna start
releasing emails of people that they
sent me but without their names you know
cutting out their names and their emails
to show people how my advice helps
people out and how once they hire
everything that I told them was like
literally like to the dot like literally
every single thing that I said happened
to them because it's just how it is man
here man now we're just being honest out
here man
you know what I mean we're just being
honest we just listen the way I see
coding programming I see I see it as a
tool as a tool for all of us to get
careers half fun because it is very fun
it's very fun to code and the fact that
we actually get treated better than
probably half of the population you know
at a job like most people are happy at
their jobs you know there's gotta be
some companies that you're gonna be a
upset at you know they might want to
work you out for too much too much time
they'd be like hey man we got a release
this new software or not software for it
we got a release this new update to the
website you know and you gotta stay
there till 8 o'clock at night that is
gonna get you annoyed but besides that
you're gonna be happy because you're
gonna be like okay I got benefits I got
money my party I could buy whatever how
I want you know like this year alone
like I worked for what for like nine
nine months yeah cuz I quit my job like
around September so this year alone I
was doing all my calculations I was
checking everything that I did right now
let's hear long I mean about after taxes
from my other job I made about 60 K
right after taxes right and that was
nine months I didn't even stay there the
whole year I mean 60 K then from there
all my side projects and including this
website and including YouTube and all
the other stuff I made like 174 thousand
one hundred and seventy four thousand
like in total and that's all from web
development right
everything that I teach you guys you
could put into practice right and that's
after taxes like most people you know I
tell my friends that and they took you
know like they've been in their jobs for
like ten years I got one friend who
bring his job for ten years
and now he just becoming like a manager
after ten years and he's gonna be
getting like a $5,000 boost which is
gonna make him $65,000 so for ten years
it took him to make $65,000 you gotta
say now next year I know I'm gonna make
a little bit less probably less because
I'm not working full-time like I was
doing but listen I'm working on my own
projects working on on cool stuff I'm
teaching you guys I'm helping people out
I got other side projects that I'm
planning on launching so it's like hey
if I 90,000 or 80,000 whatever I make
next year if I was to be like oh my god
I'm making less money than last year I
will be ungrateful because like I wake
up whatever the hell I want
I freakin work at the hours that I want
I I get clients constantly I get people
hitting me up my hey can you build my
website like you can't complain you get
what I'm saying like me personally is
like okay after I touched a hundred
thousand that was like my goal in life I
was like okay I just wanna make a
hundred thousand dollars cuz you know my
mom was a teacher assisting her whole
life even till this day she's been in in
the education system for years and she
only makes 30 2009 she makes about like
thirty seven thousand dollars before she
used to make thirty two thousand like my
whole life she make thirty two thousand
now they want to be nice after like
twelve years of being a teacher
assistant they gave her a little five
thousand dollar boost right so I was
just happy I was like you know what I'm
gonna make this because one thing that
people don't know about
and the reason why I come in and I share
all the stories well if you guys is not
for me to be like oh you know I was like
hey we I had a sad story
it's not about that it's just to show
you guys like I'm literally just like a
lot of you guys now you know how many
times we moved like me my mom my two
sister we moved about 14 times now this
this month this month I'm moving to
another state
I'm moving to Connecticut and we just
got a new house and and freaking now
thinking about it in my lifetime in the
past thirty years I've known I came to
this country at seven years old so from
seven so now that's why that's like 23
years in 23 years I moved around 16
times they were saying like 16 times I
moved around like and it's crazy you
know I was like people know that story
already of me going to school and I
don't even have money to come back and I
was like glittering like a like a bum
like a bum on the train like hey man
could you swipe me in you know telling
people are yo can you swipe me in so I
could you know get back to Queens like
that like a bum you know all those
things made me say hey you know what I
need to flip this around I need to get
this thing popping you know what I'm
saying like the other day I put I posted
up a image because all my life also -
how didn't I used to be one of those
dudes that used to like I used to like
having a lot of money in my hand you
know even though you go to a BS job you
know I was working like in a parking lot
whatever I always have like $1,000 cash
my hand just for the hell of it just
like y'all got money in my pocket right
but I never had a credit card never had
nothing right
so when I became like 25 or on there I
want to go get a car and they were like
you know you've got no credit you can't
get nothing you can't get nothing nada
all right went in there check my credit
I don't even know about credit I was
just like man I got the cash on me let
me get a card man I was like y'all I got
$7,000 on me can I please just get along
they're like bro you got no credit you
can't get anything here all right come
in my credit was I got 553 right now I
look at my credit is like a 746 chillin
like and that's because I just took a
long for a new shape that I just you
know I just copped something new so I
had to take a loan so my my dropped
from 800 to 746 but when I think about
it I'm like none of this stuff would
have been possible without code and
that's the only reason I'm sharing this
stuff with you guys it's not to tell you
my life and you know whatever but it's
because a lot of people's are in
situations of like where I was at
it's like use this thing that's a tool
man technology can can help you go from
you know being you know freakin a lower
class that you are right now or where
you was before to a higher class in the
system or you know bring you up a tax
bracket you know what I mean
like and money is not everything but it
just feels good to be able to not worry
about it man like I still worry about
money I'm not I'm not at the point where
I'm like hey man dudes as millionaires
out here we're not worried about it
now I still worry about money because if
I mess up somehow you know I'm back in
you know grinding back at work you know
what I mean I still worry about money
but I could buy anything that I want
that's powerful I could go to any
country I want I can move to any state
that I want I can do literally anything
that I want you gotta say like and what
else would it gave me the opportunity
nothing else you know what I'm saying so
I want you guys to take that and
understand that you can use technology
and don't let nobody come in here and
tell you you know this there's a couple
of dudes out there they're just like
they're completely nerds I'm sorry they
just like nerd out they don't understand
that this is a job this is something
that helps people you know some people
come to me like oh man you always talk
about money and talk about this and that
because I live in a world where I'm
trying to help people out help you know
better themselves better be able to have
opportunities in this world you know be
able to leave something to the kid you
know the people that be like oh man
don't worry about money it's because
they they've always had it around them
you know what I'm saying when you come
from the bottom and you don't know what
you're gonna eat next week you have to
always think about that you always even
after you have money you always think
about that you're like man I can't go
back you know it's like MBA never it
wasn't never broke again you get what
I'm saying like you know I hate I hate
when people hit me up and be like oh man
you should just you know you should
learn to code because you loving and
that's the only reason that you should
do it listen the only way you're gonna
be able to learn it is if you love it
right because this thing is not easy
this thing is not something that anybody
could be like hey man you know I just
came from from the corner and I'm gonna
try to learn to code no the only way
that you're gonna go through those those
blocks you know it's like whenever
you're like on a freaking block on a
writer's block and you came in right any
freaking
no more the only way you're gonna get
through that is if you love it so we all
love it
the only difference is that my channel
is about basically just creating income
for people that you know that they
needed that's how I look at it I needed
this thing man I'll be honest I needed
this job man I needed this this career
change man like you know I was like
talking to this guy to get this new
house that we're getting next week and I
was like man like what Korea would have
let me be able to move to any state that
I wanted be able to get any house that I
wanted be able to have all my finances
in order
like is rare that people can do that and
I did it dolo like I'm doing it dodo I
got a family wife he's not putting
nothing in it like wife is putting
support that's what she's putting and
taking care of baby and you know showing
me love and whenever I'm stressed out
she helps me out but all of this stuff
I'm doing it dodo you know some people
they're married so it's like they do it
them and their wives and you know their
wives helps out with a little bit of
their income and those days you know
this and that I'm doing this solo dolo
means by yourself
that's what dodo means don't load means
like you're doing it just by yourself
out here and I would have done all this
stuff no matter what I would have done
it you know even if I wouldn't have had
a kid like my dream have always been to
get a house you know and just find
somewhere stable man you get what I'm
saying like you guys people who have
moved around a lot should know about
this man moving around 14 times in your
life is it's rough it's like you don't
feel stable you don't feel like this is
my house you don't feel like this is my
place cuz you know the next year or the
year after that you're going
moving in yeah man so that's why I'm
telling people it's like you know when
you you're doing this stuff it's like
you gotta do this for yourself and for
your family man and you know like I was
just happy to be able to like you know
like one of the guys was like asking
from the snooker it's like oh man I
think this is your wife work and I was
proud to say not she don't that'll work
you get what I'm saying like I was proud
to say that like I'm at a level where
it's like nah girl she don't gotta work
man she good she does enough she does
everything that she needs to do you know
what I'm saying and at the same time
it's like she she's such a hard worker
like you know finishing her I'm gonna
help I'll finish her bachelor's now
she's got like one more year left she's
gonna become a teacher which is gonna be
great for her cuz then the summer times
she gets off summertime vacation times
she's off can be good with the kids you
know so it's like like my life is in a
trajectory up you know what I'm saying
so all of this stuff I I'm telling you
right now man I put it on learning to
code man like straight up this is not
like oh man I had any help for anybody
oh it's like you know the luck of the
life you know I was like destiny has
something special for you Joe now that's
in the 8th house for me destiny was
gonna have me right here in the heart
and Knickerbocker Knickerbocker I've you
know maybe buy the pizza be by the
pizzeria or sign you know that's what
that's what destiny destiny have for me
but I said you know what eff that man
and email told why feels like yo I'm not
trying to be one of those people living
in an apartment man like I don't want to
you know relive the cycle of staying in
an apartment have my kid go to a city
public school
don't don't even have a football team
because they can't afford it that you
know will have you you and the
basketball team and will have you on the
train
asking for money for your you know for
your Jersey trying to sell sell candy
because your high school doesn't even
have money to to provide you a freakin
Jersey like I don't want my son growing
up like that like I just don't want my
son in that situation so it's like even
Connecticut you know we're moving to
like a really good neighborhood you know
me it's crazy it's crazy just
Connecticut you would think like
Connecticut is like a rich and stuff but
there's like parts out there that's like
rough and like I was looking at the city
data and I'm saying you know just to
make sure to see what's my area looking
like and the median household is like
120 well I live at and which is good
which means there's taxes being paid
which means schools are good which means
when the baby decides to to freakin goes
to school you could go to a nice pre-k
you know all that stuff I put it on
coding man you get what I'm saying man
now I wanna hear no no racist joke man
I'm nine to move for that man I don't
want to hear no freaking racist jokes
out here man
yeah man now that's what I'm saying
people need people need to sometimes
like I wish you know if I had if I had
like a like a bigger a bigger bigger
bigger bigger bigger microphone you know
which means it's just like a bigger
audience of like all the people who are
just thinking about going to a new
career I could tell them hey man check
this out check this career out you know
what I'm saying like check this career
out because it's worth it and then on
top of that this is just the beginning
like you could pick a whole bunch of
different branches you don't have to
come in and do web development you could
do i OS development you could do android
you could do applications you could do
so for engineering you could create you
know program you know I was looking at
this new Samson how you call this Samson
fridge and it's like a smart fridge
right
somebody had to program them you get
what I'm saying
so it's like the the future is here kids
you know what I mean like and I'm sorry
if I call people kids it's just like
what I don't know what what to call you
guys man you know sometimes I'll be like
I can't be saying subs I can't say you
know if I was in the street you know
what I'll be calling ya I was like yo
what am i you know what I mean we out
here kid
I would really go I see you
listen man but we can't get to ratchet
out here man you know ten years from now
I could be like who knows about to get
about to get some type of award or
something
and somebody will pull out a video and
be like he-man in 2018 On June 14th or
whatever he said the n-word us I'll be
like he said this word you know it was
like we gotta keep it clean out here
where I'm
how good are the courses in the
description legit well the course is in
the description our hand-picked courses
that I took myself you know so it's like
you could definitely check them out know
where you hide in the process right here
I can't you don't see that topping me
off right now
yeah man sent me any questions man let
me know
yeah my real family out here man send me
any questions man
am i chilling or coding this weekend
well this weekend I'm gonna knock out
knock out all the videos that you see
the videos that you guys been watching
on the the portfolio the static
portfolio start a static site portfolio
basically I'm gonna finish that tonight
and tomorrow and then it should be
complete it shouldn't be that long
should be complete by tomorrow like a
3/4 o'clock p.m. if you're on my website
you will see all the videos if you don't
want to go to my website then you watch
it here on YouTube one day at a time
that's it it's free it's literally free
you could go to my website and watch the
whole course for free it's just the only
thing is that you're gonna have to hike
on this you're going to have to come in
to my website and register for free
the coding phase uncut they they're I'm
surprised it wasn't working for you
yeah you guys could definitely rest me
I'm gonna try to knock out all my videos
and other videos for the next week in
two weeks for you guys because number
one and like two weeks I'm moving on the
15 if I'm moving to this new crib
so who knows how long Verizon or
whatever Internet company comes in to
install the Internet how long it's gonna
take them so I'm gonna be doing a lot of
my stuff I mean I still got my phone
right where I could upload things
through upload the data through my phone
cuz I got unlimited data on my phone but
this you know this phone man you know
that the internet on my freakin 4G it's
not that good so uploading one video is
gonna take forever so every single day
everytime that I uploaded video is gonna
take me a while until I get Internet in
my house
hey Joe were you obsessed with cold when
you first started I'm still obsessed
with cold I still I can't stop I was
thinking about it I was like man I
remember back in the days when I used to
play ps4 all the time and when I used to
hang out with my friends and do this and
that and it's like I I don't even do
that no more man
like straight up my life is cold man and
I don't know maybe one day I'll get
burnt out but for now that's why that's
one of the things that I'm so
appreciative with coding because it's a
tool for me you know even me teaching
all the things that I've learned over
the years to you guys into everybody
else like all that content or what I
work that I'm doing all those videos
that I'm releasing all these videos that
I put on YouTube all those things are
gonna be here for years people is gonna
come in and search the same information
the same thing and no matter what like
they're gonna find my videos right so
I'm still going to be able to make some
money out of it even if it's like a
little bit of the advertising but the
way how YouTube works is every year it
keeps going up by by probably three
years from now just from YouTube I'll
probably make probably like 50 grand a
year just from YouTube which is enough
to survive on right so about that time
I'm gonna be doing other stuff too it's
like even the videos that I do on all my
courses I'm still gonna always create
courses because I love building stuff
like and I'm always gonna keep on you
know keeping myself updated and pass it
on to you guys into other people that
want to learn you know even you know
like there's one of the coolest things
too like I was worried after a while I
was like man I don't know if I'm gonna
be able to do this because
after a while you're gonna get bored I'm
like I'm not I'm not gonna get bored cuz
I love learning I love teaching and I
love answering questions and hanging out
with you guys and then at the same time
even when my website like this is what
I'm doing for time so I'm doing my
website and doing other businesses you
guys know I make money from passive
income from different applications that
I have online so all of that stuff gets
added together but what's cool is that
you know some point I was like kind of
worried I was like man you know what if
people start unsubscribing for my
website in and then I'm not getting the
same amount but what's happening is that
people cancelled right people cancel
which is like a new phenomenon which I
haven't I don't think if that happens to
people but people have been canceling
and then they come back they cancel and
then come back two months later a month
later right and then not only that that
there's for every one person that
cancels about 17 more people sign up so
when I lose somebody
I make 17 more people 17 more people
sign up automatically and then it just
keeps going like that it keeps going
back and forth and that was crazy the
people that cancel come back a month or
two later because then they see new
content that's there and that I okay
cool I'm gonna check this out
I'm gonna sign up for this course and
and take this course cuz you don't have
to be signed up there forever the people
who do support the channel and the
website and sign up for the lifetime and
the yearly subscription I really
appreciate you guys you guys are the
real rock stars you know what I mean but
yeah cuz I want you guys to always come
back but it's crazy because people if
they cancel they come back a month later
so we always gonna be good now for me if
I'm gonna be tired of this I don't think
so cuz I'm doing so much other stuff
that when is getting boring
every time that I think I'm like oh my
god I already know all this stuff and
it's getting boring it's like I'm
repeating like when a new framework
comes out or something new comes out
it's like I'm like oh man I'm relearning
the same thing that I already know how
to do but what's cool is that then you
find like good applications or a good
frameworks or good things that you've
got all you get excited about so that's
just how it is man so no matter what I
don't think I'm gonna ever get bored
it's just at some point there's gonna be
a bigger growth you know maybe five
years from now I'll get a bigger growth
of like maybe doing more content or I
don't know or just like traveling the
world and like you know which is
something that I really wanted to do I
want to travel the world and show what
coding and technology can do for for
people like there was a documentary that
I was watching right and I was looking
at the history of Japan Japan didn't
have nothing and Japan was it was poor
after world war ii was poor and they
basically turned it around because of
technology they started making
electronics that were better cheaper and
I feel like you could do that anywhere
in the world you can come in and take
and say hey you guys can build a new
technology I don't know whatever it is I
don't know whatever you could come up
with right you could go to any country
and get a community of people working on
that and like that that could trickle
down to the whole community of that
country like if somebody makes money in
the top and it goes in and says hey I'm
gonna buy from you I'm gonna buy from
the next person I'm gonna buy you know
it's like trade but it all comes down
because of technology so I feel like at
some point
in the future that's something that I
want to get into you know I was also
watching this guy Akon econ he was a
doing this interview about you know he
couldn't his grandma didn't have no
light in her village in Africa and he
was going to try to put electricity on
her village and then it was gonna cost
him too much money but then he figured
out that in China they make solar panels
that can light up a light pulse and give
him light and then from there he went
out there and he got a loan a 1 billion
dollar loan to be able to get it and get
it done in Africa now he he basically he
gives light to millions of people in
Africa but now when you think about it
you're like wait Akon incarnate so
freakin singer what the hell is a con
doing in Africa working with light and
it's like you know just because you do
one thing today you don't know what
you're gonna be doing five ten years
from now you get what I'm saying so it's
the same thing for me I'm working with
code and programming but 10 years from
now I could be you know I know I could
be setting up my own programs for
college students or high school students
to learn to code I could be out there in
third world countries where or you know
how the culinary developing countries
and helping them out how to bring
technology into their lives right and
how it can be better for them
unfortunately you can't go live I don't
know if you guys can see me it says
rotate device for whatever reason you
cannot go live sideways if not I will do
it it looks so much better
sideways but for whatever reason I don't
know why YouTube is like you could only
go in live vertically
yeah man now I was looking at there's a
website that sets up sets up like little
websites for producers to sell their
beat and I was looking at the website I
was like yo they made an angular one
they made it in PHP and I was thinking
in my hand man how much are they making
out of every single beat that they sell
imagine if they making like three I
don't know 3% 5% out of a hundred other
beat that everybody you know that our
producer sells and then what if they
have thousands of producers signed up on
their website selling beats you know how
much money they make and that guy
whoever made it probably made about him
proof for a small team now he's a
millionaire making money every month so
it's like there's so many different
things that you guys could build man
it's crazy
now a lot of people a lot of people are
already doing this you gotta find an
industry you gotta find the industry
that that needs something that needs
something like that like you know
selling beats online that was a need for
it there was a need for it and people a
lot of people slacked over it for years
cuz I remember there used to be this
website called soundclick calm before
there was SoundCloud and they try to
sell beats but it was horrible to sell
beats on that thing then there was
another thing called Rock battles calm
which was stupid which was like people
selling their own like they were
battling beats which I always story is
dumb because it's like you can't battle
beats bank that's dumb let me see what
else yeah so this a car a whole bunch of
websites out there that people are
making money man
you know what I mean so yeah man we in
here
now I'll be dropping some stuff of steam
it must drop some stuff once in a blue
moon but I don't know I'm kind of sort
of out of the the crypto currency
because look just the other day whatever
I had like a whole bunch of Bitcoin and
then my Bitcoin why not went down all my
bitcoins went down and I lost money on
it and then I was like so the solution
with it with it I was like man once I
went back up to 16,000 I sold everything
I said I don't want to deal with this
thing because it's like it's one of
those situations where it's like you
gotta buy something and just leave it
there and forget about it right but
right now it's just not worth it to me
is not worth it because it was worth it
when it was you know $100 $200 even
$1000 it was worth it but now I'm buying
a freaking Bitcoin sixteen seventeen
thousand dollars it doesn't make sense
so trying to get into that game right
now is is retarded it's too unstable man
Utley I can't deal with that so you give
me a shout-out where you can always give
me a shot away wherever you want to give
me a shoutout
yeah I had a few thousand dollars in
there and I was like man I don't want to
be throwing away my money like that you
know cuz I bought it when it was at
$3,000 so I made profit that's for sure
but for it to you know go up to like
nineteen thousand that come back down to
ten thousand I don't know if I'm I'm in
the mood for stuff like that
what co-editor do you use in work Adam I
use good old Adam kids it's literally
the best the best freakin best code
editor period I'm telling you guys is
literally the best one for one main
reason that is easy to build packages
for it so you could come in any language
any type of syntax any type of you know
anything that you could think of
snippets anything it's so much easier to
build it then with Microsoft or Visual
Studio code so when you use something
like Visual Studio code it's good
because it's fast but if I'm worried
about speed then if I all I cares about
speed then I might as well use sublime
three sublime three is faster than
everything period if you really want
speed use sublime now if you're looking
to have like a smart text editor then
Pat then Adam is the best 1vs code is
not even competition compared to to Adam
Adam has millions of freaking packages
vs code has maybe like a thousand two
thousand packages like you can't even
compare it it's like I don't know if you
guys remember like the console wars
right when
when ps3 was dominating the reason why
no ps3 wasn't dominating my for ps2 was
dominating because they had all the
games right so when the Xbox came out
Xbox had a few games that were good like
Halo and this this and that but the best
one was ps2 then what happens all the
developers went to Xbox 360 so then now
all the good games in like thousands of
games were made in Xbox 360 compared to
ps4 ps3 that only had maybe like 300
games or 400 games compared to the Xbox
360 that had thousands right now from
there is the same thing when they went
to now the P is for the ps4 it went out
there and made it easier for developers
to create games so what happens with
that they start making more games on the
ps4 and less games on the Xbox one so
automatically the Xbox one loss it's
like the winners is the person who has
the most users using every day and the
one that can offer more to the user and
it's the same thing as vs code vs code
came after Adam and then dating learn
from the mistakes of Microsoft like if
you're gonna make an open-source make a
frickin open-source don't make people
sign up to a Microsoft account to be
able to create a package you get what
I'm saying so that's just how it is
the ESCOs has nice colors if he is cold
it's not even that great trust me
I'm waiting for the next the next editor
I can't wait to see what somebody else
comes up with you know like a demand vs
code they're already been here for long
enough I'm waiting for the next thing
even I was using Komodo IDE and I kind
of liked Komodo IDE the only problem
with Komodo idea is that they have a
light version and then they have a paid
version you know most people don't want
to pay for anything they're like man why
would I pay for something that that is
free in another text editor you know
what I'm saying so I'm just waiting for
the next one
that's exactly what I'm doing David if
you go and build the course that I have
right now on the website which is
building a static portfolio site right
that's exactly what we're doing we're
deploying at the end of the video we're
deploying the website and I'm gonna show
you how to deploy to Heroku okay now how
to deploy into something like a regular
hosting like GoDaddy or anything like
that then that's something that I have
to have to think about see how I'm gonna
do it because you guys are doing I don't
have a website laughing I have a server
that I could upload a whole bunch of
websites to so maybe I'll try to do that
tutorial there with namecheap.com hey
you keep asking the same question what
do you mean how do you deploy fake
projects on your portfolio I'm lost
Tom are you talking about
so how how long would it take yourself
to learn something like react or
something you don't know now I mean when
it comes to learning something it's a
big difference about learning it like
okay I can say I look at a new framework
I can learn how to use it how to learn
how to build stuff right away the same
moment that I started looking at it
right just from looking at the
documentation now so remember the syntax
that's different you have to go in there
and be able to be building those things
constantly but anything that you throw
at me I can learn it now only thing that
I will say that I had issues with
learning was a lick cert and Golding I
still have issues with Golding like I'm
constantly whenever I try to make
something go there I have to go into the
documentation and do a whole bunch of
stuff like I don't remember all those
things like you know by memory I have to
look at the documentation a lot for me
who who doesn't look at the
documentation everybody looks at the
documentation it's impossible for you to
learn 20 different languages and 20
different frameworks and remember eight
every single one as if you had a
good-ass you know good-ass memory sequel
stay too little connection refused yes
you gotta you gotta search those those
errors Johnny
whenever you see stuff like that it
means there might be an issue with with
your database or it could be an issue
with your database or you gotta check
out your migration file what did you
like about angular when I first learned
angular I don't even know JavaScript
that were like I was like messing around
with it like I was good with with
backbone like I knew JavaScript
I wasn't like that that good with
JavaScript yet and I was building a
whole bunch of websites in angular and
it was easy but at the same time there
were things that I was doing with
angular that I wasn't able to do with
raw JavaScript with vanilla JavaScript
and then I was like man I'm gonna stop
using angular because it's like I'm
using their framework but I'm not using
the language of JavaScript I'm just
using whatever they have like you know
ng this ng scoped ng freaking ng cloak
ng app like that was really annoying me
because cuz there's so much stuff that
you have to learn like who has time to
remember every single ng whatever you
got what I'm saying reactor I fell in
love with it because I know JavaScript
and it's like if I know JavaScript
I know react and that's it
how do I put my fake projects on my
portfolio like the Pokemon database
jquery project jquery project in my
portfolio okay so if you set up the
MongoDB then all you have to do is you
have to create create the database you
gotta have you gotta have a forum you
gotta create like an admin section or
you gotta create a page that you can
submit to it and then add your data into
it you get what I'm saying
now for the portfolio like I said just
follow what was already on the projects
not why am i sitting in my car well my
girl came to visit her family and drop
off her cousin and then pretty much
there's no parking out here because as
you can see that's a whole bunch of snow
out here so there's no parking so I
can't just leave my car anywhere so what
I told her I said you know what go see
your family for like an hour and I'll be
in the car I'll be chilling with my
family and my internet family you know
what I mean so I decided to come chill
and hang out with you guys because I
feel like I haven't given you guys a
proper live feedback on a Friday in a
long time
what do I think about cakephp I mean
I've heard of it but I wouldn't even
recommend to learn that man like I don't
remember where was the last job I've
seen that said hey learn we need
somebody for King PHP if if you go and
learn CakePHP and you apply for a job
and they using CakePHP that means that
website is super old that means that
website is probably older than 2010 so
you're talking about a website that it's
been around for years so there's gotta
be a million bugs in there there's gotta
be a million of vulnerability a vulner
has it vulnerability sorry sorry I need
some water talking for an hour with you
guys it's hard to I'm dry so I mean I'm
about to get some snow and you know dry
that up so pretty much people
probably hacking it and just finger
finger effing the finger F in the shout
out of the the left leg the whole
website they have that website like that
you get what I'm saying like I know a
website out there man that that don't
even have didn't even have no security
I've been in places where they have this
old websites with no security the
passwords aren't even encrypt they like
you know the worst of the worst man word
you know hackers got the website just
like that bro
like yeah I worked at a company one time
now we went and we fixed everything we
we move things around and then we
thought that we had the place where the
hackers were taking the information from
and the credit cards and they're like
now
they had like a backdoor they had a back
door to the server son like no lies I
had a backdoor to the server that it was
so crazy that when I think about it and
for years probably up to five years they
were pretty much taking everybody's
credit cards and taking everybody's
information I've seen websites like that
where there's no security because
they're super old so you know you want
to work with
cakephp that's the type of headaches you
wanna you're gonna end up with you want
to work in a company where they're using
laravel man laravel security is legit
the air man
monka start heading out kids I want to
go home I'm tired
this girl's taking forever so I got a
call so I could get the hell out of here
hey man why don't you become a hacker
nah man hackers is retards you know I
find that being a hacker or anything
like that people that do malicious
things on the Internet
they're completely idiots because why
are you wasting your intelligence or
something that is gonna do harm to other
people and do harm to you because if you
get caught you got you're gonna get
you're gonna get arrested you know put
on on on a lie by the FBI like all these
crazy situations that can be avoided
before you gotta want to do hacking and
all this crazy stuff like people that do
that are completely idiots now people
that live in Russia and doing it they're
doing it out of necessity because those
guys is is starving a lot of those
hackers don't have those guys have
no opportunities no way to make money so
I understand why they do it but if you
live in the United States literally the
only country that can say everybody has
an opportunity and you are here doing
dumb things like that like you gotta be
one of the dumbest person in the world
to be doing hacking and stuff like this
no matter what technology has gone to a
point where even the best hackers get
caught and took your laptop it's not
worth it man
like if I will get on double it has to
be for something where I was like
defending myself or something like that
but so get locked up for some corny
nerdy like I wouldn't even want to
tell nobody if I got locked up I'm like
hey man I got locked up because you know
I was the hardest you know the hardest
hacker I was on you know my name used to
be Snoopy 2 K 1 2 3 you know I was that
was me man
if I go to jail and tell somebody that
man somebody's just not to shout at me
you know you gonna say like it's not
worth it man
people here worrying about IQs man I
wonder I wonder how much money somebody
gets for a high IQ you know how many
people have high IQs out here in the
world and don't even use it and you'll
see them right under a bridge homeless
that doesn't mean nothing man
I've seen people who are extremely dumb
and somehow successful you know that's
how it is man
Missy if this guy can make it through
here
let me see if he's a good driver niggas
don't know how to drive man hey yo son
I'm out of here
troll trolling
trol dot-com
listen you know what's my cumin over
9000 that's what my IQ is that you know
go look that up man you know dudes come
out with the little the little IQ meters
and be like oh my God he's over 9000
should be like yo what's your IQ bruh
I'm over I'm over 9000 that Sam word yo
that dude was sad you know that do he
signs up to show up to to the show and
then gets pissed off because we have fun
with him on the show
Mike come on man don't get mad we did
the same thing to everybody
alright guys I'm out of here man
you know kids I'm gonna see you guys
later man I'm out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
