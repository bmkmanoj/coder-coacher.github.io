charmed I'm sure let's see let's see
what goes good
just learning to play with this dude
first time ever first time playing
league of legends in three years man
horrible game for me but Hayley winning
oh yeah man I mean once in a while I
play a game so that's why I put this up
here you know for you guys to see your
boy once in a while
learner's dynasty the overextending
grinder
now we could actually lose this game
because this dude's want to go over
there for no reason
it's
Lovelace
guys as idiots man
and whose stake killing all my kills me
in essence I can't live on this game and
I'll live the bad thing about League of
Legends is that if you like you keep up
with the momentum right if you had that
momentum in the beginning of the game
then you're good but if you didn't have
it from the beginning then game sucks
aimed at some fish
and Ally husband Slean
don't kill
that door was stupid for jumping in
there man and this is how the game
there's how people throw away the game
like we winning and people want to throw
away the game I'm just saying though
like when you thirsty for kills man
that's what happens man we could have
finished this game a long time ago man
which one is it this one blood they're
probably going for right now
well I guess not they dumb they
shouldn't work for it I got this
oh man can I get that kill Jesus Christ
my god
I'll be singing great
oh my god is it gonna be ugly for this
chick this is gonna be ugly
all ships she spotted
oh I need that I need that come on can I
get that soccer redeem on my level man
goodbye buddy
oh and this is how you throw the game oh
they better run they better get out of
there man
we're about to get autumn oh no holy
terrain whoa they came back with a
vengeance now but it's too late for them
they should've did that before man I
little bro

little belt you already know you got a
business book you got a belly loop up
shut it give me some time hey little bro
you know yeah yeah don't listen to the
sauce twins man yeah I oughta listen to
my boys from Texas man sauce 20 is a
pendant building on sauce

was like this I don't want to look at my
so getting body like that look this
guy's is dumb as hell man instead of
defending this how people throw away the
game man and then this is why people
start getting tight you know still of
people to come and start swatting people
