coating face calm your boys backing out
and did it again
today we have the results from
yesterday's web developer Channel let's
get started
we got ya mo dev okay we got you don't
know JavaScript we got Chris talk
we got Jes so four people actually took
their time to build a CSS drop-down menu
we're gonna see which ones are here and
you're gonna choose which one's the best
one that looks the best the one that I
feel like they put in the most time and
the cleanest one okay so let's look into
this okay let me close this window for
you guys put this right here
I like the colors in this it's pretty
cool
alright this the first one is by llamo
see which one we have here drop-down
cool let me see so so far we've seen
tool that are done with hover effect
okay okay so I like that I like that too
one day hover on top of each element let
me see a simple mark application built
with pure HTML CSS this was created for
the coding challenge for Joe from coding
face put on to his viewers enjoy okay
somebody out here a bougie with it hey
this is dope hey that's dope man
cool I like it so let me see who else
got in here
we got a logo this was by choice
so you see okay here's his drop-down
pretty good I think all of you guys
they're really good I would say my two
favorite would be this one that by Loken
by who let me see it was it who was the
second one I think you don't know
JavaScript he created this one I like
this one because it has the hover effect
for the drop-down and then hover on each
item and it looks simple looks clean
okay now I think the winner and the one
that we're definitely gonna give the
winner of today's well yesterday's
challenge we're basically gonna say hey
man the winner is definitely talk
Christopher talk because he just went
the extra mile like this is cool this
looks like a window inside of Mac OS X
okay so there's a pretty dope I like it
I like what I'm seeing kay you went the
extra mile so you definitely want okay
let me see if I could change view editor
view see you have everything control
minimize maximize Search tab drop down
yeah I feel like he put in the most work
out of everybody and hopefully this
actually motivates people to come in and
do their projects there are challenges
for the date I mean this is gonna be
cool guys this is something that we're
gonna come in and just randomly I'm
gonna come in and tell you guys hey man
what developer challenge for today you
get what I'm saying so this is cool guys
I really like what Christopher talked it
and it's hot man I like it I like what
you did here Kate it definitely shows
that you went the extra mile okay only
thing I wish you would you didn't have
to put in the examples here I think I
would have I would have caught on
I would have hover on top of it that
would have been even more better just
because it will look more cleaner but
it's fine I definitely know why you did
it
