it again man coding face doc you did
alright guys listen
so I just did a little super quick
introduction to react and I don't even
know if I can consider that introduction
to react it's more of just like
explaining to you guys how to install or
just initialize react with this project
right so now we're going to go into the
components and understanding it a little
bit better alright so I want you guys to
understand
remember how we broke down the page and
we said okay from here to here that's a
section this right here is another
section and then inside of it we have
one section which was called the model
and another section inside of it which
was called the content right now the
same way how we did that with HTML
that's what we're going to do now with
react we're going to break this down
it's a multiple component all right so
we got to do this like this there's got
to be the the index after basically up
the application alright we're going to
create another one
that is going to be cold let's call this
a folder unison let's name this
container I'm gonna fax to just
component right components right we're
going to create that folder now we're
going to break down this page into
multiple components so we're going to
say this the header there's the content
area and then like that right for now
later on we might break it down into
more components but for now let's just
keep it simple so let's look at what we
have here we have this one which is your
container
this dish which is the weather group
what app root sorry
um which I'm going to actually delete
right I'm gonna delete the class of that
and then what we're going to do is we're
going to rename this ID that says app
we're going to name this oops where that
root let me right click this let me see
okay all right so we're going to leave
that to web at root and then we're going
to name this here alright now loading
for compiled yeah so what I'm doing
right now is basically explaining what's
going on on just this javascript file
right so what we're doing here is saying
we're going to start with line 1 import
react which is the library and then the
function component from react all right
if that doesn't make sense it's alright
you know you can look it up online check
up other tutorials you know tutorials
from Steven rider like I said they're in
the description if you want more details
than what you're getting from here all
right so that's what's happening on that
line then from there import react on
which is the way how react gets to
actually render things to a page so it's
just another library just to render
things alright then we have a class
named layout that extends the component
so what it's doing is basically saying
hey create this class which is using
component which is using the component
function you know it's pretty much is
extending it whatever is inside
component function itself is extending
that right now different there you have
a constructor there's a constructor
function if you guys haven't checked
object-oriented programming that's
another thing that's going on here it's
fine don't worry your body it might look
more difficult than what it really is
think about it like this there's a class
this whole JavaScript let's say is a
class right there from there in Saturday
you have a constructor function which
means it's the first function that gets
triggered before any other function gets
triggered this gets triggered by default
right then you have a super function
which is just saying hey run this like
now that's basically what it's saying
all right now this that's take this is
where you're going to keep track of
everything that's happening within your
component within this component
everything that you want to track you
track it here so any moment
this is just very you know values and
variables inside of this component at
any moment you could reuse this and add
anything here so you can even do
something like this like okay we mean
just Joe let's say age 29
all right and then I want to print this
out I want to print this out here so I
must print it all right so if you do
curly brackets right the credit bracket
if you do curly brackets and say this
dot state dot name all right now let's
do that and then let's say if you want
to do that and you want it to print the
name now I want to print the age now
this is basically going to print the age
so technically you compile through here
and then here as you can see Joe 29 it's
just a way to keep track of your
variables all right
so now let's say let's do this right
let's move on to the next day because
all of the stuff is it probably doesn't
make that much sense now but it makes
sense as you build on the components and
as you build on the whole tutorial the
whole website you're gonna see later on
alright so definitely we have the render
function the render function is was
telling the react react on like hey
render this so anything inside of it
gets rendered so whatever we we return
from this function remember there is a
function all right whatever we return
from here is what's going to get
rendered inside of this web app route
whatever that that element like remember
those guys from basic JavaScript
document dot get element by ID so what
we're doing is hey find this div that
has the web app root right and then
inside of it
show this application render this
application right now let's move on cool
so that from there whatever gets
returned is what gets to be shown to the
person now this is very important
remember this with react component you
need a basically a parent div or pairing
HTML tag it doesn't matter what it is it
could be a a tag it could be a a light
actor could be a ul could be whatever it
is but it needs to be a pairing tag and
then inside of it you put in all your
other HTML that you want to put it so
like let's say here possibly this div
and this div it'll still work because
this is actually going all around it but
like let's say let me try to find a good
example if I delete container and I
delete this most likely it won't work
you see right here is giving me an error
because there's a there's a a CH tml tag
with another HTML tag at the same level
si right and then from there that's what
we try to render it's going to give us
our error because it's saying hey you
can't render this you can't render to
HTML tags at once you have to render
only one so that's why we go back
control-z that's why we gotta have one
parent div from like you see here
they're from the beginning to the end to
basically say hey everything inside of
this is a component alright everything
inside of this is this component and
this is what we rendering to the paint
when we save that it shows your
component here all right now let's
continue with this if this doesn't make
sense think about it like this it's just
like HTML same way out in HTML you have
a div which is the parent and then from
there every child depending on how you
want to lay out your page then you have
your child and in different orders
that's basically it
it's just regular HTML the only
difference is for you to render your
component into whatever div you want it
to show up at it has to be surrounded by
the parent right so our guys are fucking
my throat killing me right now all right
so let's continue with this okay where
we at so basically we got this this is
done now what we're going to do is we're
going to create another component we're
going to copy this there's really no
point on rewriting this I'm going to
copy this we're gonna create a new file
and we're going to name this header
header digest or let me see I don't know
if I set it up for this one JSX
all right we're gonna find out for now
we got a name you're gay yes just now
okay so remember inside of the
components folder create a file named
Heather J yes
all right so now we're going to do a
couple of little changes that's going to
be different from this one this one was
your index file right this is like your
master component this is the first
component that's going to be rendering
every other component out there but the
header remember that is just this from
here to here right so what we want to do
is we're going to say okay we're going
to create a way to export just that
component that HTML from there to there
right now all you have to do here is
come here we got to do a couple of
little changes because we're not
actually rendering this to the page
we're going to delete this right and
we're going to come up here and we're
going to say export default class save
this layout extents component so what
this is basically doing is it's
exporting this class layout as the
default if you guys haven't taken any
courses on no GS like I said it's fine
you could take when you want to know
more and you could take one of the
courses down there right but like I said
all this stuff is just for you to follow
along and as you continue to learn in
this tutorial you will understand
everything trust me sometimes
understanding every single detail
believing it's not needed at all all
right now let's do this let's import now
what we're gonna do is we're gonna bring
that code
for that that file there will not say
import header from component slash
header and then that's it
so what that's going to do is invoice
will import that file heritage is into
this code here and then now what we're
going to be able to do is come here and
say delete that and load the header
components re put the house wrong all
right now let's see if that works
it's going through it seems like it's
working no errors let's see at the code
okay cool as you can see what it did was
a loaded both component on the on the
other file the helices a yes currently
what it has is the full page just like
this one right so here where it was
supposed to and basically import just a
header what it did is imported the file
so it's importing everything into the
area where the header was at alright so
as you can see here so this was what is
you're saying is basically hey we're
importing this have a component here
alright now we got to come here to the
header component and we're actually
going to edit it we're going to come
here delete all of this stuff delete you
can leave this div we can delete that
err
now we can save this and now everything
should be should be proper now let me
find out
is gave me so many errors okay react Dom
is defined but never used because we no
longer needed
you see what else is getting less error
okay invitation of six of 510 so let's
fix that galaxy what's the problem
okay cool all right Stella me we're
using double quotes so what we're gonna
do is we do not do a ctrl F we're going
to say without basically on everything
we're gonna say okay wherever you see
equals double quotes right we got two
equals curly bracket and then a single
pull and we're gonna say find or every
place now wherever we find a double
quote and a closing bracket right
knuckle yeah closing bracket yeah we're
gonna basically come in and we're gonna
say single call 20 bracket closing
bracket
alright final Hatter delete now let me
see what the hell was this error about
okay I think currently is just bugging
out for whatever reason trailing space
not allowed okay all right let me see
let's see if closing this fixes it here
that was just a bug with Adam I don't
know what the hell's going on
okay oh now this should be good
this component should be good now let's
see what else okay
let's see what else might be wrong with
it you say yarn run now yarn
what's okay I guess still hasn't still
loading the old one I don't know if it's
castor or something okay okay there you
go that was the problem sometimes when
we see things like that if is being cast
so make sure you you know you
right-click not right-click you hold it
down over here and then empty castle
hard reload right so now also to make
sure here you're disabled cast on your
console log right so now as you can see
what we did was we broke down this page
into two components right we basically
have the master component and then
inside of it we have the header
component right and we still got to
create another component which is going
to what we want to do is just duplicate
this right-click header
I'm gonna say content area
counter area all right cool so your
accountant area all right now let's say
we're going to take this this section
from here delete that and what we're
gonna do is we're going to come to the
content area file paste it inside okay
now also we're going to rename this here
to the content area make sure this here
is named header make sure that we're
actually exploring it like that properly
export default class header and here we
export default class content area
extends component all right save this
save both of them okay what else what
else we got to do here come to the web
app and basically the content area so
the new component shows up here and what
we're going to do is we're going to
import content area now also to rename
this to content area you see double
quotes so we're going to search there
find old replace all right now
we're going to go away like this and you
find that equals 2 equals curly bracket
now fine okay
now it's not giving us no errors all
right cool
now let me see everything is fine here
we gotta clean up this like if you guys
don't know how I'm getting dis errors
remember those packages I've told you
guys from the beginning so this is why
it is important because you will
actually see errors that you might make
on your JavaScript or ways to clean it
up with the linter and from what i use
is is basically called javascript
standard so yeah make sure you download
those packages or look it up it's right
there on one of the first videos of this
playlist so check it out all right now
let's continue with this let's do this
final replace and then whatever is
single quote and a closing bracket press
single called curly bracket closing
bracket final replace alright that
should be fine now let's see here where
is the error ok the errors right here so
there is the alt tag to it okay
both is created and now everything's
fine normal errors when a fact is one
where is it expected 10 spaces before 8
my 48
cool that's it
he is basically telling me hey clean up
your freaking cold man alright alright
so let's see if everything came out good
oh let me do a little tae-yong run watch
all right looks good
expect let me move this to the bottom
let's do a empty cache and hard reload
still on the top empty cache hard reload
cool everything is fine now you can
actually download this extension which
is the react extension this one yeah
react tools alright now when you come to
your page okay let's leave this page is
using a bill of react know that the
vanilla bill is not suitable for
production yes okay now we come here
technically you can see this little
thing here and shows you your component
so as you can see here alright we have
to lay up which is the master app
alright master console component which
is this alright layout and then it's the
layouts are actually being rendered to
the app which is this the ID of web app
root right so we come here that's what's
going on right now inside of that we
have two other components which are
named header and constant area and we
could actually look inside of it to see
the content area component and then the
header component all right what's cool
about this is at any moment if I wanted
to take this component and use it
another peach I could just take it and
yes you can say hey I could just copy
the HTML and you're right but if you
wanted to add more functionalities to
this component and like you know I don't
know you create something where it's
like hey whenever the user goes over
$1,000 in their car show them a little
pop-up or keep track of them and say hey
this person is a valuable customer
whatever it is that you want to keep
track of on the page you can do that now
and you can actually take that component
and move it around anywhere you know at
any moment like this header I could
reuse the same header in 30 thousand
different pages right and whenever I do
one change or doc on this component
right I could come here and change this
and say hey I want to name this to blog
right instead of news so now when this
thing knows whenever I'm using this
component now it changes everywhere so I
don't have to go in manually
you know component by component but I
want to change this to block changes of
block changes of block now I could just
pretty much as using change it once and
then reflects throughout the whole
website all right that's what one of the
reasons why I love reacting one of the
reasons why I love component the more we
continue building this the more you
understand all the cool features that we
can do with this and yeah make sure you
subscribe to UK your boy is back I
didn't get it again all right hopefully
this is useful to you guys and like I
said before um you know this whole
tutorial is for you to actually start
building on our page a page you could be
proud of something that's cool and
trendy something that you could show it
to your friend about how cool look what
I'm building right now right so yeah so
that's the main reason why I created
this whole whole tutorial but if you
want to learn this technologies this
frameworks everything that I was doing
guys I
telling you learning from Stephen Breyer
he's like the best of the best you know
also take this tutorial take the story
for what it is is free it's for you guys
to get your hands dirty in to react see
how things work on a quick basis and
then once you're ready to say hey I want
to learn all this technologies I want to
learn all those things then go ahead
take one of the courses from Stephen
Ryder they write down my tutorial on my
descriptions of all my tutorials and oh
my my you know my video song Erin I'm
tired all right guys I'll see you guys
later
bow g-g-gee already knows your boy Joe
back at it again man listen make sure
you subscribe and make sure you like
this video man by the way if you want to
know exactly what courses I took to
become a web developer they right there
in the description it's no secret it's
nothing crazy is no secret gift that I
had is just pretty much I took the
courses they're pretty cheap they're
like fifteen dollars each on specials
and just this mess
change your life change your lifestyle
do something fun or something cool that
you could call a career</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
