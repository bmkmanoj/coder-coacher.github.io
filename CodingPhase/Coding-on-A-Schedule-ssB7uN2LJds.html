jump back at it again medicine boys back
out here right now you probably know
what's going on with this guy he's
constantly changing the angles well I'm
gonna said he try to figure out a
different way to make you know videos
there from everybody because everybody
shoots video from here right and
sometimes people shoot from the side so
I want to figure out something new you
know something that's gonna make my
channel completely different from
everybody else so that's what's going on
now this song about doing projects this
week man so I'm right now I'm trying to
create a new schedule you know so I want
to do something like you know Monday
tutorials Tuesdays I do like a couple of
rants or you know everyday talk or you
know Wednesday I want to do something
like top 5 our resources this week or
top 5 my top 5 picks
so pretty much I the five websites will
have five different things that you guys
should actually go out and look for so
Thursday's come back to tutorials
Fridays is another talk where I'm just
gonna talk to you guys and I don't know
what the topic is Saturday's may be
tutorials or maybe random Saturdays and
Sundays might be random matter-of-fact
Saturdays will be like another topic and
then Sunday's will be like a vlog
something about doing that so doing like
a weekly vlog off what's going on in my
life throughout the whole week so I mean
you gotta see my little footage I've
been recording on my phone little
footage of me hanging out with my family
footage of my going to freaking the
doctor's appointment seeing the baby you
know kicking hearing the little baby
sounds like nothing I'm trying to make
this into a family channel because I'm
not but at the same time I want to bring
something different to the table you
know I've been trying to do this for a
while in the sense of like make this
more
personal channel where you guys are
actually more in a more evolved in like
what's going on in my life and you co
actually see what's what's happening so
that's what the channels going right now
I also I need you guys to send me
messages or go to my Instagram
so it's instagram.com slash coding face
if you have Instagram add me there if
you have Twitter add me on Twitter
coding face just like the channel here
is coding face CEO di ng p hasd so just
add me there coding phase instagram
coding phase that twitter coding face at
Facebook so you could put facebook.com
slash coding face and you're gonna find
me there and guys people who have like a
like a story to tell I want you guys to
send me a message man I don't know every
two weeks I want to be somebody's mental
meaning like whatever questions you
might have
I'm gonna just focus on you and then on
top but I wanna do it interview on you
keep in touch with you and basically
mentor them like throughout those two
weeks and help them out with whatever I
can you know you will get my personal
information and they're from now a stay
in contact with you whenever you have a
question I'll ask you a question yeah at
the end of the two weeks then we
actually do like another video where
it's like you know saying hey how was
the you know how was the mentorship that
I helped you out or whatever you know I
was watching this documentary yesterday
of this guy who was like you know like a
self-help guru I don't want to be there
I don't want to be like a self-help like
yes you can make it and you could do
this and make sure you die one eight
hundred dollars out of that and
pay ten thousand dollars to become one
of my mentor reads or whatever like I
don't want to do that with you guys I
just want to be a boy somebody who who
actually you know cares about you know
develop men who actually cares about
everybody who's here on this channel
because especially after my sister
passed away and everybody that left me a
comment like I really appreciated that
and it just showed me like this people
here was gonna come here to the channel
because they liked the video you know
what I mean and there's people who are
here just for the tutorials but then
this you guys who are actually here
because of me I'm just trying to have
fun night yeah I also wanted to you know
I want to make a website where it's like
a community for us you know I don't want
to make it like I've seen a couple of
youtubers always like oh they just like
 selling merchandise and
 doing a whole bunch of like
I don't want to do that like there's no
need for that like maybe later on listen
now like maybe I'll get a hat because
you see me with the hats like I'm always
with the hat or with a hoodie maybe I'll
do something like that but I'm not gonna
make a website for people to go and
start buying they're like I found
makeup websites gonna be more like a
place where people could basically
collaborate with others because like
right now I could be really good with
the front end right and you could be
really good with the back end so I'm
like hey how can we get in contact and
build something like somebody sent me a
message and it was telling me something
hey they want to create a website like
you know like a very popular website
that's out there but for a UK alright
and I'm like damn did you gotta got a
good idea right but he doesn't know the
backend you know so it's like it would
be cool it's like you know people who
are actually really good at the backend
could get in touch with people with the
good with the front end or like let's
say a designer let me say an example
somebody who was a designer in school
who actually gained contact with
developers and
hey I got this great idea can we get
together and you know make this project
happen that's the type of website that
I'm actually building I'm in the middle
of it and it's gonna be on coding phase
calm you know and that that's my major
project that I'm building for this year
