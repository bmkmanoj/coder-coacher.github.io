you should know by now
yeah man
so Cologne break Zachary listen man you
got to be careful with those breaks man
sometimes people take a break in they
never come back maybe like now I mean
you know I've been I've been coding all
year long
typing you know putting in my work I'm
gonna take two weeks off two weeks off
become two months then you come back and
you're not always shoe I forgot
everything you gotta be careful with
those break-ins man but yeah man
freaking
how you call this yeah so my
mother-in-law wife right they they went
to church and stuff and I'm like I'm not
really in the mood for church today
yeah I mean so I dropped the ball I feel
I feel bad I feel like that's like a
douche bag move so when I hear i'ma drop
you off at church I'm not going in there
and I do feel bad cuz it's like I want
to go but I just don't want to be
sitting down and one spot for like an
hour and a half two hours hey that's not
me
you know what I'm saying like I rather
just be moving around you know drive
around for a little bit you know got to
get to know the area like I still don't
know Connecticut that well you know I'm
just getting I'm just getting to know
the Xavier getting to know the state but
it's cool like everything that I'm
seeing right now like it's pretty legit
going from you know going past Waterbury
going to meadow berry though it's a
Woodberry going to what other area going
to damn berry is pretty nice it's not
that bad
and you were here you know it's a lot of
bad stuff that you hear on the news like
Oh wasn't there enough water very is bad
and this this and that
that's like man every area is bad any
area where there's like it's like an
urban area is bad like it's hilarity is
like one of one of my girls my girls
cousin's husband came through my money
with all right he's like kids
oh man it's nice out here yes he came by
yesterday's I can't it's nice out here
you know it's like I hear stories about
Waterbury you know on the other side
like yeah I'm like bro I'm like we're
from New York man like you hear stories
about Waterbury you hear stories about
Bridgeport you hear stories about
whatever town
well it's like man this anywhere that
there's like a urban area people
consider it matter like there's gonna be
crime there's gonna be people homeless
people there's gonna be all type of
stuff man but that's how it is you know
what do you expect you know this it's
the city you know I mean it's like you
go anywhere in the city you go to any
city there's gonna be bad parts people
are so ridiculous nowadays like I'll be
like gentlemen this is kind of
ridiculous you know because it's like we
from New York so it's like for somebody
who comes from anywhere in the world
they'll be like oh my god New York is so
bad you know like in towards this
regular it's just a regular City but for
somebody else it comes from another
place of it we look at even oh my god
people rob people get killed people get
shot up people get stabbed up and it's
like
like that's what happens in the city you
know what I mean
so it's like I'm not I'm not like scared
of any parts of like Connecticut or
anything because it's like like come on
like this is the same thing
anywhere you go I'm pretty sure if you
go to England you go to England you go
to London and there's gotta be some
areas would they be like oh my god just
so bad out there but it's like seriously
like what what's actually bad churches
yeah I just in the mood she's Catholic
I'm a nothing grew up Catholic I mean
when I was a baby I got baptized but
that's just not me you know I'm not I'm
a religious person but I'm not a
religion person like I don't subscribe
to any any religion my company I'm not
in nobody's team you get what I'm saying
like you know I feel like religion is
like it's like you're part of a team is
like hey we're Catholic hey we're
Muslims hey we're freaking whatever
we're in freaking Protestants where this
doesn't that I'm like yeah I freelance
religion word I'm a freelance I'm a
freelancer when it comes to religion
like I do what I have to do at the my
work I don't I do my my stuff but I
don't subscribe to you know I'm not
full-time anywhere you know what I mean
because grace is like I got baptized as
a Catholic my grandmother is Jehovah's
Witness I grew up from the age of like I
don't know from my 3 to like 7 as a
Jehovah's Witness like I used to go to
people's houses and knock on the door
and I used to be like that little cute
kid who comes in like hi do you want to
read that I like yeah do you want to
read the watchtowers do you wanna read
this doesn't that but
for me like now I don't know like I
can't I can't sit in a place for that
long I gotta be doing something like you
know if I was like active I guess the
only way I would be active in in a
church or anything like that is if I'm
active if I'm like passing down like the
how you call it uh you know passing down
the the little thing to get the the
contribution and stuff like that
donations or like would be like an altar
boy or something grown-ass man is an
altar boy you know that's the only
reason I will be in there but I can't be
just in there sitting down for so long
like I do it like a special occasion
Thanksgiving Christmas but to go every
Sunday so let me see what else in the
name of reaction reduction ESX what
ramsey journey saying no spoilers
spoilers of what he what's up what's up
oh yeah you saw Black Panther how I mean
isn't that good people keep saying like
this it's the best superhero movie I've
seen in my life and I'm like that's the
only face I'm gonna give it to this that
every time that a new movie comes out
today this is the best one
now probably the next one that comes out
is gonna be the best one it's like every
single time a new movie for like Marvel
comes out they're like so excited like I
used I don't like Black Panther to be
honest with you I don't like the
character I like the idea of the
character like having this amazing
African nation that nobody knows that's
like multi-billionaires multi trillion
years and a half this amazing new metal
that that could freakin do everything in
the world it sounds dope but I don't
know I don't know if I like the
character like his powers what are his
powers he has a suit like you know to me
like never really liked him like that
but more power to him
I want to see the movie because of
what's the guy's name Michael B Jordan
I liked him on Creed and my lighting on
was a Friday Night Lights I think so I
want to see him I wanna see how he does
as a bad person like you know as a
villain
I haven't seen him do any bad parts so I
know he's gonna do his job let me see I
have yet to learn anything about react
but if you're looking to get into
freelance doing a lot of WordPress for
small businesses its react worth
learning after basic HTML Javascript and
CSS yes you should definitely learn
everything you got understand this you
gotta have different goals there's
different goals for everybody this guy's
who and maybe I should do a video about
this like having different goals
different career goals you know these
guys who have careers career goals that
are hey I just want to work at a company
where I wear a suit and I get paid well
get some nice benefits and that's it
that's their goal right at one point
that was my goal when I first started
you know I was like oh I want to wear a
shoe I want to work at a Wall Street
that was like my dream I wanted to be a
stockbroker and I was like nah after I
became an IT worker and I worked at Wall
Street I was like I don't want to be
doing this right then I want to ask me I
had another goal which was I want to
work in in a super corporate company
where you know
just to have the feeling yes to know how
it feels so I worked at asked me down or
that or listen that all our G's that or
can i or that org asked me that org and
basically it was like working with a
bunch of engineers and working with a
bunch of like super smart people but it
was like so corporate like I realize I'm
like this is not the place for me for
sure you know so after I did that that I
realized I'm like okay maybe I want to
work in a start-up then I did some
freelancing for a couple of startups and
it seemed cool but it's too unreliable
in the sense of hey we have funding for
six months and we're trying to build
this you know build this application
whatever and for the next six months
we're gonna build it and we're gonna
release it right now if things don't go
good in the startup folds then at six
months or even less than that if you
have really bad management basically you
have no more job so I didn't like that I
didn't like to feel like I'll see you
know insecure that's like what you know
what I was gonna be doing in the next
few months then there's the other route
you can say hey I want to be a
freelancer a freelancer is cool I've
also done that too
the only problem with freelancer is
number one you gotta find your clients
number two you got a freaking hunt down
your clients like some people they come
in and I all can you build me this
website here's the first half of the
payment and you get the first half and
then now you got a file you know you
gotta hit the mob and I hate min I
finish a website you know one can we
meet up for you know the rest of the
payment there's this and that
and I'll give you the rest of the
website sometimes you might be waiting
on that person that person might take 2
weeks 3 weeks after you already built
your whole your whole application your
whole website for this person because
they might not have the money at that
moment so freelance and my suck I've
also done for high collars like agencies
digital agencies digital agencies are
good they always have work they always
have work for you but the problem is you
constantly having a whole bunch of
different projects like weekly so every
week you have a project to finish one
website right and then like two three
days you got to work on another website
then two three days after somebody calls
up our previous client says all we want
to change this from the website that you
did two months ago so now you got to
work on that so it's like you're working
on like 20 projects at the same time and
that can be very annoying what else
don't for temp agencies I think I like
that the most
temp agencies like when I work with
creative circle and I've worked for you
know MTV I've done stuff for like a
whole bunch of companies you guys can
look it up but that was my favorite and
the reason why that was my favorite
because I would go into all of this
major companies that's like a hired gun
right that's somebody who was like a
specialist right when you go get high
and let's say for example you get hired
to MTV right you know how to entity you
got to go through the whole process of
getting hiring you know going through
the whole process of you know going for
one interview one phone interview then
going to the second interview in person
then you might have to do a third
interview to go meet the team like you
got to go through this whole major
process right same thing that you have
to go to Facebook and orders are the
major
you know but the problem with that is
that it's too much work it's like hey I
know what I can do I don't want to be
dealing with that right so when you work
for a temp agency it's like the temp
agency already vouched for you right
they already know like hey this person
is is legit so you don't have to go in
there and do no test you don't have to
go in there don't know interview it's
like hey man we need somebody who knows
react and they gotta come in and work
full-time for the next year two years
and that's enough for me
you got what I'm saying like I don't
need to be working at a company for 10
years so like I don't need it right I
get bored with it I was watching fun fun
function he was talking about this too
he said that he was surprised that he
stayed at Spotify for four years right
more as a developer most of us get bored
right we get bored with doing the same
thing especially when you're doing what
development right because what
development is very repetitive you're
going to be doing the same every
single time like there's nothing new you
know that's why people constantly coming
up with new frameworks new new things
every single week because we get bored
right like people might be like hey man
we got angular we got react we got a few
we got amber back born whatever right
somebody's gonna come up with something
to you because we are bored right that's
the truth right people get bored people
get you know they want to get tested
they want to get feel like oh I'm
learning something new like that's how
it is as a developer you you are
constantly learning because especially
when you a web developer because you're
essentially just doing the same thing
constantly all right so you get bored
so from excuse me so for me working in a
temp agency like create a circle where
they they find you the clients they find
you
the clients that you're gonna be working
with long-term like let's say six months
eight months a year two years you know
you go in there and you're good you're
gonna sound like like it's so much
better for me because that's the type of
person that I am some people they just
they like to just work in one single
thing you know but I go see I don't know
if you guys saw the video cuz it
probably released out the same almost
the same time that I released this and I
went laughs right while I was talking
about people are getting worked up
because they like man I like angular and
this person nice react and this does not
and it's like bro it depends on where
you want to work it's very important
like let's say for example I'm missing a
lot of banks right a lot of banks they
use angular right so now you will
consider like sort of like enterprise
you know so a lot of banks they like to
use angular right but a lot of you know
startups and and small businesses and
you know like real trendy companies like
you know you're not Airbnb or Facebook
you got a whole bunch of companies they
love react right because it's more
modular you could come in and do more
work all you need to know is you know
JavaScript if you know JavaScript and
reactive who also do or be part of the
team that works on on the iOS App Lord
because the iOS app or the Android app
through react native so pretty much it's
like you are able to do more as a
developer than just being an angular
developer right most companies that like
to use angular is for the simple fact
that they don't want to think about hey
what library should we use with with
this framework like date like I say for
HTTP right like you go you don't even
have to use age like let's say Ajax from
jQuery or let's say fetch the fetch API
like you could just literally just use
what angular already has you could come
in there and say hey I don't want to
figure out how to do my own forms
validation I could just use what angular
already has all right but at the same
time that thing is so bloated that you
might you might come in and say hey I
don't need all of this stuff like this
is super bloated you get what I'm saying
so that's the thing about it and it
depends where you want to work is very
important what type of person you are
and what type of company you're planning
on working like if you're like let's say
I know people who come in and be like
hey man I've worked as a I don't know as
in accounting let's say as an accountant
right and they try to get away from that
office you know strict office type of
style of companies and you know
companies that they you know everybody
seems like they gotta stick up their ass
like they don't want to work in that
type of environment right so if you
don't want to work in that type of
environment you should definitely not be
focusing on angular because most of the
time probably 90% of the time the
companies that are using angular are
like companies that you gotta go in
there you gotta swipe in as soon as you
come in you got a freaking use your ID
for everything freaking people keep
track of what time you come in will tell
you leave they want you to stay you know
extra hours after work like I'm not
trying to be doing that you don't say
like that's not for me that's why I
don't focus on angular because all of
the companies that are seeing that use
angular you know there's a lot of jobs
out there but it's like you those type
of jobs is like you do that in the
beginning like right now for you guys
who are junior developers I will say hey
man your first job is your first job
it's never gonna be great you're never
gonna love it right so just go and you
know
try to learn react in angular and then
if you find a job where they want you to
do angular but it's your first job and
you can't find anything else take it go
ahead take it but after a while after
you have two options I'm like hey man
I already know this stuff hey man I'm
already an experienced developer like I
get to choose where I want to work at
what type of environment you know I
don't want to work it with cubicles I
want to work in an open space I don't
want to work with open space I want to
work with cubicles I want to work with
my old office you know having my own
office like you got to figure it out I
find what those companies used so you
can find a better balance to work life
that's just me you know so yeah man let
me see what else any questions guys go
ahead ask me anything man I don't got no
topics today I just came in here live
real quick just to hang out with you
guys Joe war and what are interesting
parts what are the interested parts of
what development I also like IOT I don't
even know what that that is in game
development
I love game development even right now I
plan on once I finish this react course
that I'm doing I plan on teaching Python
because I want people to learn Python so
they could be comfortable to be able to
use something called Godot
engine I don't know if you heard of it
so I want to teach game development wave
goldeye right and I mean I haven't had a
lot of game published games published
but I've created a lot of different
games I got like two games on on the
Android store so it's like you know I
know what I'm doing when it comes today
right I haven't done like Triple A games
but even a triple in games level it's
the same
like once you know programming and you
understand the concepts of gaming and
game development like it's pretty easy
like that's what then that I would like
to get into but I don't think this the
state that I live in or like the area
like I don't think New York City like
the whole East Coast I don't think this
is really like any any good gaming
companies SF or Rockstar the guys who
created was a what's the name of stupid
game I'm going blank Jesus Christ
what's the game GTA yeah Jesus Christ I
just went blank
Granta photo rockstars they actually in
Long Island and they have offices in New
York City too
so you know I would love to transition
from what development to game
development that would be amazing but
you know everything is a process you
know maybe i'll document that right
maybe i'll document that and be like you
know gaming face becomes my journey to
trying to transition from a web
developer to a game developer came
developer yeah cuz i went to school for
art like communication design so it's
like i have you know i can actually draw
and stuff like that and i know how to
use all the programs like Photoshop I
know how to use blender I know how to
use Maya 3d so all those things I know
how to use right so it would be cool man
I would like to see if I could do it
that would be like a challenge that
that's like my personal challenge can I
do it can I transition from web
development so game development
full-time game developer like I would
love to do that right because it's like
that's one of the reasons why they said
like there's a lot of guys who do like
computer science they look down on what
development because there's like so many
different challenges that you can face
when you build a software other games or
games or like just software applications
or iOS applications or stuff like that
like there's so many things that you
could bump into that challenge right
like once you this is why I tell you
guys once you get comfortable with web
development this thing is so easy like
you could do this with your eyes closed
like somebody might come in and buy oh
can you build me a website that connects
to the stripe API and the PayPal API and
I want to be able to sell my products
there you could do that with your eyes
closed right like you you're gonna be
able to know all this stuff like this
right there's really no challenges in
there right now the challenges comes
comes in when you become like a back-end
developer and you say hey man I'm gonna
become a DevOps right and you say hey
how can we scale a website that has
let's say from 5,000 users at a time to
a hundred thousand users at a time or
millions of users at a time
those are the challenges that you face
when it comes to web development
now the coding of the website that's
easy you could do that with your eyes
closed like that thing is so easy it's
not a challenge right so it's like for a
lot of guys who go into the school and
they do computer science they might look
at this and be like man like I don't
want to do web development cuz there's
no challenge is there for me you know
what I'm saying
because in reality if you are a computer
science major right and you do web
development you're pretty much throwing
away like so much stuff too
you just don't mean like you study for
it like dari you study you know how
computer systems work you study the
engineering side of you know the
computer is the electron electrical side
of a like you you study like data
structures even though data structures
you you could definitely use it but
there's other things in there in your
curriculum that you're just never going
to use in web development right it's
just not there you're not gonna use it
you know you could come in and create a
framework and do a little hey I created
a library and it got 5,000 stars on on
github that's about it that's like the
biggest thing that you're gonna create
that you be like oh this is great this
is an accomplishment but at some point
you want to get challenged man you know
you want to say hey man I'm gonna create
a the brain of a robot or any I want to
come in and create a video game a
complex video game are real-world
open-world video game like those things
they have challenges you know what I
mean creating the artificial
intelligence of like the villain in the
game like those things there's a chance
to it but web development that's not
gonna be a challenge man so let me see
Joe let me see what else is in here
I like react but it looks like in my
state in neighbor States there are more
jobs for angular which one should I
choose listen fine if in your area if
you find a lot of jobs in your area that
have angular go ahead learn it but I do
like do recommend people to learn react
react is just JavaScript there's really
nothing to it right angular is something
that you have to learn angular it's like
something that you have to learn it's
not like oh I'm doing just JavaScript
a lot of stuff like you hold on give me
a second
yeah so there's a lot of stuff that you
gotta learn like if you look at the
documentation of angular is huge man
like huge hello I see
let me see I'm just reading sorry guys I
know you're probably later on y'all see
me like just stuck I'm just reading the
the comments of the live feed on a
machine so Martin contrary that says I
heard the new version of gold ah is
amazing yeah man that's what I'm trying
to I'm trying to get into like I learned
go down to point one and I was making a
couple of games started pretty cool man
it's so easy like if you ever done games
with unity3d if freaking sucks the
there's so much stuff and so that's why
I want to I want to teach Python some
people now for not for web development
because I still don't recommend somebody
to focus on Python if they're gonna do
like development like if you want to
become a web developer and you say hey
man I'm gonna find a job tomorrow Python
is not the place to go
period well if you want to become a web
developer right if you want to do
machine learning you want to learn how
to program you want to learn how to
build games you want to learn how to
build your own applications you want to
automate your own things
Python is amazing for that right because
there's a real programming language
where you know you can come in and
create stuff like create applications
create a whole bunch of games you know a
whole bunch of stuff right but for web
development the jobs are not there you
go say like if I'm if I'm a new
developer I'm like oh man I want to get
into web development I wanna find a job
right away Python is not the place to go
you know people might tell you always is
the best programming language out there
and it might be it might be the best
programming language out there but it's
not the best programming language for
web development you get what I'm saying
like I think a lot of people get things
wrong a lot of people get things wrong
they they get it mixed up they get mixed
up between becoming a web developer
becoming a developer like that's
completely different man all right but
yeah man I'll see you guys later man
think about it like this if you want to
become a game developer I'm not gonna
tell you hey man
start learning my sequel like it doesn't
make sense oh yeah man I'll see you guys
there bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
