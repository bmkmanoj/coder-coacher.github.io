so you know I mean like we somehow we
don't did it you know it's like mama we
did it so I'm going to show you guys
this website tomorrow because I think
it's very interesting especially if you
living in LA so let me see if I can
share my screen and it's cool this whole
arm website
as an application and I'm gonna show you
right now me pop up this this thing okay
or is it
taro dot-com and they started with a
website and then became a full
application and like now they're all
over the place man the guys they
actually built it with Java so it wasn't
like nothing crazy but I'm gonna show
you right now okay display capture okay
so this is taro calm it's a pretty legit
website pretty simple you know I don't
even think that they have any like
JavaScript it's not really JavaScript
heavy it's like they still using jQuery
on a lot of stuff they're using Yui
which is super outdated what but it
shows you like hey you have an idea
whatever you know how how to use you can
use it and build a successful
application okay so let's say la alright
you come in I'm not getting paid by
these people this is uh not sponsors
they should sponsor me but I really love
this application cuz whenever you you
want to go to like you know whatever you
want to go to you know for a weekend or
a for a week I'm planning on doing like
a few days in LA so let me see I'm gonna
pick the day that I really want to go so
I want to go from Wednesday March once
they suck I suck okay so yeah so we got
from Wednesday the 7th til Sunday they
lent alright so let's look up what cars
are available for this thing this is not
sponsors this is just I love this
website right like well you know me I'm
not like you know
one of these people I want to show off
his stuff like that but I like to being
style you know what I mean like I like
to be comfortable you know my price
range
I'm not trying to pay a thousand a day
my price range is let's say 200 okay so
let's say about 400 I'll spend like 400
for the right car right 400 per day
right
so I'm looking into it I've seen which
one you know maybe that little miles
around Ghibli you know what I mean
touchdown touchdown in the city like yo
without we here like yo Chris Shawn come
outside real quick you know what I mean
we out here man or even this one like
this is not bad you know what I mean
like touchdown la $400 I'm gonna be
there for a few days so let's say I have
like a week with it a week is probably
gonna be out and you could talk to the
owner
you could be like hey man listen I'm
gonna rent it out for a few days you
know I wanna action instead of paying
you 400 and something let's work it out
I'll give you 300 per day all right so
three times five that's 1500 so for five
days you out there chillin you know what
I mean you out there chillin in the
Bentley cool so that's how we're
planning on doing this trip to LA cuz
that's how your boy does it I'm sorry
man if we got a touchdown in LA man I
don't want to be a Rodale drive with a
freaking Toyota Prius you know what I
mean
I ain't touching down I ain't going to
the spots on on LA man like you in and
yell a man like you know what I mean I
know for the people in LA yeah probably
oh man you know it's like this you know
bring them down to the hood bring her
down to Slauson you know as I bring it
to the spot it's cool I go to the spot
but as an out-of-town dude you ain't
trying to be in LA on you know under
Nissan Sentra you ain't trying to be in
LA on
until you're the Prius you want to be in
with Styles you want to be in there like
a we ain't here blue cheese son for some
reason it brings good luck you know when
you give yourself and you you basically
give things to yourself and you reward
yourself like we all work hard so it's
like if you work hard you want to be
good you you know what I mean like you
want to be comfortable you want to feel
good you know so that's what I do you
know it's like I work constantly so it's
like situations like this I'm about to
do a trip if that man we going all out
blue cheese wait you know what I mean
you know like I ain't trying to be a
rodeo drive a Toyota Prius you know it's
like what what is it are ava's or
enterprise is gonna come up and be like
hey man do you want to rent off you know
we got the latest Toyota Prius safe on
gas man you could keep that I'm going
over there I'm touching now on a Bentley
ain't we in here we laugh let's see the
stars you know what I mean yo Chris
Shawn come on Simon you know what I mean
that's how I'm touching down the hood
you know it's like Chris Sean come
outside Hector come outside we out here
in the belly coop what upset you gotta
have fun man but yeah man so what's good
what is the chrome plugin that you use a
half a couple of them I usually use a
this one called similar tech and there's
another one called rap Eliezer you know
what I mean so that's just how it is man
those two will show you not everything
cuz some websites they hide it some
websites they they make sure that they
hide those things but yeah man
yes sir we got a sound like a boss man
we in LA I feel like yo if you go to LA
you can't touch down on a Nissan Prius
man
oh no till you're the Prius or you know
or none of those stuff man you know what
I mean so you you don't want to go in
there like that websites with webpack
hiding not really it doesn't really hide
it because
it shows it webpack what it is is a
thing that I forgot the script I had it
before is a script that you could
basically basically block Google Chrome
extensions from having your information
about your website use got a googly I
don't know it by the top of my brain you
just got a googly or how to basically
block it but even at that like if you go
into the JavaScript you you know if you
right-click into Google's developers
tools and then you go into the network
you can actually go in there and look at
the things that they have man touchdown
la Renta Geo Metro isn't man we touch
him down with style out there man I
can't wait to touch down on a late man
like I got so many things I want to do
out there there's a lot of people that
I'm supposed to do some collaborations I
got a couple of channels that want me to
go up there you know so so it's a nice
it's gonna be a nice week it's gonna be
like are going on Wednesday early in the
morning you know come outside come
outside with my little bag back right
there like a New York City to LA damn I
came to say New York City no more I'm
I'm a Connecticut do now unfortunately
your boy don't win bougie we don't move
to the suburbs you get what I'm saying
your boy is bougie out here now you know
we moved to the suburbs unfortunately
that's not so now I came in saying me
NYC now I gotta say CT you know it's
like that's crazy
that's like them blues from la is like
they moved to San Diego they came and
say LA no more you fool you know you're
from San Diego man like stop foreign
dudes move to Arizona and deuces like
yeah man I'm I'm from Cali brah like you
know it's like we ain't dealing with the
Buster's out here brah it's like nah man
you from Phoenix my do like you move to
Phoenix that's a your Phoenix dude stop
claiming stop claiming la stop claiming
Crenshaw you stop claiming the the hood
man you from Phoenix man you from
freaking you from how you go to spot you
from Scottsdale bro like stop that's it
so it's like same thing for me man
now I was like I could imagine dudes
somebody's gonna pull my car one day
somebody's never stop claiming New York
you're from Connecticut dude stop saying
you from you know how people be man
people start doing the GPS and looking
at your locations like man stop saying
you from New York man you from
Connecticut do word bro so any questions
guys that's it I went through my little
rant my little you know my little swag I
come in and hit him with a little bit of
sauce now let's get serious talk about
cold man what you guys is up to man what
you guys is is building right now I mean
right now like I told you guys I'm doing
this Ruby on Rails building this blog
after the blog probably I want to do two
projects for Ruby on Rails someone to
the blog and then I might do like I said
the Craigslist project that's the goal I
don't know if I'm gonna do it right away
I'm gonna do the blog which is gonna
teach everything but it's like oh my god
like I was like writing down all the
things that I gotta do all the steps for
building Craigslist I was like oh man
this thing's gonna be mad work so be
honest but yeah man so
cinema see that what else award the
questions wired my treat
we're I'm starving right now man my
phone is dead
max why for you while we eatin say Matt
Owen says he's a he's building a
cryptocurrency investment simulator
where you can play around with buying
crypto with fake money and seeing what
it's like before using a real money Matt
always coming in from left field with a
good project now that's what's up man
that's a very good project I think
somebody did something like that for for
regular stocks on Android because I used
to have the application but I don't
think nobody has done that for crypto so
that's a very good project if you get it
done within like two three months and
you release it to the world you can
start making money ASAP or advertising
you know that's my if I see you Matt
like don't do this just to be like oh I
finished the project and now put it on
github now this is gonna be a pretty big
project so make some money out of that
you're not I mean so you better put some
advertising up in that have you ever
mess with iron cube encoder never heard
of it but to do the pokemon game in
JavaScript trying to be up-to-date yo
word let's see what else I'm going
through interview with blockchain
company and 3d model software company
both of big corporations which one
should I choose if I get an offer which
one the one that's less less corporate
if if it was me the one that's less
corporate the one that has a better
environment the one that has a better
you know job community you know or even
in which it was closer to you which
one's gonna pay you more money and even
if quote facing more money you
it's because you gotta make sure that
you're gonna be happy there doesn't
matter if they're gonna give you you
know a million dollars if you're not
gonna be happy there it's not worth it
and if you're gonna hate the job then
it's not working it's not worth it
you know sometimes you'd be like oh I'm
gonna enjoy this project but then you
realize the people that work there are
a-holes
like you got you get that vibe when you
go into an interview you get that vibe
of which environment is for you are you
getting your own office are you working
an open environment you know Open Office
which I hate because number one the
worst thing I'm probably gonna make a
video bother to the worst thing about
open office environment it's the fact
that people walking around you you got
people looking up over your back like
let's say you wanted to check some
emails real quick check on YouTube or
something like that people is walking
behind you looking at what you're
searching people constantly like talking
all over the place so you have to put on
headphones like is annoying I do not
like working open spaces make it's like
give me my office and that's it I don't
want to be dealing with you have
marketing team here you got the
designers here you got freaking guys
doing copyright right here like that's
really annoying just give us a space for
the developers to be at we don't need to
be mingling with everybody but that's my
my point of view and how I look at
things some people might like to have
you know the designers around you know I
was like some dudes is like yo I don't
want to be around guys 24/7 so I rather
be you know the marketing girls and you
know you could hit the hitter with the
game like you know but yo what up it's
like we going to lunch or not and then a
year from now after you do that you wind
up on medium.com some girls saying oh my
god I got harassed by Johnny from IT you
know what I mean I was like it's if he
meant I'd rather just save myself the
headaches and be like you know I just
want to work with the developers and be
in my office and do my work
nothing you know okay if I look at Stack
Overflow for answers to algorithms I'm
working on is that cheating or is that
how most coders do it when they when
they don't know I mean you gotta test
yourself you got to do it on your own
now if you've been there for like a week
then go to stack overflow but if you
just like starting you're like oh wait I
give up I don't know how to sort this
thing nah man like you can't just be
searching on on freaking on Stack
Overflow right away give yourself some
time the idea behind are you call this
algorithms it's to really make you think
and to see how you will solve the
problem you know what I mean like the
way how I solve it and the way how
somebody else solves it is not the same
way but as long as we get to the same
conclusion at the end that's what's
important right nobody cares about how
long it's gonna take you unless it's in
an interview no interview I like that's
why to me algorithms in interviews are
stupid because a lot of people what they
do is they just remember like the the
formula they remember how to do it and
they were okay and they do it super
quick but that doesn't mean they smart
what they did was they looked over they
studied they study the study and then
from there you know what I mean that's
it
putting referral links to real crypto
exchanges which will hopefully bringing
some money as was a wallet address for
donations I guess I can see about adding
advertising - yeah advertising has got
word you're gonna make the money because
you know when you leave it to people to
donate people will be like nah people
are too self entitled to things they
feel like everything should be free and
as I don't understand that you put in
your work to create this application you
probably gonna pay the servers you're
gonna pay the whole thing so for people
come in and be like hey man this is free
man we're trying to get everything free
man and it's like they don't take into
consideration your work or the fact that
let's say for example a somebody like
myself I come here and do a lot of stuff
for free and that's what I do but at the
same time it's like the things that are
premium that takes me forever to make
it's like yeah we're gonna charge for it
cuz it's like the same time I have a kid
I have a wife I have a cows I have you
know things to maintain but some people
are like man how can I get it for free
like bro like you don't think I gotta
eat you know what I mean like all this
tips all of this stuff gets paid
automatically some people don't have
consideration so the best way is just to
put advertising on your website so let
me let Maine says oh you memorize code
to become best developer or you
understand it some people they okay you
who understand something what I mean by
algorithms and coming in and remembering
the formula right every algorithm and
reality is just a formula it doesn't
matter what language it is
doesn't matter what frame where you
decide to use I mean programming
language
forget about frameworks programming
language right so long as you know the
syntax of one language you can solve any
type of algorithm that you could think
of now one thing that you're gonna
notice some of them are faster than
others you know calculating the the
whole thing especially like I say if
somebody comes saying
gives you I don't know 50,000 users or
something then I okay sort this out
something like C is gonna be faster than
PHP and something like like C is gonna
be faster the Ruby or JavaScript right
but as far as the algorithms people
remember those things you know there's a
lot of Indian workers and not to bring
it out to put the blame on Indian
workers but they're the ones that
they've mastered this whole thing they
have you know classes on Saturdays where
they meet up and be like hey guys we
want to get hired by Amazon Google or
Facebook so what they do is they sit
down and I know about this cuz I went to
college way where people that did this
they go over and they create these
groups where all they do is is basically
study the algorithms and then remember
it okay yeah you can understand it but
it's more about memory because when you
go to a job interview if you didn't
study if you don't remember it right
number one just by being nervous you're
gonna forget everything you your brain
is gonna go blank so it's like even the
most talented developers they mess up
all right so that's one of the things
that for me
interviews shooting have algorithms
because people are just not good taking
tests you know what I mean just because
you're good at taking tests doesn't mean
that you're smart oh you're better than
somebody else it just means like hey you
really love taking testing you you you
basically are better in that environment
but when it comes to work somebody that
probably failed the test
it's way smarter than you and knows more
than you you know what I'm saying so a
lot of people just come in and like they
cheat on the game which is just remember
things by memory instead of actually
knowing how it works so let me see when
taking a programming course is it good
to take my time and learn material
Russell of course of course you got to
take your time man
you shouldn't be jumping ahead of things
unless you understand what's going on
like you're not supposed to remember
everything right what you gonna need to
understand is the concepts right and be
like not be used to be CSS for example
CSS a lot of people waste so much time
trying to remember every property you
don't have to remember every property
right what you need to understand is the
concept of it right like you could
target at a div inside of another div by
targeting the class right or you could
target by the ID or you could say inside
of this element that has the class of
menu the div that's inside of it I want
the background to go red right if you
understand those concepts you know CSS
all right everything else is on the
documentation this thing's out here in
web development that you just don't need
to remember every single thing right for
somebody that comes in but I hey I'm
trying to remember every single thing
about CSS grids or Flex boxes and it's
like why are you doing that way this is
not a memory game right you remember
things as you're building inside as you
use it but you shouldn't spend like a
month two months in there trying to
remember every property of it it's like
no that's what the documentation is
there as long as you understand the
concepts then you could just move on you
get what I'm saying like you shouldn't
be in there trying to remember how the
properties are or in JavaScript you
shouldn't try to remember every single
method that is inside of an object or
like let's say in a rate write an array
has a whole bunch of different objects
methods that you can use right on it are
you supposed to remember every single
one no you nobody's asking you to come
in and remember every single for loop or
every single loop inside of JavaScript
that sounds stupid right that's how I'm
being honest that sounds stupid to be
like here I'm gonna remember the for in
loop though in for loop though freaking
the for each loop duh freaking whatever
loop they decide to come up with you
know a year from now no the
documentation is there
you gonna say like once you understand
the concept of a loop you decide which
one you want to use you can say hey I
want to use a for loop today hey this
I'm using you know how you call is I'm
using this array I'm gonna use the dot
map right to return back or something
different you know once you understand
those things you choose which one you
want you know now responsive design is
all about basically knowing how to work
work work with CSS 3 million media
queries that's it if you understand
media queries and understand like how
things work and stand like ok you have a
minimum width that you're trying to
target and you have a maximum width that
you're trying to target anything between
that is gonna get targeted you know
that's it you know it cuz everything
else you could look at the documentation
you know I don't think you know people
or dollars starting this career
she'll be focused on remembering every
property what you should be doing is
building projects right and whatever you
don't know you search it you look at the
documentation you know guys that come in
you you see a guy in in a conference
right those guys that go to conference
they do talks and well that's one of the
things to that I hate about when you
take a course that people come in and
they do a conference talk or they do a a
course and you see everything is perfect
they don't add the mistakes they don't
show you the human mistakes that happen
so you as a developer as a uni developer
you come in and you start thinking oh
wow this developer is so much smarter
than me oh my god I ha I gotta praise
this person you know because this person
doesn't make mistakes this person he
knows that um whatever he never misses a
semicolon and as I bro you don't
understand that this guy's been coding
for like 10 years like in 10 years he
doesn't remember a lot of the stuff by
memory then there's a problem you know
what I mean now when you look
can add of course you gotta understand
all those guys make mistakes and they
redo the video again so if you try to
compare yourself to an instructor or you
trying to compare yourself to anybody a
youtuber or whatever you're already
losing you know why because you gotta
understand that they have the option to
edit things out cut it out record it
again
you as a developer you doing this live
you're doing this on your own with your
brain you know so that's how it is man
phase are you from NYC man let's say
somebody pulled my card
they're like you're not from NYC no
Morton I don't live in New York City no
more man
you can consider this the tri-state I'm
from Connecticut I'm from I'm from
Connecticut now we speak like this in
Connecticut I'm from New York forever
man but yeah man is anyone gonna go to
twitch just to be the warm viewer on
Twitch guys there's people on Twitch the
probably the problem is I don't know how
to do it how to do both of them at the
same time I got to figure it out somehow
all right I got to figure it out how to
do it do live streams on Twitch and live
streams on on YouTube I don't know how
to do it at the same time unfortunately
all right so let me see what else what
is your opinion our cast is good it's a
great website for PHP if you want to
focus on just PHP all our cast has your
back what's your thoughts on team
treehouse scene treehouses ok man
they do what they do they're super late
on things that's my only problem with it
like their videos is they focus so much
on having great quality of video like of
percenters the guys that come into the
instructors look amazing their lighting
looks amazing the set looks amazing but
that makes the video super slow meaning
if a new framework comes up today right
it's gonna take them six months just to
make one course in aving a full course
introduction to what that framework
that's my only problem with team
treehouse they so late on everything let
me see what else how to use Narborough
ruby if possible go to my websites all
in there man
so you are now saying junior development
should start with rails I'm not saying
that you should start with rails you
gotta do a research in your area I'm
putting it in there as an option you're
gonna be able to have different options
right if you live in an area where you
say okay I get more opportunities in PHP
my website has PHP if you're in an area
where you say hey man I'm actually a
good developer and I want to start with
a really high paid then and you have a
lot of projects you want to show off
your Ruby on Rails skills do Ruby on
Rails everybody knows that Ruby on Rails
pays probably the most out of all the
different arm you know frameworks out
there or programming languages like Ruby
jobs pay the most for junior developers
right for people coming in and I just
made a video in 40 minutes you guys
gonna watch a video which I'm releasing
at 6:00 p.m. which talks about junior
developer positions I'm not gonna talk
about that right now cuz then it's gonna
ruin the next video that I'm talking
about let me see you Joe check my
question for a5 or la Blanca Blanca
Monique what's your question
put it up if it went up already and I
missed it could you please repost it so
I can see if tree
houses late which program is a little
more up-to-date I will say you got my
website you got all udemy calm and with
the reason why I like you to meet our
comm is because you pay for specifically
a class right like you say okay I want
to learn a example Python I want to
learn Python so you just pay for your
Python course now most of the
instructors there they come in and they
show you all the latest things are going
on with Python right well let's say
react when react came out react 16 came
out let's say for example the latest
version when it came out automatically
there was already a course for all on it
for it on udemy calm now the steam
treehouse have that no you're gonna way
a
long time for that to be on scene
treehouse because the problem is teen
treehouse has amazing production alright
but when it comes to this I don't care
about the production yeah but I'm saying
like you shouldn't care about that
production either what you should care
is the course in the instructor is the
person teaching you things properly are
you learning the latest things I could
care less like you know what I mean like
if team treehouse would be like hey guys
we have your courses in VR you put on
this headphones and you put on this
headset and you're good you're gonna be
in a virtual reality world learning how
to code nobody cares about that it's
like they focus too much in the
production instead of creating the
content you know like this because
unfortunately this industry changes like
this so if you're not like this then
you're like seven months behind and in
freaking web development that's like
years you're so behind like it's not
even useful no more you know what I mean
la Blanca Monique what are you thoughts
on creating a seven things on team
forest listen if you know how to market
yourself and you know how to work it
they're great I just talked about this
yesterday if you want to sell courses or
not courses all sub themes and and and
stuff like that online or team forest
you could do it but you have to create
our audience you have to go on YouTube
and start let's say create tutorials for
WordPress right and be like okay these
are tutorials for WordPress but target
not developers because developers is not
really the people that you should be
targeting you got a target how to build
a oh how to build a website for your
restaurant right those are the people
that you want to target how to build a
WordPress website for your pizzeria how
to build a WordPress website for your
sneaker shop how to build a website for
your small business
you know you do those videos that
attracts people to your content then
from there you give them free of free
themes things that are not like fully
built they don't have a whole bunch of
image slider it's a whole bunch of stuff
you basically come in and create and
create little things right small like
load themes that you could come in and
promote them but okay this is free for
you guys but this right here are my
premium ones right so now those themes
you sell it for forty fifty dollars a
pop right if the people they eff with
you right if the effort you might like
you know what I mean if they effort you
then they're gonna buy it if not that if
they don't effort you then it's just not
gonna pop off for you on themeforest cuz
you gotta understand is a lot of
competition and there's people there's
companies out there that have already
created a name and not only that that
since they started in the beginning they
already have that capital they're
already got that blue cheese you know
that that money phone that that guala
that you know that money waiter that
waiter you know the blue cheese waiter
freaking the benji way you know so they
have money for advertising so when they
come in and spend their money on
advertising
they basically drown you out you could
be a brand new developer like oh hi guys
I have a new WordPress theme but then if
this company comes in in black hey man
we're paying $1000 per day for
advertising you're getting drowned out
you know what I mean like nobody's ever
gonna find your team you gotta learn how
to how to market things in and how to
get it out there you know what I mean
but yeah man so what else any other
questions man about to start heading out
man for sorry man
I'll be honest man I answer this every
single day every single day hi from
India how much time it takes to learn
all front-end web
technologies so be honest with you this
could take years
this is not gonna be something from one
day to the other all right can you learn
the basics and be able to build a
website be able to become productive and
a month yes
can you do in two months yes can you do
in three months can you do in anywhere
between three months to a year yes but
you shouldn't be worried about how long
it's gonna take you well you should be
worried about is how much time are you
going to put into it because people come
in and gonna hey I want to become a
developer but I'm only gonna put in one
hour a day okay if you're gonna put one
hour a day I'll see you here three years
from now you get what I'm saying is I
come back you come back in three years
from now bleh
what an official applications like hi
Joe here's my website after three years
I got it done
yeah like that's what's gonna happen to
you now if you come in and take a series
and you'll be like hey I'm gonna do
three to six hours a day you could get
it done in a month or two you know but
that's just the Fernet and then on top
of that if a new framework comes out
then you gotta add that time to it too
now you gotta learn something new so
it's like it's not really about how long
is gonna take you is how long are you
willing to put time into it you know
it's like are you gonna put it in time
eight hours a day or you gonna come in
and do half an hour and be like I'm
sleepy I'm gonna go in I'm gonna try
this I'm gonna you know what I've heard
about this - I'm gonna watch this udemy
course my way home on a podcast I'm
gonna just put it on and I'll listen to
it it doesn't work like that you gotta
be building things you gotta be creating
things you got to start building website
projects you know what I mean so it's
not really about um how long is gonna
take you is how much time are you
willing to put into it okay
the best time to start Orko steal my
sequel course I just finished the color
game mostly on my all from his bootcamp
course and currently learning PHP on the
side yeah you can start jumping into my
sequel as soon as you can yeah now uh he
does all the time people be like oh yeah
you know I'll be learning courses on on
you to me as if there are a podcast I
put it in my ear and I walk around with
it wait what like that's not how you
learn that's why people end up like in
this thing for two three years and be
like damn man I've been trying you know
on and off I hate when people come in
and like on and off I don't know if
means that you put in no time you took
this thing as a hobby people come in
here and things like this whole thing is
like a freaking hobby where you just
come in and you do it once in a blue
moon
it's a guarantee for me to get higher if
I have 20 20 plus projects it's
guaranteed to get higher if you have one
solid project you don't need 20 projects
you know people worry about building a
whole bunch of projects now build
applications bill look what this kid
matt was thinking about building right
now right look at his example what he's
doing he's doing something productive
and at the same time he's gonna be able
to use all all his knowledge that he has
in web development to build that one
application the application is not gonna
be easy the application is gonna deal
with HTML CSS JavaScript and some type
of backend technology and some type of
database and some type of you know a way
to deal with sessions cookies so you're
gonna have to go in there and build a
lot of stuff right so one project that
you built that Sally counts better than
20 projects that you come in and be like
you know even like the little thing
where was this guy's name or coldsteel
has that little color game to me those
type of things are done right I rather
you come in and start building websites
because nobody really cares
you know you go to a job interview right
and you can't show that you can't show
that to somebody when I created a color
game that took me three hours to build
or whatever it's like nobody's gonna
look at them be like thank you sir you
you've built the best color game you
know but another thing to which I'm not
gonna go too deep into it but that's the
reason why Co Co now he's doing more on
his new course he has a new course on
Python which I'm gonna put the link on
the description and I'm doing a review
tomorrow I already did it today our
releasing it tomorrow
basically we're now he's changing his
whole way of doing courses where is like
doing more solid projects and more good
examples and in testing the student
instead of giving them like a full you
know seven hours of videos and then not
even testing the person you know so what
about cloning apps is a good strategy
yes you could look like let's say look
at Facebook clone that look at all
airbnb clone that look at craigslist.com
clone that you know and build it from
scratch I know you went over
projects you need but if you recommend
one application to build what would it
be I will say build a real estate
application look at Zillow calm and try
to recreate Zillow zillow.com is
difficult there's a lot of stuff in
there especially if you try to do it
with JavaScript there's so many things
in there that is kind of ridiculous
eighty-four muses are you only ninety
thousand for my to-do list yes sir
that's how people show up and I was like
people showed me like hey man you know I
have I have this this little project
that that pretty much is like you know
you putting a paragraph in and I'll tell
you I'll tell you how many words are
inside of your paragraph can you hire me
like wait what lake are you hearing
yourself like people come in with the
craziest dumbest projects like those are
things to practice those are not things
to put in your portfolio you know ma
like I see so many portfolios showing
their promote o'clock and Simon game and
I'm like like they're good to to
basically practice they you know it's
like what is this guy's name what's boss
West boss has a 30 on 30 so it's like 30
projects for 30 days like those things
are great to practice it's just like
Franco camp but you shouldn't be showing
up to wait to a freaking job interview
it's like here you guys here's my 30
projects that I did with West's boss
like that's not a project man that's not
something you put in your portfolio
that's for you to practice real estate
app is it too hard how are we supposed
to build it that's the idea you're
supposed to come in that's why listen go
to my Watson take the Ruby on Rails
course I go over all those things right
now right one of the things I tell
people why Ruby on Rails or laravel or
or any MVC framework out there and one
of the reasons why I'm not such a huge
fan of nodejs is because you for you to
learn web development you you need to
learn the whole process of everything
you know doing requests to a routing
doing post requests saving stuff to the
database how to return back JSON data
all those things when you deal with
something like nodejs and Express it's
like you're in the wild wild west
there's no no structure so it should him
it's not some place where a junior
developer starts with you know a Geneva
developer doesn't start with that you
know you want to start with a framework
that is it has been put into practice
and has been successful right now stuff
like Ruby on Rails laravel Django like
all those things they have been around
for a while and there have been testing
you know as a junior developers is hard
for somebody to go into nodejs and be
like hey man I know exactly what I'm
doing is like no no you don't like you
don't you barely understand the whole
process of it you know
I would definitely tell you guys go to
the website check out the Ruby on Rails
basically I go over all of those things
on how to build a full application and
how to break down things because you
look at our website let's say YouTube
right and you look at YouTube and you're
like um I don't even know how to build
YouTube you think I could build the HTML
but do you understand the process of how
everything works you know what I'm
saying
this does the world Ruby on Rails cover
react for the end course and use rails
at back in API I don't know yet I still
got to do this this block what I might
do is my combined Ruby or rails with
react the react course meaning I'm going
to put in in the react course the final
project of the Ruby on Rails block right
the final project of the Ruby on Rails
block and then I'll probably what I do
is I'll use reuse that project and then
put it into the react or course and add
as a bonus and then basically use react
for the front-end so we basically
transfer everything that we have already
in our website with just Ruby or rails
server side rendering to now use and
react for the front-end routing and for
the front-end course itself you know so
yeah I don't know yet you know what I
mean like you guys know me I come in I
create stuff every single day so
depending on how things are I'm gonna
decide if I want to put in or react into
the Ruby or rails because in reality you
don't really need it like you could take
react and put into any back-end it's not
a specific thing what's the deal with
the nodejs course I wanna do no GS right
but I want to do no GS
but with cloud 9 and I also want to do
it with
adonis GS I'm not gonna do react with
just expressed because that thing is a
mess all right that thing is a complete
mess and on top of that for junior
developers I think it's the wrong way to
learn no GS or even web development in
general to jumping into no GS and blah
I'm just gonna learn express expresses
like how can I say express is like so
low level like you need to know web
development in general before you even
be touching on no GS a whiff Express
right it just doesn't make sense
cloud9 why because a lot of people
freaking half windows right most of my
day consists of answering people's
questions about Windows like I don't
want to be dealing with that like that's
why it turned me off so even do don't
know Jay escorts because I was like man
all these people constantly is like oh
they have a problem with NPM they have a
problem with this they have a problem
with that and it's like man that's why
people should be freaking installing
other Linux or getting a Mac like you're
trying to get into this thing but if
like if there's a barrier there in front
of you and it's like blocking you from
learning to code like I don't want to be
the guy teaching you how to use Windows
like I don't want to come in there and
make a freakin to our course of many
course in the beginning of how to
install Windows how to install no js' on
your windows saying how to deal with
environments I don't want to do that my
job is to teach you how to code I don't
want to be teaching you how to use your
computer you get what I'm saying
so yeah man
yeah now having a Mac is not a barrier
to learning to code Oh what I'm saying
is like there's a lot of stuff
like this is the thing like I hear this
all the time from people and I also want
to make a video about this the people
that come in him and usually be like man
my Windows is perfect everything I want
to do in my windows here you know I come
in and I'm good
everything works for me guys you gotta
understand you either coming from like
hacking games right getting free games
online using torrents knowing how to
install programs for free like you
already have a certain type of knowledge
that 90% other people don't have if I'm
Johnny
the freaking the marketing guy or Johnny
the mechanic I'm not coming in with this
knowledge of hey man this how to debug
your windows here's how to do this and
that most people don't know that you get
what I'm saying like most people are
coming in like I want to become a
developer but I don't I still don't know
my operating system that well right how
can i I still learn to code without
having this thing a barrier in front of
me people want to be able to build
things they don't want to spend time
debugging their computer so that's the
main reason why I haven't done the
nodejs
or even focus on a lot of stuff from
windows because it's like hey man it's
like you you gotta take on a whole
Windows class you get what I'm saying
like some people don't even understand a
lot of stuff yeah like there's a lot of
issues that you're gonna bump into on
Windows that you're just not gonna find
a solution I'm being honest there's
certain situations where is like why is
this package not working hello you're on
the windows like a lot of developers
they don't even make this stuff for for
Windows users unless you're focusing on
dotnet people are not focused on you as
a Windows user people are not focus on
you know all the cool things and all the
things that are moving the technology
forward are done on Mac
right why do you think like a lot of the
best applications are only on Mac on
either a Mac on our only on iPhone
because it's easier for the developer
the developer is like doesn't want to
deal with all the fragmentation of
Windows you could be you know on Windows
right and Windows without upgrade and
for whatever reason now your NPM doesn't
work you know what I mean like if you
don't keep you your windows updated
constantly now you're dealing with auto
BS you know it's ironic before because
the cool computer debugging is perfect
training for Co research and Google is
your friend yes that's definitely true
but the problem with that or 84 is a lot
of people get turned off I I myself I
would hate to be a person that comes in
and it's learning how to code or I'm
interested in learning to code and then
this ago a huge barrier for a big a
swore in front of me you know I mean
like a world the size of like the main
runners war and you're like Jesus Christ
I gotta get over this war and it's like
yeah because it's Windows right just to
code some simple website just to call
some simple react you have to go through
hell just to install everything so
that's the problem you know what I mean
so so having never used a Mac why why
would I recommend it everything that you
see everything that you see online as
far as github all the projects that you
see there are open source all the new
frameworks everything that's being done
is really with the mindset of like hey
this works on Mac this works on Linux
right now a lot of times you got to do a
whole bunch of workarounds for things to
work on Windows you have to do a
executable file you got to do a whole
bunch of stuff like most people don't do
that
okay so what Mac will you recommend
currently right now I have a 13-inch
MacBook Pro I have to the max that one
right that's the latest version with the
whole little touchscreen you don't need
that you need a MacBook Pro from 2012
till let's say 2014 find it on
Craigslist find it you could buy it for
like 400 dollars you're good
after that you're coding you're not
doing photo manipulation you're not
doing Photoshop you're not doing video
editing you don't need none of that
stuff all you need is the system to
jumpstart your career that's a $400 you
can look on Craigslist let's look right
now for example we gotta go live let's
do this live and let's see oh let's see
Craigslist okay let's see in Craigslist
see for sale let's see MacBook MacBook
Pro look at this $400 15-inch okay this
2009 it's a little bit older let's see
this one okay I 7 processor 649 now
you're gonna find better deals depending
on where you live like if I go to New
York City let's say New York
see New York they're selling MacBooks
like pancakes all day like every single
day somebody's selling a MacBook Pro
look at this 2013 MacBook Pro Retina
$600 you good a gigabytes of RAM 250
gigabyte flash drive which means it's
gonna be super fast
you got Retina screen look 15 inch
quad-core i7 $600 you know I was like
let's put in a maximum let's say we want
this to be let's say we want this to be
a maximum $500 $500 this was gonna cost
you for a decent Windows computer just a
decent we're not talking about nothing
special a decent brand-new computer that
in six months is gonna catch a virus
it's gonna start going super slow no
matter what you do all right max don't
work like that max don't go slow ever
I've never had my computer be slow ever
okay so look at this you got all this
this computers $400 like this is like a
such a small investment like people
don't understand how important this is
and it's not just because it's like oh
it's a preference some people think like
hey man is a preference man I could come
here you know and and if we can get a a
MacBook Pro or you know what I'm not
gonna do a MacBook Pro I'm gonna do a
Windows no matter why because it's a
preference it's not a preference man
it's just everything works perfectly Oh
max it's that simple there's no fighting
and there's no debating aid there's no
arguing a body every developer can tell
you everything works better on Macs
right now if you feel like hey man I
don't mind debugging every time that I
want to do an update yeah I don't mind
debugging like a new thing comes out you
know the MPM just came out yarn just
came out you don't know what's gonna
happen by the end of the year a new
package manager' a new system on your
programming language might come out and
that last thing that you want to do is
be like oh I got Windows so I got a
spring six seven hours debug in my
computer like it's $400 man if you don't
have $400 a year man you need to go
straight up and I go to oh no like be
like yo man like I don't know I don't
know what's the answer to it you know as
a hero got $400 and you live in the
United States you you telling me you
can't save a hundred dollars every month
for like three or four months if you
can't do that you have issues is that
simple I understand if you live in other
countries cuz $400 might be what they
earn in the whole month but if you live
in the United States you need to step
your game up
so whatever LeBlanc is like yo I just
never used a Mac before always use
Windows I might have to take a course to
learn how it's easy nah you don't even
need to learn listen guys there's not a
course that you need for Macs people get
scared they think like it's so different
trust me it's that simple as the same
way as the windows it's not much of a
difference like just play around with it
but yeah man I'm out of here man I'm out
of here new videos about to drop in a
few minutes so yes sir we out you dig is
it boy job back at it again coding
face.com guys investing yourself
nobody's gonna do it for you you know
what I mean hey Raheem what up what up
what up what up you know what I mean so
we out of here Wow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
