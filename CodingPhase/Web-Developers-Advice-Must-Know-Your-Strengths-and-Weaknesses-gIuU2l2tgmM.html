at it again man coatings com listen live
from the nature and life in the world is
live from backyard and ice from
everywhere man your boy is back I've
been doing this for a minute man alright
guys so we're gonna continue with this
and we're never told today about
basically you know know your strengths
and weaknesses if you know you're really
strong in JavaScript continuing
JavaScript and keep doing things and
JavaScript and try to you know pick a
lot of projects that have to deal with
JavaScript you know especially when
you're getting paid for it don't sign up
for things that you're not too
comfortable so like let's say right now
for example for me is I'm really really
good with JavaScript I'm not gonna pick
a java assignment you know like when you
see your list on your task manager I'm
not gonna go out of my way I mean I hey
man can I get a job from Java when I'm
 suck from Java and I'm just
gonna sign up for it for no reason
because now is like I'm setting myself
up for failure this happens all the time
sometimes you might say hey man let me
set up the the API for you and then when
you finish the API the person has to
come in and correct everything that you
did you know it's like it's not a good
look it doesn't look good on you doesn't
look good on the company make sure that
you do things that you're really strong
it of course when you in your house and
you're in your personal space and needs
to hate I want to work on XYZ technology
cool you can do that but at a company
you know Thomas money you know you're
getting paid for a reason you're
expected to guess the best work that you
can and if like you go and take a task
that you can't finish or it's above your
pay grade or is above your skill set
then now you're costing the company
money
this is very important for you guys to
learn from the beginning from the ground
up so when you start working with a team
you don't seem like you don't know what
the you do you know what I mean I'm
sorry I'm currently a lot but that's
just it's like this challenge is like me
talking to my friends and like you know
imagine me and you're just turning out
here in the backyard I'm just a payment
I'm talking to you you know what I mean
that's what this channel is about me and
yet so you know it just make sure you
pick the right thing make sure you you
pick the task that you're really gonna
sign you know such such a cell for you
know something really good was like hey
if you know how to convert anything into
PS you know from PSD to HTML CSS and you
really go with C assessing and managing
your sass files and you know breaking
thing does into different modules man go
ahead and build that because now people
is going to come to you in together you
know give you a little pat on the back
and by hey man good job you know that's
what you really want you really want to
have positive energy around you
especially at your job you know you
don't want to be working on something
that you know you can't really finish
you can't get done you know so
definitely know your strengths and
weaknesses and always go for your
strengths you know if you're really good
at javascript javascript my pajamas
