cannot be something that is gonna be
like super long like I'm talking about a
series I'm not talking about series yeah
yeah yeah my phone okay so I need you
guys to tell me like what Satori I
should do tonight I'm not talking about
like a tutorial is gonna be super long
like a full-on tutorial like teach me
JavaScript like I can't teach you Java
Script in one video let me know guys I
need your help to let me know exactly
what the torus should I do tonight
because I was thinking about doing the
Rakhi stack but I'm not gonna do the
Rakhi stack tonight I'm gonna do that
maybe tomorrow but I can do a quick
tutorial for 5-10 minutes that you guys
might want
so let me know
let me see how can I look at the chatter
raise or connect okay displaying JSON
objects are raised or connect to
database how to connect to a database
alright I could do that
that should be easy
shouldn't be that hard
maybe I'll do that tonight maybe I
connect
like I don't know maybe I could do a
drop-down menu show you a menu like a
CSS only drop-down menu maybe that could
be helpful for some of you guys
isu to change I could say yeah but we're
actually in a different type of audience
so the advertising that I get on my
channel most of the time are
I am or enjoying I don't know milk
Mountain whatever it is right so that's
not really affecting me that much
because they still going to give
commercials on on those are videos no
matter what like whenever I talk about
web development web developer HTML CSS
JavaScript whatever it is they're always
going to show the same type of
commercials now if I did something like
I don't know a parody or comedy or you
know how you call those videos with like
tricking people pranks then maybe I
would be affected but I know thing too
is like I'm not making money from my
guilt or like that I'm not thinking of
this thing is like I'm cashing in on
YouTube like for me to cash in on
YouTube I need to get you know a million
views every day or every two days link
that's how you make money you know what
I mean like cuz think about it every
1,000 views is like two dollars so daily
I get about I think I don't know five
thousand six thousand views so I
probably I think I make like $12
$12 a day from YouTube which at the end
of the month it adds up you know it adds
up to like $300 but I came to learn with
$300 so definitely YouTube doesn't like
it's not really affecting me you know
YouTube doesn't pay the bills
while you can't see the video
the mentorship project decoded I'm sorry
guys this thing keeps cutting out I'm
like in the middle of knowing exactly
they got a dog without me actually
coating and just like explaining people
the way how to break down the page I
could do that and there's a lot of
people with test us out here man
like this one thing - man like this
freaking where I live somebody sent me a
message today like Oh Joe's bowling
Joe's doing this and I'm like no man
where I live I'm like the poorest person
on the you know the neighborhood like
this bowlers out here I'm just a
poor guy that lives in a good
neighborhood you know but yeah let me
see what else what other tutorials guys
I got two good tutorials already I got
the mentorship program decode it
what else um let me see what else
if I'm in a new murse yes sir we in here
I don't know why I feel like a real
person here for something like I don't
feel like I didn't feel like a real
person in the other car I have but this
one makes me feel good makes me feel
like I'm I'm a human being I get treated
like a human being now now by um you
know I'll be joking guys people don't
take it too serious I do not be joking
but yeah so we got two good tutorials
you know the JSON objects or connect to
a database that's one let's see connect
to a database this one and then we got
another one which is breakdown the
mentorship project decoded so I could do
that
got some beauties bro like yeah we got
them little beauties out here sign now
man I'm too old for that I'm about to
have a kick I can't even I came and look
at biddies no more my girls freaking
Hawking me she don't even let me move my
head anyway but yeah what else what's
the best way to make a one page site and
got my knife and what the links what
link to look to that knife different
section on that page oh I could do that
that's the plan Orlando that's my plan
that's my plan I want to create a union
course where I teach everything from
from scratch from the beginning to the
end
but that's gonna take a long time so I
have to first release coding phase calm
because I've got thousands of people
sending me messages leaving comments
here and then sending me emails that
they want to join coding phase calm and
they can't join because when they press
the joy button it doesn't do anything
but then when you press the menu' it
sends you to register but still you
can't see anything after you register so
it's still not done so I have to knock
that out and then I'm a look you
know a unity course that's gonna be I
guess next year somewhere next year I'm
not doing it this year because I have to
give it like at least three to four
months of me making the whole course
just focusing on the course and that's
it
because I don't want to be doing the
half-assed course and charging people
$10 $15 whatever it is put it I don't
want to charge nobody if I know that
they could get a better you know from
another instructor so
I just got your first client that's
what's up bro we doing it big this year
man's 27 year ask questions here and
other people that don't know am i
helping out you got Matt you got all the
courses that I know that be it's like I
go I start creating tutorials for you
know the rocky stack and nobody I know
nobody stirring them courses nobody's
taking those tutorials maybe like four
or five people are taking it and you
guys are missing out because the next
step that I'm gonna start tomorrow is
creating the website with react so it's
like if you miss out on that and you
don't do it man you can learn react for
free with me like on a simple way in a
real easy way the money wait the blue
cheese wait you know what I mean like yo
this son is crazy right now
and I'm burning up because if I turn on
the AC you guys won't be able to hear me
properly
sedition is too loud
the money weighed a blue-cheese way boy
do when you get back from Cali Barbara
okay i'ma hold you to it
I hope you do it
so yeah man come on guys give me another
idea we got to two tutorials that I
could do give me another one we got
databases we got what else almost other
one databases breaking down the project
for the you know mentorship project I
could do that easily
let's see what else
it's the rocky stack only from Mac and
Linux nope you could do it on Windows to
your boy Andre creating a a tutorial and
you gave me permission to put it on my
on my channel which is on Windows so all
of you guys that actually know windows
and get know how to use Windows you guys
can learn it with the tutorial I mean
it's if you do what I'm doing on your
computer everything's gonna be the same
the only difference is is the
installation how to install it that's
the only difference then everything else
is the same
a quick API yeah I could do that soon
I'm missing somebody sent me a message
that they want wanted me to do the Star
Wars API maybe I could do that quick
wireframing actually applying into a
website structure I could allow them to
 allergies man I'm dying guys I'm
sorry I'm turning the ACR because I'm
dying
unless all of you guys man bless all of
you guys man we all blessed we all bless
because we live in the best time of our
lives right now
there's like the best time of our lives
right now like all you have to do is
just work on the shame man study
come on guys like you're telling me how
to help somebody send me a message like
hey Joe how the hell do you find time so
do all of this and I'm like I don't
even know I don't have time cuz I do
look I went to work I was there for 9
o'clock to 5 o'clock then now I'm gonna
go home cook a little bit cook some food
then my girlfriend's gonna come through
we're gonna hang out for a little bit
then from there like an 8 o'clock I'm
gonna start doing a tutorial and then
from there after I finished doing the
tutorial I got to work on coding phase
calm and then right before I go to sleep
I'm gonna do half an hour of studying
how to make HTML 5 um what was it what
development games that were developing
games video games html5 video games
right so that's what I'm gonna do today
so that you telling me that you guys
right now you guys cannot go home and
and basically do half an hour 1 hour of
code come on man you guys could do it
you know
in life there's people who do and
those people who don't do and then
they end up just staying in the house
not doing you know what I mean so
it's like I want you guys to do be one
of the doers be one of the people that
actually get done you know you
don't want to be one of these people
that you know they'd be like oh I tried
doing it out and get to do it I wasn't
successful in it like you know how many
people they'd be like oh I started I
joined the gym and then they joined the
gym and don't work out you know or
they'd be like hey I joined the
jiu-jitsu class and then they don't show
up so this is the same guys it's
like you come here because you like to
call you like the idea of coding you
like the idea of putting in the work all
right but you don't want to put in the
work it's hot man hot
