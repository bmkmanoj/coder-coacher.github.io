Oh coding things back huh you already
knows your boy jump back again and I
done did it again all right listen guys
quick advice for everybody doesn't
matter if you're a junior doesn't matter
if you're a senior doesn't matter if
your mid-level doesn't matter if you're
a coding ninja right I don't
care
this is a quick advice stop jumping on
the latest thing especially when you try
to push something to production when
you're working in production guys you do
not push things that are experimental
right it's like just because you start
seeing a lot of people using online and
like hey no we want you to use whatever
a bootstrap floor or even boma
io
which I love the framework but for my
own projects when you at work you got a
 test a shadow that you can just
be like hey I'm gonna switch up on the
framework and nobody knows until the
last day you know what I mean because
I'm in a situation right now where I'm
gonna have to go and redo so much
because somebody else was using a latest
version of a library which broke
everything because our website has a lot
of legacy code so it's like now we got
to go in there and change a lot of
man I don't know how to explain it guys
it just be very careful be very careful
always ask somebody whenever you're
going to add a new version of anything
doesn't matter if it's the latest
version of Windows doesn't matter if
it's the latest version of Ubuntu
doesn't matter if it's the latest
version of a library I don't
care if it's RAM de of version 4.0 I
don't care if is
the latest c-sharp it doesn't matter
what it is guys you will need to ask the
most senior person in there right the
person was in charge of the project well
the person who's closest to that person
who's in charge because that saves your
ass from getting in trouble
that saves your ass from people looking
at you like you're crazy for
doing some crazy you know on the
website so this was just a quick advice
man like I'm telling you guys listen to
me you're gonna be fine but you know
like every day there's new situations
even either my job or situations where
people text me like my friend is
freaking out because of this situation
where it's like somebody came in with a
whole different version and started
coding their code in a certain way for
the newer version but what they didn't
think of is like hey everything else on
the website is legacy but now let me add
in this new version now all those things
are not going to work so now somebody
who I would senior developer or whoever
the developer mid-level or
whatever is going to have to go in the
eff fix all the mistakes that the person
did which brings in more work for them
that's just what I'm saying guys like
you gotta also to learn coding is not
about just like oh being smart man it's
about having common sense man I don't
care if you could solve the biggest
sorting tree
I'll clap for you I'll be like
you know great you did a good
job on remembering something of the
stupid right but if you come in and you
 just have no common sense on
certain things it's like to me I have
half no no patience for that I got very
a very cool and very nice with
buddy but man and just just have common
sense all right
common sense of like hey maybe this
doesn't work with the website maybe I
should ask somebody because there's
legacy code throughout the whole website
so if I go and change something maybe
somewhere something's gonna break you
know before you start coding anything
it's really good to do pseudo code right
just go in there type down what you're
doing type down what's gonna happen like
if I click on this button is going to
show this modal like write that down
don't code you write it down alright
that's the same thing just to keep your
your head like you know sharp and know
what the hell's going on because
sometimes we want to start coding like
oh man I go online and I find you know
the latest a Harry Potter
framework and I'm like I'd only just add
this to the website yes buddy you could
do that but then what's going to happen
with the rest of the site you're gonna
go in there and start recording
from five years ago ten years ago no
because now you're doing double work you
know what I mean like guys I don't know
but I just really wish everybody would
just have common sense man you know what
I mean like have common sense and and
start thinking about that man start
thinking about just the simple things
about web development start thinking
about just using your brain it's that
simple it's nothing too crazy we're not
asking you to to create a I
don't know an app that makes your phone
fly man
just keep simple keep as
simple as possible keep as simple
as possible what the what's that thing
keep it simple stupid so I'm sure like
that
I forgot how it goes but yeah man it's
like come on just keep it simple guys
but yeah man this is a quick little
video for you guys because I love you
