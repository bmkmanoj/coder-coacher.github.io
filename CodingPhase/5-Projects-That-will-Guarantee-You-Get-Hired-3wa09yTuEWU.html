again : face calm your boys backing out
and did it again
listen there's a core score I know how
to code now what so the first thing that
we got to do and the first thing that
we're gonna talk about is the five
projects right I've been saying this if
you're a fan of Mines from YouTube you
basically know this that I keep
repeating this there's five projects
that guarantee you to get a job number
one is a real estate website why do I
say a real estate website number one
there's a lot of different things in the
UI like different forms filters you know
the fact that you have multiple listings
those things can help you out but for me
the biggest thing that helps you out
when you build a real estate it's the
fact that you understand a lot of
JavaScript and it shows to a future
employer that you know Java scripting
you can come in and you know hit the
ground running all right
that's number one number two a
restaurant why a restaurant a restaurant
is very important because it shows you
can build any type of website right
doesn't matter if it's the Chinese
restaurant around the corner it could be
the fancy Italian restaurant that you go
to you just have to create a website for
a restaurant
it doesn't matter doesn't matter if it's
a real restaurant or it's just fiction
all right now number three I will say is
definitely going to be your portfolio so
far we got two two websites that you
created so far right number three has to
be your portfolio because as soon as you
complete one website you have to show it
off to other people and show it to
people that's gonna search your name so
make sure your portfolio has your name
your full name
talking about your a fiction name your
street name your you know your nickname
that your friends call you it has to be
your full name like my website is Joe
Santos Garcia dot-com people can find me
people can see my resumes people can see
companies I've worked for clients that
I've had pretty much that's what you
want to do on your portfolio alright
another website is that ecommerce it
doesn't matter if you're selling a bait
shirt it doesn't matter if you're
selling t-shirts doesn't matter if
you're selling sneakers doesn't matter
what it is but there has to be a
ecommerce because you have to understand
99% of the time you're gonna get hired
to a company that's going to sell things
online right that's how you're gonna get
your money you're not gonna get your
money from you know creating your
friends music website
I mean sometimes some people are lucky
and they find a cool website like that
to work for I'm gonna say hey you you
have a friend who has a rock band
whatever it is right you can actually go
in there bill his website but in reality
when you get hired ninety-nine percent
of the time is gonna be like an
ecommerce website especially your first
job so you definitely need to show like
hey I've built other e-commerce websites
so you need that to be on your resume
another website that I will say to have
for sure is a digital agency alright a
digital agency when I say that I say
that because sometimes you're gonna get
the opportunity to get hired to work for
a digital agency who does you know cool
stuff like cool websites for Nike cool
websites for coca-cola cool websites for
the easies it doesn't matter what brand
it is right this always going to be a
digital agency hiring developers so you
want to show off your skills and your
animation
you want to show off your skills and
presentation cool designs all right so
you definitely need to have a digital
agency even when I have something like a
parallax scrolling it doesn't matter
oh oh it really matters is that you have
something flashy something nice I mean
if you don't know what a digital agency
is fine just look online search it now
I'm gonna say this to you guys because I
know a lot of you guys don't have no
history of design yeah I don't
understand design and understand colored
theory yet understand hierarchy yeah I
don't understand a lot of things and
that's fine what I will say to you guys
is go to dribble comm dribble comm has
the best of the best when it comes to
designers now why do I tell you to go
there and look for other people's
designs number one to get inspiration
number two you need to have an idea a
lot of you guys don't understand what
type of projects that you build like
when I tell you hey find a portfolio hey
find an ecommerce hey find a digital
agency most of you guys don't know where
to find those websites what type of
designs you should be making so what you
should do is find a design that you like
them on dribble calm and just pretty
much go there take your time find the
best one and build it you don't have to
create this you know from scratch you
could just go in there and be like hey
I'm gonna use this design and it's just
for you know what's gonna use only or
just for you to get a job you know all
these companies when they come to your
portfolio they want to see something
that makes you stand out if you have
designs you have websites that look like
you're worth a million bucks or that you
work for a major company automatically
you're gonna go ahead of the list
because there's plenty of talented
developers out there but
to their websites look good but I don't
think so and that's what makes you
special that's what makes you different
so that's one thing that I will say for
you guys to do for sure all right
so this are my five websites the five
websites that every developer needs to
have especially every junior developer
just because it's just gonna make you go
ahead of everybody else a lot of people
go in for interviews with little
websites full of code like you know a
little snippet codes from github or you
know copan and it's like people don't
hire you for that people hire you to
have websites so if you show up with
just a couple of snippets and be like oh
yeah I could do our algorithm yeah I
could do a little change of CSS but do
you have full websites what websites
what company have you ever worked for
before right that's what you want to
show an employer
all right that's so you know I want to
welcome you guys to this course I know
how to code now what</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
