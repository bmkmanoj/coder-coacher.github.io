over this article about this dad who's
actually a developer who decides to
teach his kid you know how to program
you know how to become a web developer
and if you read the whole article you
will see the challenges that he had just
to get his kid to be motivating and I
think this is like super cool right now
like you know because I've heard of
stuff like this like where you know
they're teaching kids and like you know
there's private schools and like you
know up-and-coming schools way they have
small little programs like this like you
know when you press base play a sound a
fart and say I farted for one second
like little stuff like that little kids
love that you know what I mean and
I think is really important to teach
kids how to program because like it or
not like programming is the future like
you know becoming a coder machine
learning like that's the future you know
what I mean like engineering math and
science that's the future you know
everything else is going to be at one
point you know automated you know and I
think is like right now we have a great
opportunity because I feel like it's
gonna be very dark in the future meaning
there's gonna be a lot of people without
jobs
so we coming into an industry where
we're basically we're generation 1 you
know what I mean think if we come into
this and have successful careers and be
able to provide for our families and our
kids and you know and pass it down to
them and teach them how important in
this to actually code like you know
sky's the limit you know like when I was
young when I was like I started
programming at 14 years old like I used
to be all the time on the computer and
pretty much I got it on like I love
my mom but like I never had no support I
never had nobody telling me
Oh keep doing your thing all that
freaking kept hearing was oh my god
you're gonna go blind get off that
computer data you know and like that's
why I stopped programming when I was
like 17 who knows I could have
been I don't know the Mark Zuckerberg
like Mark Zuckerberg when he
started programming when he was young
parents came in gave him a new
computer and every time that he went to
nursery like okay here here you go nurse
I knew I didn't have that you know what
I mean so it's like for kids that have
the interest like that's like for me
it's like super cold I you know
I so young when you have things like
Xbox ps4 cartoons you got your friends
you got sports and somehow your brain is
is attracted to something as cool as
programming like you have to applaud
that and just be like hey Kay keep doing
your thing and motivate him keep pushing
and like you know that sign that was
like breathing from you know this father
who was trying to get him to you know
get him to start a Python and you know
what at the end of the day he's a little
cane no matter what like you know he got
he was on gravitating to you know coach
school and they teaching him on
JavaScript because if you listen to the
songs in Khost school they're pretty
cool like you know they have a catchy
hook and they have a little animation
like you know what I mean so that's how
you catch the attention of you know kids
to be able to to start programming man
like straight up I think it's like super
important man we have to you know keep
motivating kids to do that you know or
you know learn math learn science cuz
that's the future man and trust me and I
don't know I just wanted to talk about
this a little bit cuz I thought you know
this is cool man like you have a
dad who's a web developer and you're
 pushing you to never had
a call like that's a good dad
you know
me so that's probably what I'm gonna do
when I have my kid like I'm gonna be
like okay baby
what if the Cap'n Crunch presses this
button what happened it's kid like
like damn I'm always gonna play around
with my kid you know
I teaching him new stuff I mean I can't
wait to be honest or whatever he decides
to do or her if it's a little girl she
wants to be a programmer I heard that or
she wants to you know become a doctor or
pretty much become an actress or act or
I don't know whatever she decides or he
decides I'm gonna support them and but
definitely motivate your kids and if you
have a kid like motivate them you know
don't put a stop to their dreams or
anything that they want to do just
support them and let's see what happens
after that you already know so boy Joe
