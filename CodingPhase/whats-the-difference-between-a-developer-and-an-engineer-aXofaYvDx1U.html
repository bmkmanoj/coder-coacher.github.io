it again mang once again with a very
good topic you know the other day I said
you know engineers developers you know
software engineer software developers
and a whole bunch of other different
titles out there front-end engineer you
know for UI engineer to me to be honest
with you guys it's all the same it's
very blurry between the lines when you
comes to all these titles right now I'm
gonna go into this article because this
article is pretty cool it talks about
what's the difference between a
developer and an engineer all right and
they gave her a couple of good points
you know they talked to employers and
they talked to engineers they talked to
developers
now I'm gonna be honest there's how I
feel an engineer to mice to me right for
me to say somebody's an engineer like
let's say I consider somebody who built
something from completely scratch right
and let's say somebody who creates a
framework to me that's an engineer he
engineers something all right now
somebody that uses frameworks and uses
different libraries to me that will be
considered a developer right the moment
you start building your own libraries
don't moment you start understanding how
things work you know and you start
architecting your own programs your own
ideas right as a programmer I will
consider you a engineer right a
developer is more somebody who pretty
much uses the tools that he has and
bills things with that alright somebody
let's say for example somebody who uses
WordPress that's a wordpress developer
right somebody who uses HTML CSS and
JavaScript and builds websites
that's a developer right somebody who
comes in and creates the front and
framework to me that's an engineer you
know I consider myself both at different
times you know I've also created my own
libraries I've created my own frameworks
with you know with crystal laying I
understand the whole stack I know how to
build things from scratch right but most
of my job consists of being a developer
I'm not creating you know or recreating
the wheel every single time as you guys
might see on my videos when I do like
you know quick little coding videos when
I'm just coding in my in my house just
for fun like I'm constantly just like
copy and pasting things that I already
know to do cuz in reality I'm the type
of person I don't like to waste time I
don't like to you know try to go in
there and be like hey I'm gonna write
everything down from scratch no it's
like I already know what I need to do or
I need to develop so they're just pretty
much better okay I need to Center
something vertical-align copy this from
here I need to change like a placeholder
I don't know the syntax from the top of
my head
copy and paste it but I know all the
things that I need to do right so I
don't know it's like you know when it
comes to this it's like you know it's
like it's a 50/50 thing you know what I
mean it's like like I said a software
developer or a developer in general it
doesn't matter if software it doesn't
matter if your tapi it doesn't matter
what it is
a developer uses the tools that are
there for him to build things all right
an engineer somebody who builds things
from scratch and basically makes waves
with whatever he creates I hope you guys
understand that right
and like I said I consider myself both
at times you know it's like some
companies might say hey you're engineer
my reality you know I don't really use
title like that that much because most
of my work has been just developing
things it hasn't really been engineering
anything you know I've done a couple of
times like I had to do the try on for a
company that I did last company I was
working for a couple of things out there
so it was pretty crazy you know what I
mean so yeah I was just talking about
this this whole article
hopefully imma put it on the description
for you guys I'm gonna put it in the
comments so you guys could check it out
and you can see the links for this this
article it's pretty cool it's actually
pretty legit I like the the things that
it says like you see traditionally an
engineer and no matter the stream of
engineering engineering is a person who
is competent by virtue of their
fundamental education and training to
apply scientific methods and
interpretation to the analysis a
solution of engineering problems all
right that's what engineer is for some
people you know what I mean
for me see like this is a developer on
the other hand tends to be more creative
creatively minding and applying patterns
and practices learn through
self-discovery on-the-job reading books
blogs and of course is focus on specific
aspects of the development lifecycle
with our fundamentals of scientific
method and engineer principles see
that's the thing that's why I consider
myself more of a developer like you know
somebody that comes in and have a let's
say a computer science degree they have
a a math and science degree like those
guys they dig they've gotten more deeper
into how to build a software how does
concurrency work how does distance and
that me I've never really care about
those things you get what I'm saying
like so I would definitely consider
myself more of a developer you know then
engineer and it's like this question is
always
be there this article is always gonna be
there this topic is always gonna be
there like you know what's the
difference between a developer and an
engineer to me like I said it's very
simple engineer is somebody who
basically creates things from scratch
right creates things from scratch find
solutions through the application that
that person already has right now a
developer uses the tools that are in
front of him to create things all right
if you're not building tools if you're
not creating things from scratch you're
not an engineer you can't really be
considered as an engineer and by other
engineers and that's just how it is now
do you care about if other engineers and
they look at you as an engineer that's
another question you know what I mean
like me I could care less like I don't
need 30 nerds to validate me and be like
you're a smart guy and give me a thumbs
up like I could care less I'll be like
hey I got money in my pocket you got
money in your pocket great cool we both
did our job you get what I'm saying like
that's how I feel about it but yeah man
you know and this goes back to that the
whole thing where people was so pissed
off at at Chris Shawn and it's very some
very touchy subject for some people
because in reality that's like you know
I will be tight to myself like let's say
I'm an engineering and I spent the last
ten years you know diving deep into you
know ones and zeroes and going to
calculus seven like you know I'm
learning all of this linear equations
times three and like you're going so
deep into it you know and you spend your
whole life and then somebody else says
hey I'm an engineer you know it's like
and then you start looking into the
person you know wait you have an
engineer anything you don't have to
background you don't have to education
for that so I understand when people get
pissed off but I feel like nowadays
is very rare for people to be creating
things from scratch because to be honest
this almost everything is already has
been created right now it's all about
making things a little bit faster than
whatever was there there's really nobody
else creating anything from scratch like
there's very few companies even Korean
even the top companies don't even create
things from scratch what they do is they
look at the competition see what they
created and then they recreate it again
and then from there they just make it a
little bit faster a little bit smoother
whatever right but that's just how it is
that's how the industry is right now you
know and to break it down like we are
doing the same thing we all freaking
programming we all creating new things
out here but it's just the same
difference it's like yo one is building
stuff from scratch another one is
actually you know using the tools that's
in front of them you know what I mean
but yeah man so I just wanted to talk to
you guys about this little topic today
I'll see you guys later
you already knows your boy Joe back at
it again coding fees.com this is brought
to you by coding freeze calm the website
guys go check it out man I'm building
this new project right now for PHP logic
is gonna be called design storm this is
going to be made with laravel pretty
much all you're gonna do is you're gonna
do a search is gonna do it API code to
Behance dotnet and then the same thing
that I've been telling you guys for the
past year where I say hey I want you
guys to create fire projects so like
let's say you wanted to search for
e-commerce right you will do that API
call ecommerce find a couple of designs
that you like right and then like let's
say I like this design this design I
will save it into my own project so I
will have like five six different
designs that will save to my project but
I okay this is my inspiration so now as
a developer you're going to have you
know a couple of projects saved for you
on this web application so this is legit
you gotta see once we start building a
you know the people are gonna take this
course is gonna be legit because it's
gonna teach you how to you know use user
authentication how to actually deal with
databases deal with migrations deal with
everything that laravel has to offer
it's gonna be in this project alright
guys so I'm gonna see you guys later
make sure you come to my website coding
phase calm guys literally when you go to
my description there's a couple of links
there this links to you to me if you
want to use you to me if you just say
hey Joe I want to support you your
channel I'm gonna support your website
