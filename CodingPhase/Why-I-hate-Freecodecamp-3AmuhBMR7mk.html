face.com and today we're going to talk
about freako camp and the reasons why I
hate it why I wish somebody would just
hack this website and destroy I don't
want to see in the world guys you guys
are so stupid
whoever things that is gotta be one of
the dumbest person you guys really think
I hate freako camp or coke Adam E or any
of those websites all of those websites
have their purpose right but there was
something that an amazing youtuber her
name is the real tough candy if you
haven't subscribed to her subscribe to
her she's like one of the legit people
here on YouTube creating real content or
real opinions and what we could say the
reason why there's a youtube she's one
of those people right because in reality
if you was here in 20 what was how you
say 2006 2007 there used to be a thing
where people actually share opinions and
it wasn't a Logan poll and you know all
of this crazy stuff that happens now and
fit just spinners and you know back then
people who come here share their
opinions people will have conversations
and we will basically talk about certain
topics right back in the days a lot of
you guys wasn't even here
but let's go back to this right so this
do closes of cannabis is like do you
really oh you literally haven't seen the
course curriculum there are the websites
and portfolios that that you are
required to make from for where the
freako camp to get their certificates if
a guy straight down the list what you
call a trap they're making tribute
webpages start their portfolio web page
using placeholders typically by the end
of the jQuery lessons that's the only
that's only fixing hours and get a grip
dude I think you're mad that some people
are learning and getting jobs for free
when you wasting money in college I
didn't go to school for program
and also I'm a self-taught developer
alright and for those of you guys that
think that I hate free coal camp
I don't hate free cocaine I'm actually
subscribed to Quincy Larson i watch all
his interviews whenever he's doing like
you know something with another youtuber
i watch it I like it until you see the
guy super smart I appreciate everything
that he's done for the community but at
the same time there's something that you
know the real tough candy said which was
a very special word and as tutorial
heaven okay
people fall into this place okay people
fall into this place of hey man I'm
following along and I'm just building
and I'm building and I'm building but
nothing sticks so when I say it could be
a trap it was a trap for a lot of
people's right and then not just free
coal camp a coke Adam II which other one
oh so low learn like a lot of people
don't learn like that a lot of people
you have to explain to them what's going
on and not only that they have to see
how things are done and why they are
being done all right when you follow
along just like the syntax you don't
really learn that way for some people
okay some people come in and they got
something out of it me personally I want
to have been able to learn anything from
free coal camp when I started right I
don't use free coal camp because I buy
the town free coal camp was I already
know how to code I had no no no reason
to be using it right now do I love the
things that they do the blogs amazing
blogs do I love the amazing emails that
they send out you know stuff that I
don't even know about stuff that you
know meetings that they have like all
those things are great they're cool
there's a lot of cool stuff and freako
campus is really good in the
sense of if you're somebody who is
thinking about trying to get into the
industry but don't want to commit yet
right if you don't know if you even
gonna like it it's great to go in there
and try and play around with it but like
I said from the beginning what I mean by
a trap is you're not building anything
on your own okay
and this happens to a lot of people okay
they come in they try to follow along
they even people that come to my website
they sign up to the website and they
follow along as if it was Netflix okay
when I was said the video you know be
careful with freako camps trap it's not
really a video of me getting at freako
camp it's more of like a warning for a
lot of people that they keep falling
into this trap of I'm just gonna follow
along I'm just gonna continue you know
follow the little examples and I'm just
gonna continue on yes I got the answer
but you know ten examples down I don't
remember what happened ten examples up
there I haven't built anything all right
and that happens okay so that's where
that that word I will say thanks so the
real tough candy comes in handy a
tutorial heaven tutorial heaven is a
place where you come in the tutorial
teach you something and everything works
perfectly right the tutorial is is
perfect there's no errors there's no
syntax errors there's nothing that that
breaks and you think that's coding you
think that's where it's at how they say
on udemy uh-huh it's where is that right
everything perfect it doesn't work like
that perfect examples is not the real
world of a developer and that's what I
said
I I was trying to say hey freak Oh camp
can be a trap
maybe the video was a little bit harsh
for the fans cuz there's a thing it's
like right now if I come in and I say
man you know Drake is the worst rapper
in all time a million people is gonna
come down and drop hatin on me like oh
my god you can't talk about Drake
I say beyonce is swagga i really don't
like her music i don't think she could
dance oh my god
Beyonce's the best dancer in the world I
come in and say hey I think Netflix is
overrated oh my god you should be
thankful there's Netflix how you
supposed to chill and I come in and I
say hey canon cameras are are pretty
wack everybody has the same imaging
everybody looks the same way with their
Canon lenses and the Canon cameras and
that's why I use a Panasonic right if I
say that every fanboy of Canon is gonna
come in and say oh my god you can't say
that about canning canning is the super
triple og of the community of DSLR
shooters right or whatever you want to
call people photographer is very
videographers on cinematographers right
right no matter what people are going to
be upset alright now but when it comes
to coding you gotta understand this this
there's a huge problem in the community
the biggest problem with the community
is that you cannot have an opinion that
is not the same as to heard right and
what I mean about the heard you guys
have seen me do the the zombie dance out
here you know I was like guys who was
like angular
we uh you know what I was saying like
this guy's out here who are like zombies
how they have no brain to have no
opinion they see hey everybody we follow
this and everybody's like yes sir that's
what we're supposed to be going I have
my own opinions kids unfortunately God
gave me a gift - now follow God gave me
a gift to create alright I don't need to
follow the trends I don't need to tell
you guys hey man follow this because
this is what everybody's doing right now
no it doesn't work like that because
that's almost exactly why you know every
website looks the same you know few
years ago I know maybe almost why like
six seven years ago
I don't know when bootstrap really came
out and started coming out literally
every single webpage became bootstrap
and people forgot how to actually design
websites people actually forgot how to
create things that were original every
website looks the same right every
single developer that's following on all
of this other little websites that are
out there they're helping them code are
following the same trends the same
things constantly right and all their
websites look exactly the same you look
at somebody's portfolio it looks exactly
the same as the next person no
originality
everything is bootstrap this bootstrap
that some people don't even know how to
create a menu drop-down menu with CSS
but they know how to do it with
bootstrap some people don't even know
how to do a mobile menu but they know
how to do it with bootstrap okay that's
what happens when the whole community is
zombie doubt alright and that's what
happens to with a lot of those
communities I mean you know you can't
criticize any part of it because the
community is so big that then you become
a target and it's not really about me
hating Rico camp I love free cocaine but
I love what they have what I'm saying is
as an advice for developers who are
starting out be careful of falling on
that trap maybe I shouldn't have set
freako camp itself but basically
following you know following that road
to tutorial heaven that should have been
my my title for it but like I said I'm
gonna keep the video too cuz I love you
know I love coming in and just sharing
my opinions this is just opinions guys
you know it's like I told the same guy
even you even I don't I hate you jes I
just don't see no no purpose for me
alright
I told him that his message was like you
hating on view Jay yes how do I look
like hating on some super framework like
I like we got other things to worry
about in the real world you know what I
mean
but it's opinions it's like I handle
this website this whole channel as if
it's conversations with my friends you
know what I'm saying like we come here
we chat about different topics we're not
supposed to have the same opinions on
things okay what worked for you didn't
work for another twenty thirty people
okay you know everything so it's like
you might say hey man this was amazing
for me but then you realize hey just
because it worked for you doesn't mean
that it worked for other peoples now I
have another comment here which maybe I
should do another video for this but I'm
gonna bring this up I am gonna
the videos about about this but he
basically said has anyone here realized
they cannot actually cook after two
years one minor boot camp another longer
one of coding tutorials video based
location-based paint programming etc I
realized my limitations I can only do
HTML CSS really I will say I did
JavaScript projects will only finish
half of them I spent 60 hours a week of
coding the past year plus 20 hours over
the course of two years and I have not
been able to code from scratch I have
since I have since been just coding
along I have tons of unfinished projects
question is faced our question is faced
with this shocking realization what
advice can you give me I should have
quit a year ago but I still persists to
this day I feel like I'm a glutton for
punishment and spending all day coding
without any breakthroughs unlike many of
who take it easy
I have discipline just no talent for it
any advice this happens to people all
the time and people think like oh I'm
dumb people think oh maybe I cannot make
it maybe this is not for me this is for
smart people this is for whatever and I
don't think that that's like the problem
the problem is you know sometimes we
follow along a course of tutorial video
free cocaine coke atom e solo learn we
follow along but we're not building
anything we're just not right and that's
what I was talking about it can be a
trap if you fall into that world of
tutorial heaven you're doing all the
tutorials and you're following along and
you're like hey man I'm here
welcome to the pearly gates of tutorial
heaven where you have
you have like you know I don't know you
got like the best of the best you know
instructors out there just welcoming you
and everybody's eating grapes and you
know I just remember this I actually
grew up Jehovah's Witness which is out
of this topic but I just remember
there's images of like you know heaven
and the perfect world for for human
beings and I remember this picture so
it's like this is tutorial heaven I mean
this is where everything works fine
where you just follow along and you
don't have to think for yourself you
follow along through tutorials you see
things that are already in the
documentation but hey something new is
follow along man don't worry about it
don't build nothing one thing that I
could tell you about me guys I'm all
about building building projects
building things as you go as as you
learn because that's how you will
reinforce yourself to actually learn you
know this is not about me
against freako camp freako campus one of
the websites that people fall into the
trap they fall into the map you know
they come into the mapping they just
follow along following along following
along following along okay and it's nice
but people don't build anything you come
in you start changing a couple of little
lines people I mean not every person but
a lot of people don't learn like this a
lot of people need to say hey hey guys
let's build this menu and then you're
like okay cool let's build that menu so
then you build that menu and then you
put the interaction the animations you
build the whole thing and people don't
like that people don't really learn by
coming in and say hey this is the same
thing that's on the documentation log
Mozilla and this is how you add a class
people people don't learn like
people need to have like a goal there's
a lot of people that need to learn by
having goals and achievements at the end
of the day and I just I still believe it
that you know websites like this can
have our audience that can be successful
but what nobody tells you is like hey
this is one of like seven to eight
different resources that they use you
know but then there's some poor soul
some poor guy who comes in he's like man
I'm gonna spend my whole year on freako
camp and then at the end of the day he
doesn't even know how to build a web
page it happens all the time
okay now to this comment here you know
I'm gonna build something for you I'm
gonna create something for you I'm gonna
make a video for you matter of fact
explaining on how to get past this
situation okay now I don't have all the
answers there's like sway you know it's
like when Kanye is like yo sway you
ain't got the answers man now everybody
has the answers but for the set of
people that get stuck there I got the
answer for that because I happen to go
through the same thing and I've seen
other people that are going through the
same thing and then they reach out to me
and I help them out and then now two
months later they're making amazing
websites they could build all the
applications that they wanted to build
all right I don't have all the answers
but for those people that get stuck
there those people that go into tutorial
heaven I know how to take them out of
there I can help now if you want my help

gmail.com it's your boy Joe back at it
