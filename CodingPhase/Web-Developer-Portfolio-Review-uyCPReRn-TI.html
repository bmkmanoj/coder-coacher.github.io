viewers like you and people that support
our website coding phase comm go check
it out over 20 courses in there that's
gonna guide you to become a developer
from the beginning to becoming a pro
green with you guys today we have a web
developer portfolio so let me share my
screen and here you go
cool so we got her file Fernandez you
know maybe I'm making it too Spanish but
it's not fired right so Rafael basically
he got his web site and I'm glad that he
actually found his domain which has his
full name is Rafael Fernandez that me
right it's not a.com don't get hype well
at least you got adopt me you know what
I mean so cool so let's look at the
website let's refresh it let's see if
there's any animations or anything ok
it's a little cool no bounce right here
I like the Grays looks pretty clean let
me see what else okay
I'll see you you got the little fade in
when you scroll okay I'll see you you
know making things look nice I like the
little button I wish there would have
been like a hover effect on top of this
once I go over it like the background
should change or something let me see I
like the typography looks pretty clean
there's definitely a hierarchy you know
whatever it needs to be the title is
actually bigger than the subtitle you
know sometimes people they forgot about
this thing sorry typography in hierarchy
that's why you have two h1 h2 h3 h4 h4 I
fish sakes age you know the whole
shebang right that's why there's that
hierarchy because technically you're
supposed to have everything that's
important or H 1 and H tools and then
from there you make everything smaller
depending on on what the type of title
it is it just makes your website look
clean
right another thing too that you could
notice here is that he's not using black
right so he got black for the titles and
then like earth grey for the regular
text and that's actually better than
having something where everything in the
page is black it's like there's no
difference okay so that's pretty cool
let me see what else so he got his
projects here so this is where his
portfolio starts you know let's started
from here okay see a little scroll
scroll action I like it
alright so then we have what I forgot
this application app spark
we gotta find Fernandez calm we got
sessions a react native app that allows
users to create sessions seems cool
comparative if an application that has
crowdsource opinions in a photo via
voting system the application utilizes
relational databases user authentication
is raining Ruby and JavaScript there you
go godo Ruby you know and
sorry Raphael you had me on so I saw
this right here please guys don't add to
see your portfolio I know is just shows
like ok I'd know how to do some
JavaScript but know how to work with a
couple of little things I'm no
programming but please don't put no
little Simon game like you know what I
mean is cool okay okay all right I need
to stop get me out of here
all right so all right so the Simon game
is cool is fun and something to practice
it's not something that you want to show
right it's not something that you you
know nobody comes in and puts into their
portfolios like here's how to reverse a
string you know this is the same thing
as that to me right because if you're a
professional what you want to have is
just your projects your major projects
that you have and that's it
anything else that's like side projects
side little games like this unless you
built like a full-fledged html5 game
something that shows I okay this person
created html5 game you know this
animations that sprites there's
different levels like that's something
that we go in and say oh cool this
person knows what the hell he's doing
but coming in and seeing this I'll be
honest to me I'm just like I don't need
to see this
alright so cool I like to pick
that you got here your boy looking clean
got the nice little shape up you know
what I mean
place no games you know as I hey Barbara
came through giving a little shape up he
good I like the Hat you know taking my
swag now I'm joking
listen all right so we got about me hi
I'm Raphael specialize making
applications and modern responsive
website on located Providence Rhode
Island amen you're very close to me we
need to hang out pretty much over all I
will say I know enough to be dangerous
more important can deliver results
I enjoyed treating new terrain exploring
fresh cold libraries building every
piece I don't know what every piece most
valuable player I don't know and most of
all taking an idea from headache no
headspace to database I don't know that
last part I don't know what's going on
there but you got your resume you got
your email you got your contact info
that's great I'm not gonna put it here
because you know how to trolls be
they'll try to throw you okay now as far
as the website looks good let's look
into the applications themselves all
right let us go to the demo so app spark
that her uncle died app cool we know is
you know free hosting a Heroku so we
gotta give you a little a little time
you know but then they loads so we good
all right so let's see where are where
apps get started so what's this
what exactly is it sign up to spark read
your first app okay I'm gonna sign up
I'm gonna put in let's play pass word Oh
34 password 34 ass word 34 okay let's
see
this now okay so was a johnie's at Bari
mints I don't know I'm just gonna click
create app okay so this is required I
don't understand was this Johnny's app
I'm lost I'm lost in this application I
don't know what's the point of this app
honest a youtube flag
hey it is the Sabbath elite this what is
this so using commands
I'm lost I guess this application is
like it's technically supposed to be
something where you can find different
developers and you know I mean I don't
know the user experience gotta get a
little bit fixed well that's fine I mean
you're a developer you're not a UX
designer you're not a UI designer like
okay now one thing that I am gonna call
you out on is this
you see there's there's no padding
around this like text and images should
never be touching the walls even this
right here unless that's what you're
going for
for this progression bar like this
should never be touching the walls the
borders so let me see let me look into
this we go in guys okay so we got this
okay I don't even know how how do you
put how you put this image in there you
put inside of a tag okay that's what I
was missing I just I don't know I would
have done it like that but that's fine
um okay so one wanna see is all right
you see this you should definitely put a
divider okay and put a div right like
this right here is one section this
should not be having the the text and
everything else on the same section it
should be divided into two sections like
okay there's one element and then the
image itself is one section and then
this area right here should be another
section so I could just easily come like
let's say if you would have made it into
another another section I could easily
came in and read padding thirteen
pixels Hey and even at that this looks
better than how it was before you get
the little difference like when you have
padding it just makes it look more
cleaner okay now if you want this image
to be 100 percent whiff of the element
make sure it's in a separate element
then this section down here but this is
like the details this is the image so
you want that to be its own section
separate then how you have it right now
all right
Oh as far as the application is cool it
shows you you know some what is this no
J yes I don't even know where's my
application settings where's the
settings or more tools extensions
enabled this
now is going to spark app refresh this
okay so you are well you using Ruby okay
so that's cool using from what I see it
says Ruby on Rails but that's what's up
the only thing I would say is just I
don't know about this application I
don't know what will be its purpose you
know what I mean sometimes we try to
like you know come up with our own ideas
you know and sometimes it doesn't get
delivered the right way so my advice is
listen there's no shame on recreating
somebody else's application like let's
say for example Twitter recreated
Facebook just renaming it and changing
it around right creating a social
network creating something that's
already there you know because in
reality you want to show the the person
that hey my application is that this you
know at this level but at the same time
you don't want to have to be worried
about oh I gotta come up with a great
idea like no it's like you want to show
your skills that's what you should focus
on all right now putting your portfolio
here I don't know if that you know that
really shows anything is technically the
person that's watching your your
portfolio is already thinking like hey
this person already did it so there's
really no point of view announcing I
hate my portfolio I made it and here you
go this is what I used on it like you
don't need it you don't need to actually
put your portfolio there sessions I says
this project isn't quite ready demo yet
um I will say try to get this up online
there's a way to actually share your
react native application uh browser
a way to do it let me see if I find for
you I mean I'm pretty sure rappelled IIT
has it so you could literally take your
code and go to rebel that IT right and
pretty much go to a new rebel if this
was like the browser want a lot let's
say build this web didn't they change a
couple of things in here for some reason
I don't know it kind of feels different
let's see let's see they kind of changed
a couple of things in here but go to all
languages that little thing that just
moved at the bottom right and here you
search react needed right and then from
there with Expo you can actually load
your react native there and you could
actually share it to people yeah it's a
way I mean I've done it before I can't
remember what was the site I know
Red Bull has it I can't remember exactly
the other site is Red Bull and there's
another one that actually lets you show
the person your react native court all
your react native application to
somebody on a browser alright so look
into that because having an image that
says hey I've done this on a react
native I don't know if that works okay
yes you have you
dear boy nobody's gonna go in there I'm
being 100% honest nobody's gonna go in
there
people like to skim through things ready
to go over your portfolio like it was
just like a resume they look at your
little thing and then they throw it
right back you know if nothing caught
their attention
you know just throw that let's say right
back so you know now on the next one
which is
see login compared to explore
seems cool
I mean I'm not gonna go to the
this application but so far assume
school I mean I guess it's like you have
two images and people vote which one is
the best one which one the like it seems
cool seems nice
alright now going back to everything
like I said yeah I always tell everybody
here you know as far as the portfolio it
looks beautiful looks great I like the
design looks nice and clean everything
smooth the typography is perfect now
what you got to work on is your projects
that you have when you perform you like
you need to start building stuff that
real businesses are going to need build
a restaurant right building let's say
building system for a restaurant where
instead of them having to use something
like GrubHub or what was the other one I
forgot the other company that is come
competition for group up but let's say
grandpa right how people call just order
online and then the delivery how about
you build that system right with a real
restaurant and a real or you know the
design that's out there something that
looks nice and then you have I don't
know like a demo account at the bottom
of the screen you say hey use this demo
account to see the backend so somebody
doesn't have to go in there and actually
register put in their Facebook but in
this isn't that people don't want to do
that when they check it out like an
application from a prospect a future
employee or employee a young developer
like people just want to go in there and
they skim through it like nobody puts in
time nobody looks at your code nobody
looks at that he comment thinks well
like nobody's looking into that right
nobody's expecting you to have a perfect
code but what they expect is for
something to be easier for them to see
like oh this person has this skills
they created this they he has a whole
bunch of you know you got a back-end he
got a section for users he got uh you
know users following other users like
you know what I mean you could see it
through the backing I don't know if you
understand what I'm saying
but hopefully you know what I could say
about this portfolio is that you have
some solid projects you have some some
things that shows that you have skills
you just gotta go the extra mile you
have to come in and start building you
know real projects for real businesses
right things that really solve a problem
sometimes creating like you know quote
unquote like little startup B
applications like it seems cool and nice
but it doesn't show like hey I'm
actually a pro you know what I mean like
this is a big difference between saying
hey I just came from a boot camp hey I
just came from you to me
hey I just learned this the stuff from
free cocaine there from actually seeing
a couple of portfolios and projects that
you go like bro I'm a pro don't ask me
 you get what I'm saying like that's
the type of projects that you want to
show to people you want people to just
be like yo we need to hire this guy now
before somebody else sees this so that's
all I will say about this portfolio and
yeah and I find or anything that you
might have in the future if you fix this
up a little bit you add extra projects
go ahead send it back to me go to face
at gmail.com if any of you guys all
wanna get your portfolio hosted here you
know just for the show know this stuff
is like nobody has the best portfolio
nobody has the best application if you
have an application you have a portfolio
you have something that you want to show
to the community and you say hey Joe
look at it critique it you know give me
some some opinions on it then I will put
it on the show in you know we hear you
know what I mean
tab I so anyways when we</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
