Joel you already know make sure you
subscribe you already know coding face
calm all right man so we're gonna start
with comments how do you write a comment
alright so basically what you do what
you do it you do it double slash like
diorite and basically you say you're
right your comment song let's say this
is a comment alright and then another
way to write a communist like this
backslash a star and then you say here
star and then I die so now all of this
it's more comics so what exactly is a
comment a comment is basically you know
it's characters that won't get won't run
in the code so i could come in here and
say hey VAR car equals Honda alright so
now when I come here I say car and I run
it is going to give me honda or when I
say console.log car is going to give me
honda you see and now if i take this and
on the side I go double backslash then
it goes back to this pretty much is what
it's doing is it's not running this code
no more right so like I said if you take
away the comment is gonna run the code
but if you put it in it's not alright so
usually you write comments or what
you want to tell somebody you know
what's going on in the coat so like
let's say if I say say oh of our cars
five so the next person that comes into
your code you can leave on a common
saying hang I declared the cars number
here all right and then you don't have
to put a semicolon and then down here
I'll say something like cars plus 5 and
say hey and five more cars came in today
on on on 21 out of 24 24 old to right so
now you're basically telling somebody
what's going on in the code right and
that's why I comments is there it just
pretty much just leave a comment for
somebody follow every the code right
s'okay in the comments and save that all
right let's run this so cost five plus
five is ten all right that's about it
guys take care man make sure you
subscribe make sure you sign up for the
kmn coding face com subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
