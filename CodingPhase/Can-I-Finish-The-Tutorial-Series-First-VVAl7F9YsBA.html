my squad hey guys what up she'll blow
job back at it again man cold and face
that come for your boys back alright so
I want to address this real quick before
I go to work you know can your boy first
finish this damn tutorial before
everybody start you know giving the
little two cents on how things should be
done or this and that so you got your
boy Matt out here the tutorials on the
first in the first part and on the first
part you're already like oh you can't
put an anchor to a anchor link
inside of a ul and then put an ally
inside of it that is wrong it's not
a standard guys there is no standard for
the ship the idea that you gotta follow
exactly what Google LinkedIn and
Facebook whatever you don't have to
follow that that's number one right
number two if you guys would let me
finish and show you the rest of the
videos there's a reason why I made it
like that so people can understand a
certain concept right which was going to
be fixed on the next video which was you
if you want to put our anchor link
inside of an ally for it to work
properly and really fill out the whole
space you have to make it into a display
block so I was gonna do that anyways and
then on the next video after that which
I was going to do some bootstrap what I
was going to do I was going to change
instead of using and Li are you eyeing
Li I was just gonna use a nav and then
an anchor tag inside of it because you
could do it like that too
there's a million ways to do this guy's
there is no right way there is no thing
where somebody could come in and tell
you
this room because da da da da no HTML
the way how you got to think about it is
they're all elements it doesn't matter
if it's a day if it doesn't matter if
it's a doesn't matter if it's a you well
doesn't matter if it's a li it doesn't
matter if it's a freakin a footer
I could put a footer tag on the header
that was a concept that I was trying to
teach to you guys but before I even
finish the tutorial and people want to
give their opinions on it you have to
let me finish the tutorials first so you
can understand what's the big picture of
this that's the way that I teach I'm not
teaching you guys you know where
everything is going to be perfect
because that's not how what developing
is nobody's going to come in there and
code everything exactly how you like it
because that's your style well that's
another company style or another
company's way the whole idea of this is
to teach people that everything is just
elements and then how to lay things out
all right I could have done even I don't
even have to use a Li tag I could make
all of them a div or I could make all of
them I just put them inside of a section
like there's a million ways to do this
there is no right way there is no right
way when it comes to HTML HTML is just
like it's just for just to basically lay
things out that's it everything that
you're going to do you do it through CSS
and JavaScript HTML is just pretty much
laying things out guys that's it you
know
so and then on top of that okay I got
other people telling me what was it
there was another one but I like oh you
should use header instead of section for
the header and it's like yes but you're
missing the point
the point is that I was basically
explaining to people there are different
sections in fact if I go and just tell
people hey write this as a header and
then they gotta be like oh but wait
there's no content tag for it because
you're calling this the content but
there's no content tag for it
alright so the reason why I named it
everything section is okay I just to
divide it and be like okay this whole
area is a section and this whole area is
another section that's it all right now
all right
well that's just gonna be done later on
as we go on the series like come on guys
I've been doing this here you try to
teach me I've been doing this for god
knows how long and like it it's not bad
it's just like you have to understand
it's like you go into somebody
who's been doing this for a long time
and like you're teaching them like basic
stuff like you're telling me about basic
stuff that I know from a long time ago
and then on top of that somebody
take even moistens which is exactly what
I was going to do which was
displayed you know put everything a lie
put an anchor take our anchor tag inside
of it show you guys that way of putting
the anchor tag as a block and then it
fills out the whole Li but that's not
even the way how I'm gonna do the HTML
for it
like this is like the first part guys
it's just like laying things out
and like I said I just freestyle through
this whole shake you know it's like it's
not planned I don't do my videos planned
I don't come in here and be like hey I'm
gonna plan this thing up I use no
certain concepts that I want to teach
the people and then I have my ways of
teaching it there would have been no
reason for me to change it to you know a
lie and an anchor tag inside of it if I
wasn't showing you something else
because that's how I teach guys like let
me rock let me show you what I you know
if you already know the right way then
you shouldn't be you know you shouldn't
watch this because basically it's like
I'm trying to teach it to the people who
don't know anything this is were the
people that starting from zero you know
so that's why I'm making this tutorial
if you want the design is there I'm
gonna put the design in the description
you because if you leave a comment
you're like oh my god it should it's
 wrong it's like is the video
done no now yeah right so let me just
rock let me just finish let me teach you
how I'm gonna easy way that anything
and I say that's my style kids so that's
what I'm saying man
pistol videos then you come in you leave
your little comments and you know be
here everything that I did was wrong I
wouldn't be here there's certain
mistakes that people make and there's
certain mistakes that people do to be
able to show people three different ways
of doing something and that's what I'm
saying kids all right anyways when I my
phone bout to die I forgot to frickin
charger last night she sucks I think I'm
gonna be without a phone told the whole
day maybe so hopefully somebody on my
job has like a a charger for a galaxy
phone because everybody's rocking
freakin iPhones
see maybe somebody in the back panel
charges for iPhone
it's late I've been at work since 6:30
need a web developer job ASAP where
okay I have seen quite a few people from
YouTube leaving comments that they're
having problems alright listen a lot of
you guys that they're having problems
with the atom packages just look inside
of the text file right look inside of
the thing for that atom package list or
that text or something like that I
forgot what I named it look inside that
list see the names of them see the names
of the packages and then go ahead and
freakin and just download and manually
download it manually through the
packages from from from atom right
because sometimes if you're if you're
Mac this thing works perfectly all right
if you're Linux it works perfectly now
for Windows that's why I don't use
Windows because it's always a
problem with it so the best choice for
you guys is to take a look at the list
go on on settings of atom go to packages
install it manually and a reality you
don't need the packages I don't but the
reason why is they're so you could
actually see certain things in in your
your atom editor could look exactly like
mines so it's like when you see me
getting some errors or me getting some
some feedback on the JavaScript you
could actually know what the hell is
going on you know oh yeah I want to get
those too so that's why the packages are
there but besides that you can follow
the the tutorial without the packages
you don't need it
so the people that I feel that that's
stopping them don't worry about it just
keep going
also oops sorry also guys just make sure
you you can install no GES and also NPM
is is installed and also yarn because
you need yarn you can't you can't do
this without yarn I'll be honest that's
the only thing that's completely a
prerequisite you need it for sure oh
don't listen to the haters not now he's
not being a hater he's not being a hater
it's just people gotta just let me
finish the tutorials man let me finish
it then from there you come in and you
give your opinion and be like okay maybe
we could do this a little bit better
maybe we could do it another way
but like I said there's a reason why I
did it like that because later on I was
going to show it to people in three
different ways of doing it like that
doing it with the Li in the anchor tag
inside and I was going to do it with a
knife with anchor tags inside and then I
was going to probably doing what a div
and I was going to just do it with
anchor tags inside of them
because you could do it with any way
that you want
there is no no specific way where you
say hey every menu has to be a UL and in
al I know it doesn't have to be like
that
HTML is just pretty much a way to make
things out last name you know so yeah I
know he's not hating he's just trying to
point things out okay um I call HTML
that way I guess that way that gets the
job done
yeah I agree with you too I think
HTML it is not something that you
and time on that whatever what the hell
they closed down mine why the they
closed down the my job
you
if we can close down the parking lot of
my job like everyone second
there's some
whoa yeah man let me see what else
missing what else you guys are doing
what sort of comes on would I put in my
resume
if I have no prior content well that's
why you got to be you new projects
constantly why don't these people
hold on give me a second look at his hat
so I gotta go into work and they
blocking a parking lot
give me a second
you
sorry guys people blocking off
the driveway I don't even know
that my job had a second driveway
I guess there's another one through the
back oh oh this Aiko I'm exploring
right now I love being out here and I've
been through the back I always come to
the farm
big boys - oh so this way the workers
come through nice I did not know that at
all
but yeah when
yeah guys just keep doing the tutorials
man trust me I know what I'm doing
Felipe's hey hey you know what I mean
like I don't know what I'm doing guys
I've been doing this for five years
like I have a way of teaching it to
people that's gonna make it easier then
how you've seen done before I can teach
people certain things when they just
completely bring beginners when they
don't know how to create layouts on the
stance or anything so I have to teach in
my own way to make it easier for them
all right
let me see Joe when will you or your kid
be ready to code when to put him
straight out straighten that coat
yeah not definitely I'm gonna put him in
man I'm waiting so is that the baby's a
little bit older so that's the baby is a
little bit older you know he still know
the womb right now he's still on the
couch you know so he still hasn't came
out yet when he comes out I'm gonna
teach him you know everything else
statements mobile okay baby
you know if you know if elmo is
ready do this if elmo is blue do that
you know you got to teach them early
man boys back yeah man and to make it
really freakin Matt is not hitting guys
at all
so just to make it clear he's just
pointing something out too early you
know it's like I just need to finish the
tutorials I need to finish my point once
I finish my tutorial my point then you
come in and you tell me hey this is
right this is wrong but till then let me
just finish it and then if it looks
crazy at the end if it doesn't look
exactly like the design if it doesn't
work then tell me hey Joel you up
here you know but till then let me just
teach in my way all right
also I finished yesterday all the CSS
now the CSS is going to have to be
broken down into multiple parts because
it was one hour long so I don't know
what do you guys think should I make it
a half an hour make it into two videos
half an hour half an hour or make it
into three videos you know 20 minutes
each
you guys let me know because it's like I
feel like watching a video for one hour
long I don't know if people's gonna
watch it you know it's like a whole hour
is like you know it's like it's old deep
so it's like if it's 30 minutes 20
minutes you know three videos yeah I
mean he's still gonna have to do an hour
but you know it's hard for somebody to
sit down and be like hey man I'm just
gonna I'm looking at this video it's one
hour long like this one hour like it's a
long time you know you're right too
mr. innocence for improved JavaScript
about the treehouse but the guide that I
explained the object-oriented program
that was so I'm reading JavaScript
jQuery book and doing you to me well if
you really want to learn Opie
object-oriented programming I will say
get Anthony's Elysee Elysee
understanding the weird parts of
JavaScript right because that guy goes
in-depth into JavaScript like you're
gonna learn everything from JavaScript
and I'm you know in that course it's in
my description but it's very dense
meaning it's super long it's like he
goes to like the most intense detail so
I was saying it's up to you it's up to
you if you want to you know watch it
straight like me I couldn't watch it
straight I had to watch it in different
parts like at one week I would do
objects one week I would do arrays like
I wasn't able to watch the whole thing
in one shot because it's just too long
plus is like it's so long that you can't
really retain the you know the
information because it's so long
but yeah man so yeah each 30 minutes
will essentially become an hour with
pulsing stuff maybe 20 20 20 yeah I
think I'm gonna do it like that I'm
gonna break it down to 20 minutes that
should be like the maximum for each
video 20 minutes so I'm gonna do that
tonight I might what do you guys think
should I release all all three of them
in one shot or I should do two today
and release one tomorrow because
tomorrow I'm not gonna I'm not gonna be
able to to record anything I'm not gonna
yeah I'm not gonna be able to record
anything or or do anything cuz tomorrow
is my my baby shower so
we're gonna celebrate the baby's coming
as a party I'm probably going to vlog it
show you guys a little bit about you
know what happens there show you guys
all my friends or my family and yeah
nice man Congrats oh yeah Congrats man
if you got your first job finally man
you're in the door just keep going keep
learning don't stop learning just
because you work and don't don't mean
that you're going to stop learning keep
learning because you're still a beginner
you still got to do your own personal
projects it's like as I said if you was
goin going to work as like going to
school you're gonna do work at school
but you're not going to be able to
elevate to the next level unless you do
work at home too you know so that's what
I would say also just don't be nervous
just go and do your thing you know do
your job try not to get there late at
least for the first three months and
then after that after the first three
months you're comfortable at the job do
whatever the hell you want also if
they're not paying you enough once you
get to the three months or mark start
applying to other places don't be like
one of these people that stay in a job
for a long time
we are millenials guys you know we don't
stay in the same jobs for a long time so
I would advise you guys don't staying in
a job for a long time because what
happens is when you go into a job and
they see your skills and then I okay
cool this person is only worth you know
$18 an hour $20 an hour right but your
skills have elevated in the Newton ear
on the next tool you know two to six
months right your level is already
higher than that so now that company is
not going to come in and be okay great
you're a great developer now we're going
to give you you know twenty five thirty
dollars an hour no it doesn't work like
that once you work in a company you
start somewhere
legally every year it's 3% that they're
only going to raising so 3 percent out
of 18 dollars and so my advice is
now that you have the skills apply to
another company and go get a job over
there and apply for a higher position
higher pay and then do the same thing
it's like the same thing right now like
for me the next company that I go to has
to be above 120 K because if not it
doesn't make sense like I could make
more money if I also just stay home to
be honest with you guys and I finished
coding face.com how I envisioned it and
how I wanted to be if I was to be
working full-time on it I could be
making more money than I make in my job
currently but I do like the people on my
job but that's a personal choice you
know so it's like I don't know if the
day I decided to leave from here like I
don't think I'm gonna work for anybody
anymore
I might just you know do tutoring or
create my coding phase company who knows
I might just join a boot camp get paid
mad money to do nothing and teach
nothing so that would be like my
retirement is like hey I joined they
walk on my retirement I'm a retired to a
boot camp I love it I hate hey guys I
retired I'm in a boot camp now
you can release them or people can just
go through them what you take every fam
give people a chance to work at their
own pace Sun will go faster than others
naturally yeah that's true I know I will
use sass I'm using sass
I'm skipping straight from CSS I'm not
I'm not doing it like the old-school CSS
way where you got to go in there like
let's say you have to put in div you
know div anchor link and then from they
start styling or you say you know
something like class header you know
that menu dot whatever I'm not doing
that I'm skipping right through that you
know because there's really no point of
it like nowadays you could go in and
take like a little crash course on on
regular CSS and you can learn that
in 20 minutes you're not gonna get
anything out of it of me explaining CSS
from scratch in the beginning one more
time because it's like you see that
everywhere so the whole point of this
tutorial is like so you could get the
feel of what it is to be a full stack
developer so I'm using all my tools oh
my my skills on my little CSS tricks
that I use I'm gonna even show you like
um how to Google things you know so and
hopefully nobody be like oh my god he
Google's something that's what you're
supposed to do guys when something comes
up and you can't remember it and you're
like oh yeah
this I know I need flex boxes here but I
don't remember the syntax by you know by
memory so you're supposed to Google it
you know I wouldn't be surprised
somebody comes in and be like oh my god
he googled everybody Google's kids
so I'm teaching in a way where you're
gonna see it's pretty much this whole
tutorials whole series is for you guys
to learn and to also understand the
process of being a full-stack developer
so you're gonna see every single thing
that I do which is pretty much the same
thing that I do in my job so yeah I
don't code in regular CSS I code with
sass because I'm more productive like
that
okay let me see three months is slapping
your employer in the face if they hire
us a junior developer they are investing
in your future since junior developers
know do not know shake yes you're right
but this is what happens they are
investing in you but they're not gonna
come in and be like hey cool he's a he's
not a a junior developer no more let's
pay him another $50,000 on top of what
what he's earning right now then I gotta
come to you with that what they're gonna
come to you and they're gonna be like oh
hey Johnny you you've been doing pretty
good here's two thousand dollars more
which when you check comes in that's
like five dollars extra on your
check I don't know about you guys but
I'm not gonna stay in a company that's
gonna give me a raise like that
and that's what companies do if you're
thinking that your employees are going
to be nice to you because they like you
and because they love you know guys it
doesn't work like that
this employers are looking to
also save money so if they could squeeze
out out of you you know a good year two
years and be like hey we got this great
developer he came in as a junior
developer now he's a great developer but
let's squeeze two years out of him for
thirty thousand dollars they will do it
to you of course if you stay there
because it's hard to ask for a raise
it's like one of the hardest things to
do because it's like what is your your
contribution worth is it worth more like
you know two times more one point five
more then what then what you already
 got when you first came in it's
hard to put a number on it so employees
we were well they are gonna be
cheap with it and they're gonna try to
 you know keep you there with a
really low really low
low-paying song why would you stay there
you know what I mean me like when I
first my very first job that was related
for like related to web development
wasn't even a web development company it
wasn't an e-commerce company it was like
a eBay wholesaler meaning my job was to
create listings for eBay right eBay
products all right and then from there
my job was to basically change the HTML
change the title on the certain things
put in new pictures and change the CSS
that's it that was my job all right now
since that was my job how much do you
think they they would pay me I was only
like $14
I went from earning $22 in my
regular job to earning $14 because I
wanted to become a web developer but I
took that job because I needed the
experience I needed to have an
experience of say hey I'm a web
developer you know so I just took it but
was I gonna stay there long no I left
out of there in three months three
months I already got 60 K you
know so it's like it was a to me
it was a spit in my face for this people
to know that I had certain skills and
they were paying me thirteen fourteen
dollars I think is like fourteen fifty
or something like that and then the
older was like I told him like oh yeah
guys like I'm gonna leave um you know I
appreciate you guys hiring me and this
and that and the guy comes to me and
he's like yeah man don't worry man named
you know if you want a raise man you
know we could give you 17 an hour and I
was just looking at this guy I'm like
bro do you know what developers go for
do you know that developers are making
over $100,000 and you're paying
me $14 an hour like yeah it
wasn't complicated work but I'm still a
developer you know what I mean like not
everybody could do this
so him paying me $14 an hour was
 so I just moved from here rofl
gnashing and just started going to
another job which gave me like
60 K and I was good with benefits and
all of that in three months so it's up
to you guys if you guys want to stay
there for a year and just to be grateful
like trust me guys do your own thing
yo I love the videos I'm working really
hard to get this JavaScript job in a
month
any tips to really solidify my
JavaScript skills well you got to know
at least one framework if you're gonna
go for a front-end developer or you know
if you go for front-end development you
got to know at least one framework you
gotta go in there I will say either
angular or Java on react so be ready
okay then when should be your timeline
for going from developed journey
developer to normal intermediate terms
level working professionally I would say
as soon as you as soon as you know
you're ready like you look at the look
at the descriptions right most jobs
description they're gonna have ten
twelve fifteen different things on the
list right and they're gonna ask you a
whole bunch of so if the list has
fifteen different technologies like HTML
CSS JavaScript Ajax react whatever
 PS DS whatever it is on the list
right if you got over um over half of it
you know more than half of it then
you're ready to become that's a your
regular developer you're not a
junior developer number your junior
developer when you only know two to
three things in there so it's like if
you know half of them already you should
be applying to it
yeah so yeah buddy that yeah buddy DAP
he said hey man I just really want to
let you know that I really click one the
way you talk and teach when I learn from
you from you it clicks yes and I think
there's a reason why it clicks for a lot
of people because I'm not trying to be
here like you know be super technical
I'm trying to teach it to people that
don't know anything or people who are
completely beginners or people who you
know I just get in their you know their
foot at the door because it's like
nobody caters to the people that are
just starting even when you watch a
tutorial people are expecting you to
know a lot of the and they start
throwing you big words so start throwing
your big concepts and it's like man the
brain doesn't work like that
because that's why I took me a long time
to to learn everything you know because
I feel like you know people wasn't
teaching it to me in a way where it's
like oh they have me into consideration
of they understand that I'm a beginner
they already drawing you know a whole
bunch of concepts that are advanced as
if I already know it you know some for
me I just I break it down in a way where
it just starts making sense I break it
down in a way where I wish somebody
would break it down for me that way you
know so that's why you know it clicks
yeah I'm going to add the the project
files today you know I apologize I
forgot to to put it up but matter of
fact the project files are in the gate
if you download the gate
all the files are in there I totally
forgot I don't have to put it as if like
it's already on the game I have all the
images in there so you guys should be
good
how to quit gaming and focus 100% on
what development
listen you you're gonna have to make
that choice on your own self you know
when I first started coding my whole
goal was like man I just want to be able
to to you know to be able to buy any
game that I want what I having to ask my
mom for no money or to you know to just
be good and now my life has changed my
life is I have different goals
you know coding has become my new game
you know to me every day I level up I
learn something new
everything you gotta think about it like
this you gotta have something that's
gonna give you purpose in life and it's
gonna give you a reason what to do right
to do this and why to study and whites
and learn all this right so for me is my
bank account my bank account is my level
so every time that I learn something you
either in a month or two months later my
bank account gets a little bit bigger
you know so for me that's how I level up
and that's how I think of life like a
game like that so it's like now I'm like
on Grand Theft Auto I feel like I'm on
Grand Theft Auto I could go anywhere by
whatever the hell I want
I got the unlimited coke you know what I
mean so that's how you got to think
about coding coding is like a video game
it's like you're your only difference is
you're playing with your life you know
so you are they're going to stay home
and have zero dollars in your pocket or
depend on your mom and depending is that
or whatever or you could say you know
what let me see how much I could get out
here let me see how far I could get in
life so you gotta think about it like
that
that's how I look at it right now I feel
like I got I'm not even unlimited I'm
now on the unlimited yet you know like I
haven't got the code for unlimited yet
but like I'm walking around with a lot
of money I could buy any
 that I want so it's like that's how
I think about it some people they're
different than I oh yeah you know all
they care about is just to level up and
get to become a better developer to me
that doesn't motivate me it doesn't
motivate me to know every
technology out there what motivates me
is knowing what I can provide for myself
provide for my family that's what
motivates me that's what gives me the
energy of light coating every day coming
to you to go home learn more stuff on
udemy like right now I'm learning a game
development course on udemy and it's
kicking my ass and I feel dumb doing it
because I suck but now it's like
I'm starting from scratch it's like I'm
I'm a brand new developer beginner learn
how to do game development so it's like
right now I'm trying to unlock a new
skill you know so in the long term
unlocking that skill is going to
represent dollars so dollars is my level
up it's like okay cool

I look at it
