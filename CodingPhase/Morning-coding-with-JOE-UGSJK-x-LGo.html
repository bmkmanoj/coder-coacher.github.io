guys we in here man we doing this
live some of you guys probably like what
the hell is Joe doing he's working on
some Pokemon thing well basically what
I'm doing is I'm coding the pages right
I'm coding the the Select screen and the
battle screen right so this supposed to
be a game that we're going to to code
with JavaScript on the future-proof
javascript course right but for us to
actually be able to do this you know we
need the HTML to be done so that's what
I'm doing right now with you guys live
just to mess around and you know answer
some questions whatever questions you
guys might have or like you guys might
just want to talk in a chatroom it's
fine whatever you guys decide to do but
yeah there's gonna be a pretty cool
project because it's like it's legit man
it's pretty legit so the whole
battle system is gonna be like a rock
paper scissor type of game so that's
what we're doing and we're calculating
everything depending on the status of
each Pokemon so let me see boom boom
boom so let's hide this because there's
the first view which is the Select
screen
all right so now we got this this two
pokemons okay player vs. CPU now let me
see what was it
let me see trying to find a battleground
for Pokemon as its HD take this one
there for now
copy this from here let's hide it again
I'm live right now gonna show the baby
shuttle baby
yeah I want to see the baby you wanna
see you little baby Ethan they're
younger yeah tell me does he look like
me hmm you looking over there like what
what's going on thank you thanks to the
people so they went up to the people yo
so happy to have the little baby
where are the comments wife he wants to
see the comments be like yo I don't know
it also hate her be nice there's a lap
right there get in there say without to
the people come on baby let me see we
got a couple of people in make sure you
give this some likes man baby we took
you to your baby in the world are you
happy with daddy no he's not look at the
lips we do that live
that's how you know that's my baby that
baby came out with just my lip you got
to pound a lip seven pounds of dick
that's it
so cute baby oh yeah can't hear me can
you hear me I don't know my Microsoft my
Microsoft my microphone is on word all
right so yeah so let me let me go back
to my coding I'm gonna show you guys cuz
technically that's what I wanted to show
people all right so cool infinite Airy
without Airy so sup man we got a couple
of new people's in here man so let's get
back to my coding okay so this is where
we get so I coated the the player select
screen and now I'm coding this screen
which is like the battleground of
pokemons and alright so the whole
game is gonna be like a rock paper
scissor type of game but we're still
gonna use the stats of each Pokemon so
if a Pokemon is another's weakness then
it counts for 1.3 like 1.3 if it's 100
then is it counts 130 for him because
he's the other Pokemon sweetness now let
me see how long with see where is a
height
okay cool so this is the screen right
I'm gonna put I should get another one
cuz this this one looks like
bump-bump but up put it up see it would
how is just pokemon battle grounds
that's not bad
I take that alright so let's see let's
start editing this little pokemons
okay so we got Charmander and baubles
are all right here let's set this up
animus see idle scream player I mean I
200 pixels all right
it's not bad little pixelated but not
bad
left
I see left 20%
all right so that's good
okay it's not supposed to be responsive
so don't worry about that okay this copy
this but CPU which is the computer let's
say 80% and then seal right sorry right
20 okay cool
eh eh oh eh oh eh you'll bring them back
as pokemons are freaky yeah
[Laughter]
all right so what else we gotta do to
this okay so I want to have dear health
I don't know should I put it on top I
think I should put it like on top like
right here on top of this I have their
health right and then up here it's what
we're gonna have the move like okay
attack you click on it and then it does
you choose which attack you want and
then it does like some rock paper
scissor type of so right now we're
just fixing the view right
the whole JavaScript is gonna be done on
my website coding phase comm which
hopefully I can start doing tonight
that's one thing people think like is
like oh man why are you taking so long
to do the rest of the tutorials like
guys I gotta come up with it
I gotta build it up build the HTML then
build the JavaScript
making a way where you guys gonna be
able to understand it you know so I was
like it takes a little time but trust me
is worth it the time that you guys are
you
yes yes see me I see me all right I
missing can ya see you boy when I came
back oh that I just freeze all right
yeah yeah if I see me
cool all right so let's go back so
rapidly hopefully this thing saved
okay pokemon battle
okay all right so what we want here is
the health the name of the pokemon the
health right okay so let's do this okay
let me see player we gotta make this
position:absolute that's fine and then
what else I play screen okay pull the
ear says player
okay player 1 all right so this way I
want to do it I say something like this
my white height equals wave a 400 pixels
it's just an estimate guys so okay all
right
right that's not bad so play 1 and then
if glass and then we'll say if I say HP
we say 100 out of 100 then down here
we're gonna put the bar there get this
okay just gonna see this bring this up
okay I'm saying what else we want to
talk to this let's go to color see
pokémon Idol we want to get an image so
we are low
I was going on like the internet super
slow and is my this kind of ridiculous
so to save this image so we could get
the colors from
Paris and now we've got the colors all
right so this is the background of this
box one of the best things about it once
you get to know HTML CSS like you can
build anything like I could literally
build up the Mona Lisa in it cuz I'm not
comfortable with it my goal I need to
know is just look why are the colors and
then I could build anything all right
and then I think this was the color of
the border
all right so this height is too big
going moving this to the left let's say
okay all right let's look at that
picture sort of what it looks like
we got squirtle okay so what it says you
got the title the level okay so let's do
it
so let's put in the title see how far
the health should be named health level
things Oh meow Alvey
now let's look at this CSS okay so this
is the view image player ward
okay so we got play one and stats and
then name so they lured us here copy
this lady wants that's what else we got
over there name okay put a padding
around this boy pixels it's too much
Charmander all right what else we got
okay what the hell just happened
sometimes I shouldn't be acting out man
sometimes I feel like I should switch up
from Red Bull that ate tools something
else maybe like cold pain probably
coping it will be better because this is
more for programming there's not really
for best to really be making a lot of
cool stuff from the front end but it's
fine it's fine for what I'm doing right
now all right let me see
CPU playlist at
the inside of name so it could be the
side of it
Charmander low-five and then let me see
so hellfish elf is a bar alright so
let's try to do that we gotta create a
health health bar okay so let's say say
health but a house health look at this
copy it from here okay stats help
okay elf bar okay what was the color of
this thing all right think it's this one
all right so let's see at ground okay or
the radius if I pick so much came
padding to pixels that's a little bit
more than that let's say five pixels all
right let's see what else
Timbo to raise my Fedora percentages
okay let's keep it like that what else
what other color HP was like so orangey
type color I don't think this color we
need anymore
so let's see yeah there that's good so
it's a color where is it
that's a little bit more orange a little
bit more reddish no it needs to be a
little bit more lighter than that yeah I
think that's good yeah that's fine now
let's see what else we got to do this
bar shouldn't be that hard
only 5% same
display:inline-block so we're doing
right now it's trying to put this thing
side-by-side so we got a do that for
that got a copy this now let's just put
a rat so we can see it okay no let's say
flow left and this put the C on the
title to flow left okay now you see what
happened there what you do is like this
health become me and say overflow:auto
that should bring it around again all
right now let's give this a little
margin 20 pixels on top
if it's on their own bottom baked skate
the ten that's fine okay now let's see
what else we want to change this color
to what was the color the green color
okay so again this green color there's
actually the color of the health bar
okay health bar background like that
but there's something we are missing
because what we want is the inside of it
to change so we got to create another
div inside of the health bar which is
gonna be called was the health bar if
pass
LF bar side
it's inside so let's copy this paste
this here now I groan off this be
the missing what's the background I'm
missing remember if it's white damn I
will douse hosts
acting up in a dark dark color inside of
it all right so we could do this we
could come here and let's say for this
one this make it something like
something like that
so healthbar the color is that okay
and then this was inside
because we got a patting the sound of it
that's what's messing it up
no it's not that one
that one's fine it's this alright song
yeah that's fine but we're gonna do it
as a transition we're gonna come here
health bar and inside we're gonna say
transition and say oh let's say it for
five seconds then ease in and out what
does going to do is well we change this
when this pokemon gets attacked then
this is gonna go down with a smooth
effect alright so let me see this is
worth 75 here but we don't want a whiff
of this so we're gonna do it we're gonna
do that into HTML you're gonna come here
to the HTML and put in the style say
with 75 we're 400 then with the
JavaScript and we tamed it here it will
move it so let's see them try this
oh you saw that
so that kids little animation kicks look
at that hey so that's what we want
alright I think we done as far as this
we still gotta do the buttons up
here the whole shebang
it takes time guys like you guys think I
don't be busting my ass for you guys
like I do man like how long have been
here coding this and this like my
day off right now right now I could be
playing ps4 hanging out with my friends
while I'm doing this for you guys so you
guys can learn JavaScript all right let
me see who's online yes phaser IO I'm
making a few games on it which I'll show
you guys later on what's up you know
once I freakin how you call this one
side comment I have time I'm gonna also
make another course on phaser IO because
it's cool it's pretty easy if like if
you know how to code in HTML CSS in
JavaScript then you could be making
games it's not that hard I got tri-unity
and I hated it I tried Unreal Engine I
hated it but I just like the web you
know so yeah you're Joe quick question
do most places use es6 JavaScript syntax
icons like template literals not really
you know most places they're not they're
not using es6 area like all the time
the people who use es6 are the people
who are like online
like the people who are working for like
the latest you know startups and
whatever but most people that working in
companies a lot of times you're gonna be
working with legacy code you know oh
that's es5 old ass javascript now
whenever you create something new then
yeah you could you use es6 that's what I
do whenever I create something new I
created in year six whenever I have to
make it for like I'm just editing
something that somebody already cold or
I'm just messing around with legacy code
in my company that I use cs5 that's it
let's see and now a message from our
sponsors where do fire blasts by scratch
and Bertha Charmander yep what language
are you using can you do a beginner
tutorials yes
oh my tutorials are for beginners guys
like how are you Caesar
have you been to this website it's
called coding phase kaha like literally
everything here is like for beginners
guys right so you come here learn HTML
CSS right now coming here see how the
course looks have another introduction
you know let's say an example HTML
boilerplate did you like the super
basics like was a text tag okay we're
talking about headers page with
paragraphs we
image tag see like CSS you got
everything box model box size in display
then we break down a whole website and
look that's a lot of hours guys
I don't know putting a lot of work for
you guys like take the time is sign up
it's $5 man come on you know like
there's a lot of work that I put into
this so it's literally for beginners you
know like I'm building this ship for
beginners I'm getting to a more advanced
later on and I'm sorry for everybody
else who who like you know they're
already past the beginning stages of
like what development like that's fine I
would say is good to redo certain things
so like that you could just reinforce it
but at the same time it's like you know
all the more advanced things they're
coming in the next few days like even
right now like I gave I created this a
JavaScript course right so I created
this javascript course and what I did
here was I didn't go over every single
thing in JavaScript you don't need every
single thing in JavaScript you need
things as you as you needed you search
for things as you need it right so
there's a beginners course so what I did
was I talked about the syntax how to
write a data types
operators numbers strings arrays objects
functions control flow if an else
statement switch statements loops every
loop that's useful in JavaScript I
missed the for each but that's because I
want you guys to learn that and be able
to go online and find other loops and
other ways to do it like one thing too
I did in this course as was I wasn't
holding your hand like I was teaching
you guys what everything is is doing on
JavaScript and everything that you need
to know as a beginner and then at the
same time I'm telling you where to find
the resources where to find the
references where to find the different
methods for each different thing like
let's say there's a metaphor functions
ISM metaphor objects DISA methods for
arrays strings you know I teach you like
two or three methods and then from there
I'll teach you where to find the rest of
the other methods because they're
reality nobody remembers all this
right even myself like right now like I
know how to do flex boxes but I don't
remember every single thing about flex
boxes all right so what do i do I come
here
CSS reference that I own I've been you
know it's now something gonna be like oh
I'm gonna remember every single thing
under the Sun you can't remember every
single little thing under the Sun it's
like you come here you look at the
references you okay this is what I'm
trying to do and trying to stretch it
right so there's so much
property isn't so much that you
can't remember everything so you gotta
learn how to find the resources in there
the references and how to read the
documentation of certain technologies
frameworks programming languages
whatever because that's how you gonna
learn the idea like sometimes you go to
different tutorials and the tutorials
have zero mistakes right the the person
doesn't teach you how to find the
answers to when you find a problem so
then now you're stuck because all you
know how to do is the things that he
taught you right but he he didn't teach
you how to think like a programmer and
solve problems so that's what I'm trying
to do on my website you know cause like
I'm on the same boat as you guys you
know I was a freaking developer that
self-taught and all these things I had
to learn it on my own because most
people did
they don't teach you that they don't
teach you how to think like a program
they don't teach you how to search for
for the answers how to find out through
the reference what you actually need is
like you know what I mean like if you
need to reverse something and you're
like oh a guy in a ray I need to reverse
an array most tutorials or or
courses don't teach you that hey you
could come here in search array reverse
and then you see it yeah so now you know
how to reverse an array you know most
people don't teach you that they teach
you oh this how reverse is is done but
they don't teach you where to find the
answers for different problems that
you're gonna find and that's what I'm
doing here with this thing like the
first project that I did was pretty
simple
it was hi coalition like a notification
so adding or removing classes you know
looping in the wild which is just a
while loop right so I'm teaching you
guys the things that you learn from all
the other videos back here but you're
learning it and now in a project in a
real-life situation now this project you
might be like oh this is Pokemon this
 is stupid all right
but there's so many pieces to this that
this is gonna make you think like a
programmer like this one's gonna be one
of the hardest ones because I'm gonna
tell you right now why because first of
all you gotta come here this is your
first thing all right first of all you
have multiple screens so you have to
select screen right so first of all you
got a display all these characters here
right you gotta have different data for
it which the data I'm going to give you
but then
you know in the formulas too but you
gotta think in your head you're like
okay I'm not gonna print out this
formula every single time so what am I
gonna do I'm gonna put it into a
function so I don't have to rewrite it
every single time so little things like
that is what you're gonna pick up from
here and you're gonna be like okay cool
this is what I gotta do whenever I'm
starting to build a project right so
let's say from here you come here you
select a character when you select the
character that character goes to an
array and that array says okay character
select a Charmander all right and then
from there it switches up screens it
comes to this screen which is the battle
screen but before going to the battle
screen you have to do like a loop of
like random random numbers right so you
could get a random level for each
character and then you gotta get a
random character that you're gonna
battle all right and then from there
you're gonna come here and then there's
gonna be multiple buttons here where
you're gonna choose okay I'm gonna
attack right let's say you you click
attack you click attack and then from
there another thing that we're gonna go
over is we're gonna create a system like
rock-paper-scissors right so whoever
wins the rock-paper-scissors attacks the
other one right now like what like I
said there's a formula for it all right
so it's not just like Oh 30 points down
30 points less or whatever it's not just
that this also um you know it's like it
goes to the attack x level all right and
then x stack stack means if the person
is if they both the same Pokemon then
the stack is gonna be one if the the
Pokemon is this one
Charmander kills or bubbles are because
he's fire and this one is is a
leaf then this one is is its weakness is
fire
so when he attacks him he attacks him
with a 1.3 so there's a lot of here
that's gonna happen like this is you
know a lobby was gonna be like this is
gonna be the easiest project and the
reality is gonna be the hardest one
because you're gonna have to use a lot
of JavaScript and then on top of that
when you attack a character
we gotta calculate how much his health
is which we have a formula here for the
health right depending on the level of
the character the what's itself is gonna
be so there from there like let's say
when this attacks let's say 37 let's say
37 in the same example something like
this Charmander attacks Bob Lazar and
then Bobo starts on health is 220 420
right and charmander's attack is let's
say 38 right we gotta create a formula
that is going to tell us what's gonna be
the the percentage of 220 when he does
38 right so let's say 220 right so let's
say no it's 38 times 100 100 divided by
220 and then that should give us how
much it went out how much percentage it
went down so 38 times 100 divided by 220
17 so when we do this we say ok bubbles
our health is at 100% so now what we do
is we come here and we say 100 minus 17
and then equals two right we come here
I'm just showing you guys for the
holloway right
eighty-three and then when that equals
to 83
now his health goes down to 83 percent
right and then that's a it goes down to
83 percent and that's what's left and
then you keep going like that and you
keep attacking and once it reaches to
zero then it says okay the person one
okay so that's the idea behind it now
for some people that might be like oh
this is easy no it's not because
there's a lot of pieces that are moving
right not only are you gonna have to
deal with the Dom but you're also going
to have to program this so yeah
it's not that easy but it was cool about
it's like you building something cool
and at the same time you're gonna
 learn JavaScript after this
if you don't learn JavaScript like I
don't know now you definitely gonna
learn it because this after this
you're gonna be like oh man now I know
how to think like a programmer how to do
you know how to be a developer so
there's a lot of pieces to it you know
oh yeah man I wanna CSS for now nope
- the old coding phase comm what
happened to it nobody was going to it
so it's like I built the other website
right which I still have it there and I
spent a lot of hours building it right
and nobody was people signed up but
never went on it you know so I was like
okay cool I'm not gonna have a website
just to have it so what I'm gonna do is
I try to make everybody happy and give
them everything that they want it for
the other website and then this one I
say you know what I'm just gonna make
 that it's gonna make me happy you
know what I mean like if I'm going to be
spending a whole bunch of hours coding
Shane being away from my care for my
wife then I'm gonna do something that's
gonna make me happy and what makes me
happy is teaching you know coding right
that makes me happy because I like
it I love coding and then not only do I
get to teach people but then at the same
time I get to learn even more because
when you teach somebody you really learn
the topic you know son that's why I said
you know what I'm gonna switch up my
website to the new coding phase comm
which is being hosted teachable calm
right which helps me enough not focus on
on the code but focus on the courses
instead of me worrying about all what
what service should I get should I pay
for her Roku should I pay for AWS I
don't have to worry about that this is
being hosted by a company already all
right and then on top of that the
system's already set up for me where I
could just come in here it keeps track
of everybody's everybody uh you know
quizzes the videos they watch when did
they stop watching like like that
and like for me was important it's also
to getting the data I want to know who
actually is doing the courses all right
so who's actually doing the courses
who's actually doing
now let me see like there's a couple of
sales
there's the ships from like this week so
it's like the courses are selling you
know but what's cool about it it's not
just okay I'm making a little
 $2,000 a week whatever it's not
about that is the fact that I could come
here and go to my users like I said I
come here to my learn HTML CSS right I
could come here and see students and
then let me see learn HTML CSS reports
so I could actually come here and see
who's completing it
you know leaderboards like who's
actually done with it so now I have that
data like you see cam is done with a
Jose Montero is done with a you know a
lot of people that signed up they're
almost done with it this 11 people
finished it right but there's a whole
bunch of other people who are still
taking it cuz now everybody has enough
time to come in here and do it you know
and then they see like a lot of other
people got to sign up but still have a
you know they still haven't done it yet
which I appreciate it that they signed
up and they bought the course want them
to come back and finish it it's not just
hey I tried it I started it that's why I
come here every day and try to
help you guys out so get motivated
because sometimes you you come here and
you're like oh yeah I'm gonna become a
developer but then nobody wants to
really put in the work you know it's
like look at that it's 86 people only
only let me see 86 people out of 86
people 50 started it so 30 people have
signed up and they haven't even started
all right or maybe they just they
already know HTML CSS all right so let's
see the future proof JavaScript right
so let me see reports let's see video
stats not video stats leaderboards
alright so from all the people these are
about six who already completed who come
every day every single day and they they
watch it cuz every day I drop in like
three to four videos and right so
there's a whole bunch of other people
that haven't started it and also too you
have to understand just because they say
is enrolled doesn't mean that they're
enrolled to this course because when you
buy the bundle when you come here and
you buy the decoding phase all access
pass alright when you get this all
access pass you get enrolled to every
single one no matter what alright so
yeah so what's important about the site
is just me keeping track of everybody's
how you call this progress cuz I here
because of my own running get money and
become a million if I wanted to become a
millionaire my courses will be in
 you to me and I will be paying
for advertising arena alright
that's not the point the point is to
help out everybody who's in here and
hold you guys accountable like if you
really want to become a developer I'm
gonna help you I'm gonna invest the time
to get you out there but if you're just
 around and you just like oh I'm
just not gonna do it
cool so then don't do it but at least
you're accountable you know you spend
five dollars for no reason if you didn't
want to become a developer then that's
on you you know behind it
you know what I mean so holding praise
God I want you guys to really succeed
man I want you guys so to do your thing
yeah Henry I'm transparent about
this shame because in reality is a lot
of people that signed up they they know
they want to support me they want to
support me some of them are not sure
they want to become developer some of
them are they want to do it they some of
them just they just love my channel like
you know what it was $5.00 it's not
gonna hurt my pocket I'm gonna support
Joe and that's great but at the same
time like I just want to help people out
you know what I mean like I want you
guys to really step it up this year and
get you guys in jobs and you know just
be good you know so I don't need to hide
anything as far as like sales or how
much money I'm making I'm making a good
amount making a good I don't know this
month I probably made like a good 4 G's
from the website so that's fine you know
it's nothing crazy I'm not gonna become
a millionaire of that especially one
half of it goes into taxes and
then you know another 20% is on fees and
hosting a whole bunch of so in
reality what the hell do I leave with
like extra $1700 which is like is it
worth all the time that I put into this
 not really but it's worth it when I
see people who who are really you know
busting their ass and coming in here and
and don't they work you know like I love
seeing I love seeing the fact that
people are finishing the courses and in
getting done you know I'm in here
and be like oh I learned so much from
your course and they send me emails yeah
Victoria pow soul
yeah you gotta be careful a k47 and like
whenever you do work for anybody you
gotta get money up front and do work you
know calculate everything calculate the
time that's gonna take you calculate you
know all the work that you're putting in
do because people are gonna be nice
nobody's gonna be nice
trust me and also just do your thing man
but make sure you get paid first you
know it's like me I've gotten burned a
lot of times I've been super nice to
people and they keep burning me and
every day that more people keep burning
me more and more and more and more and
I'm like yeah should I just be a asshole
but I'm like you know what that's not
who I am I'm not an asshole I'm just a
dude that's like nice you know
but yeah man we in here
yeah so who in here finish the html/css
course on my website everybody in the
chatroom let me see I know Henry
finished it
yes Henry uh if you learn phaser dial is
good because it's a good way to practice
trust me you're gonna learn a lot of
JavaScript like especially object
oriented prom programming so
yeah I think I think the people that
want to learn they wanna learn you know
what I mean like this certain people
that are gonna learn and they're gonna
bust their ass like I'll see you how are
you always you come in I drop a video
you get it done
you finish it move on to the next like
you're one of those people that yeah
here for a reason you know what I mean
like there's a lot of people on YouTube
and that's one of the main reasons why I
was like yo I'm not gonna put tutorials
no more it's gonna be rare and I'm gonna
put in like tutorials or on YouTube
because this is not a platform for
people to do work right so that's why I
said you know what I'm gonna put my
course on my own website even if only
ten people get to go in and do the work
I know those ten people did the work
right when I put something here and you
own on YouTube nobody does it you know
it's like people wanted watching they
give it a view but I know they don't do
it because if they did do it then they
will ask me questions or be like oh how
you do this one was the next video one
is this and that so I know exactly how
how YouTube works Victoria what I'm
Victoria where you from Victoria we
haven't seen you around here that's good
we got new subscribers new people
supporting the channel what you learn in
Victoria Rana I wonder
what exactly are you learning Victoria

JavaScript PHP front end back in
databases what are you interested South
Korea my peoples my people from South
Korea what up 21 viewers 21 likes

yeah man PHP yo you trying to learn PHP
cool I'll help you out with that drop
some knowledge of freelancing okay I
mean all I can say is just guys just be
careful always get paid 70 to 85 percent
of your money up front don't do work for
friends and what I mean like if you do a
job for your friend cool but if your
friend is a oh man could you do this for
me and and you know I got you later man
be like oh man I'm so busy I barely have
time with work I only got like a little
fraction of time to just like do
anything
so with that you already told them like
you know I'm not gonna do your
work man for free so at least you do
that you know what else
check out Craigslist check out a lens
check out what else Fiverr there's a lot
of places where you can make money on
your own now it's about you being a
hustler and trying to trying to get it
it's not the same thing as having a full
time job
full-time job you can just stay there
and you'll be good and you get paid on
Fridays all right but when you were
doing freelancing you got to really go
out there and find your clients and do
networking talk to other people who want
a website yeah man all right guys I'm
about to get back to coding cuz I gotta
finish this sting tutorial alright so
getting back to the code okay alright so
you got this
now let me see
this player one all right let's see
player main character bottle screen
player
all right let's see it don't work what
the
what isn't this working Oh cuz I put
player to okay dang okay let's delete
this from the bottom
clean it up
all right cool let's see what else now
we need to put something up here just a
big button this battle
so can I rotate this thing
see like I don't know everything guys
but I do not a search I don't know how
to solve a problem like I don't know
every single thing under the Sun let's
see player 1 image
see there you go
that's what we want it man see you boy
your voice nice - man you boy it comes
in I'm a problem-solver guys alright let
me see what else we gotta do to this
thing battle binds
I went too low the image
there's a lot of CSS here so
we separate this thing
okay let's see now we gotta fix this
buttons
oh wait sorry sighs right see if I could
get the sounds from like Street Fighter
yeah well is those fire is my refiner
I'll break this otherwise slow slow
damn Charmander slaps that out of
bubble SAR I'm about to play my own
sound effects gonna be the sound of

funny ass game yo let's see alright so
you got the fight button cool and then
let me see fight BTN and okay so this is
fine for now though still the battle
buttons okay I like that little sound
where is that they gotta have some other
course
all right so let's see what we got we
got battle buttons so screen fight
let's do this
all right let me see what else
guys takes a while take a little wild
but it's worth it
hey guys it's just about tricks man CSS
tricks man so you know it starting to
feel like a body right obviously can I
do
there you go that's what I'm talking
about
kids I see how we look there you go you
know it looks legit now it looks like we
know what the hell we're doing right
all right let's see
can I separate this so we don't have to
redo this every single time okay take
this here put it here
75 by 56
all right you have to see what else
we've missing is the paper
hey goddamn paper and with toilet paper
all right
okay what the hell why is there one of
them is off she will be the same
 assholes so they know
letting me use it
Oh coding guys still blink still
working on this thing
the tricks kids you got a lot have a
trigger system they don't want you to
use their images cool so we save it in
the upload of some whales
all right see I still want to know why
the this thing is going up it's
gonna piss me off the tip size is over
100 or is this one up
see sometimes like that that's
gonna piss you off you're gonna be like
why are you being difficult wait there
might be something here because of the
font size but why is the font size
affecting this
now Marge in this hair on top let's say
I pick us on each side cool what's a lot
of work kids just for you guys man
all the that I do feel yes ma'am
looks good no wasn't me here Missy
Victoria's like so cute alright I was in
here Casey
fantastic pop Colin weird
when will they actually start fighting
well yeah man
who is calling with this in the
background coding phase angular a
monster my vaporizer
it's a good Saturday
word then you hear the boss fantastic is
like I'm I'm eighteen your baby
fantastic is a little baby system
administrator what why are you studying
system administrator in 2017 come on man
my total jobs is not there no water you
gotta study something cool man computer
science or something that's worth
something
see you know tell you much you don't
know man I'm being honest tell your
mom I said you can put this video for
her mom you don't know
trust me man
I went through the same with my mom
and not she lives with me like when I
was young she never wanted me to be in a
computer oh you're gonna go blind
you're gonna go those in that I'm like
yo this will pace the jobs pace the
 bills now
- none dies like oh this is boring
there's just me coding guys this is me
coding what I have to build for a course
that I'm doing right now on JavaScript
so somebody got a code to HTML CSS for
this so I guess I'm the guinea pig
all right I gotta build this but
it's cool because then people gonna be
able to you know to actually learn this
 they're gonna learn JavaScript by
creating a little rock-paper-scissor
Pokemon game oh yeah
why does Joe use Red Bull instead of
editor why the editor and I could even
be using sass but the idea behind it is
there's gonna be a lot of people who are
taking the course for you know future
proofed JavaScript on my website and not
everybody needs to learn a new editor
you know somebody's using plumb
everybody's using what's the the one
atom and then there's the other one
sublime tags and then this visual studio
call so to not confuse everybody I'm
basically building it here and then if
you want to do it here you can do it
here and come here to wrap all the IT
and take this URL right what's the
freaking thing and then you could play
around with it yep
good old react fiber I actually did a
video about it but I haven't released it
yet
Joe pokey Joe wanna see - Joe what what
is it doing what I can't hear I can
understand this
Joey Channel I'm sorry yes react fibre
was just released which I should do a
video about this
it's your message I haven't checked
let me see I'm a check right now let me
check right now let me go in my email
let me see
it's centered on YouTube I'm going
through all my emails in shape now it's
a mystery YouTube
okay Zachary says hey Joe I'm already
bicoastal deals on bootcamp on the
backend part right and basically he
wants to know if he should leave it
alone because they don't really want to
learn no js' but he wants to learn the
backend but more of dotnet Drupal and
PHP I would say just finish it finish
the course because all the things that
he goes over are things that you're
gonna need in any back in language so
just finish it doesn't really matter
like once you learn one back-end
you're gonna be able to understand every
single other one every single other
language out there it's like right now
you understand what if and else
statements functions and variables and
all that right so once you
understand all of that you go you could
translate that in any other language
like if you learn in JavaScript you can
learn how to search in PHP like if right
now I wanted to say you know how to do a
function in PHP you could look it up and
it's the same as JavaScript so I
would say just finishing man trust me
man just knock it out the way after
you're done with that then you're gonna
understand you know what to do with the
backend and then from there yeah and
just keep on moving you know
oh yeah man pretty good tire I might
take a break my see you guys later on
what's the matter
it wasn't what the other people can't
make me so ball and cool like you listen
man this is family man this shit's
been around since the beginning of time
my family I can't do anything about it
but it's fine I don't let it stop me
you know let me do what I want to do in
this world you know still God still got
money in the bank
I'm just saying though you know
sometimes we just you know we gotta do
some crazy you know how is it that
Kodak black does it like this is pocket
change man you know what I mean like I
don't even use cash like and this just
cash to have around like the design that
I tell people like you count it up for
me I don't know how much I got in here
it's just there's no that I just
have like on the floor literally like on
the floor because I haven't picked it up
in months because I'm like one of those
type of people that's like I'm
superstitious when it comes to things
and like sometimes if I drop money I
don't like to pick it up until I need it
so I just leave it there on the floor so
this it's been there for months you know
like I'm just saying like you know there
was a time where I will work a whole
week for this all right now I have this
on the floor you know it's all come from
what development man you know so it's
like having this you know doesn't
stop me and never stop me you know for
game like I'm good you know you gotta
have fun in this world man you gotta
have fun in this world and like that's
just how you gotta do it man you got to
be confident you gotta love yourself you
gotta know that intelligence is better
than anything in the world
studying busting your ass everything
 pays off at the end man my god
so people like this ain't nothing
like no this ain't no rent money they
single no no no I think this is like
 that I dropped literally a
few months ago I haven't picked it up
from my room it was on the floor so my
wife don't pick it up from the floor
just leave it there
so I mean like when I bust my ass on
this it's for a reason
tell you guys like yeah I gotta work
hard man you gotta do your thing work
hard so she's gonna pay off right now
you look at this and you're like oh man
this is boring who was it that said
it somebody forgot hole somebody said it
here was a non Chang or something like
that
ash Nanda said what are you making this
is boring
Pokemon is boring what you know this
Pokemon little thing is going to
multiply this little stack and this
little stack is going to multiply it for
my calculations 17 times right so all
right but sometimes you gotta sacrifice
you gotta put in that work you got to do
what you got to do you know what I mean
you gotta just work hard man
yes a curry I mean check out the the the
course man the html/css course
everything that you're gonna need is
there trust me you're gonna be going man
yes you could use flex back on flex
boxes whatever you want to use you could
use it like if you already know
something like let's say I'm doing
something where I'm like editing a font
or whatever right if you already know
that concept you could do it however you
want it you know you don't have to do
exactly how I do it
what's important is that you get the the
results of whatever it is that I'm
teaching you you know if you already
know it your own way that's fine you
know somebody somebody sent me a message
telling me that he he did most of my
tutorials his own way but he appreciate
it because it also gave him time to
practice and and put work in you know so
everybody does their and their own thing
and they learn the wrong way but here
and I'm about to be out of here kids you
hang out with me for what for two hours
of me coding this say me can you
tell me the PHP developers way I mean if
you know JavaScript you can understand
PHP you already know programming right
then just look for the syntax if I'm
gonna be later on tonight I don't know
maybe what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
take a break and I'm gonna chill where
wifey and okay
for a while and then today later on I'm
gonna make a bunch of videos which are
the videos that I'm gonna show here on
YouTube for the rest of the week I saw

that's one of my favorite ones man oh
yeah man I'm gonna see you guys later
you know make sure you go to my website
Coney face comm check out the course the
thing that I just day right here like I
just spent two hours coding distinct a
website guys we're basically gonna
create this game you're gonna be able to
choose a character right after you
choose a character you're gonna be able
to come here play rock-paper-scissors
against the computer and see which one
wins now there's no JavaScript yet
before it so all of that information or
that code the logic behind it we're
going to code that on coding phase comm
like I said some of you guys might say
all this is easy they I don't want
to learn this guys you need to
learn how to practice how to
build things with JavaScript this is
like very complicated like to do all of
this with vanilla JavaScript after you
learn this doing every general of
another JavaScript you're gonna be like
oh this is hard but after
you do it then you're gonna everything
else besides this is gonna be super easy
because you already did one of the
hardest things to do
all right now doing this in jQuery
easy doing this and react this easy
doing this in view doing it and
angular it's easy
but during this in vanilla JavaScript
this is gonna test your skills if you
really go with it
listen go to coding freeze calm right
now it's right there
