again man coding phase comp your boy is
backing out and did it again
so your boy Charles is basically sending
me this link and he's telling me hey man
check this out check this our course out
and it seems like a legit course but
there was something that I was just like
listening just to the introduction and
it just didn't make sense to me and this
is why I feel bad for anybody that's out
here looking for any type of resources
to learn online because everybody comes
in and spills their own personal
opinions on on things which is not the
reality of life of what's really going
on in the industry all right so this is
valuable skills and earn a high salary
most courses are either updated and
teaching you less valuable skills like
jQuery or PHP or the course doesn't
cover the full spectrum of technologies
that you need I agree with some of the
things he said people teach you know
outdated stuff and that's right you know
because somebody might create a course
in 2014-2015 until this day you know
2017-2018 still set in the single course
still making money out of that same
course so you know poor you come in in
2018 you sign up for a course and you're
taking a course from 2014 and you don't
even know it because a lot of people
don't even put no dates on on their
their courses but sold into something
that he said it's like hey people are
teaching jQuery PHP things that are
outdated and less valuable and I'm like
I don't understand what it's up with a
lot of people who live in certain
bubbles a lot of times people who live
and when I say certain bubbles live in
the the major cities New York San
Francisco if you live in the major
cities for some reason people really
think like JavaScript it's the only
thing that's gonna be in the future and
the only thing that's gonna be a
around and it's the only thing that you
need to learn for web development and
you need to make sure you learn only
react you only need to learn you know
our nodejs and that's all you need in a
reality it's like no there's like a
million jobs out there for junior
developers to come in for PHP there's a
million jobs who are out there who are
pretty much looking for people who know
the basics of JavaScript you know cuz
somebody sent me this another email to
where it's like hey Joe I mean no
JavaScript loop right now I don't know
what to do with myself I've been trying
to learn JavaScript but I don't even
know when is it that I'm ready to start
looking for a job because this
constantly new frameworks and new things
to learn and more and more things to
learn when it comes to JavaScript and
it's like I haven't gone to an interview
because I don't know if I'm ready and
it's like yeah it's not just you buddy
everybody's going through it right so
especially when you have you know
developers out here who pretty much just
say hey man here's nodejs
this all you need to learn and one thing
that you gotta understand for a lot of
developers it's easier to just teach you
JavaScript because in a course it's easy
you say hey I told you javascript is no
js' here's how you do a couple of things
learning from here and I don't have to
worry about teaching you another
language I don't have to teach you about
another database everything is the same
thing here's the mean stack here's the
merge stack that's a old JavaScript it's
easier then coming in and explain to
people hey this is PHP this is Python
this is Ruby this is whatever language
there's this job of this dotnet you know
what I mean on top of the three main
things which is HTML CSS and JavaScript
it's easier to just say hey we just do
means that we just do merge stack it's
so much easier but one thing that you it
just bothers me because it's just like
man do these people do the research like
me and this other guy Andre near goy we
could go into a you know a nodejs
interview and AC and go in and get you
know get the position now every one of
you guys is gonna have that look all
right because a lot of the companies are
looking for people who are more the you
know more experienced right if I come in
and say hey I've been in the industry
for 10 years I'm gonna get the job if
you come in and you say hey I learned
this online I got a couple of little
projects and I only been here for you
know my last job I was a developer
intern or whatever for six months you're
not gonna get the job right but in a
easier position like something with PHP
or something where they need you to know
jQuery to basically maintain legacy code
or or just easy sliders and little
things like that you are going to get
that opportunity to get hired all right
like you have to start somewhere there's
the thing where this guys they forget
and it bothers me because you know I see
it all the time you know it's like right
now I could come in and tell you hey
guys we're gonna prepare ourselves to go
work at Google and we're gonna have 300
400 people next to us arms and our you
know arms to arms together and we're
gonna walk to Google where we're gonna
say we demand to get a job here let's
all get a job we're not all gonna get a
job at Google
okay like it's just not gonna happen
all right guys we're not gonna get a job
at that big high-tech company it just
doesn't work like that if you were if
you live let's say an example for for
whatever reason let's say you live in
and West Virginia right you live in West
Virginia and you live in a
city kaul Parkersburg man you live in
Parkersburg because this is the thing
people forget people live out here and
they're not working with noah - yes
they're not working with all the latest
things out there you know most of the
time it's gonna be stuff that's already
been around for years
you know PHP jQuery Python or if you're
doing something you know dealing with
data or if you working with a corporate
company is gonna be done that like those
are the things that you're going to get
you know those are the jobs that's gonna
be in this area all right if you don't
live here New York City where there's an
abundance of like jobs of every
technology your safe bet is for you to
do the research you can't listen to
people out here and tell you hey man
this is the best thing that is the one
that you got to learn this is the only
thing that you're going to learn no it
doesn't work like that you're supposed
to have knowledge of a little bit of
everything now to tell somebody that hey
man jQuery PHP what else that people
like to say is outdated dotnet or what
else um we gotta find we got to make a
list of like every every hipster guy out
there that loves to just put down this
technologies we need to make a list
right and we like hey guys don't use
this because no js' is out right and you
look around in your area you like um
there's no no js' jobs out here and the
jobs that are here they're looking for
somebody for five to seven years
experience so what happens to me the
self-taught developer in my house and
there's the thing this isn't that
bothers me because it's like a lot of
those guys they don't put themselves in
other people's shoes they don't put
themselves in other people's shoes they
don't understand that if you live
in let's say Youngstown Ohio it's not
the same thing as living in Cleveland
Ohio so when you do general things like
even was this kid's name even you when
even you was telling me here on YouTube
the creator of you he is like hey man
you know there's four companies here
Seattle oh you know there's four
companies here in Seattle that are
actually using view Jay yes so when you
say there's no jobs for view Jay yes
you're lying
and I'm like your hating he's like your
hating you know hey it's not gonna get
you anywhere no it's not hate it's I'm
being honest I'm here to be honest with
people you know what I mean like I'm not
gonna tell people hey man under the
training blogs and you know SitePoint
calm and ready calm view GIS is the
hottest things but you come down here
you come to Vegas you come to Utah you
go to Arizona you go to Albuquerque you
go to Amarillo you go to OKC you go to
Kansas cities you go to freaking Iowa
you go to Chicago nobody's using vue.js
there's no jobs for it nobody's using
that at all you gotta say so for me to
come in and be like hey guys you know
angular you know react so old-school man
they're super outdated they super
outdated the new thing is view GS the
new thing is no js' only everything in
the world that gets done with no js'
guys it's the only thing that you got to
learn in the world this is so stupid
it's not even funny man people live in
bubbles man because people act like
they've never been outside of the city
people act like people who are learning
online is the same level as them like
when they go to a job interview and be
like hey man I've been doing it for
seven years ten years I wanna you know
work as a node.js developer you have
five to ten ten years as a job
developer yeah they're gonna give it to
you of course you know JavaScript
already like the back of your hand but
Johnny from freakin from Bowling Green
Kentucky who's teaching himself online
is not gonna show up to a place and be
like hey guys hire me I learned no G yes
three months ago and in my house on on
you to me and as I hate can I get a job
it doesn't work like that all right
now if he comes in it to a job for PHP
JavaScript you know something basic you
know when you're learning this courses
online even to this day my biggest
selling course it's not react it's not
none of the major courses that you would
think it's not laravel Larry Bell was my
best course literally and less than
seven percent of the people have gone
into taking it alright because the rest
of everybody else like about eighty
percent of the people are taking learn
HTML and CSS alright in the next course
is future-proof javascript which is the
basics of JavaScript so that means
everybody that's looking for courses are
like super beginners guys hey so when
you see this courses that just tell you
hey man this is the only thing that
you're gonna need you know it's like no
js' there's no js' diet and everything
before it it's out dating you don't need
it you don't need to learn this because
this is not where the future is going
I've been hearing this for like seven
years same thing that um this kid came
in left a comment do you think rule will
continue to grow anything 2018
I think note is coming for that spot
guys I've been hearing this for like
seven eight years for like okay like
seven years since 2011 around there
since 2011 I've been hearing people say
no js' is around the corner for seven
damn years
you get what I'm saying and I bring this
up again a million times when Twitter
left Ruby on Rails when it actually go
back let's roll back a little bit when
Twitter
Twitter was actually the best and the
worst thing that happened to Ruby on
Rails because this how the community is
so fickle you know people are so fickle
when it comes to this thing you know
when Twitter came in and was created
with Ruby on Rails Ruby on Rails
exploding everybody said oh my god they
created this in a week and look how
successful it is because Ruby on Rails
production-wise you can't compete
there's no other framework or language
out that I can compete with Ruby or Ruby
on Rails period so when it came out
everybody's like Oh older the the
freaking startups everybody started
using Ruby on Rails alright
then from there Ruby on Rails basically
slowed down because Twitter said hey
we're gonna switch from Ruby on Rails to
Scala alright and when they did that
automatically they just pretty much
stabbed in the neck and say here we're
gonna stab you in the neck because
people are so you know even the smartest
developers are so dumb at the same time
you know some people think when you're
creating applications out here you got a
plan out for when you get to a Twitter
level when you get to a Facebook level
when you get to a a snapchat Instagram
level
alright everybody thinks that you got a
plan for that moment and what they don't
understand is that that's only 1% other
companies that make it to that level
right so if you out here creating
websites or e-commerce or a website that
way it's like a service anything you
could think of Ruby on Rails is perfect
for it right but online people will be
like
Ruby on Rails is dying mind you there's
so many freaking jobs for Ruby on Rails
that can't get filled because there's
just not how many people out there that
know Ruby on Rails like that so what
happens when you know the language and
you're good what happens you get paid
the most Ruby on Rails developers get
paid the most out of everybody maybe not
going but out of all the other
developers and I'm talking about web
that's my specialty
don't come here and tell me you know
some Python developers they make
distance isn't that guys we're not
talking about big data we're not talking
about software engineering we're not
talking about creating applications I'm
talking about my specialty web
development if somebody can talk about
web development is me I know exactly the
ins and out of web development all right
I started from the bottom I was just
like you guys years ago searching and
searching and searching until I realized
that not everything that's on the
Internet is is beneficial for me all
right
something's hurt me something's drove me
to try to learn technologies die I
didn't need things that there was no
jobs in things that are you know it was
somebody's favorite new language of
somebody's favorite new framework and I
would go in and try to learn it and
waste of time without creating any
anything from my portfolio or creating
projects that were something that I
could show four or something I could
make money off because if we're here is
for a reason to be here on the Internet
in front of a computer listening to me
and you're doing this for the love this
is stupid you will have to be stupid to
just say hey I'm just doing it for the
love I'm not looking for no benefits at
the end I'm not trying to get no money
at the end it's like I'm spending 12
hours a day learning to code and I'm
just learning I'm not building anything
I'm just learning you going on saying if
you thinking like that that's stupid
okay now people like this I don't know
the guy who was his name
and rainy nagoya or something i think
they hurt people more than they they
help them because when you try to come
in and you say hey man don't learn the
things you know that are the basics of
web development but yet you want to
become a web developer that's like
telling somebody hey man don't learn how
the ABCs but he is how to write a
sentence alright this is how to write
your essay but don't learn your ABCs
wait what does it make sense I hope you
guys understand me don't learn your ABCs
but learn how to write an essay this is
how you write an essay you don't even
know the ABCs but you writing an essay
you get what I'm saying like sometimes I
just feel like man I don't want to stand
it I just don't understand it I
you can't downplay the things that now
as a senior developer you for you you
say oh this is easy there's easy this
things
nobody needs to learn this is this is
old school this is outdated mind you
there's so many jobs for people out
there now you're just blocking off the
people who are there to learn from you
from learning something just because you
don't want to teach that you got one
saying like there's certain things that
I don't like and I still teach it I
still tell people to go learning I'm not
the biggest angular fan but I could tell
you right now I've compared to
everything else out there besides react
I've never seen so many jobs like you
have for angular 1 and even angular 2
now there's jobs like literally you come
outside you trip over them when it comes
to angular and react now if you're one
of the people that are like me who would
like to go for the top is like hey man
if I'm gonna learn this stuff if you are
a developer write it name another
developer you you are a person who is
switching careers and you're in a
position where you say hey man I can't
really go into a career if my first
job is less than 60 let's say $70,000
well the perfect place where you will be
Ruby on Rails because if you're
good if you know your your freaking
language and you know the framework
you're looking at 85 starting you know
what I'm saying to put all your baskets
in just JavaScript and nodejs and just
say hey man I'm just gonna forget about
everything else that's out there you're
hurting yourself you got a look at your
area you got a do the research find out
what's in your area and realize that
just what you see on the incident is not
really what's happening in your world
all right you might see somebody talk
nodejs is the future no Jesus is the
best thing in the world
guys if you live in freaky you live in
Tulsa Oklahoma no js' is not the world
no js' is not the world let's look it up
this is just a random thing I'm doing it
just randomly because you know sometimes
we we talk about things that and
technologies that are very popular in
major cities and major cities New York
San Francisco that's a but let's look
into this let's say node and let's
looking what is it did I say it was a
Tulsa yeah Tosa Tulsa seven jobs and
this is not even as no developers this
is senior front-end developers which
means they're just asking for people who
know NPM a lot of times this people add
node to two jobs you know like a
recruiter might put in the key word node
but and they don't need you to become a
no developer what they need you to know
is at least MPM so you could download
the freaking libraries you could use a
web pack in the whole shebang right but
start looking into this thing man look
in your areas
now let's see what they got
PHP more jobs more jobs than than
freaking junior developer generic web
developer okay see like in Tulsa like
this is what you guys are junior
developers like this is where you're
going to find jobs this is where you're
gonna get you start in your in in in the
damn industry you know jumping into you
know no to yes and say hey man no js' is
the answer to everything
it's just not guys I'm telling you right
now
it's just not the answer for people to
say hey man you know JavaScript you're
ready to go no you're not ready to go
because javascript is not the same thing
as nodejs it's the same language but you
got to know more stuff and then you got
to compare yourself to somebody who
might know five to ten years more than
you who's going for the same position
and you're like hey man can I get that
job they're gonna look at you like
you're crazy like yes you there's a lot
of people that get opportunities in
major cities but I want to know who out
here out of all of you guys lives on the
major cities the major tech hubs New
York San Francisco let's say la Austin
let's see Colorado if you live a little
cities to leave a comment and say I'm in
those main cities or just put I'm not in
those main cities I'm probably gonna put
in a poll alright just I'm gonna put a
survey on online on YouTube and I'm
gonna release a later on the you know
the results of it and I just wanted to
say this all here man and I keep
repeating myself you have to be careful
what people put out there on the
internet because I could come in and
tell you hey man you know the hottest
thing right now here in New York is
actually golang but now you come in and
you're like hey man I'm just gonna learn
golang and then the next thing you know
it's like you live in Tulsa and there's
no jobs for kool-aid
how convenient you just spent so much
time learning something creating
projects creating portfolios creating
things and it's like they don't use that
all right all right smaller business are
not using that which if you look it up
smaller businesses are the ones that are
hiring junior developers it's not the
main companies it's not you know this
big companies are Google and Facebook
nobody's big companies are hiring junior
developers the ones that get hired to
die junior developers are like guys
creating robots and MIT like this is a
huge difference between hey guys I'm a
junior developer here you know learning
from you to me learning from Cody feels
calm and hey guys I'm building robots at
MIT I've never had a job but I'm
building robots at MIT can I get a job
who do you think is gonna get that job
you know we could think about that now
if you go to a smaller business those
are the people that are gonna give you a
chance to start working once you build
yourself up then you have those
opportunities then you start going to
those you know major companies even the
smartest people here in YouTube the
smartest guys the guys that you respect
all right a lot of them they came in
goats were a major company and trying to
get an interview they won't even pass
the funk interview you get what I'm
saying like that's just a reality of
things so when you come in here and you
listen to everything that's on the
internet it tells you hey man all of
this other stuff that's out there man
it's old school those are all school
things those are the old school things
there's no dumps for that you are a
that's not the future what is the future
I've been hearing this for seven years
no js' is the future and for some reason
there's more jobs for PHP but I'm
supposed to tell people don't go and
learn PHP because no
GSS the future people sound so stupid so
ignorant like you know what's the future
the XYZ framework the Teletubby
framework the Harry Potter language you
know where is a quantum computing and
the computers you know quantum computers
is that's the future go ahead and
prepare yourself for that for a 10 20
years thing stay out here starving while
you're still learning that yeah you're
planning out for the future while you
could literally have a job right now be
working and then learn all those other
things that it's coming up just prepare
yourself that's what I did I learned all
the basics I learned all the things that
would give me that job and will get me
working like this
those are the things that I did now I
learned any technology I want I come in
and learn whatever the hell I want I
could learn goaling I could learn OGS I
can learn Ruby on Rails I could learn
Python accolade dinair I could learn C
sharp I could learn whatever the hell I
want but you know why I always had a job
what I was learning there's no point of
view learning something if you won't be
able to get that job you know learning
something that you're gonna get the job
and then prepare yourself as you keep on
building your skills once you know what
development you know everything else
it's just about learning syntax and
learning different ways and different
paradigms that people do do things but
just I don't know watching that video
just kind of trigger and I was like man
this is so dumb like you could literally
tell like this person is in a bubble
like when you tell somebody
automatically don't learn jQuery which
can make your life super easier as a
JavaScript developer don't learn PHP
which literally has the most jobs than
any other
programming language out there in the
web and you're trying to teach web
development you're like what are you
doing you hurting people you know what
I'm saying so I don't know just do your
research man find your your own area and
see what they hiring for man this idea
of like I know everything it doesn't
work like that because we don't know
everything we need to put ourselves in
other people's shoes not all of these
people live in New York and San
Francisco same thing that I told even
you bro I'm not hating on you
it's like view is the baby of reacting
angular and they're from there that's it
but doesn't mean that companies are
going to drop everything like they're
doing that they're using angular and
react and they're gonna say hey guys
we're dropping everything we're gonna
jump on few GS something that some guy
is building on his basement it doesn't
make sense
all right so do your research kit I'm
out of here
