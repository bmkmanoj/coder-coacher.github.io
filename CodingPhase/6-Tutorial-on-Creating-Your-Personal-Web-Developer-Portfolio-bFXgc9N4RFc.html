Conan face.com today we got something
special okay today we are going to
create a personal v card so now what
we're gonna do is we're gonna build the
menu
okay the mini is technically going to
show up whenever we click on this
hamburger okay so look what we're gonna
do before that is put on the icons here
of social media so let's just go to
fonts awesome
come here see icons let's put in YouTube
okay take this okay now we're gonna go
to the index.html and find where we put
the icons should be here so you're gonna
put it like that now let's see what else
next thing that we want it dual let me
close this real quick close this real
quick all right and okay so we got the
YouTube let's go get the Twitter okay
Twitter got Instagram Instagram and
let's see who else that's the graph
Facebook now I don't know if you people
even put their own Facebook's online
okay let me see
let's put in dribble okay so all the
icons are there now the next thing we're
gonna do is we're gonna make this into
links currently we're just gonna put in
like that just a hashtag which means
it's gonna send them to the top okay
let's open this up okay copy this paste
it there close it all right so I'm just
gonna paste it oops
tap paste it tap well enter and then
gonna copy it is and paste it at the end
of this one click enter
okay all right cool no let's see was to
say icon section okay so go to home find
where is a Content area info section I
came is out of here right at the bottom
I'm gonna see info section and the
reason why we put in this because is
inside of the info section in actually
actually I wanted to say icon section
okay so now here we're gonna say the
anchor links gonna make it color white
okay
just like that
let me see color white
text-decoration:none let's see what else
fontsize say to REM for now to see how
it looks
let me move to sit aside save that and
that doesn't look bad
okay no I'm gonna see what else what
else should I do
maybe a little padding padding zero on
top I say 10 pixels left all right okay
I'm gonna see say and first child okay
so the same for the anchor link in the
first child we want it to be padding:0
top:0 left:0 10 pixel right zero bottom
zero on the was the left side okay so
now there you go that's exactly what we
want it okay cool yeah so we got that
part now we got to do the many all right
so let's create this menu let's come
here we're gonna have to create the HTML
we're gonna have to do right under the
hamburger under the hamburger gonna say
div or section
section and then class menu okay we
could even do ID at some point I'm gonna
clean it up maybe use IDs later on but
for now let's just keep it like this so
ID menu and we're going to say what we
gonna do I'm gonna put in nav okay here
we're gonna put in H ref like this okay
we're going to put in home okay so we
got about portfolio contact okay alright
so as you can see we got the menu there
now it's all about coming to the main
that CSS come to the bottom and then we
gotta say menu and we're going to make
this background color one I'm gonna say
position fixed position fixed and then
we're gonna say what assessment fix
top:0 left:0
right zero bottom zero so that's going
to do is it's going to make the whole
thing the whole page the whole div well
the section so we completely the whole
page so now with z-index we make this to
be let's say set so now it could be on
top of everything so I want to click on
the button this was gonna turn up right
it's gonna change like this okay and
then now here we're going to say
something like this X menu and hold on
now I'll add then we're gonna do and I
say display flex okay we got a command s
a slave flex align items is Center okay
there you go
so it's centered okay now we're gonna
come here say nav let's play block I
mean it should be this play block
already well yeah so it should be
already display block but we're gonna
come here say nav with let's say 400
pixels okay and we're gonna say justify
cards at the center okay so what that's
going to do is going to Center
everything for us okay now let me see
see if this thing is really centered yes
it is but now the text inside of it
one each our anchor tag to be
display:block okay
and there you go oops go back
okay now the next thing that we want
this thing's still not centered we want
it to go and become text-align:center
okay now for this we're gonna say font
size three room we're gonna say padding
say one room see how that looks
it's a little bit a little bit too crazy
right let's say two point three rims
it's not that bad okay two point three
rims
okay one two three four let's say
text-decoration:none color we're gonna
say is white okay
for now we just gotta say however is
going to be color let's say color five I
think yeah that works okay cool yeah so
that's the menu something simple nothing
too crazy okay what else we want to do
here
we need a X right here to close it so to
do this what we're going to do is
where's the goals BTN def a hamburger
okay so that's the hamburger icon hmm
okay let me see position C hamburger
icon we're going to put a z-index eleven
okay all right and now next thing that
we're gonna do is we're going to
actually do something crazy that for you
guys probably got like what so we're
going to put in another class to this
home and basically whenever we have
manual active ok whenever we have many
active this is gonna change instead of
bars it's gonna be times ok but
currently I mean you're not gonna see
that now you're gonna see you later on
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
set up some things that let me see how
are where is it it's the main menu ok ok
cool
so this how the menu looks when it has
the class menu active ok so you're gonna
do it like that and then we're gonna
change this hamburger icon so many like
COD okay we're gonna find where it says
hamburger icon you see where is there
and change it to menu icon okay now when
menu active when the body tag has menu
active this menu is going to show up
okay but currently right now what we're
gonna do is we're gonna say top zero
should I do like that
yeah that's fine we're gonna say opacity
opacity:1 okay so we also gonna do like
a little animation so we're gonna say
transition or let's say transition I was
about the syntax transition I think damn
I forgot the syntax Oh God CSS
properties what how did I forget that I
know this but like by heart all right
where was it I can't remember it
I know it's like one one second okay yes
that's what I was I was missing so it's
all transition all for five seconds and
then ease in and out okay there you go
but that's why I just remember I was
like wait what's the first property okay
cool now let me see what else menu
active the menu is like this okay and
menu active oh I'm going to create a
nest so I could put this inside of menu
active okay now what I'm going to do let
me see what else I'm trying to do this
animation I have no plans I haven't
planned anything this is like straight
from the head okay so we got this top
zero okay and
and how does it look when I say okay so
many menu by itself is going to have all
of this properties okay so we're gonna
copy all of this stuff let's just copy
it
let's take it outside copy but if I take
that paste it here you take it aside
then we're gonna say now when we have
many active we have menu to be what was
it
top zero okay and for this we're gonna
say top 100 percent okay so you know
actually remove this left this left
right thing that I have here I'm gonna
say with 100 percent okay
so 100 percent height 100 percent well
we gonna say top:0 bottom:0 okay that
works and then we wanna say translate it
is it transform
yeah transform and then translate 3d now
I can't remember that property translate
CSS translate through the CSS alright
you know it's always good to check it
out okay so that's what I want X Y Z
okay so what I want on this is to be
100% now I want this all to be 0 0 and 0
let's see how that looks that's fine
let's say if this was 200 pixels yes I
see see you start seeing things animate
if you didn't see that
let's do it one more time let's say 0
here you can see there you go so we're
gonna say 0 there when it's active now
when it's not active we're going to come
here and say negative 100% ok negative
100% with a hundred percent top:0
bottom:0
okay
so now what happens if we remove this
thing right so there's what we're gonna
do with JavaScript later on so it's
gonna be something like that and then we
say man you active save okay and then it
comes from the side now let's see it in
action
okay let's remove this there you go so
that's what we want and then when we add
the class menu active what happened
there oh I put on the wrong place that's
my fault
it's right here in the body class okay
there you go
now technically we're gonna say x yeah x
so technically when the menu is active
right when many active shows up we want
x to show up so f8 x so let me see home
CSS it is the regular menu okay
now this one we have menus active and
then we want to put in icon icon section
we want to say F 8 f8
white okay of af8 there's a menu can
many like on so this menu icon and there
you go so that's what we want
alright so we don't control that with
will see us well know CSS and JavaScript
together like when we click on the
button here it's gonna remove many
active and then it's gonna change from
f8 x it's going to say that fake I
forgot what was it F a hamburger
something like that FA bars okay so I
mean currently we already have
everything that we need
alright so let me remove this for now so
that was our menu right our menu the CSS
is done okay we're good as you can see
everything is there it's working
perfectly exactly how we want it all
right if we want the menus to come back
we're gonna add the class menu active
and there you go you got your menu okay
cool now what's next I believe we're
going to jump on to other pages cuz this
is probably done by now you know what I
want to change this instead of a white
box I want to change that so be by
saying here where is it
or says logo where is it look okay we
gotta say Jane okay make sure okay for
some reason it didn't refresh okay
so Jane there you go now let's come back
to this where is a main.css
where does it say logo logo
says down the home
okay so we got logo here and what we're
gonna do is we're gonna change this to
water five pixels solid white okay we're
gonna say display flex let's say display
flex what else just a five content
center vertical line
I don't align the aligned items Center
and there you go we have that centered
now we're gonna say font size say for
ramp okay color white say line height
zero so that's how it is so this text
you see there's a issue with this text
this text has like a space on the top
that's bigger than the one at the bottom
which means we're going to have to
expand this a little bit and those like
130 now it's not 100% centered because
of this stupid text see how we have that
space smaller space at the bottom then
on the top now make this a little bit
smaller maybe that's the sweet spot okay
so what else we want to do to this you
got flex line height height as we move
to happen the height yeah okay issues
let's say instead of 130 let me see and
it's just Tula and then bring this to be
or 50 okay that looks nice that's
actually looking good right there cool
this was a productive 30 minutes all
right now we're gonna move on from this
and we gotta jump to the next thing
