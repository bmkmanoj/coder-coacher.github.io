again man listen alright so we're gonna
talk about you know sure you guys nerve
wordpress in 2017 and i will say yes go
ahead learning look on youtube go on on
you to me take a course on udemy about
wordpress or you could look online or
youtube if you find something good that
you know actually suits your style of
learning i will say yeah go ahead man
you know why because there's so many
small businesses out here like you know
it could be a bakery it could be a
restaurant could be anything you know
any type of business or even though
friend of yours that might 1/2 a website
you know but they don't have the money
to actually pay for somebody to go in
there and build the full website you
know from the front end to the back end
and you know create a custom website so
sometimes just using wordpress will be
enough you know why because it's like
you save yourself the time you know with
plugins like you know you already have
stuff like galleries a blog all that
stuff is already built into wordpress so
see ya go ahead and learn him and like
there's so many jobs out there that
pretty much they asked for experiencing
wordpress and any type of experience and
teach because WordPress is actually
pretty easy it could probably take you
like I don't know maybe a week and you
can learn WordPress of course like
everything else you have to put in that
time to be able to master it well once
you got your hands on it like it's
pretty easy you're gonna be good trust
me just make sure that whoever you work
with you know that how much work you're
supposed to do because a lot of times
people that uses on well I want you to
use WordPress or people that I want you
to build a small website for them they
don't understand the time that it takes
so they might say hey
you made me just a website with images
about my my blog or whatever and then
they'll be like oh can we add a forum oh
and can we add you know social media
thing and can we keep adding so next
thing you know you have a project that
was supposed to take you to three days
now it's taking you a week two weeks so
a lot of people are pretty cheap in the
sense of like how much they want to pay
for a wordpress site which is also a big
problem because you know you might go in
there and do work for like three four
days and the person only wants to pay
you $150 or $200 in you're like wait
what I just put in so many hours that on
that up it's like wow I'm working for $5
an hour now make sure you you have a
nice scope of the project and you can
actually tell the person ahead of summer
hey once we write this scope this is
final this is not gonna be constantly
adding to new stuff and new things that
gets added to the website basically you
gotta pay me for it of course you gotta
say in a nice way in a way where the
person's gotta feel comfortable but at
the same time just be honest and be
clear where everybody don't don't do any
work for anybody for free and don't bust
your ass for two three dollars anyways
