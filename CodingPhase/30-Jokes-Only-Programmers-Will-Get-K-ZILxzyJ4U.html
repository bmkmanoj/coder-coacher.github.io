just found this on hacker noon man I
love this this website man so I'm
reading this so basically 30 jokes only
programmers will get all right so this
is the statement a user interface is
like a joke if you have to explain it
it's not that good and it is front of
you know why because if the user
interface you have to explain it and you
gotta show people I hate Co Preston's go
do this and that go doesn't that that
means you must stop already
you already did something wrong and it's
like it's supposed to be simple like duh
all right
this weren't a message from processing
sketchbook folder disappear the
sketchbook folder no longer exists
process was switched to default
sketchbook location and create a new
sketchbook folder if necessary
processing will then stop talking in the
third person
all right here's another solution
another solution for iPhone X scrolling
embracing the notch all right you see
what was happening it's like because
people are pissed off right now about
the new iPhone X that it has this thing
and it's like it doesn't continue it
doesn't show this area and it's like
okay so what do you want the the text or

loop if I go to n I don't even know what
language is this then PHP for I equals
$1 I 100 okay it's just a for loop I
didn't get it okay there's also the
follow follow up copying code directly
from stack overflow how to actually
learn a new programming concept
essential changing stuff and seeing what
happens exactly
I'll be telling people like how do you
how do you learn something you basically
change stuff and sees what happened like
I do that all the time guys like I want
to learn something new
I watch it tutorial I do it have an
instructor does it and then from there I
go and I just basically take my time and
just break it change it around do below
this and that and then that's how I
understand how it works all right let me
see adventures in code review we do not
need a 60 we do not need a 68 year timer
you can sometimes people make mistakes
sometimes people put in numbers and then
they don't realize what the hell you're
talking about you're like wait you just
for 68 years like what's wrong with you
whether you whether you to meet so what
are you to meet at the office at
Starbucks get up
