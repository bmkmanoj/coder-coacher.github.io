all right so we got Tommy we got we got
the whole squad hold on you send me an
mp3 I don't know let somebody sorry my
fault
84 music I got you
I just saw that your B trainer are
missing cool so we're gonna start it up
with Tommy you're gonna start it away
Bobbi
hey let's get it in cool let me see
where stuff I'm gonna start sharing my
screen hold on I got a delete a couple
of days private videos and and whatnot
now I'm playing I just gotta I gotta
find how to freakin make this thing the
screen to share I noticed a little three
dots can screen share cool we in here
unlimited all right so we got your boy
Tommy which is cool that he put it
upwards on github pages I appreciate
that
um let me see so what we got here we got
search on is good you know the whole
layout of it looks pretty good you know
I'm pretty proud of what you got here
everything you got going on I don't know
can you guys see my screen yeah okay
cool um I will say let me see with the
intermediate project
okay we'll say oh I like the shadows on
it everything's good came out pretty
legit shadows are good the background is
good um let me see
grab yeah that's fine
the text I wish you would have made it a
little bit smaller and just more
consistent to the design but besides
that it looks fine and just the padding
it needs to have like a bigger padding
like you see this here that's a way
bigger padding that's like 45 pixels of
padding around it and here it barely got
any padding if it if it even has any arm
and then here to this also padding so
what you're missing out of this project
is mostly padding you know what else
okay this right here okay I'll see you
let me see let's try to just try this
out let's see I'm sorry I'm a little
busy
I usually just find like a who's on
Instagram that oh yeah kuchi let's put
coochie in here oh oh okay so let's get
her in here it's like half asian half
black all right so let's see how this
works okay well that's all right I like
it when it's AMI
well yeah cool so you got the doubt if
the JavaScript was good so you do your
thing oh let me see what else
um yeah just this thing right here just
I guess is just more about the details
on it but everything is functional you
know so definitely is really good I'm
proud of you oh did you have any
problems with building this hoarder
oh yeah piss me off I mean I've met you
got it
how was it how what was it that you had
problems with uh was it initially when
because not I built it all on jQuery
we'll finally using any of vanilla
JavaScript mm-hmm so then like when I
use a pen method it just appended
everything to one card
mm-hm so like it basically what's a
pencil tea and it hops onto the newly
created card and just doing that so I
just kind of figure it out
come on Chris my main concern all right
cool all right so let's see who else who
else is next who we got in here uh let's
go to April I'll show everybody put it
up on Gil I see you guys over here fancy
let's see okay is it me me three project
all right cool let's open this up oh
okay I like what I'm seeing cool you so
you got the design the borders outside
the shadows are good the buttons are
very crisp I really like this wait
what'd it look like
um they came out pretty good okay nice
and small and uptight all the color
could have been a little bit lighter and
the border okay how to make it exactly
like this but all yeah looks pretty good
ah let me see what else you got the
little the little star would have been
nice if you see like here has like a
little shadow would have been nice if
you want to guide that little blue
shadow
it and we can't see it though you can't
see it no I can't see it
alright let's see let's see if you can
zoom in up in this this thing no I mean
like there's no screen share oh my fault
my fault
alright okay boom going back cool so
what I was talking about was the button
looks pretty good everything the layout
outside leo is pretty good the buttons
here are great I like it the fonts are
perfect the fonts are definitely perfect
you really really put in time into the
the fonts and decisive so it looks good
oh I wonder what fun is this that's
clean okay cool you use that oh that's
good yeah cuz that's a pretty clean
clean fun let me see what else oh this
could have been centered yeah I had
trouble figuring that out
um if next time try to use a hike on is
the easiest way would be to use a
flexbox vertical centering action it
doesn't automatically for you you don't
even have to worry about it after that
so on let me see this right here just
the padding music needs padding um I
miss this is well you see like that's
definitely a pattern in there in between
okay for like those buttons oh the fart
could have been a little bit smaller you
can as you can see let me see what else
yeah that's pretty much it now let's see
let's check it out see if it's working
out
nah ah okay okay
not much um I don't
all right so what did you get absolutely
in JavaScript all right so everything
the design is perfect so you got your
HTML CSS hands-down
alright I mean so obviously I had
trouble like getting the members like a
to be exactly the example like all the
member names like it would only pull up
one as opposed to every car having
member name on it
okay oh I mean I created the form also
but just getting the two to link and
actually be functioning well that was
also an issue to me as well uh so hey I
need to learn more JavaScript Beth oh
yeah no that's fine that means you know
from the level where you got when this
thing started you definitely leveled up
this month you know is this whole thing
has been like what like three or four I
think it was like four weeks that we
started this thing so you I think you
you definitely level up from where you
was at before to where you at now and
that's what's important the progress it
wasn't to finish everything on the
project you know cuz everybody here's on
different members you know some people
even if somebody was still stuck on the
first project the point of this is to
basically level up and get to the next
level you know so from what I saw I
think you did great you know you
definitely improved your HTML your CSS
now you know what you gotta work on you
know pushing from here here cuz if you
don't understand everything on the way
up so now go from just straight prevent
tools you know understanding everything
for variables loops are statements
understanding the operators you know
less than greater than those little
things are basically the things that are
gonna help you out to learn JavaScript
so just focus on those things and you're
gonna be golden I mean I definitely give
you like an A+ on this you know yeah all
doing great so far you would tell me
definitely
so let's check everybody else let's see
who's in here oh who else we got Mack
let's see what my job
okay website live version okay let's see
what we got here
all right cool I see try to do it oh you
know Michael is responsive which is good
you gave it a try oh the style on it is
pretty good I like it
I wish this thing's here with a pink
fixed like as you can see I don't know
why it's like that I wonder how you put
it then you try to position it use flow
listen oh you I think all you have to do
for this was just say okay 50 percent
high-quality percent laughs and we can't
see it on the screen okay um sorry about
that
again okay so going back to it
so this one back up right so the layer
around it looks fine the shadows are
good I think the shadow was a little bit
too dark could have been lighter than
that the inside shadows are very good
the text I like this you see he made on
the background disappear so that's cool
did a good job there um what else
okay I'll see you cool so you try to ask
something a little something extra
that's good I like that definitely let
me see what else we may function if you
press the little fill a button there's
such functionality which one
on the to the left of that like the
little icon just yeah oh then you can
search by name cool okay I'll see you
so you've been pretty good on the
JavaScript side you really went all out
I like to the layout everything was good
it's just minor details and the the CSS
I don't know why it's coming out like
this and why why this thing is not
obviously open tasks mm-hmm yeah I think
you've got to work on the layout on it
because I think this was probably off OC
because you got it you info you use a
profile icon span okay that's good Oh
see I'm just trying to figure out why
this thing is not wrapping around it
it's just enough fix height on it the
background i'ma see you see okay yeah so
you try to do a fixed height on this you
you just gotta let this be automatic you
know let it be auto you see how it's
good it's just pretty much just a CSS
the JavaScript is good just gotta work
on the CSS a little bit more to make it
a little bit more tight well everything
looks good everything else is good so
let me see let me put Karrueche okay
Dada so let's see ah I wanna see thanks
for us I'll collect it cool okay so um
added validation which um checks it for
symbols in the handles and it also
automatically adds the accidents with it
okay
also then you're missing a little
message that says hey no no singles why
it's fine you could add that but yeah
like a mix nice all right
and a little fade I like it
cool and I like that you made it that if
they click outside it exits it that's
good
and then another minor thing is where it
says the team members in the top the
number changes depending on how many
cards you've added on the left side but
all the stylings nice little bit all
right I see you man
I like it everything on this is good it
shows that you know you're getting very
comfortable with JavaScript it shows
that you understand what it takes to
take it to the next level and also just
the only thing that's really missing is
just minor details on the CSS you know
what you can learn just by practicing
just building pages on pages you're
going to master all of that you know
it's easy after a while the more pages
that you make in the more times that you
have to reuse different CSS tricks then
you're gonna learn that with charts all
right so as far as JavaScript you
definitely do your thing just on just
the CSS is just a little bit a little
bit wonky
dude because they just need to get a
little bit more tight but I could see
already that you know your programming
side has definitely improved just all
you need to do is just really work with
the layouts the way how you laying
everything out and also and on Mike
honest media queries and for to make
things responsive
look at our bootstrap not to copy
bootstrap but look at certain little
tricks that they use like they use stuff
like our border box or the use our you
know display table display I think
display table
I think that's the name of it where they
use those little tricks for CSS to just
make everything align it properly now of
course it goes go allow and say okay
forget doing it this way I'm just gonna
use flex boxes right equals to do it
like that and just to organize your your
your your CSS a little bit better but
all of that stuff is going to come with
the more you practice and the more you
build websites now the javascript is you
do your thing you definitely show that
you know you know the the way of you
know of programming you know it's like
how you made the the javascript did it
with vanilla you did a jQuery um I use
jQuery from image or Inlet alright
that's good let me see where's your this
loop through your little JavaScript I
just wanna I wanna be nosy and I want to
know what's in there you know see how
you are you organizing your your code
okay I started out in comments but um
people to look at but I didn't finish
okay cool put a lot of comments in here
see whether you know your code is pretty
clean you have everything organized yeah
definitely you doing your thing now
let's see let's see you boy can let's
see what can God why can't your boy
can't coming out of left field just next
take that all right let me see you see
what your boy got oh just going to Ken
right now oh boy you only know Kenny's
on the west goes a every I wonder if you
guys could hear the music in the back
man alright forgot about that
hey you didn't it is all right cool so
let's see this thing that's working this
cool okay you got the little images let
me see Tex ah
oh there you go about to have me creep
walking up in this bitch alright so so
go into this let me see
forgot a mute at cool alright so let's
go into this ah the research Oh what's
this was this this little dot um things
a picture this carrot alone on an icon
oh yeah yeah that look like I don't know
if that was there under the dark on the
designer but yeah let me see so okay you
gotta work on your fonts like you see
these fonts here
I don't know if in the design they were
serif and I don't know if you remember
serif and sans-serif is two different
things
this type of font don't wanta have the
little squiggly lines at the end of
every character
those are Coursera right II serovar are
usually used for newspapers or you know
for display display means like a title
that's when it's good for mostly all the
websites they use something called
sans-serif which is no squiggly not like
this you see it's just flat because it's
easier to read for the user right so you
know you could use something like what
April use which was a ladder from
on Google font or you can use something
like open sans or if you're in a Mac you
could use Helvetica so that's one thing
that I would say work on the fonts all
right let me see what else I like that
you put all our pictures in here yeah
that's not the squad all right
so now let me see what else so do you
get to work on JavaScript okay you see
Joe not in I didn't not only work on it
I try to but okay
ah yeah this I just didn't understand it
you know the whole the whole week I was
working on it cool I'm just a basic and
just just going back to like tutorials
and just working on improving on it okay
no I mean you you're doing good I mean
definitely from what you started at was
this definitely improvement classy you
know we could tell that you got your
your hands dirty inside of the
JavaScript you know most people on they
still stuck on just CSS so for you I can
see that you actually went in there you
know you try to do as much as you can
you know also I would say um you know
just try to clean this up you know even
after this this episode this last
episode finish this project clean it up
and just like try to make it as much as
possible okay as we got here you know
what I mean so pretty much I think you
got a lot of the basics down it's just
about the the font sizes fun colors he
is just like you know the details but
besides that you definitely got a lot of
them done you see like you got
everything everything wrong here it
shows me that you you know the layouts
you know you understand how they have to
work and you know how to break things
down yeah now all you need is to mess
around with the CSS play around with it
a little bit more yeah I mean what I did
over the week is like I try to mess mess
around with the code but then like the
CSS code but in the end I try to do with
the JavaScript is it just mess it all up
the JavaScript so you know I mean all
you gotta do is like I said you don't
have to finish everything it's just to
show improvement show that you know this
whole project this whole experiment was
to just get people to code and then not
only that that a lot of people that are
watching this right they're gonna be
like oh man
I'm just like him like I got one of my
other friends who are another viewer who
I'm actually tutoring now and he was
like man it was really good
watching those guys because I could
identify with them you know I'm at the
same level as them you know what I mean
of a lot of people in here so it's like
it just gave him like you know like
you're not nothing hope but it's just
like it show him like other people are
going through the same thing they're at
the same level you know and it just
takes time the more time that you put in
the more you're gonna improve everybody
here if we go and we go back to the
first project on that first week we all
gonna be like yo like there's a big
difference from where everybody was at
at that time you know it's like some of
you guys were missing how to do things
in layout some of you guys were missing
how to work with fonts images gradients
but now it seems like all of you guys
understand the basics of those things
right and that's why we we created this
whole program this whole mentorship and
it's just like you know I wish it could
have been more like hey I'm right behind
you guys all the time and just be like
hey do this move that and you know at
the same time on this like just like you
guys busy
and you know working like 30,000 things
on this channel so to say that to say
that how much you guys improving this
month is like you know I'm amazed and
I'm really happy I'm proud of what you
guys have done this month and yeah man
like
this is crazy like you know animal
like yeah older your thing creaking Matt
came and killed it with the JavaScript I
didn't think he was gonna go in there
that hard
the kids are search features die
validation damn mmm bout to take my job
it's gonna be like you're coding Mac
make sure you sign out to the getter
make sure you hit hit me up you know
that means though but yo and you know
like April you do your thing to menu you
definitely improve your ear page you
look really good
I really like what you de you you
understood what you need to work on on
the fonts you made everything nice and
crisp the buttons were really nice and
crisp now it's just about pushing
yourself forward getting this javascript
this is just you know the basic just get
the basics done understand the Dom now
that you understand how CSS like with
CSS and you want to say hey I want to
target this um this front here this
paragraph inside of this div once you
know that then you're good because then
you understand how the Dom works you
understand that you know what's inside
like let's say when you have a div a
paragraph inside of a div and you say
okay this this div has a class of a
header and then inside of it has a
paragraph name menu and if you know how
to target that with CSS you already got
half the battle and as far as JavaScript
because a lot of people don't even know
how to target those things so with
something like jQuery or even in vanilla
JavaScript you're gonna be golden now
it's just about knowing that you know if
statements on loops understanding
variables on data structures like
objects are raised all those things it
might seem like a lot of things that you
got to learn but I can guarantee you
that you can learn all those things in
one day take one day it doesn't matter
it can it doesn't have to be today take
one day this weekend on a Sunday go and
search either through the course phone
um you know this guy coat steal or
search online on YouTube search was this
guy's name learn code Academy search
JavaScript introduction to JavaScript
and you just watching that video will
get you up to the point where you're
going to be comfortable with JavaScript
because all you need is just to
understand like you know the variables
and how to do loops and how to add a
property into an object once you know
those little things this project is
going to be easy for you and yeah so let
me see your boy Tommy avoid Tommy you
did good son you know I thought from
everybody here is between I think you
know the level that I was at between you
and Matt yeah definitely you know
neck-to-neck
yeah both got I feel like yeah both are
really good and there's like what lacks
in Matt you have and what lacks in you
matt has so it's like even now like it's
really good how you guys have you know
captain contact through the chat and all
thrown through slack channel you know
stay in contact and you know this build
upon that relationship and just try to
help each other out those little things
of like let's say when Matt comes up
with the next project on his own you
know send it to Tommy be like yo tell me
what you think and Tommy come give them
some feedback do the same thing when
Tommy comes up with a new project you
know Matt what you think check this out
then Matt comes in gives you another
feedback so like that yeah I both help
each other out move to the next level
you know but yeah yeah all definitely do
your thing man I really really wish
everybody when it came to this last
episode because you know this shows who
like really really was interesting and
not saying that Baffin and rayon and
trail were not really into it but
because you know we don't know the
stories we don't know where everybody's
at
Oh freakin who got hit by a car we don't
know like you know the whole shebang
like we don't know the stories but at
the same time it would have been really
nice to come here and just be like hey
man just face the music pretty much and
good I hate this where I got up to
there's what I did that I improve that
I'd not improved because now you know
thousands of people is gonna come here
and they're gonna watch this video this
video get thousands of views you know
and people gonna be like man I was just
like him or I was just like her and then
you know he gave up or she gave up he
didn't get to show up she didn't get to
show up they probably gave up so it's
like why why would I want to continue
this if I'm on the same level as them
you know what I mean so the point of
this is to motivate others and help
other people that are watching this and
it's just like you know to some the way
they relate to you guys because
everybody is trying to learn how to
become a web developer and some people
might take this tool as a career some
others would just do it for fun some
others would just want to put that under
the wing and be like I could code if I
want to you know what I mean like these
people who are just gonna be just like
that because at the same time there's
also a fear of like men am I ready to go
for a job into you are people even gonna
hire me like even right now like to be
honest with you guys all of you guys are
a level where ya can get higher right
you know so basically to a junior on
general developer position yeah if you
go to or basically introduce ya will get
higher because is does the man is there
it's very easy to get in because a lot
of companies there's not that many
people who can code so what they do is
they're like you know what man we're
gonna we like this girl April she came
in you know she's very professional came
in on time you know you know what let's
give her a chance
let's hire her she might not be a
mid-level but you know what she got the
heart she already knows all her basics
let's invest into her hire her now
you know what April we got to hire you
an X amount of dollars it's a maybe it's
a hit compared to what you was earning
before but at the same time it's like
we're gonna give you it basically you
like a probation for the next three
months after that they bring up your
price on that you know they'll be okay
cool you've definitely improved you you
could do the job here's our you know a
60 grand 70 grand step that's it you
know because to tell you the truth I've
seen this so many times there's people
that leave boot camps that barely know
anything and companies hire them because
they freakin they need people it's not
about who's the most talented who's the
most smartest who's the best programmer
no people and company are ready to a
vessel on other developers and be like
okay this person has the skills that we
need just the beginning skills and that
will build upon that so for all of you
guys are whereof I see you guys to start
just send out your resume see who calls
you because you got a call you know like
say something about that cuz um I mean I
already start setting up my resume by
like 2 or 3 months ago and it's not a
great resume just maybe like my profile
and like a couple of websites and stuff
hmm but I mean I'm getting an interview
like here and there like maybe like once
a week
there's mean I'm hired yet I mean it's
tough don't get me wrong but I just
wanna be realistic with people out there
too I mean you could totally just send
it out and the worst-case scenario is
they just say no yeah you know exactly
so it's like it's like for me like I
always saw the story like when I first
started getting into this I was like man
I was literally ready like I was I'm not
going to make myself sound like I'm good
or anything but I was like really ready
to get hired at a high level by like
three months three or four months I was
like really good but I was scared I
didn't go to the job interview don't say
oh man they're gonna ask me a whole
bunch of math questions they're gonna
ask me a bunch of you know computer
science questions and it's like yeah
sometimes they do but sometimes
you know what I mean it's just like they
gotta hire you if you have the skills if
right now a company says hey can you
guys can you use come in and tweak our
pages change the menu or add this to the
paragraph change the tables on this page
can you do that ok cool you're hired
so now you just got hired for something
super simple you know once you're at the
job things get more complicated but now
it's cool because you're getting paid to
learn at the job because none of this
stuff nobody knows this by heart
everybody has to do googles everybody
has gotta get to the little Google's up
be like hey okay how do you do this how
do you do that how do you make this menu
disappear I still do it every day off of
my job like just today I was like I
haven't used jQuery and like eight nine
months and I forgot how to do something
jQuery and I was like you know how do i
how do you do this and I searched it
I've been doing this for like almost
five years now and you know it's like it
there's no shame to Google things you
know so it's like when you get hired at
a company it's more like hey do they
trust in you they like you they they
believe that you could do better and
yeah just start applying you know so I
want you guys to also do what I've been
telling everybody go on dribble find
five pages you're going to find a
restaurant you're going to find a
realistic you're going to find a digital
agency you're going to find a portfolio
and you're also going to find what was
the other one I forgot but this this
five pie of five pages that I always put
on hours promote here for people to
basically have on their portfolio like
hey I've built this pages you know so it
could even be another real estate
doesn't have to be just one realistic oh
I have two real estate pages just search
her on dribble get the design from there
build it from scratch everything from
scratch also you could use bootstrap or
you could use jQuery of or any react
framework whatever framework you want to
use but
have those at least five projects on
your portfolio where people will look at
it and be like okay this person knows
how to code because they don't care
about your background they don't care
about what's your resume say of like hey
I worked at this company I are freaking
I move boxes on Walmart I freaking do
deliveries for this thing like nobody
cares about that
what they gonna care about is how does
your website look how does your the
design on your website look if
everything is crispy meaning padding
meaning Fox meaning um layout wise if
everything looks good you're hired
it's like the same way how people say
was it
first impressions um whatever whatever I
forgot first impression matters or
whatever it that's how it isn't what the
velum if you go in there with a
basically a project that is halfway done
or like man I get portfolios people send
me portfolios all the time like Joe can
you can usually check my portfolio up
see my page you see what I got and I
don't even want to put it out there I
don't wanna even I don't even like to
respond back because they're that bad I
look at them so for everybody that's
sending me those emails asking me hey
Joe can you go through my portfolio the
reason why I don't answer back because
that's what a company is going to do to
you guys they're not gonna answer back
on this everything is topknot you got
understand this career is very cutthroat
meaning everybody's in competition with
each other it's super welcoming like if
your women your minority if you're a
freaking doesn't matter where you from
you could be a alien you just landed
there all year come come join the crew
you know there's no I would say there's
no like discrimination in this industry
so for everybody also ask me that how is
it to be black how is it to be a Spanish
how is it to be Asian how is it to be
the sin that nobody cares
your color colorless like nobody cares
about how you look
what's important is basically can you do
the job that's the most important thing
so for all of you guys that out there
and you have a certain scale and you're
thinking in your head I'm not ready yet
take it to the next level
so now to end this and a good note for
all of you guys because I know I don't
want to bore you guys but I want you
guys to now do those five projects that
I told you go online of course take your
time do it at your own pace but once you
finish one project you know put on your
portfolio make sure you have a dot-com
it doesn't matter what it is make sure
you have your name money so it could be
a Joe Santos Garcia or jsg calm or it
could be Joe SG whatever it is or you
know whatever is your name or your
initials make sure it's your name on it
and the title of your portfolio has to
be your name so when people google you
the first thing that shows up is your
portfolio because now you gotta forget
about resumes you gotta forget about all
the other things that a regular job has
like when you go apply for a job those
things don't matter what matters here is
your basically your presence online do
you have a github do you have projects
do your projects look good those are the
things that's going to take you to the
next level also to go to meetups
you know check online go to meetup.com
find out who's out there you know who's
out there in your community show up just
be like yo just go in there with your
little headphones and be like yo I'm in
here I'm part of the community too you
know yeah so you know it's like you're
my calling for April go to the freakin
spot you go over and be like I'm here my
name is April I'm here to kick some ass
and that's it
you know so just show up man and just be
part of the community and make sure you
do your projects and also just take what
I set in here improve
every day those little things that they
might seem little right now like France
padding you know shadows how you slay up
how you lay up things they're extremely
important because those are the things
that make a page look crispy when you go
to Google every every single load pixel
on that page they freakin test the
out of it when you go to youtube look at
every corner every padding on the page
it's almost identical it's like the
space between the foxes is perfect
everything looks good
you go to a professional page everything
needs to be identical meaner like oh
nice spacing spacing between the the
font spacing between menus buttons
whatever it is those things is what
makes the page look professional it's
not just a code it's about also making
things just look nice and tight and me
alright so yeah man
I'm really happy for you guys that you
guys got through this this was my first
experiment you know maybe somewhere in
the middle of the year or next year
might do another one um you know I'm
always here for you guys make sure you
subscribe make sure you like this video
make sure you show love to your kid man
you know what I mean like come on
alright so anyways May I want to know
what you guys got out of this what do
you guys feel like about this experiment
because people they send me messages
right now asking oh yeah what do they
think that they get anything out of it
like okay so you guys answer that yeah I
mean what I learned from this whole
whole project thing like just putting
myself out there and is working on the
projects and just uh you know just just
there's all the other errors and stuff I
began into it so nice nice nice nice
part is a time management particularly
when you're juggling a full-time job and
you want to venture on to something new
is going to take some time and carving
out time in your day to make sure
you can't work on that side project or
watch that tutorial or just practicing
the code I mean you can watch tutorials
all day long but you're not practicing
and it's pretty much useless yeah
exactly that's so that's a really good
good tip for everybody that that's
watching this because there's so many
people that you know they they come here
and they're like oh man oh I want to
learn this and I'm working a full-time
job and most of the time a lot of people
spend a lot of time on watching things
on YouTube or even watching me but
they're not putting in the time that
they need to do for the projects and I
know it's super hard when it comes to
you know
dividing time and saying okay which
one's priority like do i chill with my
partner today do I go to my friend's
house do I go and meet my mom in the
mall today or do I tell her forget your
mom I'm chilling today as I said to do
you know so they you have to when it
comes to code you have to separate out
time and say hey you know what I really
want this I know this thing is gonna pay
off it's the same thing like when people
go to college the same thing how when
people go to the army they the that time
is separated from everything else
they're like you know what I have to
knock this out and I I completely
understand super hard because when you
have a freaking irregular life if you
have a life out here you know you got
things to do it's even hard for me you
know it's like right now I don't code as
much as I used to
I have coding phase that current which
I'm supposed to finish but I don't get
to do because I'm doing YouTube and all
this stuff so it's hard to juggle so
many things at the same time and I
understand but for you guys that are out
there you have to know that you just
have to say hey I'm just gonna bust my
ass I'm not gonna have no social life
for the next three months give yourself
that time and you're gonna be good like
I can guarantee it you could do this in
a month two months three months to just
like make it nice and crispy you can
definitely do it it's just about you
just have to disconnect you have to the
skin
I can just be like you know what this is
what I want you know it's just the same
way how other people do it and I go you
know why man I want to go to the
Olympics those guys don't show up in no
way they're like you know what their
friends is out there you know getting
some dubs like a those guys is like nah
man I'm at the gym I'm here aerobics I'm
freaking running I'm boom what the
little sling they got done bit late so
when it comes to this thing you have to
take some time and give it to yourself
because from there once you have a job
you go to it you do this thing on your
part time you come home you you go over
tutorials once in a while but you gotta
get that job first so that's a very good
tip that you know April gave you guys so
whatever you met was good put your the
spot and then that you got a big think
of projects and then stick to them and
like aim for weekly bi-weekly even
monthly projects to like increase what
you were initially yeah no I definitely
definitely agree with you on that you
gotta have goals man you gotta set goals
you gotta be like okay if the next week
if I came in here and all I knew was
just how to put things in a HTML tag
that's all you knew which is like what I
told Beth to if all you know is to put
things into a HTML tag if you all you
know how to do is just say hey div
that's fine by next week I want you to
be able to put something inside of the
div so put in hi my name is Beth that's
it that's an improvement you know what I
mean so that's what I want for everybody
out here to just have goals have a daily
goal and be like hey today all I want to
know is what the hell is a variable what
the hell is a loop that's my goal for
today for the goal for the week should
be how can I make a menu how can I go
and make my images responsive every week
you should have
have a goal you know also to when you
guys are buying a course from you to me
or from anywhere make sure that you're
not just copying it you're copying
following whatever the instructor is
teaching you that but at the same time
on at the end of every chapter do it by
yourself on another page a private page
separated from the project that you're
working on was the instructor or whoever
you are or whoever it is on YouTube or
Udacity team treehouse whatever it is do
that project there finish it copy it
from what the person is doing it okay
cool this how you do it cool it this is
great
now once you're done come to the next
one now you're going to recreate that
same project but without looking at it
and now when you need help of course you
come back and look oh this how I did it
here that's how he taught me but you
have to take the time to also start
making it on your own don't just follow
what what's on the tutorial don't just
follow was enough on a video because
you're not catching it it's like the
same way how back in the days in school
you're liking sixth grade and the
teachers like okay guys bring out your
 pencils out and your number-two
pencils and your number two whatever I
want you guys to write some notes the
reason why they tell you that is because
when you write it write it down that's
just sticks to your head if you just
follow and you're like okay cool I'm
listening to the teacher I'm watching it
nothing is not gonna get stuck there you
have to constantly do it and then do it
on your own so everything could stick to
you all right now Tommy is do you see
sign Oh what you got is not a same thing
um basically what I got out of this I
mean you can learn all the tutorials you
want but if you're not putting knowledge
to paper or I guess knowledge to your
computer then there's no point in
learning it since everything is going to
be lost I mean I've done this a couple
times like that I feel like I'll just
quit I come back I just can't come back
but doing this it puts pressure on you
because you have to complete it you're
you're with
I guess some cohorts with you they're
doing it too so like I didn't know so I
knew Jake where I don't know like
working knowledge of jQuery so then it
was kind of I kind of had trouble doing
it but when Matt showed me like his code
I mean I was reading his code and then I
just dissected his coat and made some of
it some of with mine well that's how I
did it too like I just probably took
like one function that he created and I
just like took one line of code but that
line of code made like the world of
difference nah that's good that's good
so yeah it's like you know you just got
to come in here do your thing and just
practice it you can't expect to come and
try to learn code and do it like you
know tip so it's not like you're going
into the beach and you're like always
too cold no this is something you just
gotta say is cold it you know throw
yourself in there you know what I mean
but don't be tiptoeing into this thing
because then you're just wasting time
time goes by you know the opportunities
that you're gonna get here on this
career are amazing there's like the
golden age you know so the people that
getting now they're going to be set
they're going to be good and this is
just the beginning for your career as a
developer as a programmer so if you're
getting now you're gonna be good if you
wait until that oh man I'm away until
next year
next year you don't know how the economy
might be next year they might not be
hiring as many people as they are now so
after that they're gonna be looking at
how many years you really have to let oh
man this person only have two months of
experience we're not hiring
we the economy is bad we can't be hiring
people to train them right now you gotta
take advantage you got to get
interesting and just go all out because
it's like come on man it's like this
opportunity of a lifetime economy is
good there's a whole bunch of jobs the
economy is turning into a service-based
which means they're gonna need more
developers so it's like there's like
future proof the only thing that's not
proof that's not a guaranteed is
how the economy might be the economy
might not be as good as it is this year
to next year which means they're going
to be more selective they're going to
still need the developers but they're
going to be more selective of who to
pick now as a brand new developer like
I'm not even good I could still get a
job you know what I mean so try to get
it now that's it that's my only in my
last advice but yeah so let me see what
everybody says here and you see what
everybody got in here and let me see
what I what I what I what I would up let
me get in here
matter of fact I'm gonna put this okay
we got we got Lisa Cage in here we got
your boy beats you got Warren in here
you got FinTech um let me see we got
Frank Frank being a thirst bucket um let
me see what else we got whirring in here
what else what else what else is in here
we got voice Atlas we got your kid
greatness we got who else who else well
so else um even face magic is loser he's
in here
let me see who's in here who else um we
got Joseph your boy Joseph whoa your boy
Joseph is in here there's like one of my
very first subscribers one of the person
that you know believed in me
in this channel believe them what I have
for this channel the kid is is great man
God is on his side you know I mean let
me see let me see what else what I was
what else um let me see who else is in
here uh Frank we got what else who else
who else who else who else we got Jason
in here we got a lot of new people
that's what's up cool cool cool cool
cool man I
see a lot of people got some good good
info out of this and I gotta say people
man do your thing man take this this
video this experiment that we did here
arm thinking as an experienced man take
it for what it is learn from it and keep
it moving man keep learning keep doing
your thing man and you're at home ask
your boy Joe back at it again man coding
phase dot-com man we in here man so you
guys want to say anything before we
leave bye YouTube bye you too you know
you don't have no social media no
YouTube no nothing
yeah there's no way people could just
reach out and be like yo that's how do
you yeah no I think that also be like OD
coding phase jr. ah that's my boy right
there
the nice thing man he's a hustler he
knows what he's doing he's getting his
feet wet he bout to start making a
millions out here you dig Oh some work
for encoding phase let him catch it up
you boys nice man he's the last thing I
mean like I said you guys gotta put in
that word gotta get in this thing man
and I'm just really glad that we lose in
this together and you know for everybody
that's out here as you could see there
was there was seven people let's say
that there was seven people out of seven
people four people survived to the end
you know it's like Hunger Games out here
kid you know freaking cam came in check
trail real quick yeah about the game
you said hold on let me get that yep
get the out the game real quick our
strong arm hole quick hey I saw I got a
question for you Joe like like like five
years ago like like who who who
motivates you because I know I know five
years ago it wasn't my commercials of
this or you know like like I remember
yeah very good questions cool
me into this thing like I always say I
started with like what I was doing the
same when I was like 14 just playing
around same way how everybody out here
probably played around at one point
myspace whatever
back in the days right so that's how I
started Dragon Ball Z whatever but then
I never touched it I have no support I
have no support for my family I have no
support from a girl for who I had at the
time I have no support from my friends
all my friends will look at me like man
come on son get in this like you
know like I got hood Frank's like I'm
not this is not like I'm not coming from
like the you know freakin tip-top you
know whatever my friends is not shining
in Taylor my friends are like freaking
Deshawn and your boy Julio like that's
what I grew up back you know what I mean
so when I came out of nowhere I'm like
yo man I want to do this programming
thing they're like nah man that's what
the smart kids that's what I'm kids who
you know who got money you can't get in
that I was a cool so whatever I
started doing my my thing I was going to
college I was at the same time I used to
do music too and I was like you know
what eff this I'm gonna learn how to
code this was what I really wanted to do
cuz I was like man I used to go to this
this place there's no Starbucks right as
by the Starbucks and I will see all
these little kids in there on their
computers and I'm like man how the hell
am I going to school and gonna work and
those guys are still there you know
looking super nerdy on a computer with a
low last beer and I was like man I'm
trying to be like one of those guys
there so I said you know what I'm gonna
start coding I did one month in teen
tree house I realized that team tree
house wasn't teaching me how to build
webpages and I was like paying $10 a
month to constantly be looking on
YouTube constantly be looking on on high
colas coke atom e on Udacity udemy so I
was doing like a 30 different services
Pluralsight I also did - in other words
each
 they will just teach him and I hate
this is a variable this is a loop this
is a CSS property so what I did was you
know what man if this I found you that
all you to me I took a course from there
I took on the coat
I took coach course and I also took on
this guy Steven Grider's uh one of his
react courses and then I was like you
know what man this guy is really good I
can do this I took the whole courses and
then from there I just learned how to
make pages I got hired as I got hired
because I was just in similar with you
guys I didn't really know that much I
got hired and then from there every year
I get a little bit better I get I'm not
the best developer which I'm not trying
to be because I have a life I'm sorry
you know I have all the that I want
to do too you know but at the same time
it's like I improve every year every
single year I come in I you know bus
everybody says every company that I go
to
people look at me when I go to an
interview are going with my nose soon my
little thing you know talk to them hi my
name is Joe Santos how you doing
um yeah this and that whatever so I go
in there you know tippity-top right but
at the same time you know some people
might look at me and like man this guy
don't know anything this even people
that leave comments or online and be
like this guy doesn't know but the
reality of things is that I do know
because I can get top dollar for this
thing it's not like not everybody gets
paid good just because you you're gonna
go to the interview you got a show you
got a show that you could actually build
whatever they watching the bill you know
what I mean so my motivation was
straight up just to prove everybody
wrong and just say you know what man
this is for everybody this is for
anybody who wants to do it I wasn't
gonna you know I was gonna be just
probably an IT guy you know sure
the shitty ass shirt fixing computers
for lawyers because I used to work for
lawyers now just fixing their little
computers
that couldn't build my life I could have
stopped there you know what I mean but I
say you know what I'm gonna continue I'm
gonna push myself to the next level and
when I started this there was nobody in
YouTube there was like maybe one or two
people on YouTube that their tutorials
but nobody that I could relate to nobody
that could be like I wanna be that guy
know these guys from YouTube I wanted to
be like them like let's be honest I just
wanted to get my coat in and say okay
I'm gonna come in the right thing I
don't relate to a lot a lot of these
weirdos that do coding um and I mean it
in a good way I mean like you know
there's certain people that just don't
relate to but I could come in and just
do my job that's in I'm there for the
job I'm there for the experience because
I love coding but I'm not there to you
know be like oh my god like I
know everything under the Sun nobody I
have things to do I got a wife feet
I got friends uh you know I go to the
club I'm in there like this like I have
stubble you know so but that was my
motivation that's where that that little
rant that little story goes my
motivation was just to prove people that
I could do it and show people that
anybody could do this all you have to do
is just plus your ass and be passionate
about it you know give yourself three
months three to six months of just like
hey I'm not gonna have no social life
this is not gonna you know because it's
hard when you're working full time and
during school or doing whatever don't
have social life you don't need it for
those three months six months you don't
need it in the long term the things
gonna pay off it's gonna be like oh man
like you know it feels good to me I'm
 paying for my house
paying for a new whip like just like a
few years ago
this is so crazy I'm paying $800
for my car that's how much I
would have to basically work like two
weeks to get $800 now that's what I
would get in three days so it's like why
wouldn't anybody else out here who's
having jobs
try to change the lives and and do
something positive you know what I mean
like you guys could do it and just go
about
that's my last message super quick
follow-up question then because I think
I mentioned it maybe in the last video
about how when you were teaching
yourself to code you weren't working at
the time
can you tell me how you got here dad and
how you made a working group well I
started I started a toilet 25:24 going
to 25 right so at that time I still live
a little mom's which kind of sucked
right so um still living with her um I
would help out with things here and
there but it wasn't like I had a kid or
had any responsibility so I said you
know what I'm just gonna learn this
thing so that first month when I was
doing some treehouse I did team
treehouse the whole thing the whole
burning stack that they had they had the
whole front what I think they called a
uh I don't know if it was front and
stack or JavaScript full stack something
like that I forgot the name of it but I
did the whole thing everything from HTML
to CSS JavaScript I learned the basics
but then from there I didn't know how to
build pages and that's when I started
looking everywhere else is like how do
you put all these things together
because it takes time you know what I
mean so how did I do it you know with
just staying home it was freaking hard
like I'll tell you the truth it was like
a extreme month month two months cause
it's like after that on top of that I
had to freaking going and get a job and
and start applying for jobs and
like you know getting I was getting like
40 something 40 grand I think I at the
job that I was in and I left it alone I
said you know what I'm leaving this
because I'm I'm not looking to make any
more in this company I'm trying to leave
from here and get something cool so I
left that I was without a job for a
month then from there I went and started
working in a job for like $13
I think $14 an hour which isn't you
know and
it was just basically to pay for me to
get to the job but once I got the job in
two months
I applied somewhere else and I left that
job and then I got 50,000 and I was like
what the hell like all it took was like
three four months of action of like
really getting into the industry
not knowing just like going you
know diamond and then um I got it go
ahead
I mean in and just like start applying
and then I got hired now I made more
money than what I basically took me like
two years to get an associate's degree
for you know because I had programming
systems which it was really systems
which is like IT work right so I went to
school for that and I got more money in
three months from working on this thing
you know what I mean I was like man I
could have been doing this thing since
like 18 19 years old now that's why when
I see a man I'm like man I am jealous of
Mac because I look at him I'm like man I
wish I would have been at that age I
would have been able to be doing this it
would have been like I would have been
blowing everybody at the box you know by
now who knows what all so that's how I
did it at that time like I took like
those few months of just like bombing it
being at home my mom was like oh
you're not gonna go to work I am you you
 24 years old huh
hey how do you get how do you get help
at the time idea where young like chat
rooms or nah I mean sometimes I would go
on sing treehouse form
most of the time will be like
stackoverflow right oh yeah it's like
it's not like how it is now I feel like
now you can find communities you know
you got meetups you got all of these
cool things back then like four or five
years ago there wasn't like a lot of
action around this it was like if there
was there was like I'll be honest there
was like some people that I just didn't
want to be around like you know this
site this is one thing that people don't
talk about in this industry like you see
all of you guys you guys are regular
people just you know regular
people are coming into this and they
really want to get into the
industry right but there's certain
people who are just like it's like high
school thing you know life is like high
school now imagine this we're all like
the regular kids in high school right
and like you know some of us a jock
somebody was you know the
cheerleaders some of us is just does the
cool kids with the brand-new clothes
then there's this little group in a
corner on the lunch lunch tables playing
yugioh right right
those guys they hate they hate the fact
that regular people trying to get into
this industry they hate that
because they told that this was going to
be something neat where it's like oh
this is too smart this for smart people
but they can't get it so don't side for
people I stay away from because I don't
leave those type of interactions because
I'm I'm coming in here I'm like you know
I'm so let's say like this I'm
professional I work well if you come to
me on some outside of work I
will slap the SH out of you and that's
how I know it's okay those cyber people
if they act like oh we're too smart to
let other people in we're too smart like
you
do you know how to do this this is a
paradigm do you know how to do this
 um how you call this st. trees
tree something whatever I forgot the
name it's like this people that just
want to act like like you have to secure
it to another like a it's a small niche
group right so me I definitely I don't
hang out with those people don't chill
with them so it's like for you guys
coming in as self-taught coming in as
you know regular developers there's
gonna be a lot of people who's gonna
welcome you that but you gotta also know
there is the small minority of people
who really think that they like the
smartest thing in the world am i that's
my advice I'd sell to everybody stay
away from those people because they're
not there to help you they're not there
to to make you a better developer
they're not there to give you a you know
positive criticism they're basically
there to
make themselves feel better in the sense
of like hey I know this and you don't
know it so now I'm gonna on you
most of those people don't really
advance so they just kind of just stay
there
I mean the most successful people in the
world they always keep learning
they keep learning books c.length even
like small little things from different
people regardless of if it's big or not
yeah exactly yeah but I'm just saying
I'm just putting it out there that they
are freaking people like that even like
this freaking guy saw a guy on the chair
or Franklin but he's one of those people
like literally they're not there to help
each other out they're not hit there to
help other developers they there to just
make themselves feel better it's like
you know I gave him a wedgie when I was
in high school you know they put him to
lock them up in the locker room and like
now they have that yellow chip and it
shows I was like I wonder the nerdiest
kids in school so if I'm one of the
coolest kid one of the cool kids when I
joined this group after we got to make
their life miserable that's how they
walk around so my advice stay away from
those nerds and keep doing your thing
then no that's a quick a quick little
rant you know yeah alright guys so man
this is great any other questions let me
know
it's the last episode kids take
advantage the idea is good it's fine we
did almost like half an hour what was it
and I wanna have um almost two hours in
here now and a half a day so we
definitely would go we definitely got
the squad um I'm just proud of that you
guys finish this and you know yeah keep
doing your thing and just keep pushing
forward man all right cool
everybody start oh man man I love y'all
stay supporting the K um yeah show love
out here man
make sure you subscribe make sure you
like this video man at the same time
like I was saying check the description
the courses are right there when you buy
a course you do help me out it's like
they gonna charge you ten fifteen
dollars no matter what but all you're
basically doing is like okay Joe sent me
here so pay him a dollar you know so
it's like they
the same but at the same time is
not even about that because if you go to
udemy.com and buy on your own time it's
fine to just buy your course it's
freakin boss your ass you know and just
take this serious don't do no
tiptoeing man don't tiptoe into this
thing's mom and just go all out give
yourself three months man if you can't
do this in three months then it's fine
but at least give yourself the
opportunity to say hey man I tried this
I went in I went to interviews I got
hired and then if I didn't like it I
left the industry and peace you know so
yeah man I'll see you guys later
yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
