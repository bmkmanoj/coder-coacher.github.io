back at it again coding feats calm your
boys back and out and did it again
alright so how does it feel to be a
developer that first week right when you
become a developer and you get higher
that very first time how does it feel
I'll be honest with you guys is very
nervous situation like for me I was like
I was pretty nervous because number one
you always gonna have imposter syndrome
even though you know how to do something
you always gotta doubt yourself and be
like oh man I don't know if I can do
this I don't know what they gonna ask me
I don't know if they're gonna make me do
something that I've never done am I
gonna fumble and I gotta be like you
know type in something and like
somebody's behind my back and I'm gonna
be nervous can I focus like that those
things are definitely gonna go through
your mind right that's one so what
you're going to be doing is pretty much
the whole week it's just setting up your
local environment to match whatever the
company is okay so they might come in
and actually hey what do you prefer
do you prefer Windows or Mac right then
it's up to you to set up the system so
they'll tell you okay here are our
credentials
so whatever big bulky or github
you know this our repo cloning you know
let's say you're working on on laravel
they're gonna tell you hey and stole map
or you know a homestead or whatever they
use then from there after you set up
your local environment you're going to
be giving small tasks of just looking at
the the website or the web application
get familiar with it
understand where everything is as the
controllers how things are working
pretty much just play around with the
website right then from there your next
step is going to be
so pretty much they'll give you like a
little task right a little task to see
at what level you are I mean do they
need to hold your hand the whole time do
they need to basically just give you a
task you're gonna get it done cuz you
already have a lot of experience with
that framework work that program
language or whatever it is right so
they're gonna give you a small test
something simple see how you react
of course this right here is very
important because in my dictate the way
how people will look at you which is the
the far boil it will make you nervous
because you're like man if I don't get
this first task done properly then I
think that I saw that I'm a horrible
developer that I don't know what the
hell I'm doing
so all those things are gonna go through
your mind you're gonna be pretty pretty
nervous about it
now do you have to be nervous yes and no
I mean yes because it's your first time
no because they hire you you know what I
mean like they already believed in you
they already believe that you can do the
job so now it's just about getting
familiarized with whatever a system they
got you know like
how they push to live how they you know
how why exactly is it that you're gonna
be doing are you're gonna be doing more
front end I'm you're gonna be working
with more in the back end like those are
the things that in reality you're gonna
be doing that first week so you
shouldn't be worried because you already
know that they are you for a reason they
want an extra hand they need the extra
help so now it's all about you're just
getting used to their process and
understanding what the hell they do how
how they work so just take it easy don't
stress it too much just relax chill and
you will be fine
it's just it's just the first week man
the first week is always hard especially
because you don't know how are your
coworkers are you gonna enjoy working
with them are they gonna be you know fun
people to work with because like it or
not being in the office for eight to
nine 10 hours a day is exhausting
right so if you're gonna be there for
that long it better be with somebody
that you enjoy working with you know
what I mean
so yeah man you already know simple joke
