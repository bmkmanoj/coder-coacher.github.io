at it again man coding face calm and
live alright guys so today we're gonna
talk about how to charge somebody for
freelance work especially when you are
junior developer right so this is very
simple charge for what your work is
actually worth don't charge nobody you
know ten thousand dollars if you know
you only have two months ahead as a web
developer right charge them a decent
rate right so you look at how people are
charging in your neighborhood your area
your city and basically make an
adjustment and say hey I have two three
months actually of what development and
then from there you say hey okay so if
they charging $20 per hour
right charging 14 because you gotta
understand this is the beginning for you
guys you guys don't have no experience
in this and people who actually read
that you know don't come out of nowhere
gonna hate there's guys charging 50 $60
an hour when in reality you can't
compare your skills cannot be compared
to those guys cuz they've been around
for 20 you know you know for like 10
years and been developing in companies
and then now they decided to do
freelance work that you guys cannot
compare to those guys now why would I
say hey charging you know $14 an hour
right well you want to get them hooked
in so pretty much what you want to do is
basically you give up it's like giving
them a little freebie at first and then
now that I oh yeah this person is really
good then next time when they come back
to you for another job or they want to
do anything else on the website you can
today I'm gonna hey buddy prices don't
wind up I'm hot out here and a lot of
people want my talents and they want my
skills
so now prices don't went up you got $14
before but now you
looking at 18 20 23 24 that's how you
basically started getting you know your
clients that's how you start going up on
prices like right now somebody comes to
me and tells me hey we want you to do
something freelance work like I'll be
honest I'm not going and it can be low
forty-five fifty dollars an hour and
that's like too afraid and I'm just
being honest
I'm not going below that because that's
why I'm already making at my job if I'm
getting a good amount of money I'm not
gonna be going below that you know even
to frighten it's like you know I'll be
honest with you guys
don't do no work with no friends because
it's hard our friend might come up to
you but I hate man I only got five
hundred dollars for you can you help me
out and then because he's your childhood
friend and you know him for years
you come out of knowing but I know every
night okay I'll do it for you next thing
you know this project is like a
two-month project and you're doing
everything four hundred five hundred
dollars that happens to me all the time
like that's why I constantly now what I
do love it I bro like I'm tired from
work I just some straight up like down
I'm tired from work I can't do any work
for you right now
you know I'm booked or whatever and it's
not because I want to be a bass hole to
them but it's because they don't value
the time that I put into the work so
pretty much that's about it you know
like of course also too once you get to
a senior level me myself are I don't
consider myself a senior about what I
have all the qualifications everything
that I look at you know a job openings
where it says senior level developer I
pretty much go like this check check
check check check
I have all of that but me without for
myself that title probably not because
being a senior developer comes with a
lot of responsibilities that I don't
even want to have you know what I mean
so I really just be like hey I'm a
developer you know what I mean I'd
rather have that that openness and that
that space to
if I mess up or if I decide to do the
work or if I decide not to do it I have
that openness when you are singing
developer is like you have to actually
you know get a lot of responsibility so
like let's say you might see a front-end
job on that front a freelance job that
might say hey we want a senior back-end
developer when you get hired for those
types of positions they're looking for
somebody who's been doing it for years
and there's basically no no space for
errors no space for anything you know
what I mean so a lot of times for me I
don't think the pressure that you get
from those type of projects I don't
think it's worth the money I don't
