boy Joe listen coding phase comm make
sure you subscribe and make sure you
like this you know freakin video man
alright listen we're going to start with
the MVC model the only way for you to
move on to the next step in learning
Adonis Jas and nodejs is to understand
what's the MVC model right model views
controllers right so let's see this is
how it works right let's say it an
example you come to facebook.com right
you go to your Facebook when you come to
your Facebook basically the route tells
to controller says hey I landed here
this person landed here right so when
they land there a controller gets
triggered right and it says ok now we're
using the homepage controller for
example right and then from there let's
say somebody comes and they like ah you
know I'm the click like right that goes
to the controller that notifies the
controller and basically from there that
gets saved in a database so when that
happens that goes to the model right and
then the model comes back and notifies
is the controller and says hey I saved
this to the database now show them a
notification you know just like this you
click here click there and you get a
little notification that says hey you
liked it right so to make it easy you
know think about it like this you land
on a page right a controller gets
trigger right that updates the view and
says hey show them the about page right
matter if I showed them the Facebook
page Facebook home page then from there
the person sees the Facebook homepage
they clicked or on a like button that
goes to the controller again and then
from there the controller has different
actions Justin you know for whatever the
situation is so let's say an example you
click the like button or you send a
message each one has its own method
inside of the controller right
so which is just a function so then from
there the controller says okay this
person liked a post then from there goes
to the model the model this is your
database this is your my sequel there's
your nodejs your Mongol a MongoDB our
that's where it gets saved this what
deals with the database all right and
then what it does is saves it it says
okay this person user Joe liked the
image of Kuan right that's it then from
there the model after you get saved and
notifies the controller says okay it got
saved now the controller comes back and
updates the view and says okay this got
saved so pretty much it just gives to
user like a little you know sometimes
you see like a little green button or
you might see like a little hand or
something to notify the user that
something happened so back in the days
people used to just put all their colder
you know like do their HTML CSS
JavaScript on the database the logic of
the database now the logic of whatever
the action was the logic of where this
database is gonna be safe - they used to
put that all in one page right so what
happens when you do that it's just a
huge mess and it's like spaghetti code
you don't want to ever do that so what
now with the system of MVC what they did
was just pretty much separated
everything and you say okay we're gonna
have to view which is what the person
sees the controller which is the logic
of what's going on on the page and the
model which deals with the database
we're gonna separate each one all right
and now they have stuff like call mvv
see they have a whole bunch of
difference but the one that I really
like is this model MVC alright guys so
pretty much room remember that it's
gonna go from the route the person lines
from here we're going to put in a
controller which is gonna show up here
and then when the person like saw a post
or you know whatever the situation is
any actions that be taking it inside the
page is going to deal with it inside the
controller and then from there if it's
saving anything to the page or to the
database then we deal with that here and
the models alright guys
simple any questions let me know and
make sure you subscribe and make sure
you like this video man trust me I'm
doing this on a very high level like you
know it's like straight like not to dis
you guys like for dummies you know it's
like the easiest way to explain this
what I happen to you know give you
something super difficult in an alone
explanation of what it is all right make
sure you subscribe and make sure you
like this video
Wow make sure you look at the little
videos on top somewhere over here on the
page make sure you like that okay and go
in there and keep on with the playlist
all right I let me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
