man coding face.com your boy is backing
out and did it again alright listen
today's gonna be a very controversial
topic and I'm taking a stand here and
I'm gonna say this well
I'm choosing Ruby on Rails over Python
and what does that mean right like Who
am I well for those of you guys that
don't know me I'm a web developer I've
been doing this for a long time now I've
been doing this since probably 2011
we're in 2017 right now ending of the
year of 2017 pretty much I'm gonna
choose Ruby on Rails on this one all
right now this goes to everybody who's
trying to become a web developer who
basically is a self-taught developer I
believe the route for a self-taught
developer somebody who's teaching
themselves at home either reading books
either learning on udemy learning on
team treehouse Pluralsight every single
company out there even coding face.com
right any company that's out there right
it doesn't matter if you're trying to
become a developer and you're teaching
yourself there's a easier route for you
to get in to the industry by becoming a
web developer there's more jobs and it's
easier for people to get in okay because
smaller businesses they need developers
okay so once you in the industry that's
it you're in the industry from there on
every other job that you go to it
doesn't matter what college you went to
doesn't matter what high school you went
to
that's wiped what stays with you is the
fact that you work somewhere and you
actually been out here creating projects
all right so that's why it's important
and why I think is an easier route for
people to get into web development
instead of - it's off
Engineering software development or you
know machine learning etc you guys fill
in the blank on subgenres of programming
that's it alright so why did I pick this
topic today why are we talking about
this it's not a Ruby on Rails versus
Python it's not Ruby on Rails or Ruby
the programming language versus nodejs
golang whatever language you want to
fill out you know PHP doesn't matter why
am i choose rails in that Python well
we're gonna go into this okay I'm gonna
look into this thing because I just
spent a good hour and a half of going
over different states different job
postings I did the research right just
an hour and a half on each one so I have
about three hours doing this okay so
pretty much I say you know what I'm
gonna create a course my next course is
gonna be either and Ruby or rails or
Python Ruby or rails I love it and I'm
biased because it's probably one of the
first things that I learned especially
in the backend um in Python I love it
because is similar to Ruby and at the
same time it makes your code so clean I
love that about Python but I'm all about
jobs I'm all about the opportunity of
getting that job first all right
most of my audience are people who are
not college graduates they probably have
degrees in other fields but it's not
computer science right so that's the
first thing that I want to let everybody
know because you know this might just
bring up a whole controversy on the
internet but for some reason when I say
something it makes ripples throughout
the whole industry but it's just funny
I'm gonna bring this up so we're looking
for Python developers quote/unquote
Python developers there's a big
difference when you do a search of
saying only indeed.com
and you see Python okay
if you put in Python is gonna show
36,000 jobs out there alright we're not
talking about hey do they have any
description do they add it to you know
somewhere like a plus no we're talking
about
hey they hire in Python developers and
they hiring Ruby on Rails developers
okay it's a big difference between the
two all right now we're gonna go into
this one thing that you're gonna notice
if you do this search like this I mean
decom title colon Python you're gonna
notice that most of the jobs here are
really for software engineering and
machine learning all right now those
fields are not something that you could
just say hey I just learned this on
udemy in you know you to me is where
it's at hire me companies are not really
- or you know wanna give you the
opportunity that quick it's not that
easy to get those Python jobs because
you got to think about it like this
let's go into a little bit of history
Python has been you know it wasn't super
popular back in the days but it's always
been there now all the nerds they love
it we love it right
we love Python now the universities have
been doing something lately for I think
the past ten years a lot of universities
and colleges have been picking up on the
fact that Python is very easy very clean
and it's actually easier than C C sharp
Objective C you know F sharp all those
languages is actually easier for people
to learn so what they're doing is
teaching computer science just the
basics computer science we're
programming just the basics they
teaching it in Python a case of what
happens now now with time Python has
been getting more popular more popular
more popular more popular now what
happens with this is a lot of the
college students are doing searches
online in the searching for Python
Python tutorials pi
done etc you fill in the blank
everybody's looking for Python but what
happens is that there's really not a lot
of jobs for Python developers for people
who are self-taught people who are
looking for this online if you are a
computer science major
now you earn the you know on the same
Lane as everybody else the engineers the
software engineers you guys are fighting
for that position
all right you fighting for that position
everybody has a college degree everybody
has this dissing that those guys they're
fighting for those positions to get
those jobs right but one thing that
you're gonna notice here most of these
companies are not really doing web
development what they doing is software
engineer basically creating programs
creating on tools for for the company
itself or you know doing things like
that that is not really dealing too much
with the web you know it's not that easy
getting those jobs let's just be honest
it's not because the competition is so
fierce
out there that whenever a new job gets
posted out there everybody starts
applying for it like you know what I
mean it's like cockroaches you throw a
freaking steak
out on the street cockroaches and rats
is gonna go in there and try to eat it
up as soon as possible by the time you
get there it's probably just a bug all
right so that's what happens with Python
now on the other hand Ruby on Rails is
pretty much something about the web
right it's a framework for web
developers okay and one thing that has
been happening with Ruby on Rails for
the past few years is the search results
have been going down but the jobs have
not been going down for some reason you
know everybody on the internet have been
saying Oh
Ruby on Rails is dying Ruby on Rails is
distancing that and that's mostly
because they go buy stuff that they see
here know GS or like let's say for
example
stack overflows survey which is a survey
of other developers but they're not
doing a survey of the businesses they're
not doing a survey of the companies that
are hiring for this technology this
framework grooving or else they just not
you know what I mean like one thing that
you wouldn't notice here is I hate if
you do search results you will see hey
no js' is on the top and I could tell
you one thing when you search for nodejs
a lot of people are not really looking
for the back end of you know to use
nodejs a lot of people use the search
result of no GS for searching things
like NPM packages and you know etc all
right this everybody knows this this is
not a secret guys that more than half of
the people that use nodejs or MPN they
use it for the packages of JavaScript
for the front end they're not there for
the backend packages or they're not
there for no g8 nodejs itself they
therefore the packages right I myself
used MPM all the time on every single
project that I do doesn't matter if it's
in Ruby a Python a goal and I installed
nodejs in my computer and wherever I go
I do npm install right so you guys
should know that javascript right now
there's no denying javascript is hot you
know but you gotta understand javascript
is the front end it's always going to be
hot because you need HTML CSS and
JavaScript no matter what that's always
going to be hot and one thing that
you're gonna see Python is super high up
here okay and it has actually been going
over JavaScript and the reason why this
is happening is very simple when you
look online you search for Python you
gotta understand Python is a snake a
Python is a snake I think you search on
YouTube Python and they're showing you
snakes right now another thing that
you're gonna notice
is like I said Python has been very
popular in universities like everybody
that I know that have taken computer
science in the past ten years have had
to take Python alright
so in school they're basically telling
you hey you want to learn the basics of
programming do it in Python make your
life easier so all the students are
constantly searching for Python Python
Python okay now we look at Ruby on Rails
and we see you know nodejs is here it's
more similar to closer to remove your
rails
remove your rails is all the way at the
bottom that's one thing that you're
gonna notice as far as search results
okay and what does that mean this being
a complete decline of Ruby on Rails when
it comes to developers right all the
developers out here they want to be
jumping on the latest things they want
to jump on goal and they want to jump on
nodejs they want to jump on you know
even Python whatever it's hot out there
you know everybody's worrying about
angular versus react versus view but
what are companies looking for why are
companies out here hiring all right when
we come back to indeed calm you will
notice one thing for every job that
python has and this is quote unquote
Python developer we're not talking about
hey we added you to the description we
like hey we don't mind if you know
Python if you know Python C C sharp
Objective C JavaScript let you know how
HR and all this freaking recruiters put
in twenty thousand different
requirements or twenty thousand
different programming languages just to
fill it up because in reality nobody
cares about if you know what cyber
language you know as long as you have
two essentials and you know how to
program like you every other if you
don't web development you
web development in every single language
out there it's just about looking at the
documentation and learning the syntax
doesn't really matter but when we look
specifically into Python versus Ruby on
Rails as far as jobs and what's out
there you will notice that most of these
jobs are for software engineers they're
looking for people who are very
knowledgeable are very good with math if
you're not good with math Python is not
the place for you because they're not
looking for people who are self-taught
the idea that you might see this on a
udemy commercial where they say python
is where is that hmm like no it's not
where is that for a brand new developer
yes they have to promote that because
hey they're making money it's all about
making money it's not about you know
giving people the options and giving
people the resources to actually find a
job as soon as possible hey let's learn
Python it and spend the next six months
trying to look for a job especially when
you're self-taught and you don't have a
computer science degree yay let's do
that that's on you me on the other hand
I'm more of a realist all right now so
I'm looking at this you say okay 1,200
jobs all right there's two thousand and
eleven hundred jobs for Ruby on Rails in
the United States right now and this is
the same thing as in Python this is
1,200 jobs in the United States right
now we're not talking about hey we're
looking for a back-end developer and we
don't know exactly what technology we're
gonna throw at you but if you know a
little bit paid on is similar to
whatever we're doing here we can teach
you the language no we're not talking
about that we're talking about
quote-unquote Python developers versus
Ruby on Rails developers
Ruby on Rails is a great community in
every company that has invested into
Ruby on Rails knows that and they know
that hey if we do use Ruby on Rails
we're gonna get the best
the best and not only that people that
love to code you know most of the Ruby
or rails developers are not here for the
money they make a lot of money but
they're not here for the money like you
could literally tell you go to a
conference it's everybody's day is like
super excited for the language and you
know they just need to work man they're
trying to learn now Python is great and
I'm not you know I'm not talking bad
about it I'm there's nothing for me to
say hey I want to just persuade people
to leave Python alone I'm putting in the
facts here okay if you are a self-taught
developer somebody learning on your own
you know gone with Python is not the
best choice for you that's just being
honest right look it up if you live here
in the United States look it up now if
you live outside of the United States
one thing that you will notice is you
know there's so many jobs compared to
Python that are are moving or rails
remotely look it up goes to diced Congo
to remote comm go to remote okay dial go
to even Alera jobs you might find jobs
that that put on Ruby or rails you know
listen look it up Ruby on Rails jobs
versus Python jobs guys I'm telling you
right now there's a huge difference now
for the past 10 years people have been
trying to bring Ruby or rails down and
it's for a reason when Ruby or rails
came in Ruby and rails changed the whole
industry every single company out there
was like what the hell is this we're
using dotnet and all the cool startups
are using Ruby on Rails and it was for a
reason okay with Ruby on Rails you could
build any type of web application super
quick and efficiently right now
one thing that happened I don't remember
was 2008 2009 2010 around there
something happened Twitter came out and
Twitter was created with Ruby on Rails
then the creators of Ruby on Rails
realized that hey for the type of
website that we have using Ruby on Rails
is too slow we're gonna have a lot of
problem scaling it now one thing that I
will tell you guys is how many of you do
you guys think are going to create
something like Twitter bring this up
because this is something that you can
see here 618 million tweets sent today
by 9:56 p.m. Eastern Time you get what
I'm saying like how many companies do
you think are getting that type of
traffic that type of you know get and
post requests constantly how many
companies do you guys think that are
dealing with they're not that many guys
I'll be surprised if maybe 15-20
companies in the whole world are getting
that many you know get impulse requests
in the world so what happened after that
after the creators of Twitter or
probably just the team of Twitter saying
hey you know what let's change language
and I believe they change to Scala I
think I wanna I'm almost pretty sure
Twitter Scala yeah Twitter uses Scala
alright so they had to switch from Ruby
or rails to Scala so just because of the
you know the way how things work is too
many requests and they needed to scale
bigger and I'm not mad at them I totally
agree with them I think for something I
Ruby on Rails that might not be the
right
place for it why when they did that they
pretty much open up the gates to
everybody be like you know what we might
not use Ruby on Rails okay like
literally Ruby on Rails was on its way
to becoming and Ruby in general was on
its way to becoming the next PHP pretty
much owning you know let's say 50% of
the market the moment that happened from
there started going downhill as far as
you know companies popping up using Ruby
on Rails people say you know what we
might as well just stick with whatever
we have we might as well stick with Java
with which we already have we might as
well stick with yeah you know asp.net
which we already have PHP which we
already have so they're not gonna switch
up all right now who takes the risk who
are the ones that are creating new
companies usually is the the new people
coming in the new developers new
startups all right
till this day a whole bunch of startups
are still popping off with Ruby on Rails
because it's so much easier to build
things on the web okay now another thing
that I'm gonna say is you know we come
back here
and we look at this numbers right
throughout the whole internet this is
how many websites are out there you got
PHP 20% of the website are dumb PHP 8%
are Dinah dinette or you know zero point
95 percent are Rovia rails 23 percent
Python 21 percent or Express put those
two things together they're like a forty
percent aren't nodejs you got a little
something I say thirty percent are done
on on Python not even thirty percent
zero point zero point thirty percent
I dunno Python that's throughout the
whole world and that's fine because most
people are gonna use WordPress so PHP is
gotta win no matter what
but once we start coming in
say okay top 1 million we started seeing
numbers start going up one thing that
you're gonna notice is Ruby on Rails
don't drop from here
it just doesn't that little third spot
no matter where you go it's still going
to be there and come in we go top 100
okay now this is the sweet spot this is
the the place where 90% of a few guys
are going to get hired all right this is
the sweet spot this is where you're
gonna get those jobs okay you're gonna
see that you know PHP still dominates
asp.net you got Ruby on Rails Express so
you both of these know GS so no GIS on
the top 100,000 sites no js' are very
close to Ruby on Rails and this thing
can also be a little bit mixed up
because you could have no GS on your
server for whatever reason it could be
for automating something and pretty much
this application picks it up and says
hey they use Express hey they use nodejs
alright so that's to be clear alright
now we come to the top ten thousand
websites one thing that you're gonna
notice is Ruby on Rails is still on the
top and never leaves that third spot and
those companies are not going to leave
the language because pretty much it
works
Ruby on Rails works no matter how you
look at it it just works is as good as
great for the web it's a great framework
the language is beautiful it's easy to
learn it's just everything that a
developer would ever want all right but
we're gonna continue with this you know
let's say here on the internet a lot of
people just don't like this guy they
just don't like him there's a lot of
developers I just don't like and don't
like him his name is David Heine mere
handsome eh
he's the creator of Ruby on Rails when
we think about a typical developer he's
not the square looking developer what a
tight shirt and can't you know can never
can barely move super awkward in in you
know in different situations like this
is somebody who's very comfortable who's
very secure who has a very cool company
and I've heard this a lot of times guys
from other developers guys who in my
head I'm like man these people are crazy
for a lot of people that like man I
don't like Ruby on Rails because of this
guy and they say to themselves like I'm
so happy that Ruby and rails has been
going down but what they don't
understand is that just because this guy
is not your typical developer doesn't
mean or that the fact that he's a little
bit arrogant sometimes that's fine
listen I wish you know Bill Gates who
come in and took that issue sometime or
Mark Zuckerberg will come in and be like
hey guys I'm hanging here diving like
Mark Zuckerberg and throw like a billion
dollars on somebody like I wouldn't be
mad at Mark Zuckerberg to do that right
but this guy he's out there you know
what I mean he's really out there people
loving and people hate him
and I've seen there's a lot of times
where people be like man I'm so glad I'm
so glad that they don't you know that
Ruby or else is going down but one thing
that they forget is the fact that Ruby a
rail system amazing framework
all right so even if you be like hey man
you leave comments everywhere you go on
the neck Ruby on Rails is slow Ruby on
Rails is dying listen the numbers don't
lie man you know this is the new baby
for everybody
pythons been around since got no sweat
right it's been around for a long time
right so it's taking this long to get
popular with the cool kids
but one thing that you're gonna notice
is the jobs are not there for self to a
developer now if you're a computer
science if
you are a well-known developer if you've
been doing this for 10 20 years I don't
know what you was doing watching this
video because this video was not for you
and you know it right go ahead leave
your hate comment below I will
appreciate it
we know you have 10 years in the
industry we know your 20 years blood
we know you was doing this with haskó
and if we can pass Cowen and the whole
shebang and lisping yes great I'm
talking about
the people who are trying to learn
people who are self-taught everybody
wants to get into this industry now but
I'm not going to teach something that I
feel is gonna be harder for brand new
developers on my website one thing that
I noticed on my site right is about 70%
of the people start with HTML and CSS
which tells me 70% of the people on my
website are completely beginners and I'm
pretty sure that even when you to me
even a team treehouse all those
companies out here that are teaching and
other instructors are teaching they
realize that the majority of the people
are completely beginners right we can
come here and try to sell you something
and say hey man Python is where is that
hey man no js' is where is that I can
come in here and sell you that dream and
I could probably get more people more
subscribers more people to buy into my
courses but I'm not aiming for that type
of business I'm in here for saying hey
this person came in they got a job in
three to four months that's it that's my
goal that's my goal to say hey my
students the people who come in and pay
the hard-earned money
they're getting the best chance that
they can't out of me to get into the
industry alright so now this long video
is a 28 minute video and it's just
tell you hey the next course that I'm
dropping is going to be a Ruby on Rails
five and we're gonna do it with react
and that's how we gonna do it kids all
right
pretty much it's like a thirty minute
video just tell you that and I wanted to
show you guys with proof you know it's
like the numbers are there you can do
the research you can look it up do the
research and look it up what our Python
jobs looking for um you know how
difficult it is for a self-taught
developer to get into a company as a
Python developer and that's what I do
here I'm a web developer I'm not a
software engineer I'm not a software
developer the people that come to my
channel and my community they're not
software developers software engineers
they're people just like me and you try
to get into this industry right I give
them the best route the easiest routes
and get internet industry get introduced
to programming but at the same time with
one simple goal which people forget the
main goal is to get a job and be able to
survive by doing something cool and fun
all right
from there on once you're working you
can work on game development you can
work on software engineer you could do
whatever you want but once you get that
job my job is done and that's my goal so
if you like this video make sure you
like this video below leave a comment
tell me what you think I want to know
what the people think about this this is
real numbers this is stuff that you can
look up this is research that you can do
on your own I spent about an hour and a
half on both of them and looked at it on
where they are today on I'll give you
the date November 21st 2017 I did my
research look through a whole bunch of
websites look through a whole bunch of
different job boards and one thing that
I know this was most of the jobs from
Python they're looking specifically for
degrees in math
science they're looking for people who
are doing machine learning I crown
software engineer now if you don't have
that then what happens now you out here
competing with this same college
students that are applying for the same
jobs who at least have been doing it on
paper for four years before you now if
you want to do that go ahead you can do
it everybody makes their own choice and
everybody learns on their own way
but me personally I'm going to give you
guys the best route that I can give you
all right listen guys make sure you
subscribe to this video make sure you
like this video I'm here for you I'm
here for you I'm here for you right so
I'll see you guys later
if you love my channel if you love what
I do here go check out my website man
coding face.com pretty much literally
the coolest applications that you could
make out there I'm doing them on
different courses alright
I have you know get all access pass I'll
have learned HTML CSS by building a cool
social network react the quick and easy
way build a restaurant web app learn PHP
know des hommes
listen we could go in there man let's go
in there no js' jQuery JavaScript
framework hyper FGS pod GES SAS like a
pro terminal for developers build a
responsive web app future-proof
javascript object oriented programming
with javascript es6 es7 s8 any es that
comes out is gonna be in there let's
just put it like that lerigot like a
boss let's build an Instagram clone
let's build a Netflix clone Adam text
editor life after learning to code you
guys and all of that you can literally
say hey I'm gonna buy one course each
right you could do that or you could
just come in and get the all-access pass
you get access to everything for a
single price per month super cheap I
believe you could get it for $10 when
you use the link below
like guys it's up to you if you're
seeing this and you're thinking hey man
I wanna get into the industry as soon as
possible this is your best route man I
just gave you all the research that you
need and where to find it and make your
own research don't take it from me do
your own research look it up find the
different jobs and compare both of them
then you start noticing a couple of
things all right I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
