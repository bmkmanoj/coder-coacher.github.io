coding face.com your boy is backing out
and did it again we here we live man we
we chilling listen man we starting to
see a good man
a lot of you guys been hanging me up and
yeah I was like what the hell is Jo has
been like two days we haven't talked to
him see okay guys I was feeling sick for
like two days
you know it was one of those days but
your boys back now what's cool about
this is today is what the 31st tomorrow
is January 1st 2018 it's a brand new
year well you know brand new you know
brand new swagger for a year you know
it's a lot of cool things are coming up
all right now what I wanted to do is for
you guys I told you a few days ago I
haven't really promoted a or told
anybody but for some reason a lot of
people signing up to the website I'm
guessing a lot of people want to sign up
to the site and you know get the most
out of it especially for 2018 somebody
hit me up today like man I'm super
excited with this new Ruby course that
you got and yes I'm telling you right
now this is the most fun one for me too
because as you guys may know I love Ruby
like that's like my first love when I
came to programming because when I was
doing HTML CSS and JavaScript like
JavaScript is I'm like this with
JavaScript you're not I mean like it's
like a love-hate relationship
because there's things that's annoying
about JavaScript but Ruby just like it
felt like Colin it's like almost as if
writing in English so you know that's
something that you're gonna see that I
just I love it you know and it shows how
how good the course is coming out very
detailed and you know I got a lot of
emails from people that hit me up
they're like oh man I thought like you
know because
some people they they've they've gotten
to the point of html/css right and they
they became good they doing their course
they building their website they're
building their portfolio then they go in
and they try Java scraping they tried to
load your yes and you know for some
people the programming side of web
development not just of you you know
what we see with HTML CSS the page
itself but the programming side for some
people they think it was a little bit a
little bit more how you call it it was a
little bit more harder for them all
right because when you get into that
programming you're like oh man I'm it's
a little bit it's a little bit difficult
etc you know so cuz you got to start
thinking as a programmer somebody who
knows how to code you gotta switch up
your brain in different different ways
that you got to start thinking logically
like how you're gonna code how you're
gonna build this so with Ruby it just
feels like home right so a lot of people
are really enjoying it and it's great
because if you haven't really gone beep
into the backend right like yes we could
all build a page from the design like if
you follow the HTML CSS if you follow
the sass like you could build a page and
that's fine but knowing the back in
knowing how to program it's a little bit
different you know even with JavaScript
JavaScript has his own ways and you know
you start learning how to program
JavaScript but then you go to a DOM and
you're like oh man how you do this and
dealing with objects you get lost in the
sauce well with Ruby it's just easy it's
just like it's right in front of you you
know what I mean like it's almost like
playing English it's just logical thing
if you do this it does that if you want
to find out if if it's unique
you put that unique if you want to say
hey I want to shuffle this array you put
that shuffle like there's so many
methods are on Ruby that just makes your
life easier like some people they have
issues with with loops
you have issues with loops in JavaScript
for loop or for each loop in in pretty
much in rubies just that each okay so
you going say for every single one in
and this array do this you know people
are here that people have problems just
like me when I was getting doing the
hyukoh let's say when I used to get into
like coding in the beginning I was
having some issues with nested um like
moto or has a more - multi-dimensional
arrays I'm sorry
multi-dimensional arrays I used to have
an issue like looping over
multi-dimensional arrays but it Ruby is
so easy like it's just like okay that
each here that each there and that's it
I mean it's that simple
but you know a lot of people I'm
surprised you know it really does suck
when you know people online talk bad
about a language or they talk bad about
something and they don't know about it
it's like they'll be like oh man no PHP
is dead
Ruby on Rails is dead um you know
they'll say all this crazy stuff and
it's like do you do your research first
like I don't believe anything that
anybody says on the Internet because
everybody if they don't like something
there with all this sucks and that's it
that's the whole comic there's no
information behind it there's no like
you know giving you no info no telling
you like oh this is why sucks this is
all there's no jobs here there's no you
know I don't have no jobs in my area for
this that's why I don't like it
no they just come in and be like oh it's
dead it's old
oh is it sucks oh that's it that's all
they give you right but it kind of sucks
because then as a brand new developer
somebody who's getting into this you
come in and you're like you don't even
know anything period so you're listening
to whoever's online and talking about
certain things and you're like okay this
person has has done it before or this
person has more years than me so I
listen to
so when you listen to them and they give
you a misinformation or something that's
their personal choice like I'll be
honest all the things I could say like
is my personal opinion on it is like the
whole view thing like some people like
it some people hate it me personally I'm
like it's black like it doesn't bring
anything new to the table I don't think
that it is good but can you build
something with it yeah you could build
something with you but it's just like
why would I somebody who already know
react somebody who already knows angular
somebody that have been in the industry
for a while why would I want to use
something that that's the same thing as
everything else that I'm doing and it's
not bringing anything new to the table
you know what I mean so that's my
opinion but it's like I tell you guys
all the time if you want to learn it you
guys can learn it but personally I will
say hey there's no jobs for it so why
would you learn it you know but I'll
leave that to you guys I'm more about
the jobs guys you guys know me I'm all
about the money and more about jobs it's
their jobs their if there's jobs in a
certain language a certain industry I'm
gonna tell you go there because all of
you guys are brand new developers
there's a few of you guys who have been
here for like two three years and a
couple of you that already have jobs
right or have been working in the
industry for a while but a majority of
the people my core audience are people
who are just getting in people who are
just about to get that new job right so
if I come in and I'll give you guys
information about a technology that
doesn't have jobs I'm giving you guys
bad information you know it's like I'm
not guiding you the right way because my
goal is to get you in that first job
once you're in you're in nobody could
take that away from you once you did six
months a year in a job you're a
developer right before you even get a
job and this is why I made that video
you're not a developer in three months
people think like hey
man it's like right now I could be like
hey I'm a doctor
but I have no no experience as a doctor
I've never been in a hospital I've never
treated anybody how can I call myself a
doctor you get what I'm saying
that wasn't nothing that somebody send
me a message to they're like oh man
you know I don't like your video where
you say you can't become a developer in
three months it's like no you can't
because to become a developer it's not
learning to code like you could learn to
code you could be a programmer and you
could program in your house to me a
developer somebody who's creating
something projects creating um how you
call is working in projects in a
professional environment not just like
hey I'm just doing it in my house it's
like you a hobbyist you get what I'm
saying like you're not really a
developer unless to you in the field
right and you cannot be a developer in
three months it takes time you could
come in and learn to code learn to
program but your journey starts when you
first get that first client your journey
starts when you get that first job till
you get those things you're still just
like a hobbyist it's like I know it you
know it you get what I'm saying that's
why a lot of time there's people that
they never even go to interviews because
they they still haven't felt like oh I'm
ready
Oh or like let's say you try to follow
every JavaScript trend out there you're
like okay I gotta learn this one there
now I gotta learn the other one day I
gotta look there other thing if you fall
into that loop you're just gonna be a
hobbyist in your house for a good year
I've seen people that have said like oh
I've been trying to learn how to call
for two years and as I broke
you've been taking this as a hobby you
need to take it seriously and say hey
this is what I want to become and you're
not that until you get that approval of
that first client until you get that
first job you get what I'm saying so
that's what I mean and then with boot
camps in that video I was saying like
you can't become a developer in three
months it's like boot camps come in and
teach you programming the
teach you the very basic stuff that you
could have done in from what $10 course
stuff that you could've got from my my
website for $7 currently right now if
you go to my website and you click on
the link below sitting or you use this
code 65 for neck 65 for new year all
right you get for seven dollars you get
over five hundred dollars worth of
courses all right now for seven bucks a
boot camp you go to the boot camp you
won't even get me you'll get half of all
the things that I'm showing you guys on
my website right in three months but
they charge you like $10,000 to $20,000
now most of you guys don't have that
type of cash on you so what's gonna
happen you're gonna have to take a loan
so now you gotta take a loan to go into
a field that you're just trying you're
trying to get into so before you even
get in the field it's like you already
started - you get what I'm saying like
if what if you have already student
loans what if you already have a car
loan you got a mortgage now you're gonna
throw $20,000 on top of that you got
what I'm saying like and as I'm like yo
they not gonna make you a bootcamp is
not gonna make you a developer in three
months
there's people which I don't understand
why there's a lot of people who are
let's say computer science majors guys
who already know how to code guys who
understand how how the web works but for
some reason they feel insecure and they
go to a boot camp which makes no sense
if you went to college for computer
science or even IT you could go and
literally look at the documentation of
most of these languages that are for the
web and you already know this stuff you
know how to program why do you need to
go to a boot camp for them to give you a
little piece of paper and say hey buddy
you're developer now like
this well what is this little paper you
know what I mean like why do you need
that you know what I'm saying like
I don't know I just find me weird you
gotta say like I find it weird like if
you are somebody who was going to school
who went to to college why do you need
to go and pay twenty thousand dollars
after you already graduated from college
to basically go to a boot camp and tell
them hey man in three months teach me
something that could have probably
revised on my on my own in three weeks a
computer science major can learn web
development in two weeks because you
already have all the foundation you have
years of foundation what are you doing
going to a boot camp you get what I'm
saying
like you look stupid now most of those
people they commanding whatever they go
to those boot camp State they freaking
they graduate from the boot camp they
know how to do what developing app you
know web app they get hired and then
they'll be like hey man I'm a successful
or you know developer from a boot camp
and it's like bro you had a computer
science major and you already have your
degree you went to a boot camp to go
basically get a pat on the back and then
you get the job because you already you
already know the skills like yo yeah you
know this but there was no reason for
you to go to the boot camp you're not a
freakin something that the boot camp
should be proud of you know what I'm
saying because then what was messed up
is that they take the people who are
successful in the boot camp and then the
people that are not successful which is
about 80 percent right and those that
eighty percent are you guys alright and
you guys are let's say most of you guys
are just regular dudes trying to get
into this for you right dudes and girls
trying to get in into the field you guys
are just regular people you don't have a
computer science major right so if you
go over there you pay twenty thousand
dollars and then you can't find a job
because you don't even have the the
proper projects or you know the proper
experience then now you come out of then
you're like I'm pissed off like you guys
told me that all I had to do was get to
the boot camp
I was gonna get $100,000 and then you
realize you don't have the skills like
you went in there learned the basics but
now you got it after you finish the
bootcamp now you gotta go home and start
building your portfolio which is gonna
take you more months
all right depending on how how fast are
you working on them right so that's all
I'm saying you know what I mean like I
just wish people really really would you
know do your research when you win this
this field you have to do your research
not everything that everybody tells you
online is it's right at all because some
people they think of themselves as you
know they they don't like how can I
explain this like me somebody who's been
here for five six years right I can come
here and talk about things in the way
for somebody who's at my level five to
six years right but you guys can see I
don't talk about that I talk about the
lower level stuff like things that is
for you guys who are starting up guys
who just have two weeks started guys
who've been here for a month you get
what I'm saying like that's why I talk
about certain topics I tell you guys
study this study that you know because
it's gonna be more beneficial for you to
get that first job once you get that
first job you're in you gotta say this
thing is like you know how your buddy
comes up to you and be like man you know
it's like freaking this construction
this the city job of construction once
you're in you're in you got the benefits
you got everything you know you like
them old Italian dudes man like them I
had a friend of mine who who his father
was a like he worked for a city in
construction like you know like fixing
the roads and stuff like that literally
once you're in you're in for life this
is the same thing as web development
like once you're in you got the job
you're in nobody could take that away
from you all right because number one
you get the the security number two you
already have let's say
somebody who can vouch for you either
somebody who you could use as a
reference and you have that project
there you know sometimes we we create
projects for companies to and this is
something that I haven't really told you
guys that much but if you going and you
create a website for a client right make
sure you keep the original files
somewhere either in a zip or a github or
bitbucket somewhere where let's say that
client loses that website loses that
domain loses that that hosting if they
lost our website
you still have your copy so when you go
through all this job interviews and
they're actually also you've worked on
this client working on this person you
want to have those projects there
somewhere like in a hosting account that
you might have somewhere where you have
to put in a password to see it and then
you could show it to the client or show
it to your new employer because a lot of
times you create stuff for four clients
and they lose the domains then they
don't paint the domains they don't pay
the hosting and then now when you try to
show it to a client a new client right
you're like oh yeah I built this website
for let's say a jar you know Joe's
pizzeria dot-com when you go to Joe's
pizzeria com that doesn't exist because
I got the lead it that even keep up with
paying the hosting so you have to be on
top of things so yeah man currently
right now guys if you look at the the
title 65 for New Year's right so 65
percent off on the whole website I'm
gonna share my screen and the reason why
I'm pretty much bringing this up because
so many people have been signing up to
the site in the past two two days and
I'm like I told you guys there's a 65
percent off on the website right now I
mean you can't once you signed up I mean
you can't really get the discount but um
for the new ones that they haven't
signed up and they thinking about
signing up today yeah
I use the promo code man you know what I
mean like use the promo code straight up
sound like like I built it there I
created it for you guys so use it you
know I want people to just come in you
know come in and just like learn as much
as you can man like right now I'm
creating a lot of cool stuff for you
guys we got new videos coming out we got
new reviews that I'm doing for
portfolios I've got reviewing web
applications that people have built I'm
going in there you know critiquing it
and now I'm not taking my time with it
now I'm gonna do it more professional
because usually what I do is I just put
it on the screen and and then that's it
and I just start judging it as I see it
but now I'm not taking my time so you
know it's gonna be a very good editing
I'm gonna show you the things started
working for the website the things that
are not working so I just want it to be
more legit you know I bought the camera
but a couple of things so now I want to
I want to bring and implement all of
those things into every other one every
other web series that I already have
where it's like I want to be more
professional with it and just give you
guys something cuz you guys deserve it
you guys have been helping me out a lot
you know this past year yeah like I have
the time you know what I mean like I got
time today cuz you know what I mean it's
like that video with a little white boy
is like I got time today cuz yesterday
you have time but today I got time cuz
so it's like I have time man so it's
like I should be giving you guys like
literally the best quality content out
here and to be honest man I love every
other youtuber out there mint but man my
channel is legit man I'm not even I
don't even wanna I'm even want to do
that like that I don't wanna you know
hit him with the dab that much but you
know this channel legit man we're doing
amazing things man you know what I mean
like right
currently we got about 2,700 people
signed up for the website a lot of
people don't even get to do that you
know what I'm saying like we the website
is doing good you know it's saying I
want to give you guys the best things I
told you I'm getting this new studio I'm
actually moving to a new house so I'm
sorry I know you guys is gonna miss the
the ghetto curtain you know this you
know I might bring this up for for a new
spot man because this ghetto career has
been with us since the beginning you
know and I really appreciate the the
ghetto curtain you know the ghetto
curtain to tear me you know block the
Sun from outside for us you know we got
to pay her back some way you know I got
you mom
you get what I'm saying so we gotta get
a nice spot we doing something good man
like this things that we we doing right
now that people's gonna be like damn Joe
like Joe Duncan Jordan came up from the
little blue video in the background when
I used to be my my other room you know
with the the city's camera the you know
coming in here you know cursing a lot
I don't even curse that much man I'm
bougie now ya got me bougie now I don't
even curse on YouTube that much you know
what I mean so but we do it we're doing
good man we're doing good thank God you
know it's a new year and it feels like
every month things multiply doesn't
multiply by two
I wish but it multiplies by like point
twenty-five point fifty point sixty and
multiplies we still going up so from my
calculations by next year we should be
doing some crazy numbers you know so
everything that we're doing 2018 is is
gonna be amazing
you know I want to continue creating
courses for you guys I still want to
create you know relevant stuff like I
don't wanna I'm gonna add other stuff in
here you know and one of my friends was
telling me you know you should still do
do like a Python do like a angular
course and do a couple of other stuff
just because there's people that want it
right that no matter what how many how
many times we tell them like hey man
there's not that many jobs there for
brand new developers at this moment but
they still want to learn those things so
I'm still gonna make it right somewhere
in 2018 I'm still gonna do a Python once
we have all our fun and we get to get
comfortable with Ruby then we're gonna
jump to Python right and also probably
before I even jump to that I want to do
a full animation course for you guys
because it's very important that you
guys learn how to properly do animations
and keep things that 60 frames per
second if you're going to join a digital
agency you know so if you're gonna join
a digital agency and you want to build
nice animations like for you to learn
that it's gonna be a blessing so I want
to give you guys that too so right after
Ruby we're gonna give you guys that
which is gonna be on a make a good two
three-hour course and then we'll build
like you remember that other website I
told you guys that what you need it for
your portfolio a digital agency or
website so with that course we're going
to also implement that which is gonna
take a little while soon because we're
gonna put a lot of animations we're
gonna make a legit you know these things
that you guys just don't know I'll be
honest with you guys you guys just don't
know I keep getting emails I hate Joe
how do they do this on their website
how are the animations are are being
done like this there's things that you
guys just don't know you know SVG's um
the masking this things I call masking
with with elements there's also G SAP
there's also the all the css3 animations
that you can do like there's so many
good stuff out there that if you haven't
had the opportunity to do it you might
lose out on a lot of jobs so it's very
important to have all those skills and
you're probably thinking oh my god
there's so much to learn
a job no no no this very few things you
need to learn to get a job but you wanna
make yourself a more attractive
developer than somebody else because
most of these guys think about it like
this these guys that go to interviews
and play oh yeah all I've done is
ecommerce websites and all I do is this
but if you come in and you were like hey
man I know how to build a website from
scratch the the HTML the CSS I can come
in and put in the interactions with
JavaScript I can come in and build the
backend I can come in and deal with the
database if you are a you know a modern
company and you need animations and you
need like let's say animations for
Google AdWords you know for your
advertising I can make that to like
those things make you valuable that's
when you come in and be like hey man a
half a lot of skills under my belt so
you asked the price that you feel your
are on your work you know what I mean
like that's all I try to do I try to
give you guys the things that is gonna
make you more valuable as a developer
all the things that I freaking have been
doing all these years like know this
stuff is gonna be from one day to
another guys the the first things that
you gotta learn HTML CSS in JavaScript
then from there you got to understand at
least one back-end language and you
gotta understand the flow of it how
things work how you know get requests
work post requests how a REST API is
done because if you get higher so
front-end developer you need to be able
to understand and communicate with that
back-end developer or vice versa if you
get hired as a back-end developer you
need to communicate with the front-end
developer so even if your job is not
front-end or back-end you need to know
what exactly happens behind the scenes
or in the front so that's what I want to
give you guys then from there giving you
guys you know just the extra oomph where
it's just like man wherever you go is
like damn this dude
how he knows so much I gotta hire him
you got what I'm saying so that's all I
want to do for you guys but yeah man

a CSS flexbox and CSS grid learn HTML
CSS by building cool social network so
everything that you you could think of

build a restaurant web app so this is an
hyper app but everything that you
learned in here you could pretty much
put it to react is hyper app and react
are pretty much the same thing the only
difference is a hyper app is not a big
of a library s as react so if you don't
if you need something quick and easy and
small hyper app is perfect for that

have to sign up for anything that is
paid course like all of this stuff is

to try to buy each one but when you come
in and you sign up for the membership
you pretty much right now you're getting
a super major sale right now like for
the whole year fifty-two dollars period
for just monthly you're like ah
no if I trust this this thing I want to
just try it out cool try it out seven
dollars a month you cancel whatever you
want one-time purchase literally people
have paid 300 for this this is not like
Oh
like right now the people that have
found me from YouTube you guys get the
discounts the people that find me from
Google
they come in they pay 300 dollars like
straight up I'm not lying
like you guys are getting a big sale
just because you know me from YouTube is
pretty much is like hey like you guys
are are like I don't know how to put it
it's like you're connected to the plug
you get what I'm saying when you you
come over here you get all the sales
I don't put none of my coupons on any
other you know those coupon websites
because a lot of times those people
that's that go to coupon websites
they're not really looking to learn
they're just looking to see oh yeah I
could get something for $7 cool I'll
sign up and then they never come back
and then they cancel it like I don't
want nobody to come in and sign up if I
I've seen this done where people come in
sign up and then I okay I sign up and
then don't take not even one other
course guys don't sign up don't this is
not like a New Year's resolution right
now this is this is not a new year
resolution I don't want nobody signing
up and I'll be honest if I see that
anybody that signs up and in two weeks
you haven't touched the website I'm
canceling your subscription
automatically right and you're probably
thinking hey why are you canceling my
subscription I'm cancelling it and
giving you your refund back because I
don't want people signing up to my
website and doing this as if this thing
is I go how you call is like a New
Year's resolution where you know you you
think of it you're like oh yeah man you
know I don't know let me go back like oh
yeah man like I'm gonna sign up to the
gym and then I'm gonna lose some weight
and then they never go to the damn gym I
don't want nobody standing up to my
website for that you get what I'm saying
like I like to keep track of all the the
the people that are
to the website I keep track of who signs
up I keep track of who actually comes in
every single day who actually comes in
and looks at the courses cuz that's
exactly why I did this remember guys
when I was putting all these videos I
would have been putting on YouTube for
free but people wasn't doing them right
so I'll say you know what if I'm gonna
come in and do all of this work cuz this
thing takes hours guys this thing is not
like I just come here but I ain't you
know what I'm just gonna come in and
freestyle a tutorial no although this
stuff takes hours this times that you
record a video and a like oh I didn't
like how I explained it let me come back
in the lead a so now if a video took me
20 minutes I gotta come back and do it
another another time again for 20
minutes like it happens like that it
takes time right so if I was gonna do
this on YouTube
I was like yo people gotta see it right
- for it to make sense right if I was
getting the the views of let's say my
bro or traversÃ©e media it would make
sense for me right because then from
there that would it will pay it by
itself but people wasn't doing them and
I'm like girl I'm doing all this stuff
for free and putting them up online
nobody's using them and it's like okay I
came and keep track of who does their
work who does what so now we're
teachable calm thank God I found this
website that lets me you know put all my
courses and all my videos here for you
guys and then I keep track this is not a
thing where it's like hate you signed up
and I don't look at that stuff I'm all
up in your business I'm like this like
I'm in your business I look at when
you're watching videos like I look at
what videos you want what videos
actually paid time you know this videos
that people come in and they watch it
for like two minutes and then they give
up and then I look at the video and
realize like if there's something wrong
with it
or I wonder like King are they getting
lost there you go same for every single
video every course that I've created
every single tutorial of creating I
learn more and more and more right like
if you take the PHP course and this is
why I took down the nodejs course
because when I did the nodejs course I
didn't trust I it was a great starting
point for a lot of you guys but then
what I said was I looked at the no js'
course and I looked at the PHP course
and I'm looking at this new Ruby course
that I'm building right now and I put
all of them side by side and I was like
yo compared to the PHP in the Ruby
course the nodejs course was not on the
same level so I said you know what I'm
gonna redo it again and I'm also doing
that too I'm redoing it again but we're
gonna do it with just the basics of
nodejs and then from there we're gonna
use something like a dynasty s4 it could
be more structured and be like okay this
how you do your routes this how you do
your you know deal with your database
etc so it's like I took it out because I
want to give you guys the best of the
best right so you know I've learned so
much over this year and then now for
2018 it's like I already you know how
you found find your your spot like you
know how my friend always says this man
I'm in my bag right now I'm in my bag if
you know what that means I'm in my bag
I'm in a big-ass bag right now like I
already found my pocket I already found
the way how I want to teach my courses I
already found the perfect way for people
to understand it everybody who has done
the PHP 7 course they like young I
understand everything like this thing is
easy all right so I found a way to
really break it down for you guys and
from now on like you gonna get that you
know top quality course that top quality
tutorials you know so it's like it's
legit man you know what I mean if for
those of you guys that buy the one-time
purchase like
this is not something that's gonna stop
like I already told you guys this is
gonna be part of my life I have other
stuff that I'm doing you know I break
down my day through different different
ways
I have other businesses that I'm doing
but this is part of my life meaning I'm
always going to be creating courses on
my website and you're always going to
get courses no matter what it is if next
year
reiax 17 comes out you're gonna get
react 17 if the next year after I had
this react 18 then you're gonna get
react 18 if you see angular 27 then you
gotta get angular 27 like you know what
I mean like I'm giving you guys
everything back to back back to back
back to back so it's not really like oh
I just learned this stuff and I never
gonna come back to this thing know
everything that you're gonna see here
you're gonna be seeing all the current
things you know all the new frameworks
whatever comes up I'm still building it
you know what I mean cuz people want to
learn you know so if you're gonna learn
from somewhere you might as well learn
with your boy you get what I'm saying
now we ain't here kids
let me see who's in the chat room right
now I'm gonna see who's in here man yes
the code is 65 for new year so or you
can just click on the description below
65 for new year man take advantage you

special but that's not coming until like
probably I don't know like me so if you

if you sign up for the $7 a month
you already saving so much because it's
$20 per month and I usually do a 50% off

ten
now because um today you get a 65% off
you pay $7 a month forever if you wanted
to keep it at $7 forever you could keep
it at $7 forever if you cancel it you
know 2 3 months from now
then when you come back again somewhere

I don't cancel my my codes right well
90% of the time I don't cancel my codes
so codes that I put in like today
technically is til tomorrow
but am I gonna cancel it I don't know I
mean you could use the code you could
try it out I don't care you know it you
know this business-wise I shouldn't say
this but better cancel this code it
makes sense if I cancel it yes I know
but if you get it from the link from
this video if a year from from now you
come back and you see this video don't

but if you come in and you click on the
link a year from now in my working might
not work I don't know you know you know
sky's the limit I don't know I don't
know when the code ends but it
definitely if you come in and put in 65
for New Year's tomorrow it will not work
the link might still work but the code

man there's a lot of cool stuff man it's
a lot of cool stuff that we're doing you
know plague man like that's just so much
stuff man like I tell people all the
time and you gotta you gotta come to the
website man and even if like you don't
check it every single day this every
single day I add new videos literally
the only thing that I wish teachable
will have will be like an automatic
update for everybody to like you know
let people know like hey guys like I
just uploaded seven videos in and to
react I uploaded seven videos into Ruby
on Rails seven videos on CSS with Flex
boxes like I wish it would just do the
automatic notifications for that but
besides that I mean it's a great
platform you know but yeah man I miss it
let me see who's in here
yeah go ahead man 20 dozen subscribers
get ochre and giveaway yeah this thing
is special man this thing is special
this thing lasted all all year long you
know it's like I went to Ikea to buy a
curtain and it was nice and then when I
got here I was like it just it wasn't
gonna feel the same way if I put in
another curtain and I was like you know
the ghetto curtain just got a statement
like there's something beautiful about
this like I have this on top of like
some little bamboos up here you know and
like when I look at it I'm like I could
buy another one I could buy a real
curtain it was like you know just to
give it a little bit more more MORE
how you say this like a little cleaner
look but it's just it works you got I'm
saying it's like it works man it's like
you guys remember when I what was this
guy's name Redman he he had MTV Cribs
and the way to to connect well not
connect to ring the bell you had to get
two wires outside of his house and go
like this that's how you rang the bell
in his house that's like that's the
ghetto curtain for me you got to say
like yeah we could get a new curtain
yeah we go for it new stuff but there's
something beautiful about it you get
what I'm saying
and it's like what was crazy about this
is that next year you know 2018 people
the new people that's gonna find me
they're gonna come to my channel and
then black oh oh this guy is legit
youtuber he got a nice camera he got a
nice setup he got a nice mic
phone and this and that and it's like
they won't know where we came from like
you know what I mean like they won't
know we came from this little room whose
it's a mess like this room is a mess
like this thing is like I got things on
the floor adora that don't work like
this is like a storage room there's
supposed to be a classic you gotta say
like like people won't know that we came
from here they'll be like oh here's a
legit youtuber he you know he probably
makes millions not know I'm like nah bro
we we we are here like we don't make
money like that
from YouTube but they'll think in there
and they're like oh man this guy's legit
you know what I mean and I'll be like
man that's why I needed the freakin
ghetto Karen got dirt my dad okay like
as people people don't wanna know where
you came from you know I mean Chad said
oh man Ramsey Ramsey Jordan what's your
question what's your question I can't
see you Ramsey let me see if I could
bring up I should have did the
livestream with you know when I do it
with the chat room up because I like it
when when people get to see what's going
on
you know what I mean like it's nice when
people come in and they could see also
the chat room so let's say Ramsey says
he has a question I don't see his
question I Ramsey Ramsey what did he ask
okay
okay well said doesn't matter any what
does this say okay
Ramsey said I found a junior deaf
position that says they don't care if
the person has zero experience but they
want
15:15 Hungary dissolved and the co
provided I don't know how to solve them
should I just look up the answers yeah
look up the answers look up the answers
find it but you see this is what I'm
saying
they want a junior developer right and
they they probably want you to work on a
website and then instead of them saying
hey could you build us this page make it
responsive you know add a little bit of
JavaScript or whatever framework you
want or even jQuery and then send it
back to us you know with nice
documentation you know just leave some
comments and and see how your code is
but instead of asking for that they're
asking for 15 algorithms like sometimes
a lot of this companies stay so stupid
I'll be honest they're like really
really dumb because they're just wasting
people's times like I could like you co
actually miss a really good candidate
because you're asking for dumb
algorithms like you don't need it like
you're freaking doing web development
like if you're gonna be doing I don't
know
data are you working or something else
then it makes sense but if you just
working or on a website
show me websites why do I care about
your algorithms now you know what I'm
saying and I understand that that what
they do that and the reason they do that
is because is to try to test if if the
the developer can use his brain you know
every time I come in I say minimal
require requirement is to use
frickin brain right a lot of companies
they think that by doing this they're
testing you to see how you think and to
me I find it that's that's dumb because
you could come in and take you could go
in and take a Stephens bride or Stephen
Grider's a course on on algorithms and
learn all that and memorize it now
is that going to say that you're a
better developer than somebody else no
because when you both go into the job
interview
somebody that might come in and know all
the algorithms but doesn't know the web
it's like that can happen so now they
missed out on you who is a really good
web developer and just because you might
not know all the algorithms so I mean
just apply for it but I really think
that is dumb I mean yeah so let me see
so Kewanee and ramsey yeah both so the
Job Description yes it was in North
Carolina
J hell J Hills asking me what sure he
learned he finished a Codel of or was
the cold steel's what developer bootcamp
go to my website right you don't have to
learn it from my website I always tell
people you could literally come to this
timeline use it for what it is and learn
it from whoever you want you don't have
to learn it on my website but you should
follow along with this there's a
timeline like first of all you got to
know a text editor second of all know
the terminal there from there learn HTML
CSS building a cool social network or I
just take you for what it is learn HTML
CSS build our responsive apps so if you
already know how to build responsive app
then you're good advanced CSS meaning
CSS grid and flex boxes okay then from
there learn sass like a pro which is the
CSS preprocessor so you definitely need
to know this because this is what
everybody uses if you go somewhere and
they you'd be like hey have you heard of
sass and you were like oh I've heard of
it but I don't know how to use it people
are gonna look at you like you crazy so
you got a no sass pug I will say is it's
optional this is good if you're going to
be working with nodejs or you're going
to be working with a lot of HTML files
if you're going to be building a lot of
HTML files you could use this template
engine to build those websites in HTML
and then is how can I say it it's like
it's a template engine like it saves you
the headache of having to go in there
and change the header for every single
file that's in HTML like you could just
do it one time and then automatically a
it basically converts all the Pug files
into regular HTML so I mean just take a
look at this thing
this thing is great if you're gonna be
working with a lot of HTML files
future-proof javascript there's when you
start learning JavaScript like all this
stuff from here to here I will say this
is just the basics this is just
for you to know what the hell's going on
in front of a computer from here to here
is outcomes I will consider it HTML CSS
there from here future-proof javascript
to jQuery this is just to learn the
basics of JavaScript there from there
es6 is to learn the moral modern way of
building JavaScript applications and
then from there you have JavaScript
framework hyperope jes build a
restaurant web application this is like
teaching you guys how to build a web
application like a single page app
definitely you can learn react to yes
now there's all optional like if you
don't want to learn hi perhaps yes you
could skip this you can say okay I don't
want to learn this right but I will say
learn it because there's a lot of things
there that will help you to be a better
JavaScript developer like understanding
what happens with hyper at and what
happens in this build a restaurant web
application is important for you because
by the time you get to react you yes and
like let's say before that when you
finish jQuery there's like a big space
in between where you still haven't built
web applications with JavaScript right
so jQuery teaches you order basics Ajax
and all that good stuff but in between
they're hyper app is the thing that
glues together single page apps for you
especially with Java scripts so I will
definitely say this to are very
beneficial for you javascript framework
react yes definitely there once this is
once you're done with react I say you
know the front end you could consider
yourself a front-end developer you can
start applying for front-end developer
positions
everything from 1 to 13 right now once
you learn PHP 7 then you could consider
yourself off
stack developer you know the front end
and you know the back end right then
from there the nodejs course I'm taking
that down that shouldn't be there the
library like a pro I actually merged it
with learn PHP seven so they both the
same course Larry bro like a pro way in
PHP seven they're both the same one
advanced back in this is if you guys are
events like if you're somebody who you
already know all this stuff then go
ahead start learning go cuz if you're a
gold developer you could get a hundred
eighty thousand dollars a year I mean
who's gonna say no to that you know what
I'm saying so definitely let me see it
me see what else
shout out to Queens you already know we
ain't here yes if you buy the seven
dollar deal monthly it's like you're
paying for it monthly it's like no
matter what I'm still going to be high
coalesced it's like no matter what I'm
still adding all the courses the way how
it works is if you sign up for for any
anything here to get the old access past
the old access pass means you get every
single course that is on the website
automatically alright the only thing
that you don't get automatically is the
the uncut uncut videos from YouTube you
have to actually sign up for that but
it's free it's like the only reason well
I don't put it here with the
subscription is because it's not really
a course it's more like me uploading
videos that I don't want to upload on
youtube and where I might curse or I
might say something crazy so it's like
if you want to see those things then you
add it to your your list of videos that
you want to see but I'm not adding it to
the sort of package itself like once you
sign up you could add all those extra
things that are not there
but every course that I build is gonna
be on this package so either one you get
the $7 one right now
either you get the $50 for the whole
year
either you get the $105 for a lifetime
that's on you you get what I'm saying so
yeah you get everything
what is vanilla JavaScript vanilla
javascript is just JavaScript the reason
why people say vanilla is because it has
no flavor it has no other flavors like
you know things like react react es6
angular view everybody use their own way
of doing things with JavaScript or like
you have to learn the framework so as
like if you could do everything that you
could do with a framework with just
JavaScript but at the same time you
gotta know that when you write things in
JavaScript it takes forever how long
would the Ruby course be I believed
almost the same length as the PHP course
so if the PHP course was about like
seven eight eight hours no I think it
was like PHP course who came out to like
nine hours so the Ruby course is gonna
be about nine hours and I'm planning on
doing two projects for it so once we
finish doing things with Ruby then we're
gonna learn how to do things with
Sinatra and then after learning Sinatra
we're gonna learn things with Ruby on
Rails all right so yeah man we are in
here kids
yeah you could do a front end internship
it's not gonna hurt you
it all depends if if you can do it you
know what I mean like a lot of people
cannot cannot work for free you know
like I know guys who already making
money in another industry like let's say
they work as a bus driver for example
and they're making $60,000 a year right
but they hate that job they somebody
who's already making money they can't go
to a company without hate I'm gonna do
an internship with you guys and for free
like it's not gonna work for that person
he got bills you got stuff to do but if
you're a kid or somebody who still live
with your family and everything you know
um Michael is like if you still live
your fat with family or you got money
like that where you can say hey I'm not
doing an internship for like six months
or whatever it is then that's fine too
you know we'll see a question about
media queries what's your name eating
eating fill sense
let me see was yeah see if I could find
it yeah
eating fill says I'm struggling with
responsive design because I think that
I'm using too many media queries do you
think it's better to choose your break
points around your content in design or
around devices no just listen
sometimes there's companies that's gonna
ask you to do things for like 30
different devices right but as specific
companies but when you're building
something just to be responsive you just
want a pace to be responsive like like
you don't have to go in and build a size
for every single device like at all you
just don't have to like you just say
okay from zero zero
wave to let's say 550 that's a small
cell phone okay so you create your code
for that then from there you say from
550 to 750 nose to 780 that's a larger
phone or a tablet there from 780 to 1100
something that's like a large slab a
large laptop right there from there from
1100 up you treat it all the same you
just say okay this is large screen
devices now see but if you start going
crazy but like man I gotta find out
every every single single type of device
out there you're gonna go crazy like
there's thousands of devices thousands
of phones people use different different
things like you know what I mean like I
got this
let me see github curly fries calm it's
a little framework that I started
building in memory of my sister December
27th marked one year that my sister
passed away that's one of the reasons to
watering I didn't come in here that much
I didn't talk about it too much so it's
like I was spending time with family and
stuff like that so yeah my sister passed
away last year so I created this jeonyul
UI but if you wanna come in here you
wanna check the grid system is a very
simple grid system on how to do how you
call this like your own small framework
if you want to check it out as you can
see I have different break points so I
have break point for extra small break
points for small medium large and
extra-large
all right now in the variables I have
the sizes of let's say extra small is
from zero minimum where it starts at
zero break point small is
at 451 break point medium is minimal 768
break point large minimum is a thousand
and eight break point extra large is
anything above 1300 so that's it alright
so those are my my break points that I
constantly use no matter what so yeah
alright let me see what else so yeah
don't go crazy don't little crazy with
break points cuz you can still go crazy
with it yeah man go ahead kids you know
me somebody sent me a message like you
like your own videos I'm like yeah my
videos is legit I like my own videos if
I like something I'm gonna like it like
oh man you like your own videos like
yeah of course I like my own video I'm
legit like why wouldn't I like my own
video
let me see I'm still debating a webpage
to Joe Joe
Dementors I have only one actually has a
webpage and they all just use their
github and prior experience to get other
jobs yeah sometimes you could do it like
that you know you could just so there's
people that just get jobs with just
github but it's just you got to think
about it like this that's if somebody's
technical like you send me a gay hub
account I could look at in look at the
projects you guy but I okay this is cool
right but if somebody from HR or let's
say a recruiter that's looking for
somebody to hire and you send them a
gear up they'd be like I don't know what
the hell is this I don't know what the
hell I'm looking at I need to actually
look at real websites so as a brand new
developer you want to have those real
websites that you built online now just
on github because nobody has time to
download your website and install your
yeah you know you're known modules and
and do NPM install like nobody has time
for that
so it's like if you have your website
online then people can see it
there you go
Jose her those who say anybody new to
web development I'm working on github
project holla at me I like to get
familiar with using github and
contributing to projects there you go he
Morris stars like your Brooklyn so call
right now it hurts the code that's
another thing soon the the heater for he
from here guys freaking stop freaking
working for like three to four days so
I've been freezing in here
like I had a personal heater like my
wife's not here my baby's not here I had
them our I told him to go to there then
you know the grandmas house but it's
being extremely cold so finally
yesterday they fixed it and as you can
see today I'm here in the ghetto curtain
group like if not I will not be in his
this room right now that's why I also I
haven't put no no videos man
Anthony everything says good evening Joe
what is your opinion about web
development jobs in 2018 with net
neutrality coming one person says since
5g is coming is kind of mute point yeah
there's really no point of talking about
it I did a whole video which was like 20
minutes on why I didn't care about net
neutrality like I'm just not worried
about it like this companies people
doesn't matter if if they have to pay
extra money big they'll pay the extra
money because the the thing is that all
these companies have been banking on the
idea that the Internet is free right so
every company makes money online selling
products selling distance net but
everybody was banking on that that stuff
was free so nobody had to pay for it so
now even if they have to pay for it they
have to money for it trust me you was a
developer you're not gonna be hurt at
all like that's not your business you
gonna say like people who are worrying
about this are people who are like they
worry about their rights and all of the
stuff and I understand it is annoying
when something was free your whole life
and then they they might charge you five
dollars extra because they just changed
it you know it's like that's annoying
but as a developer man like don't let
that stop you you know what I mean like
that
that's not gonna be no way in front of
you
let me see pause and amp is something
that said developers are working on now
that's the thing you know progress was a
progressive apps isn't a progressive web
applications so be honest with you not
every website needs to be a progressive
web app like people you know this is one
of those those things that in online
like everything is like everybody's
jumping on it
but you don't need to jump on or
something at all there's certain things
that you just don't need to jump on it
like you could learn it but it's not
something that every single website is
going to use something like amp app is
good because it makes your website no
faster for for Google and it's great for
websites with content if you don't work
for a company that creates content like
blogs or news articles like this has
nothing to do with you like to be honest
with you like it doesn't have nothing to
do with you unless you work in in those
fields my opinion cable companies laws
on streaming streaming sites now they
wanna bank on Wi-Fi yep I'm not much of
a designer kind of kind of guy though
okay let me see
you should do more what develop a
portfolio of reviews those videos are
the best
yes I'm bringing them back I'm trying to
do one developer portfolio review every
week that's the goal I actually have a
lot of emails from people that send me
send me stuff but sometimes it's hard to
to go over every single every single
person and sometimes though I'll be
honest the websites look so bad that I
just don't want to put it online because
it's like then I'm embarrassing the
person you know what I mean like I don't
want nobody to to get embarrassed
sorry emails gotta check out the emails
kids word man Oh God so what am i doing
for New Year's New Year's I'm supposed
to go to Queens go spend some time with
with wifey my wifey oh how they say in
Spanish we fee and we feed where we feed
I'm going I'm gonna go chill with my
wife I and the baby baby eat then I'm
gonna go hang out with them in Queens so
I'm still out here in Long Island so I'm
gonna go chill with them but yeah that's
what we're doing nothing special
i freakin ID ranked like two days ago to
try to keep warm cuz it was freezing in
here I went out to a local bar and stuff
like that by myself once the Alpha drank
but man I don't like drinking drinking
is not for me I feel sick for like two
three days so yeah man so tonight
there's no drinking I'm just relaxing
word man we we gotta step it up this
year guys its 2018 man you know we need
to really do you really really really
need to do a lot of cool stuff this year
man let me bring you back to today's
Missi whoops like we got to do a lot of
cool stuff this year man like we got a
bill like real applications like you
guys should definitely see you know like
like not only follow what you learn here
or follow what you're learning other
courses that you might take but start
building things guys start building
things like you know look at Facebook
right how about you challenge yourself
and say hey I want to build my own
Facebook from scratch right you know you
already a lot of you guys already took
the PHP course guys you already know the
PHP course you already know the laravel
course with everything that you learned
in that course you can build your own
social network right you have the
documentation for things that are you
know that are not under the course
because not everything you can put
inside of a course you always got to
remember that nobody's gonna be able to
teach you everything but once you know
the concepts of the web you need to
challenge yourself and start building
certain applications that's gonna help
you level up on your skills you get what
I'm saying like you can't just be like
oh man I'm just gonna follow what the
video says nah man challenge yourself
man go hard start building things and
that's how it is you gotta challenge
yourself man you can't be
out here just like hey I'm just gonna
follow what the book says I'm only gonna
follow what what's on on the course like
now you got a branch ow you gotta
challenge yourself like say okay I
learned all the basics I learned all
those things I'm going to recreate
Facebook what's going to what are you
going to learn from that you're going to
learn how to build everything from
scratch with HTML CSS right look at
Facebook look at everything that's there
recreate it okay and the reason why I
say Facebook because Facebook has a lot
of things that is going to help you
elevate your mind as a developer and
elevate your level on this thing because
you start looking at it like this it's
okay you go to Facebook let's say for
example on a Facebook you create a login
page
after creating the creating the login
page then from there you want to create
the the home page where it shows all of
the the different things right god damn
it Tai Lopez is on Facebook - oh my god
oh my god he's following me oh man god
bless that guy man
know what I mean like it's crazy but yes
you just build a Facebook man you're
gonna learn how to deal with
relationships you're gonna have to deal
on how to create you know a following
system you know followers following you
know how to send messages from one user
to the other user like all of those
things they're they're valuable right so
you have to push yourself to build it on
your own so I would definitely say go
ahead build yourself a Facebook if you
want to go all out and you want to say
hey I want to build an Instagram okay
cool build an Instagram you know with
file uploads you know you could get to
learn how to use AWS how to send your
images from your stuff we got LV in the
chat room got wifey in the chat room
right now we're do that we'll be without
without without ma we need to add the
baby to to the channel Alice says hi can
you activate the PayPal please send me
an email right now Alice anybody who
signed up with PayPal on remember guys
if you signed up through PayPal I have
to actually sign you up manually right
so you have to register to a free course
so register to the hyper app course
right and then from there send me the
email of your username for the website
and then I will give you access to all
of the courses manually yeah there's no
other way I could do this
you know unfortunately Ramsey sent it to
me to send me an email right now a
coding phase at gmail.com coding phase
at gmail.com and register for a free
course and then send me the email of the
user name that you use for for the
website okay so use this link use this
link and register for this course so
what that does is it creates a username
for you once you basically do that then
from there I can look you up on the
system and add you two to the list
waiting on that email Alice
Missy
what
without without without what I would
apples here who's here who's here
you
okay Alice I'll see you I just saw you
right now I'm giving you access right
now let me know if you got to cheer
Arafa out coffee is that question for me
what projects are you working on
currently or is that for everybody else
right now currently all I'm working on
is as my own personal project I'm
building a new page for coding phase
calm all right so we're still going to
have all our courses inside of the
teachable the teachable platform but I
want to create a page which is going to
be better looking it's something that's
more welcoming like a nice landing page
for people that come in and they put in
coding phase comm like I want it to be
legit
okay let's see Ramsey
okay Ramsey let me see where you were
yeah and this for everybody else whoever
signs up to the PayPal just remember
that I do this manually with PayPal so
you have to actually email me your
information you gotta sign up for free
course like the hyper app course and
once you're signed up then from there I
can come in you send me an email with
the account that you signed up with and
then from there what I'm going to do is
I give you access to all the courses so
I have to do that manually with
teachable things like let's say if you
will so by the yearly or not the yearly
if you also by the one-time purchase you
could pay with PayPal or if you buy a
course separately you could pay with
PayPal but if you're signing up for a
subscription base I have to sign you up
through the subscription manually which
is different all right so there you go
Ramsey Jordan you you're good you should
have all the courses dinner
okay do you do you need degree no you
don't need a degree let me see
hey man why are you thoughts on CSS
great do you use for your own projects
do I use for my own projects yeah
depends on what I'm building you know
like if I just need a grid I'm using CSS
great now but not for everything man
like those are tools you know what I
mean like it's not for for you to change
all of your code is it oh now we're
using CSS grids so now we're gonna
change all our pages to CSS grid if
you're using bootstrap or you're using
any framework out there you could still
use it it's up to you if you want you
gonna say like you don't have to switch
to CSS great now if you're building a
project from scratch and you're like hey
man you know what I want to have more
control and it will be nice to just
control everything through my own CSS
without having to use anything else for
a grid then yeah use CSS grid
Raphael Kofi impose let me see what else
Rafael says that's so cool I like your

we're talking about good quality stuff
we talking about good merchandise stuff
that you could wear stuff that you could
be like I you know you go to a meet-up
you go to a on you know you you outside
like you could be wearing some developer
clothing but it's not corny you get what
I'm saying like that's all I'm trying to
do so I'm branching off from that I'm
doing a lot of cool stuff man
that's what I told you guys I'm like yo
like the YouTube thing is literally like
20% of all the things that I'm really
doing out here so when you don't see me
that much on YouTube is because I'm I'm
doing other stuff now my whole plan is I
want to be able to wake up early in the
morning so I could knock out all my my
courses and all my tutorials and then
the rest of the day I could go out for
meetings and and other stuff that I need
to do like I need to start going to more
meetups I need to start going to more
conferences people keep asking for me to
go to them and I just never have the
time so now I'm gonna do it more legit
you know what I mean like we're gonna
have the studio we're gonna create cool
stuff we're gonna have official
commercials for the clothing like cool
stuff man like this isn't the clothing
is gonna be targeted for people that
that code but it's not for people that
code I don't know if you guys get it
it's like if for people that code but at
the same time it's not like hey guys
here's on front of the Vella purrs like
nah like this is clothing line that I'm
building that Pete anybody else could
wear you know so I was talking to my boy
that he works for a BBC ice-cream he was
telling me he got a connection to I
don't know if you guys have ever heard
of plunder which is plunder calm
Kharma they also on Karmaloop calm all
right so I'm your screen share my screen
okay so the t-shirts the the the fit is
the the clothes is gonna be also be
selling out here in Carmel Lube and
plunder so it's gonna be pretty legit
like everything that I do is for a
reason like I'm not coming in this game
to do something crazy do something corny
you know it's like I want my stuff to be
at the same level as other people that
making you know t-shirts making cool
stuff but for us developers we gotta
understand it now for other people who
who like you know they just buying
clothes to buy clothes they gotta look
at him but oh yeah this is a cool design
I'll buy it you get all the same but if
you're a developer you know exactly what
what it is that I'm talking about you
know so it's gonna be pretty legit man
so we got a couple of things coming man
that was just a little preview man cuz
right now we talking about 2018 right so
right now we just giving you guys
previews on this man you know I mean
like yeah I was thinking about doing the
joy of the Tai Lopez video for the hell
of it you know what I mean
so yeah man building your current
projects and to use any framework yeah
I'm using all react on it I'm using
react for the website yeah man we got a
couple of stuff man we got the you know
the freaking coding face socks man yeah
man yeah man we got hats beanie socks
hoodies all day yes sir
exactly
we need the official new era stuff man
we I told people like yo if I'm gonna do
something man there's gonna be legit
imma see them and see who else in here
and trying to read everybody's comment
let me see yeah get the I don't did it
again
I didn't did it again I gotta see you
know I gotta see how I'm gonna do it
there's a lot of cool ideas that are
half of my head for the clothing line
that I want to do so Joe was he a long
game what do you mean about that long
game what I'm planning on doing in long
term if that's what you're asking
um I don't know man I like I like I
already told you guys I like this cake
all snogs let me see it snugs Instagram
Ruby I'm supposed to do a video with him
pretty soon dude because I'm a fan I'm a
fan of him let me see if I can find him
yeah Rashad Rochon snarling enough up
talk about him before she dies like I
like what he's doing he's working on a
lot of cool stuff too like he he's
currently I don't know if he's working
with coinbase if he's working in
coinbase oh he's working working with
coinbase so let me see if I could share
my screen
yes so there's like one other people
that I follow I have one on my other
account on my coding phase account but
yeah like I just find him to be super
cool like he's doing a lot of cool stuff
you know he's working with coinbase you
know working with the Bitcoin he also
has a ruby meetup here in New York he's
worked with a lot of people like he's
done a lot of cool stuff right and I
like what he's doing and I was like look
at that like a boy out here in Google
like
you know community leaders dinner like
you get what I'm saying like he's doing
his thing now what's cool about him it's
like I find him to be exciting
fascinating to me like I find to be
exactly like what I am I just don't have
I haven't had the time to really go out
and go to like all the meetups and go to
meet up with all these cool people that
he gets to meet up cuz I haven't had the
time but next year I got time cuz like I
got that time cuz I'm coming so yeah so
all the stuff he does a lot of cool
stuff man like he be out here killing
and you see him with the MCM bags like I
Heart Radio he goes does a lot of talks
and a whole bunch of different companies
and and like at the same time I believe
he got his own arm you know Michael is
like a own clothing store and sneaker
store that he's working with like
travels the world like there's a lot of
cool stuff this dude does like you know
and at the same time which is what's
important to me is that he's a developer
but he's not a square you get what I'm
saying like that's the type of vibe that
I'm trying to bring into this so the
long term for me is I want to teach you
guys how to Co I wanna get all of you
guys in jobs but at the same time I want
to make developers look cool out here
that's my goal right I want to be
surrounded by other developers that are
cool people who are working and doing
cool stuff and it'll be like we like the
new cool kids on the block if that makes
sense
you gotta learn like so that's my
long-term right at the same time I have
a lot of different business ventures
that you know five thousand a month here
six thousand a month day
$7,000 a month there until I get to my
goal my goal is to make half a million
dollars a year that's my goal
the goal is not to be a millionaire the
goals to make half a million right
but it's different little ventures right
but at the same time it's not really
about the money it's more about what I
can do once I reach that once I reach
that then I could come in and start
doing my own conventions my own meetup
groups my own you know traveling the
world and talking to high schools in and
bringing into the kids you know going
there fresh you know what I mean like go
not looking like a like oh man like this
guy's you know super nerdy wear some
glasses and a tight you know polo shirt
now we going in there you know fresh you
know what I mean like just seppies on my
feet you know chilling out here maybe
with a chain or two you know what I mean
like I want to do it in a way where as I
came in you see this this uh you know
this ball players this in a ball players
rappers or movie stars like they're good
they doing good but that's not the only
route for you to get out the hood and
then I want to show them I hate this is
technology this is what you could do
with it
this is if you focus in math and science
this is what you could do this one you
could become you don't have to be a
ballplayer you don't have to be a rapper
you don't have to sell drugs you don't
have to do none of this stuff right so
that's my long-term plan and that's what
I want to do you guys have seen what
I've been doing out here you know the
firt of fo first four months of me being
on YouTube I was giving out about like
three hundred dollars out of my own
pocket to people and like free courses
on udemy people are here they come out
sway I used to go look I'm out my first
videos look at all my videos from
December to March I used to be given a
whole bunch of courses for free to
everybody right so now if I have enough
income and I'm having
of money out there where I could be like
hey for me to survive in this world all
I need is like 70 grand right then
everything else
I don't need it for me to be buying
stuff for myself all I need is that
money for that I can say hey now I could
start giving out you know computers to
kids or or kids who are interested in
coding like you know what nobody
believes in you
here's a thousand dollar grant for you
to go and create your application and
you get that motivation like that's my
long-term goal because technology is not
gonna go away but we have to basically
reach out to different communities and
show to the kids that hey man there's
money to be made out here and it's cool
to be smart and it's cool to do good in
school it's cool to you know coming here
make money and just like you know I mean
like I wish to be honest with you I wish
there was like doctors going to high
school like you know doctors going to
high schools lawyers going to to high
schools and just start you know what I
mean just going there you know like in
my neighborhood my neighborhood has like
one of the biggest communities of
tesla's and Maseratis and and Rolls
Royce and there's neighborhood where I
live of all of Long Island right it has
to most people that have money right and
I'm like okay that's cool people got
money but how about you try to motivate
other people or guide people or how to
better their lives especially for kids
that don't have nothing right I wish
when I was in high school somebody will
come in and be like hey man you know if
you guys do good in school you know you
could afford this you could go travel
the world you could go buy this cars you
know you could do whatever you want you
know but we didn't get that you know who
who are the people that you look up to
you like oh who's getting money all the
rappers the freaking movie stars the the
ball players to those who sell drugs
like those are the people that you look
up to because that's what you're seeing
right now for other communities they're
like oh man like you know it's
time for for a little Shawn that his dad
makes you know yeah my dad makes a
million dollars a year you know he lives
over there oh my mom's you know a little
Cindy she makes you know her mom is a
freaking high paying lawyer like but for
people like me and you and a lot of us
we don't we're not surrounded by those
people we don't know how that world is
you know what I mean like there's people
I know people that's like oh yeah it's
like right after high school they're
like hey man I'm about to go apply at
that UPS and you're like wait what but
that's because they don't know you get
what I'm saying like there's more to
life and more opportunities out there
but you got to know that the
opportunities is there so that's what my
long-term is my lord my long-term is
just to show people like y'all man
that's what you could do this is the
things that I've done you know I have
little websites in there that make 2000
make 3000 here and there right a month
right when I quit my job I wasn't crying
for my my job like oh man you know I was
making you know like 80 grand over there
with full benefits and every day what am
I gonna do now
nah I was making the same amount of
money as my job was paying me by myself
so I didn't lose anything
the only difference was I was making
double the amount of money that's it but
who cares cuz I still make fun my eighty
ninety thousand on my own you know what
I'm saying so that's the goal man that's
that's where I'm at man you know with
the whole clothing the whole everything
that I'm doing is for a reason man this
like you know I come in here you know
somebody told us like you know you
you're ghetto because you do the chit
chit chit
it's like you making this nah man is
like I talk the same way I talk to my
friends on YouTube I talk to people same
way I talk to my people you know what I
mean like this is what makes me
different this is what makes me you know
who I am I come in and give you extra
sauce that you wouldn't have
you know what I'm saying like you gotta
have some type of some type of flavor
you know what I mean like you can't you
can't come in and and try to do the same
thing that everybody's doing you know
what I mean you're like that's wack
you gotta come in and create something
dope but yeah I mean so that's the long
term kids so everything that I do you
see it is for a reason yeah I could
kids man for sure that's a good idea
creating some jerseys for developers
that's dope
you know I know man I'm trying to build
this team man I'm trying man I'm trying
to I'm trying to you know just I got a
position myself in the next year you
know with everything that I need to do
right
like once I I get to a certain point
then I'm gonna start coming in building
my team cuz right now it's like I'm the
type of person that I wouldn't even tell
nobody Oh help me out if I can't pay you
right so if I can't pay you I'm not
gonna tell you hey man help me out with
this this isn't that or less or less I
can pay you at the moment
you're not saying so it's like I'm
setting myself up to that point you know
so just give me some times 1 once I'm
good then I'm gonna start bringing
people in you know in then yeah man yeah
man definitely you have to capture what
coding is is expressing yourself yep yup
exactly
exactly
perfect you think you can make it mike
weis yeah man Thank You Man thank you
for coming true man come chilling with
your boy you know it's like sometimes we
we think of stuff man and enough notice
this man sometimes we think like we want
to do so much stuff that might seem
impossible but like the older I get and
like the more experience I I notice
about things like everything that I told
that I couldn't do I'm doing it so for
you guys it's the same thing everything
that you think that you can't do what
you want to do
trust me you could do it unless it's
something that physically you can't do
hey you can't just think yourselves like
hey man you know I'm 38 years old I'm
about to go play ball and mb8 physically
like it won't happen but anything
besides stuff that you can't do
physically you could do it like and
that's what I'm at man yeah I definitely
know I need to get like some more
regional teams that's exactly why I
wanna freakin start once I finish
everything that I'm doing I can finally
start going like from state to state
like I want to go to like meetups in
different states get people to know me
get people to see me because the thing
is like if you see me on the internet
you might like me ain't even without all
this kids real just kids cool right but
if you meet me in person as a wrap like
trust me like you're gonna love me
because I'm I'm just so regular dude man
trying to make this this nerdy stuff
cool that's how I look at it you know I
mean I'm just trying to make this nerdy
stuff cool for more people to get into
it people that didn't think that they
was able to do it and not only that this
is just like a door there's a gateway
drug to everything else like technology
is such a big feel tech is such a big
feel that wherever you you decide to go
you can become successful in it all
right you can come in and say how well I
started as a web developer but now I'm
programming robots you could do it you
could definitely do it
hey I started doing this and you know I
started looking into a biology yeah you
could do it like there's so many
different fields that you could get into
because now there's like all the
knowledge is there for you like you
could build a lot of stuff that people
wouldn't wasn't able to do it before cuz
the technology and the information
wasn't there but now is there we in 2018
man yeah man if you got some nice
designs and you're a good designer hit
me up man coding phase at gmail.com yeah
that's what I want to do I want to start
giving out you know laptops and helping
people out you know even people there's
another thing soon you know when people
get locked up and they come back home
and they don't have nothing no jobs or
anything like wouldn't it be cool like
if there was like a school or a place
where give people who are okay family
guys were felons and who are felons and
people who are coming from you know you
know that just they came home they've
been in jail for five ten years wouldn't
you be cool that when they finished from
you know coming out of jail they already
have a skill right that they could use
like you could pretty much like build
teams and be like okay like I'm gonna
help you guys out get jobs online
cuz that's one of the beauties of this
thing it's like hey yeah sometimes it's
gonna be hard if you are a felon or
somebody who who have committed a crime
back in the days and you're like man I
regret that so much I want to get a
second chance in life I think technology
is perfect because if you can do the job
you can do it remotely you could still
get hired nobody's looking at you like
oh man
I hired a felon and this and that like
nah you have a second chance now you got
I'm saying like you will come in and
learn this stuff and work remotely work
on your own ideas work on your own stuff
you get what I'm saying so it's like
sky's the limit for this man like
there's just so many different groups
that can be helped with technology and
programming and you know just coding in
general like there's so many cool places
that I feel that haven't gotten reached
and maybe I'm the guy to try to you know
push that forward you know we need to
start we need to tell Abama to holla at
me get Obama on the show you know I'm
gonna yell Obama I know you ain't
president but you still got connect son
hook your boy up so we could get

two-hour thing three hour thing and then

whole videos a lot of you guys that
stayed here y'all get to watch it cuz

of people come in and they don't even
they don't get to watch the whole thing
