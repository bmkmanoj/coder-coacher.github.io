I'm trying to set it up with you know
maybe I'm gonna create a channel called
coding phase 360 just for the 360 videos
just because what I haven't you know cuz
currently I can't really I could upload
videos to you guys but I can't go live
YouTube without recording I don't know
it's weird I have to record it for it
you guys still get to see this on 360 I
can do live videos but I can't do it
through my account on YouTube so I have
to create a new account which is a
headache I know but I guess I have to do
it you know what I mean so yeah man we
in here coding face.com
the boys backing out and did it again
man go check out that course on PHP man
like I told you guys I've been building
that you know I also have the course you
know life after learning to code which
goes into freelancing goes into working
for a company how to find a job how to
pass the job interview how to get you
know clients for freelancing you know
how to work different projects how to do
your taxes like I'm going into all of
that
alright so yeah man go check that out
those are the two courses that I'm
working on right now as we speak
you know just knocking that out I'm
probably gonna finish the life after
coding no life after learning to code
you know I'm finishing that course
probably by tomorrow and then from there
this whole week I'm doing the you know
micro framework lumen which is like a
child novel and then from there I'm
gonna jump into laravel for a PHP course
and just like giving you like everything
that you need to be successful as a PHP
developer right and not only that that's
just like let's say you wanted to do no
js' alright you wanted to do Python
let's say you wanted to do Ruby on Rails
having PHP under the belt really
solidifies you as a web developer
because now you can pretty much work on
any company out there you know there's
gonna be a lot of companies that's gonna
hit you up with WordPress or a
especially as a junior developer when
you're a junior developer you have to do
what you gotta do you know what I mean
it's not really an option of saying hey
I don't want to do WordPress honey I
don't want to do this and out on the
touch PHP it's not really about that
it's about you getting a
and getting yourself into the industry
so yeah man I hope you guys like this
load 360 really I hope you guys enjoy
this I'm probably gonna have to create
that the other channel where I'm gonna
do like 360 videos it's just gonna be
360 videos depending on where I go
unless I go to and in fact I'm gonna do
the 360 video there or you know like a
live video alright so I might just say
coding phase live 360 that might be the
name of the channel just for the hell of
it cuz we you know don't live videos in
three section is cool like you know
