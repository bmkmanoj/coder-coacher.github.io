again man coding phase calm your boys
back and out and did it again listen
guys today we're gonna talk about you
know net neutrality and why you
shouldn't be worried that much right now
I've seen a lot of articles I've seen a
lot of people crying about it I've seen
a lot of people like oh my god is the
end of the internet and to be honest
with you guys I don't see it like that
like I don't and I don't know I always
have this thing where I go against the
public opinion of a lot of people most
of the time because you know people
freaked out every single day people
start freaking out like oh my god you
know net neutrality we won't be able to
watch netflix we won't be able to watch
TV we won't be able to watch you know
their Dragon Ball Z their anime their
porn you know it's like bro like calm
down you're gonna be able to watch it no
matter what
now I understand there might be a extra
charge you know I don't think it's gonna
be that bad people are thinking that
it's like hey man you you go to
worldstar it's gonna be $10 if you go to
Hulu calm it's gonna be $25 guys to be
honest with you guys I really do not
think it's gonna be that way at all
and it's not just me being positive it's
not just me acting like oh my god this
is not a big deal it's a big deal and
not a big deal because what was there
before
net neutrality think about that right
what was there before that was the world
like freak it out no right after net
neutrality did it change your world I
don't think so
right and now that they're taking it
away does it matter I don't even think
that it's that big of a deal at all
you know people been asking me of course
there's a what development channel you
know hey is it gonna affect my
application is it gonna affect me being
able to make money guys it's not gonna
affect you think let's be honest
people that's gonna get affected by this
we're talking about Netflix we're
talking about Google here in YouTube you
know all of those companies like they've
been making a lot of profit for years
profit day you don't get nothing out of
it I don't get nothing out of it none of
us get nothing out of it right and
somebody say hey were you getting good
content you're getting free content
online and you're getting you know HD or
4k now 8k was about to come out now you
maybe you're not gonna get 8k guys I
understand that part of it but I also
understand the other part of like hey
man if I owned a company for example
right I own a company and I'm supply
somebody who is technically my
competition the service and they're
basically taking all my money away and
now we're making somebody else rich what
did I want to charge and put like hey
there's a fight on a charge if you want
to be doing 8k there's gonna be a
fallout of charge would you do that yes
you would do it right now you know
Google Facebook or Amazon freaking
YouTube you know you porn all those
companies have been making millions and
millions of dollars
nobody gets nothing out of it right
we're not getting anything out of it no
you know regular people don't get
anything out of it let's be honest let's
see and let's talk about the real
situation out here right all that's
happening is another rich people are
getting more money right does it affect
me and you it doesn't affect us right
what's what's $5 you know what I mean
like what the hell is fine on us you get
on Santa to pay a fine out of feet on
online right if I'm paying fifty five
dollars for a hundred megabytes or 100
megabytes down
a hundred megabytes up on Verizon I'm
paying $5 extra because you know net
neutrality is down it's not there no
more and then I hate we're gonna charge
you $5 extra plus tax is gonna be seven
dollars extra okay
who cares is I'm gonna have the same
thing the same freaking channels the
same websites everything's still gonna
be the same now it's up to the the
subscriber the do people really care
about this content maybe I'll be honest
even with everything that's happening I
think this might be good in a certain
way and it's you some of you guys are
gonna kill me or anything yeah I gotta
be like oh my god Joe's crazy but I'll
be honest I'm tired of Netflix like to
be honest with you I'm tired of seeing
the same shitty dollar content on
Netflix the same BS shows that they show
on Netflix or Amazon I want to see real
content and what do I mean by that right
I mean this you know we've been having
television for over 50 years
hey or more you know almost a hundred
years of filming and in television why
isn't all that content out there right
like if net neutrality right if net
neutrality out of nut out of losing net
neutrality we get to get access to all
that content because now let's say a
Time Warner Comcast or a how you call
this a Disney which Disney is buying Fox
and all this other companies
if they come out with a service that's a
hey man we're gonna give you all those
movies that you haven't seen on Netflix
because we haven't wanted to share to
them all the shows that we've been
created for you guys on NBC ABC EA every
other channel we're gonna give you an
unlimited plan for 24 hours a month guys
I'm willing to pay that I'm willing to
pay them to have access to all of that
content right that's to me that's what
it's going to
happens out of net neutrality right
Netflix is not gonna be winning no more
Google is not gonna be winning no more
Amazon is not gonna be winning no more
because they've been backing in on the
idea of I hate the internet is free is
like somebody pay for the Internet this
know how you code is like there's no
there's no charge between the flow of
Internet going back and forth so all the
profits goes to them now I've seen
people pull the posters up online where
it's like oh man now my ISP is gonna
slow me down when I go to my you know my
left wing or my right wing content guys
I really really really do not think they
gotta do that why because that's why the
FCC is there and now you might say hey
the FCC is in cahoots with all these
people yes they are in cahoots the same
way how Google is in cahoots with the
government say we have Tesla's in
cahoots with the government man how all
of these companies work together to
censor people they've been doing this
for Wow
it's just like it was Google it was
Amazon it was all this other places and
now it's gonna be switching over to
Comcast and Time Warner now they're
gonna have the power for the regular
people is it gonna be something that
we're gonna be like oh my god we don't
have our our freakin porn sites no more
my to be my X and X website my whatever
my Rhett to like guys the arete soup is
gonna be right there the only difference
is that hey you're not gonna be having
that 4k back and forth you know it's
like hey unlimited internet just going
back and forth with our charge there's
gonna be a charge that's just how the
world is it's always gonna be like that
right it lasted long enough let's be
honest it lasted long enough you know
especially in a country where everything
is about capitalism and everybody is
about making money it's like are you
surprised that this is happening I'm not
surprised you know what I mean like so
why are people crying about this like oh
my god I guess the end of the
world it's not it's just gonna be
another charge just the same way how we
get charged every day for taxes same way
how we get charged for anything that we
buy there's certain things that are not
even worth the money if I get sick right
now I'll go to a hospital just to go
show up I hate could you check my blood
that's $800
it's that worth $800 No so it's like
just because it's on the internet now
don't cry a body right you haven't been
crying about it in all the other
different situations right people are
crying about like oh my god I won't be
able to visit my website and I won't be
able to to do what I want to do my day
will never find my website currently
right now people have amazing websites
really cool content out there and their
content is not being found right because
of Google Google mana monopolize the
whole thing you know back in the days is
to be like goals they used to be Yahoo
they used to be um what else there was a
Netscape AOL Google ate all of that
Google came in and ate ate everything
right like there is no competition to
Google Garrett there is no competition
to Netflix like I've been dying to see a
competition to YouTube YouTube is great
but not great at the same time the
censorship this you know they're people
who are creating content they can't
monetize it there's so much wrong with
the Internet of today that am I gonna
cry about net neutrality no you get what
I'm saying like why are people making
such a big deal about this like there's
so much other things wrong in the world
like you having to pay five to ten
dollars extra for the 4k package hey you
want the 8k package and you want to be
streaming 8k movies is $15 who gives up
there right there's a lot of stuff
that's wrong with this you know this
country right now especially every
has to do with capitalism right so I
hope that people can use to this idea
and I don't say how they are not used to
it yet
like you're supposed to notice already
like you telling me in all the time that
you've been here you haven't realized
that this country runs around and
everything that's connected to this
country it's all about money doesn't
matter about the little people doesn't
matter about the people in the middle
like this conversations where are we
arguing we're talking about net
neutrality and people are saying a lot
of people are gonna pay for this no it's
not really about the little people
it's about this is more of a transfer of
basically power of people who are making
money already transferring it to other
people who were making money we're not
making anything out of this that's it
attend on a charge ok cool
I'll pay you for the $10 charge but you
know what what this is gonna bring out
this is gonna bring out other people
coming in and being like hey you know
what Netflix came in and they had their
chance cuz this to be honest with you
guys this is not about anything besides
Netflix Google Facebook Amazon this
thing does not affect anybody else out
there and people are saying hey man what
if your startup and you wanted to create
a news a new service for online guys its
2017 there hasn't been a startup for a
video and god knows how long
because this freaking companies they
have such a monopoly around the internet
that is ridiculous
any company starts coming up they buy
him off so it's like what startup was
gonna show up to tricking actually come
in and give competition to Netflix and
googling and you to bring all of this
companies nothing I'm being honest there
was no no competition I mean nobody was
gonna be able to compete with them so
what happened now you got the major
companies
you got freaking Comcast Time Warner the
companies that have internet services
ISPs in they also have content right
they're like yo we can't do this we
can't be given them the free easy access
right and then they're also taking away
all our basically all our money because
no longer are people paying for cable no
longer are people coming in and watching
TV shows they're paying for Hulu they're
paying for Netflix they're playing for
whatever company out there YouTube red
you got what I'm saying like they stop
making money but they the ones supplying
discs you know there's three four
companies with everything they're
supplying them with the free flow of
basically on my hey he's our
infrastructure and you make all the
money right all of that's happening is
being transferred over right what's
going to happen at the end of the day
Google Amazon all of these companies
they're now gonna be charging more money
for the services what's gonna happen is
they're gonna have to put it cheaper for
people to be able to sign up you know
Netflix started charging I was at
fourteen fifteen dollars and four
freaking month they're gonna have to go
back to that seventy eight dollars that
they used to have to be competitive
right because it's like hey if I'm
paying $10 I'm paying ten dollars extra
for this high-speed Internet
I'm gonna pay $15 to you for your shitty
content when Disney has a better service
than you and they also come with my ISP
package with my internet service
provider why would I use Netflix when I
could use Disney you get what I'm saying
like it doesn't make sense now they're
gonna have to compete right for us to
user it's only a set price nobody's
gonna come in and be like hey guys you
gotta pay $67 for your internet now
extra if you want to get access to
everything on the internet it doesn't
work like that guys the FCC is there for
a reason if they were to do that people
would literally write and they will have
to take that out right the next
president is not gonna be trouble the
next president is gonna be somebody else
when will comes in if they were to do
something so crazy like that where they
would charge you know $10 for each
website for each service just to be like
if you want to use Hulu you got a pic
$10 extra people will write it for that
people will be like I am not paying for
internet for the incidence will be
completely different than what it used
to be people will write it that's what
will happen that's the truth if you see
people writing for you know Wall Street
like imagine the incident that incidents
the most important thing in the world
period the Internet's almost as employer
in its water if you're not getting your
information people will go crazy if
you're not getting your content people
will go crazy they don't want to do that
all they want to do is make their profit
YouTube Google all those companies
Amazon they make their money
but now the the ISPs Comcast Time Warner
Verizon they're like hey man we're
actually paying for this service and
we're losing all our customers that used
to pay for for content on cable how are
we gonna continue painful and giving you
free access to it like f you you know
what I mean like that's what they gotta
do
and that's what they did you get what
I'm saying so for us as developers right
do we really care about this let's be
honest do you guys think that you guys
can compete create something that's
going to compete with you too
do you know how difficult it is Vimy
tried and failed they had to close it
down a lot of different companies try
and they have to shut it down because it
is very expensive no matter what even in
a small scale it's very expensive to
maintain video
and hosting and all that stuff the only
people that can afford to actually put
those services are Netflix YouTube
Amazon that's it
nobody else can afford that and the
moment that somebody starts making
something that could compete those
companies come in and buy them off
alright so for us like are we gonna cry
for this like this is my my question to
you guys do you guys really think that
you're not gonna be able to visit your
web sites like this the whole thing
about net neutrality is how much traffic
is going in and out to be honest with
you guys
right it's just to put up a whole to it
and be like hey man you know so you see
this website it's running 4k video I had
a bit ray of let's say $20 or whatever
is super crispy slow that down slowed
that down bring it down to 1080p am I
gonna cry of my video is 1080p no I'm
not
you get what I'm saying like people are
over here making this thing so freaking
big and so like monumental is like oh my
god it's the end of the world
guys like there's so much things are
wrong in this country really to be like
crying about this like you're gonna have
to pay a extra fee from $5 to $15 for
the 4k 8 K package do I care about that
no I don't care about that I don't care
about that if they tell me hey man you
only get in 1080p on your service for
your $55 that you're getting you know
what I'm gonna say okay cool thank you
am I gonna cry because it's not for King
like this is the thing where we come in
and we're like you know if you break it
down even wait what people are talking
about that they won't be able to visit
their their regular web sites and this
and that they won't be able to find a
small website you can't find the small
websites
now because Google controls it so what
are we talking about are we talking
about hey we're basically transferring
the power to somebody else that's what
we're crying about
we're crying about hey we're crying for
Google Amazon their Facebook and all
these big companies because now they're
giving back the power back to the ISPs I
don't give a damn I'm still gonna be
able to create my content still gonna
create my code I'm still gonna create
everything that I need to create who
cares if it's not a frickin 4k you get
what I'm saying like I'm not gonna cry
about that who cares to be honest with
you guys who cares about Netflix I
really don't care about Netflix people
are crying for Netflix and I'm gonna go
Netflix is a shitty service and to be
honest with you guys I don't care about
it I would really like for Disney or NBC
or one of those major companies to come
up with a service that has all the
movies even if it's I gotta pay $25 per
month</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
