comp so now the next thing that we want
to do is we want to start working on the
content area which is this whole section
okay so what we're gonna do is we're
going to create a section right we're
gonna say content area and then we're
going to break down each piece into
different sections alright so we got
this is a section this is a section and
then inside of that section there's
multiple sections inside of it you can
see and then from there we have this
table but we're not gonna do it with a
table alright we're gonna do it with
just regular HTML okay guys so the first
thing that we want to do is one thing
that we forgot to do and that's why when
we hover over this this thing doesn't
work it doesn't really give us any
animation to it any transition and it's
because over here we said transition all
0.5 we're supposed to put the s so 0.5 s
now as you can see you're fades in all
right cool now another thing too we want
to do is we want to come here to the
index dot HTML and we're gonna come here
and put in a section ok let's say class
content area okay no because this is a
lot of CSS we're going to create a new
file call content area that s CSS make
sure you put an underscore on the front
click enter so now here what we're going
to do is we're basically going to say ID
content area we're gonna start coding
inside of that now make sure everything
is fine we're gonna close and if I open
mean we have to import it so we're gonna
say import and we're gonna say content
area okay save that there now we're
going to close mean that s CSS click
here on the terminal and press ctrl C to
stop it and then the NPM run watch one
more time okay alright cool so we are
set we are ready to go so let's start
breaking this thing down okay you know
take this image put it here and let's
break it down by sections all right so
we got the content area okay and then
inside of constant area we're going to
do something like Dave or we for even to
a section but for now let's just say
Dave okay we're gonna say div and we're
going to say heading all right call that
heading so let's say h1 okay dashboard
okay
close that that div okay from there
we're going to put a paragraph and we're
going to say welcome to go jobs
welcome to go jobs you know close that
up okay so we already did the section
now let's go into each one of these so
what we're going to do is
we're going to come down here and we're
going to say Dave I don't know what
should we call the slides or cards
there you go cards we're gonna say that
let's say div class cards and then div
right now inside of this car its
container ain't that we have we named
the Dave and what a classic cards we're
going to say here live class card
singular right so we know it's just
we're talking about one card and
whatever styles we put on that card we
could reuse it for all the other ones
okay so on the first one we're gonna say
something like this we're gonna do div
class use our image okay then we have a
span class title or name yeah user let's
put let's keep that convention user name
and say John levi's close that up
oops span okay now here we're gonna copy
this paste it down here ain't gonna say
user title say full
stack developer okay then after that
we're going to put in an HR save that
after that we have two sections so we
got previous and then we have the
whatever this is what I was cool I guess
previous job or let me see that's what I
mean is previous education that's a dumb
way to put it
but let's say we're just gonna put one
we're gonna say div class and what we're
gonna do is we're gonna do something
like this we're gonna say call MD I'm so
used to pull strap guys like even when I
called things on my own
I just call it by the bootstrap classes
so call m.d. six know let's say cone
before and then so it's like a column MD
is like for you know a medium devices
the screen of it right so call MD for
and then we're going to say something
like this like spend education
okay call this class education okay
now I'm still around here guys I'm right
here working on this we're not gonna put
previous education because that's dumb
all you have to do is just put education
one time okay now here on the second one
we're gonna copy this and we're going to
paste it here and we're going instead of
putting two of them I mean we could put
two of them we could say class schools
okay
schools and here we'll say Grover
Cleveland High School and hear something
like New York University okay save dad
see all that stuff is being written
there but remember is behind this menu
so all we're gonna do is we're gonna
move it to the side we'll see assessing
the low why let's come back here let's
bring out this image okay so we did this
card already now we got to do the other
card okay how long okay we got that card
the first one now we got to do the
second one now we're going to do
something like this we don't say div
class you know we're gonna say card
all right if class card close that up
I'm gonna say something like what's the
hh6
I'm gonna say interview schedule now
here we're going to create ain't deaf
all right we could even put in a span it
doesn't really matter span since we
still working with text all right so
we're gonna say 21 July 26 2018 I mean
this must be the person who created this
must be in Europe or something so July
18 2018 my 7 2018 okay now what we want
to do is we want to separate this into
two sections so you got that one and
then we got the other one okay so here
we're gonna say what's the name of this
was the online travel ticket system seen
aux online shopping e-commerce
that kind of makes no sense what will
build this this design pretty much
didn't think it through right
so interview schedule we're going to see
something I just want to keep this we're
not gonna keep we're not gonna do the
other one we're just gonna keep the
first one so we got that let me put a
class in this class date okay now for
this we're going to put in we're gonna
do what we do here I'm gonna copy this
put in class call md4 for this one we're
gonna actually just put in two and here
we're gonna say ten all right so what we
want to do is next we want to say okay
application not the case you this is
gonna be just a con and here we're gonna
put a icon or like let's say that's IT
let's say job type job type that sounds
better
so okay and here we're going to put in
put in the information we got let me see
div class let's say here we're gonna put
in and Best Buy
headquarters or HQ BestBuy HQ
we're gonna put in the position here
we're gonna say senior developer and
then we're going to put in the time so
we're gonna say time for this senior
developer here we're gonna put in the
the time so I say 9:30 9:30 a.m. okay
alright so we just finished this whole
thing now for this this whole card right
here for now nothing that we're not
going to do it but for now we're not
going to do it because this we're gonna
need something else like d3 or or like
let's say I don't know
another graphing or charts Jes and we're
not gonna duel arena maybe I'll do it at
the end of the video but right now this
tutorial is just about HTML CSS for the
moment okay now what we're gonna do is
the rest of the other sections which is
this and what we're going to do it is
we're gonna come create MC another
section so we got a section counseling
area we got heading we got the cards and
then after we have the cards we have the
table down here okay so let's put in the
table we're gonna save table
okay and then here we gonna say T head
for the table head okay alright now next
thing we want to do here is basically we
got the head which is this and we got
the body which is this so we're gonna
come here you're gonna put in a table
row and inside of it we're gonna say th
th so let's say
company jobs and of application sorry
Mikey boy just died for no reason like
seriously okay so let's come back to the
image and of application okay location
okay location so this doesn't make sense
end of application okay whatever let's
just keep it like that end of
application in location okay company all
right so we're gonna come in and put in
the tee body and the first one I'm gonna
say TR online shopping okay online
shopping and then we're gonna put in TD
TD okay for now let's just
cover this so it's like Java developer
say July 28 2018 and location let's say
New York New York alright so we just did
the whole HTML for this whole section
here and everything from here to here
except this one and we did this all
right now the next video that we're
gonna do is is styling this up with CSS
so right now you guys just got to see
how we do this with just plain HTML now
just so you can see exactly what we just
built we're gonna start a little bit of
the CSS this is just for now because I'm
gonna leave the rest to the next video
so for now we're gonna say counting area
padding left to 80 pixels all right let
me save that make sure we have the ID so
instead of class we're gonna use ID and
data so you have all our information in
there okay now let's change this from
padding to actually a margin margin left
save that and then we're going to put in
a little padding
of let's say 15 pixels okay so it could
be a little bit more organized alright
