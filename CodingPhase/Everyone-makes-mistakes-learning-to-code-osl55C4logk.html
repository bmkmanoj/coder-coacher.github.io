it again man : please calm I'm out here
you already know still the morning drive
and there's my morning drives to work
you know a little quick video for you
guys but yeah man we're going to talk
about you know not giving up man
especially when you find the problem
that is just it's holding you back and
you like them and I can't get through
this like you know what I mean like
I say an example somebody like you guys
is having troubles away
Ajax right an example right I'm not
saying that you guys are but let's say
you're having a problem with Ajax and
you like them and I'm doing a post
request and nothing is being saved or
I'm doing a get request and I'm not
getting the data object I'm supposed to
be getting you know sometimes you get to
see you know little bumps and little
 in code that you know it's out
of your hands you know it's out of your
hands like you're still a beginner so
understand that once you understand hey
I'm still a beginner I'm not gonna quit
coding just because I found a freaking
block that I can't do at this moment
just think about it and be like hey just
continue it look on Google look on Stack
Overflow you know
AK somebody come back here to you to
leave a comment here most of the people
that are in my you know in my comments
they know how to how to do certain
things where you know let's make this a
community where we could help each other
out you know what I mean so don't don't
let your brain being a fog and say hey
you know what I don't know this
I'm quitting cold don't quit because of
it don't quit because you just found a
little block that you can't do or you're
having troubles because at the other and
at the end of the day you're going to
notice it was something so dumb ass you
missed the semicolon or you missed a
comma or you only put it
you know one single quote instead of the
other thing we call - you know -
clothing close the string whatever it is
right so most of the time is always like
some dumb little mistake and it's not
really about hey you can learn code it's
more about just a human mistake
everybody makes mistakes so just because
you make a mistake doesn't mean like
hain now you're going to quit clothing
man you know that's what I wanted to
make this little video about today just
you know little because you find a
little block that you can't do what you
having trouble with don't think that
everything else being cold is hard
sometimes you got to walk away from it
and come back to it later you know what
I mean like this you've been coding for
3-4 hours and the Shh is not working
leave it alone come back the next day
you know and then the next thing I'm
pretty sure you're going to find what
was wrong with it a lot of times is
because your brain is tired or you're
just tired you just been looking at the
screen for too long and you can't even
find a little mistake you know how many
comes out I've had that problem way I'm
missing like our freaking comma a
semicolon a closing bracket like
plenty of time
you know that's why sometimes it's good
to have on something like an es plate
but at the same time is kind of annoying
how he is listing starting uses that
much
why yeah a lot of times you're gonna
have like little problems that's going
to come in and kind of make you want to
wait but those witnesses can finish the
little flock that you're trying to say
you know I mean like come on guys you
understand this is this is how cold is
like there's always going to be
something that's kind of block
your way to finishing the project it
could be anything could be you think it
could be somebody else you're working
with it could be libraries are you
downloading and then you realize all of
your code is perfect
so the libraries is down to it it's
 it doesn't work a lot
of times she liked to have you know so
don't play calling man keep doing your
thing and as always make this little
quick reading about this because you
find a little block or on your way
that's stopping you for the moment those
things that you have to quit coding is
the custom just walk away and then
compact you already knows you put your
back at it again allocate you know
location is any other message he was
like oh yeah man like I've stuck on this
and like it
schools that I'm dumb and I can't do
cold air play bro you just gotta keep
going you can't just stop because you
found one little problem
and then who I was leaving his me out
that he's a cage
oh yeah no sorry I was missing a comma
I'm like yeah it was like you gotta keep
going so I'm thinking that is because
you can't find a solution for something
like that moment doesn't mean that your
adult Lee can Fontaine finish it come on
man
you already knows you're poor chill back
at it again
Koda freeze calm make sure you subscribe
make sure you like this video man
there's a lot of drug this is not like
you know something planned is just
something that every morning I'm going
to do real quick just reuse eyes after
one channel or tell you about anything
that's happening in my life
