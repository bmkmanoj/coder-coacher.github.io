face.com and now we're gonna talk about
list method
okay so let's methods is actually my
favorite part of Python and any
programming language out there like you
know like this is where I have fun okay
so we're gonna start with the very
simplest thing so we're gonna have a
variable call users and in here we're
gonna say there's gonna be Joe there's
going to be Barbara okay there's going
to be Jacob there's going to be cam and
there's going to be Miss Jones right
okay so there's a Miss Jones
alright so how can we add rain how can
we add a new name to this list very
simple okay we could actually use append
all right so we're gonna come here and
we're gonna say users dot append and
we're gonna pass in let's say Johnny
okay everything's fine come here and
we're gonna print users so I'm gonna say
print users let's see what's inside of
it as if you see Johnny is in there but
let's say we had a list of numbers
alright and we say we just wanted to add
this to in there so we're gonna say
numbers equals to let's say two three
four five six seven okay let's say we
wanted to append the numbers to this
array okay sorry this list so used to
Java
okay so we come here and one thing that
you're gonna notice is that basically
all we did was just add the array inside
of this array but wait what if I wanted
to just have all of the numbers to be
part of the first array not having it
inside of the array meaning I wanted to
have the number two as an index inside
of the first array and the 3 and the 5
and the 6 and the 7 well we can actually
do this by saying extend so you could
say
extend numbers so that users are 8 and
as you can see instead of having a list
here all we did was we took all of the
items inside of the numbers
list right and then we just put it
inside of the users list okay so that's
one of the ways to do this now you have
other cool things that you can say sort
you could come here and say reverse so
we're gonna do a little something we're
gonna come here and we're gonna say
users that sort okay you're gonna run
it says okay
ah never and a supporting instances of
int and strings okay so that's however
that you're gonna see you can't sort
numbers and strings at the same time
okay so what we're going to do is
instead of extending this numbers here
we gotta take this out comment it out
okay
and we're just gonna keep the names
alright so for now when we come here
it basically go b CJ j j m and one thing
that you're gonna notice is that it's
just in capitalized order right so
basically we just sorted it out from A
to Z all right now if we wanted to
reverse it we could say reverse true
and as you can see it starts from z28
okay so it goes M Jay Jay Jay C B okay
so that's an easy way to do it now let's
say you want to just reverse it you can
literally just look at what we have here
which is just say hey reverse alright
you can come here and say you're Reverse
okay reverse no D sorry about that
and automatically what I did was
basically it took whatever we had here
at first it brought it to the end so it
just basically reversed the whole list
that we created here okay so as you can
see it goes Joe Barbara
Jacob cam Miss Jones that's how we had
it here but now it basically goes Johnny
Miss Jones came Jacob Barbara Jo and
Johnny is added at the end when we
appended it over here all right so
that's what's happening now if you guys
know about functional programming you
know there's a lot of cool stuff that
you could do here with you know LAN so
if let's say you wanted to find out how
many indexes are inside of this array
right well this list I keep saying array
but you guys know what I mean
all right so you're gonna say users that
reverse so now we're gonna come here and
we're gonna say hey I want to find out
how many are in here so I'll go out of
the goal like this I can say Len okay
and then put users inside of it and then
automatically returns to me 6 so at
first we started with 1 2 3 4 5 5 names
then we added Johnny and then as you can
see it knows that hey there's actually
six different names inside of the users
now let's say we wanted to get something
out of this main array okay we say hey I
want to actually remove Jacob out of
this how can I actually get him out of
this users list very simple I can come
here and say like this users dot and
then I say pop and then I put in the
index of the Jacob name okay so I'll
come here and say 0 1 2 so I was gonna
pop the number 2 index out of the okay
so I'm gonna say users print it so guys
to see what's going on and one thing
that you're gonna notice it's like wait
Jacob still there why is Jacob still
there and you're gonna realize that what
happens is basically you
look at the order of operation how
things are being run with the code so
first of all we declare users here okay
and then from there we say okay we have
numbers right we didn't do anything with
numbers but here we appended Johnny okay
so that basically added Johnny at the
end okay so now there's one two three
four five six so there's six names in
there and then we reversed it so we had
Johnny on the side we had miss Jones on
this side and then we had kam on this
side as the second index so then when we
say pop the second one the one that got
removed was actually camp remember cuz
we reversed it so if we want to come
back take this out we run this you'll
see that Jacobs no longer there and so
if you say users pop - so you're saying
Joe Barbara and then Jacob was here so
that got removed and basically we bopped
Jacob out of here okay
so there's like the basic stuff that
you're gonna be able to do with list I
would recommend definitely check out the
documentation and see all the different
things that you can do with a list and
what are the metastar already building
for list so yeah I'll see you guys in
the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
