HTML CSS is your boy Joe okay I wanted
to tell you guys about CSS I kind of
give you a little bit about it on the
last video but I want you to have more
background all right all right just a
little bit what exactly is it that CSS
stands for so in cascading style sheet
like there's been around for over 20
years you know it started in the 90s
it's a way to basically edit a page
style it's exactly what's a style sheet
right so you have CSS everywhere the
whole web is made of CSS raised HTML CSS
and JavaScript of course but CSS is the
one that gives it the colors the one
that changes the font size the one that
basically organizes things on the page
so the start is taking a look at certain
things right so like let's say this page
right we right-click this this has a
style funny so if we come here we would
expect well inspect the element right so
we could come here click that and we
could see that the line hi is inherited
margin size is 0.5 M if we wanted we
could come in and change it and say blue
will be changing to red or we could say
font size I'll say 44 pixels make the
size huge you know with the change
almost every option that you can think
of we know through CSS a website a lower
without CSS is ugly it's hitting it it's
just regular text
all right so matter of fact I'm going to
show you guys right now something from
you know if we just style it I think
that's probably to see in other pages
that we did another core
tutorials right and we come here we open
this file there's not gonna be any
styles on it at all
so we're gonna see the big difference
between there's no styles and when we
introduce certain styles to it right so
as you can see this how regular HTML
looks like without right now let's say
we want to start styling it up we come
here and say style menu thread MSA is
this stuff menu oops
stuff menu li list-style:none MSA color
code background black color white and
let's see how that looks all right so if
we do that we start giving it some
styles you can start organizing this
page it make it how we want it so that's
what CSS is it's just basically is a
style sheet to basically control
elements on the page and say hey we want
this font to be red we want this form to
be 20 pixels bag you know we want the
wave of this element alone to just be a
waste of you know 400 pixels you know so
now is just 500 pixels now let's start
making this like this a three paragraph
margin:0 auto and then si with 500
pixels line height of 1.5
let's see how that looks all right
see this thing here let's delete this
stuff organizes margins bottom let's say
50 pixels let's make this wife let's
make the list styles this is you like
that from now let's create a little
something for this links is make some
display:inline-block let's make this
here with 500 pixels norwich and zero
Auto alright padding:0 okay now it's
also the list let's let's remove this
with from here
I'll see how I look menu background like
this let's make this play in my okay now
is place margin of 50 pixels and as you
can see now the pages of those are will
organize so what I'll see it CSS the
page is just you know default styling
which makes this look hideous
alright you see it's not gonna say shame
and got crazy bullet points like you
know what I'll see you sense the paste
is doesn't look good so that's what we
are going to learn next
right kids see you in a little bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
