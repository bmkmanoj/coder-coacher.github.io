YouTube will be like a day or two to
maximum for the past year it has only
been two days the maximum that I haven't
dropped a video or haven't gotten live
you know so now I don't know where I'm
gonna get my internet connecting so when
you don't know when your internet is
gonna get connected the people who was
this company Xfinity hit me up with the
line of like hey man we don't know what
they they're gonna be available this
week to bring anything for you and come
connect it for whatever reason the
people that used to live there never had
internet like in 2017-2018
who doesn't have internet how you don't
have service for Internet in a house
like you're telling me all these years
you just never wanted to get some
Internet in your house like so now they
got to come in and connect all of that
like manually it's not like okay the the
service is there for you know it's like
hey we're gonna have to bring in the
wires and connect this and like really
like really you know like come on it's
2017 you tell me those people that used
to lived there for like ten years never
connect the Internet in their house like
no cable or nothing
like it's kind of crazy yeah but
everything's good with my family we got
man alive without Wi-Fi man there's
always a Starbucks yes there's always a
Starbucks but it's not the same way man
it's not the same thing when I you know
how many times I come here live and and
come hang out with you guys I do this
all the time so who knows - when I'm
gonna have this installed in my house so
it kind of sucks I gotta go you know
record videos then go to a Starbucks and
upload it there and then you guys get to
see me it's not the same thing that's
where I'm live you know what I'm live
that's when the source be trippin man
that's when your boy comes in you just a
you know what I mean
like we're being here hey yo
by the way since this is the last video
we just hanging out this is not gonna be
like too crazy you guys could ask me
questions about coding but this is more
like you know farewell for X amount of
days you know we don't know how long
it's gonna take but I know it's not
gonna be this weekend for sure I'm
moving this weekend so this whole
weekend is gonna be headache today I
drove for literally nine hours straight
like oh my god I'm so tired going back
and forth from you know Connecticut to
New York and like man traffic I'm so
beat so tired but the only thing that
gives me power and energy is talking to
you guys I was really like down because
I'm tired I didn't even get to go to
sleep that much yesterday cuz I was
knocking out all the videos for the CSS
animations and I wanted to get all those
videos done for you guys so you guys
could go in there and start creating
animations but what happened is I needed
to wake up by 7:30 and I went to sleep
at 3 o'clock in the morning so I'm mind
you you know how it is when you go to
sleep at 3 it takes you an hour to
really full
sleep so I'm therefore like to vote for
clock almost 5 o'clock in the morning
and then I probably fell asleep wake up
at 7:30 gotta get ready do all this
stuff and then from there drive for like
9 hours straight today and it was crazy
so I say you know what what's gonna make
me feel good right now and it's actually
come talking to you guys you know if you
guys notice this about me I'm all about
energy like this days I'm really in a
good mood that's energy something down
this Energy's like my energy could be
upset could be a mad I could be whatever
whatever my situation could be happening
I come here and I share it with you guys
right and then at the same time when I
talk to you guys it levels me back off
to being normal just you know coming
here just drip you know what I mean just
chill I could have a lot of stress but
then without talking I hang out with you
guys to answer your questions and just
chill with you guys then I come back to
being normal alright so yeah man we here
man you boy I have even shaved nothing
I've been just grinding I've been
knocking out videos for you guys so you
guys could definitely be good all of
these days
but yeah man it's crazy man you're a
busy man why am i moving to the woods
man now I'm not going nowhere guys I'm
moving to another state which I told you
guys a while back but all of the courses
all of my videos or everything is is in
here man
you know with my boy snugs man snugs
what up man yo
snugs you're available right now son
send me your email coding phase at
gmail.com so I can send you the invite
right now let's go live man I've been
wanting guys I've been wanting to have
this guy on my my live stream for a long
time man for a very long time you know
we got Chris Shawn in here man Chris
Shawn without man I was seeing your
Instagram man what happened to the
camera what the hell you dropped it a
sudden that you broke it you have to go
get a fix man you gotta be careful with
that man it's not send me an email right
now coating phrase at gmail.com so I
will send it to you send you the link
and you can hop on this this live stream
real quick and we could just rip open
this this live stream right now guys
Schnucks is legit man oh man all right
cool but send me the email Zarqa send
you the link and you happen whenever you
want no it's not click me this is
actually a legit thing on YouTube this
might be the last video for a long time
I don't know it could be like a week you
get what I'm saying like I'm all be
honest I'm not one of these people that
would be like hey man I'm gonna record a
video in my house and then I'm gonna go
to Starbucks and upload a video and do
this and that guys I'm not one of those
guys that's gonna go to Starbucks and be
sitting down there for like god knows
how long it takes to upload this videos
I'm not doing that being honest that's
just not me facts you know what I mean
like I'm I'm the type of doulas like hey
if this thing is not in my house okay
I'm gonna have to wait on it you know
what I mean
Comcast will be two to three weeks word
you know what and that's one thing that
I take for granted like here has verizon
files where I'm moving to this note
Verizon files there's none of that so
when I upload a video
it goes super fast and this is crazy
so the the deal that Xfinity has is
you're forced to sign up to half cable
which I don't watch TV right so I'm
forced to do this right they don't let
you sign up just for internet so you
have to sign up for or the full package
and it's a two-year contract I'm lying
you now this might sound crazy to
somebody their deal is
a hundred megabytes down but six
megabytes upload I don't know what's
gonna happen with that I'm gonna be
going through hell like to be honest
with you guys like if I were to know
like that was gonna be a issue I
probably wouldn't even have moved
because I need my upload speed to be top
speed and it's crazy
let me see sorry yeah man it's freaking
crazy that they're high code it's like
their internet is so slow like is good
for download but what about uploads so
somebody told me that I mean the guy in
the the freakin machine whatever the
machine the custom service guy he's like
hey you can sign up for a business plan
and I'm like you telling me like I have
to sign up for a business plan to get
twenty five megabytes upload like this
sounds crazy like I'm so used to City
stuff like I'm from the city man you
know the man from New York so even
though living out here in Long Island is
still
consider part of New York you know it's
very close to New York City so the
infrastructure is there but you start
moving outside of the major cities now
you start bumping into problems like
this like this is kind of ridiculous and
this is one of the reasons why I don't
mind you know net neutrality because
this is ridiculous that only in the
major cities you get really good service
and then outside of that everybody else
just gets almost nothing and that's the
thing where I was like from the
beginning I was like wait net neutrality
is gonna suck right but then at the same
time it gives you the opportunity to say
hey I'm paying premium I want fast
internet in my area no matter where I
live currently it's not like that
currently it's like hey the internet or
service providers they're just like okay
we gotta service everybody that's in the
major cities because there's a lot of
people around there
whoever's outside of those cities you
gotta fend for yourself you gotta be out
here with DSL numbers you know what I
mean
dial-up numbers you know I mean like
five megabytes upload like that reminds
me of like 2001 2002 when we used to
have a Verizon DSL like that's
old-school man and that's what I'm gonna
have to be dealing with so let me see
let me see what's out here I want to
find something yeah man let me know what
you guys is up to man I wanna know what
you guys is is definitely doing today I
mean anybody working on on the CSS
animation course that I created it's
still missing the other part which is
comes in with G sap which is the
JavaScript I'm gonna do that probably on
Sunday and now I'll go to freakin
Starbucks to upload it until my internet
gets in but yeah let me see
I'm trying to figure out is that I try
to look online to see freaking I don't
man let me just see something real quick
I'm looking right now and it's crazy man
the only service providers that I have
in the area where I'm going to live is
frontier DSL which I've never heard of
Xfinity which is cable and satellite
internet which is huge net I've never
heard of huge net I don't even know what
the hell that is
so the duck hugeness uh-huh download
speed are 25 megabytes download and then
upload is 3 megabytes
that's scary guys I'll be honest that's
freaking scary
this is crazy
so Xfinity has I don't know
the plan that I got is a hundred
megabytes in in like six megabytes up
like that's crazy I don't even know how
I'm gonna work with that like the
download speed is gonna be fine but I
don't know how can kind of survive at
those speeds man let me see who's in
here man
yeah that's crazy
spectrum is 100 megabytes down and five
megabytes up you know it's freaking
crazy man there's no word man struggle
net and word well you know this fine man
it's fine it's alright no I'm not I'm
not gonna cry about it
where am i moving to am moving to
Connecticut I mean it's right next to
the you know to flag another say this is
right next to New York
Connecticut's right next to the United
States yeah
Oh God let me see yeah moving to
Connecticut man it's the new frontier
man we out here we're gonna you know
we're gonna we're gonna try to make a
movement in Connecticut you know what I
mean like I'm oh I'm gonna find all the
meetups I'm gonna tell you guys about it
for any of you guys that are living in
Connecticut let me know if there's any
meetup groups or any cool people out
there cuz you know me I when I come into
town I really like yo who is who whose
kid is this like oh who's that once we
start coming in come in with the gold
fronts you know bring out a change
coming with the guala yo so this is this
how you know this is small this is a
small town right I go to like a TD Bank
and I'm like okay I want to take out ten
thousand dollars from my bank account
and the lady looked at me like I'm about
to rob the place I'm like I'm I'm
looking for ten thousand dollars to you
know take out my bank account and she
say that's a lot of money you got a
calling for that I'm like you're telling
me nobody in this goddamn town goes into
the bank and takes out $10,000 cash are
you telling me that she's like no you
have to call in our biggest um our
bigger is how you call that another Bank
they have to call in another TD Bank
that's a bigger chain than them so bring
in the money I'm like how you ain't got
no money over here like don't people
come in here and like bringing money
into this place you know I was like yo
this is crazy
like I was literally there for like half
an hour
half an hour to like 40 minutes waiting
for them to get $10,000 like is not that
hard like how can you just not go in
there and be like okay boy and then on
top of that like literally the safe
whatever was the safe
that he had as a safe it was open like
I've never seen that I've never bring
into a bank this is how you know it's a
small town I go into I go in there right
and I'm in the talking to the teller you
have the door to the freaking safe wide
open it looks empty as in there
like nobody put no money in there I was
like yo this is ridiculous like this
2018 and you telling me nobody has
$10,000 in here cash that you can pull
out they had to do a special order to
bring it from another freaking Bank and
then they came and then give me the
money gave it to me if you've seen my
video on Instagram I put it I was like
okay whatever

just just for the hell of it this is you
know when you come out pay n you know
when you have money in the bank right

from there I gotta go into my other
websites one of my website was down last
night and then that website being down

have been like a good
$400 loss in a day so I'm not trying to
lose 400 odds

got I got gear this is in high school I
don't need to be sure I know if I got
gear I got gear I don't need to be sure
enough every single day you know what I
mean like when I come here is I need to
be comfortable there's like my you know
how when you were hanging out with your
boys you know you go to play ball you
know one guy might be broke one guy
might have money one guy might be good
but everybody's equal because y'all have
like a real just comfortable shirt a
comfortable you know shorts
or sweatpants so everybody doesn't
matter where everybody is that we're all
equal at the same time you know what I
mean so that's how I coming here coming
in just naturally you know what I mean
but like I said man it's crazy it's
crazy man sometimes you got you gotta
give yourself awards man nobody's gonna
do that for you I'm gonna talk to you
you that is trying to learn you know
you're trying to learn how to code
you're trying to become something in
your life right you don't want to be
Johnny you know Johnny who's living in
the same apartment you know two blocks
away from where you grew up at you don't
want to be that guy right you want to be
the guy that to say hey I can move to
wherever the hell I want all right you
want to be the guy that say hey tomorrow
I want something I'll go and get it
there is no limits to me all right if
you want to get to that point you have
to give yourself awards because all of
the stuff that you're doing right now
and it's gonna pay off at the end but
it's really annoying I'll be honest it's
really annoying who wants to be in front
of a computer all day learning to code
watching videos and videos trying things
out almost breaking your head debugging
things that don't work you know and then
when you finally get it to work you like
oh man yes finally well nobody's there
to come in and be like you found that
bug nobody's there for you you know what
I'm saying so how can you make your life
better
you gotta give yourself something buy
yourself a brand new MacBook buy
yourself a brand new car buy yourself a
little vacation go for vacay go to Vegas
a lot of people never even been to Vegas
a lot of people never even been to Miami
go to freakin go to edit league go to
France go to Thailand you know if you
got the yellow fever that's where it's
at you know what I mean like tilings
despot if you want to go if you want to
get the high quality the high grade you
gotta go to China all right so you guys
know me man I'm just messing around but
it's true you gotta give yourself
Oh words man you can't just come in here
work hard and not give nothing to
yourself you gotta give yourself
something man you gotta you know you
know give yourself your own applause you
know this times I'm here you know I'm
coding something I'm stuck and I'm like
ah man like in gold and I still you know
have issues with calling all right
there's a lot of stuff that I hate and
golang but I like the challenge right so
when I'm here stuck and I'm stuck in a
debugging something ah man you see this
is why I like Roo because this is easy a
Ruby what goal ain't gotta be so hard
right I'll be screaming like dying here
and wife it comes ringing in here and
knocks on the doors I kill you okay I'm
like leave me alone for a second I'm
finding some bugs and trying to fix this
you know when I find that bug then I
come back in and my oh cool you did it
Joe you know I come in I like so your
boy gets the big bucks now I don't say
that
I just be like Gil I'll be saying this
to myself all the time
yo your boys nice whenever whenever I
find a bug I wish I could have like a
camera on me like 24/7
cuz this times that I just find a bug or
I find a solution to something and for
some reason I just be like yo your voice
nice like yo I don't know do you guys do
that like right after you just figure
something out just be like oh there you
go
you know I mean like I don't know I mean
hyping myself up man like a lot of times
man but yeah let's look was it wasn't a
chat right now you're probably thinking
like your Joe is crazy like always man
yo man for real don't okay so
getting loose Ruby on Rails now this is
just a you know this this is just an
email right and which is to me
completely hilarious that I keep hearing
people telling me Oh Rubio Road isn't
that guys that's like a myth
you know I mean I'm being honest that's
like a myth when people tell you all
Ruby is there rubies this and that guys
there's so much money a ruby right now
like if somebody tells you that just
ignore them
I'm telling you right now this is just a
regular email that I get constantly this
is stuff that I get all the time I don't
see this happening with JavaScript I
don't see that with any other language
you know and I do my research guys this
is not just oh I got one EEMA no I do
our freakin research is it hi Jacory
fortune 100 company who are looking to
hire Ruby developers to join our team
and all saying they looking arrange for
developers from junior through senior
and such half range of salaries
available if you're a ruby developer and
are looking for opportunity Austin
there's an opportunity that you sure
surely to take a look at the basic
requirement basics Ruby on Rails or
similar frameworks so pretty much if you
know laravel you could come in and say
hey I know Larry Bell and very similar
to Ruby on Rails well if you already
know Ruby on Rails you're already golden
you know building web services using
production applications like if you've
created any of the projects that I built
with you guys you guys are ready for
that designing implementing REST API
which is like so easy because is
building with Ruby on Rails like this
shouldn't even have been asked they
shouldn't even be be on the list right
so they're like Postgres or my sequel
like and there's just like I told you
guys this like from beginners to seniors
like juniors to seniors like the money
is there man
like this is not me and I come in on my
own trying to pump up I'm trying to
bring up the numbers or Ruby on Rails
none
the numbers are there like the numbers
is right there it's up to you if you
want it you know what I'm saying a lot
of you guys that live in the south that
live in Texas and as you can see this
people in Austin Daye looking for junior
developers there's rarely any place that
I've seen that you guys know about it
try searching online junior developer
where are you finding those like this
barely any jobs for that even just for
that title right most companies just
want a mate level to a senior level and
the reason why they say that is because
they don't want to spend the time to
train you for six months so if you see a
company talking about hey we don't mind
hiring junior developers that means they
have time you know they got time today
cuz like they got time for you they got
time to train you they got time to to
have you make mistakes on the website
and then from there they could come in
have a senior developer help you out
like you can't go wrong guys like this
is this how it is man it's the real
world versus whatever is being sent on
the internet you know I don't listen to
what people say on the internet because
when it comes to it most of these people
have their own agendas it's like right
now I could come in and tell you my
favorite language right now is Crystal
Lake I also love Ruby on Rails but I'm
super fan of Crystal Lake
but I'm not gonna tell you hey man
crystal Angus is the place where all the
jobs is that because that's not the
reality there's no jobs for Crystal Lake
right crystal Lange is like experimental
until they release version 1.0 and more
companies get on top of it okay
or even golang if I come in I tell you
try to jump into Golding as a junior
developer with no years of experience
you're pretty much wasting your time you
have to have some type of years under
your belt because the companies are
using coding they're not gonna trust you
straight off the boat just as a hey man
I just learned it I just learned in this
world of developers and we're gonna you
know can you trust me with your golang
system is like nah man get
the skit about him and that's just how
they're gonna do to you but when you
have things like PHP Ruby on Rails
people are jumping ship
right they let them jump ship a lot of
people that jump in ship from PHP jump
into let's say no js' it works for them
because no js' has a whole bunch of
issues like you guys don't even know it
has a whole bunch of issues but if you
are an experienced developer you can
handle that and you can go through him
but I'll get cool you don't get
everything that you get in laravel but
at least you come in and you can build
it or like let's say you don't get
everything that you having in other
back-end languages and put they have
little hacks they have little libraries
that people create it but if you're a
junior developer is like you why would
you want to be in that world you know
what I mean so it's like you want
something that's gonna get you high as
soon as possible so that's all I'm
saying man like you guys got a got a
definitely you know no Ruby on Rails man
learn Ruby the basics of it I have a
great course on the site whatever and
you guys learn if you want to bite it
like I said everything that I come here
and that was like I forgot who was there
I don't know if it was was this kid's
name Baker something I don't know if it
was Baker Baker tamer on Berk a tamer
he's like oh man he said sometime I
don't he don't mean it in a bad way but
he said oh it's like just talking about
animations here comes the course and
it's like broke of course it's gonna be
your course I'm not doing this stuff for
me like I could care less
literally I'll be honest I could care
less about CSS animations or Ruby on
Rails or any of these are stacks at all
like if I really want it to be about the
money I will make a Python course
literally like a Python course will make
me way more money than what I'm making
with everything else but all I'm doing
is basically coming in and creating
stuff that is gonna get you guys in jobs
and get you guys hired quick because I
already been through it you know what
I'm saying like you gotta learn from my
mistakes you know what I mean like you
guys you guys don't but when I came in I
didn't have a good hike on it's like I'm
a mentor I didn't have nobody even when
YouTube there was a whole bunch of
cornballs
that I could even relate and I couldn't
even watch them because they were
talking about stuff that were geared
towards people with computer science
degrees and it's like where's the guys
that make it without no degrees why
aren't they talking so all the things
that I do here is for a reason for you
guys it's not for me like I'll be honest
like I could literally be like okay if
tomorrow or god forbid my website went
down everything got hacked whatever
everybody got deleted all my videos
deleted I'll just be like okay cool
great I'll do something else I'd do all
the other stuff that I've been doing I
have my own websites I make everything
all my money comes from my websites and
you know from clients and doing
freelancing or if I really wanted to be
like how you call there's like worry
about money like I just go back to work
like what the hell do I need to be
putting myself on the Internet over here
selling courses for like literally like
super cheap it's not for me trust me is
not for me if it was for me I will be
doing other stuff like hey guys here's a
500 out of course here's a you gonna say
like I could be doing that but I'm not
you know what I mean so it's like when I
come in is because I start doing
research I'm like first of all I feel
like we've already talked about
everything that we could talk about here
on the web right as far as like getting
jobs all the things that you need to do
right so now what I'm doing is this year
is finding the right topics that is
going to help you have like a leg up
above everybody else right if
I come in and I started seeing hey they
looking for graph QL there's a large
amount of jobs looking for people that
know graph QL I'm gonna come in and I'm
gonna basically teach graph QL for you
guys so you guys could get jobs it's not
for me so be like oh cool
so graph QL is popular and I'm gonna
create a graph QL course no I could care
less I could literally be playing ps4
right now okay like everything that I do
is not for me is for you guys and that's
100 percent being honest with you guys
right like it's my way to give back to
you guys for supporting me and showing
love so when I come in I'll tell you
guys about something is because it's
really out there when I say hey Ruby on
Rails is popular right now and they
giving opportunities to a lot of junior
developers and I come in and I create a
course in Ruby on Rails is because for a
reason that basically most of the people
that are gonna create a course or the
courses are out there they are extending
a course that could have been done for
you guys in four or five hours they're
extending it to 27 hours 37 hours who
wants to sit in front of a computer for
37 hours learning stuff that you could
learn on the go as you become a
developer you get what I'm saying like
all my courses are basically summarizing
all the things that you need to get
higher it's not everything that's in the
documentation because things that are in
the documentation you could go and find
it yourself
you're gonna st. so with all that being
said I want you guys to you know when I
come in there I'll tell you guys about
something it's because it's for a reason
is because I come in I look into it you
know but like I said let me send my
email to your boy snugs
snugs let me know I just sent you the
email right now oh man I'm getting tired
my eyes are shutting down but
we're gonna be up we're gonna be up come
on man we're not going to sleep
you're not going to sleep not yet we
about to get your boy
snugs in here man and there's somebody
that you guys definitely need to know
about this guy is legit somebody that I
look up to somebody that I come in and
I'm definitely looking into his career
his Instagram his all his moves I'm I'm
there I'm like this with a platform I'm
just worried snugs you're doing this a
were snugs you out here like that you
know somebody that I could say I respect
because I feel he he's armed
I don't know how could I say like I can
relate to him you know I was like
somebody comes in with the sauce he's
just comfortable who he is you know what
I mean like not a lot of developers out
here is like that man
so as I can't test it 1 2 aah
how was good Joe man you called me eatin
though I was eating up this White Castle
man you called me a cheat their way so
you know my boy a check a check
let's go what you ain't here's nuts what
up that's real bad oh my god it's just a
pleasure and honor to be up in the same
spot with you man I already know how you
get down I'll follow you eating the
popcorn like Michael Jackson just like
you yeah I'll be like yo I'll be telling
people's like people that you know like
I you know sometimes you got you know
the Internet is amazing because it's
like you might come in and be like man I
don't even you know like for me I'm
gonna tell you like my example like I'm
a developer right but this rarely
anybody out there that I'll be like oh
man I go hang out with that dude I could
be cool but I dude I got like you know
how cool be you know I would love to
work with that person right there's
really any situation
like that because a lot of people
they're not they're not coming from the
places that we come from and they don't
have the sauce you know what I mean
even though I'm very open to everybody
but it's not as rare that I get excited
you know what I mean it's rare that I
get excited but oh man this dude is
killing it you know it is rare that you
see that
so definitely love everything that
you're doing and yeah man yes absolutely
what's good with this I can't see the
chat right now that's kind of strange
but I'm definitely here for that Ruby on
Rails talk I'm here for that JavaScript
talk all that modern framework it's not
going to let me know the questions
though you got to let me know the
questions I can't see jack this is
freestyle is it straight it's like we
come in here we just chilling right now
you are here you in the hole right now
so you know we out see we're in the
black right now so yo sign so you got a
meet-up for Ruby or Ruby on Rails a new
dog yeah
how long you been doing this oh that's a
good question man um accent well which
one I mean I'm technically I'm part of
144 meetups and now run the NYC RB and
also I co organised another Ruby meet up
in New York City and I help organize and
do venues for NYC react community well
I'm for the know community well you know
so it's like wherever I can get in where
I can fit in man I start a stacking
chair see that's what folks don't
understand I stacked chairs I would just
be the first one it's a meto the last
one to leave I will help stack chairs
you know all the pizza up that's what I
was really doing on the slide and then
they tossed the keys to you boy right
right time luck is when opportunity
meets preparation that's crazy so how
long have you like when do you start I
mean as far as let's go back let's go
way back way back in the time machine
okay so when this Snuggs
really started getting into programming
sure I want to say man it was Ruby to
help me man I fell in love with the
language so much
I messed around with dotnet all of that
it's like when rails 3 can't quite call
a year but it was around when rails 3
came out and I really got in the Ruby I
like oh man and I just fell in love with
it man I remember my girl - we used to
run a night club together in Virginia
anyway so I've told my mom about that
Glock dive hunts Agrella
you already dope yeah so he's a night
club back at my school in Virginia man
she was like she was a DJ and I ran the
club and it was one night we were
leaving out and she was in between these
two taxi cabs and she got a sandwich and
her knee was just messed up she had to
go to the hospital and everything and my
bully had my neighbor had was working
for rosetta stone which is right in that
area and he gave me the pickaxe book
mm-hmm and I sat there next to her
bedside I read the whole pickaxe book
the whole time I fell in love with Ruby
right then and there wow that's that's
around rails 3 is about rails 3 and then
I moved to New York man I got out I
started going to meetups in New York
City I just would cop that one way mega
bus ticket and I will come up to New
York stay for like a week cuz I'm from
the area but I went to school in
Virginia I would come up and then I was
like one of these days I'm gonna get a
job I'm gonna go to enough meetups
there's somebody gonna be like yo I got
a job for you you know just like how you
do and then I'm like one of these days
I'm gonna get a one-way ticket and I got
that one-way ticket learn now that's
what I've been telling people like all
the time - like man you know it's like I
don't know about going to me as I don't
know about you know doing all this stuff
and it's like man listen these people
I'll be honest in life is just how it is
this how it is is like there's people
that just have to look right if you're
one of those people that say hey man I'm
not waiting for lady luck to come in and
bless me and throw to me a little sauce
on top of me I'm not waiting for that
i'ma go getting that sauce myself and
make it happen if you wanna make it
happen you're gonna get it done you know
what I mean like a lot of people they
give up they're like oh you know I was
seeing a poster of somebody who was
doing learning to code for like three
years and I'm like no you could have
probably done it wait
sooner if you just went out there in
started networking and like not only
networking but at the same time going
for interviews how can you stay in your
house and not even try to get in the
game and go into the interviews because
you don't even know what what people are
asking for until you go to that first
interview and you get rejected you don't
say like for me I got rejected three
times before I even got the first job in
my first job wasn't even a legit company
it was like a ecommerce company but I
could have literally came in and said oh
man I can't get a job this thing is hard
you know I was like I'm gonna go back to
school I'm gonna go back to this and
that now what I did I say you know what
this thing is not working I got this
opportunity to work in his arm
wholesaler reseller slash whatever on
eBay but I got to get I got to get the
opportunity to use HTML and CSS just to
write that just to edit the listings
right so now when I came in I got high I
was there for like three to four months
right
I came in I already got that stamp a
company already trusted me right so then
your next company that you come in
you're like hey I got this websites I
got this skills this is what I know and
I got this company that trusted me so
because they trusted me
now all the other companies say you know
what somebody already gave him the
chance we're not taking that risk you
get what I'm saying like once you get
that first job you good you know what I
mean you're in the game that's saying
I'm not even just the first job to Joe
you know it's it's more like like I mean
well I played football I went to school
up I got a full tuition football
scholarship right and it's all about
it's not about the touchdowns it's about
what you fumble and you're like oh what
do I do now
Mamadou just roll around on the ground
you know what I mean and there's nothing
wrong with fumble and it's like all
right well how do you learn cuz yo to be
told I think I think the worst thing
that could happen to somebody get a good
first job let's talk about that you know
it's true it's true it definitely could
it could definitely hurt you you know
that even like let's say for example if
somebody like for myself right I feel
like
if I would have had the route of like
you know some people that come in and be
like off the gate like oh man
they found this key in a basement
freaking connecting frickin wires and to
a computer he was typing with his feet
like and then they say you know what
this kid is super talented signing onto
Facebook right you come in you your
Facebook and then now you didn't go
through the whole struggles you even go
through you know all the things to get
out there now what like what do you
aspire to after that you know I mean
like what what's your next goal how do
you move up on you know in the game for
me it's just like I rather just have
that long road of my okay I built all my
skills like they're everything that I
need to do I've worked on every single
type of application that you can do on
the web I've done all of them so it's
like now anything that comes up to me
and somebody tells hand can you build me
this website like this yeah okay cool I
already did that well can you do a REST
API with this ok cool can you do a
graphic you oh yeah I took a course
already on that
so already knowing so here you go you
know what I mean so it's like I'm always
up to the game no matter what you know
what I mean so yeah you gotta be I mean
in this day and age you have to you got
to be up on your skills you got to be
afraid to like truth be told just like
not afraid to mess up yeah I mean like
nobody's perfect it's all in a day's
work I mean really it's about like when
you wake up in the morning are you going
to have fun I mean it should be fun like
this is it with it this isn't the
wrapper game I mean you know we made
every now and again and you know we make
I hit them more like that again but
truth be told like this isn't the
wrapper game it's not like a 5 year
thing like this is something you can do
for however long you want to honor me
you know that's that's the beauty of it
that's the beauty of because you just
come in and literally there's so many
avenues which is what I tell people I've
heard people that come in and tell me
hey man oh you know it's like I want to
I want to be a real software engineer
and you know the web is boring and I
want to be creating applications like
this I'm my bro but it's just opening
the door
for you if you get the opportunity to
get into a good company as a web
developer listen that company already
gave you that step you could go in if
you know freaking Java and you're the
Java master and you could create Android
applications your next company that you
jump onto they gotta be like yo this guy
he got hired by this company so we're
already believing him so you got already
next step you know but some people they
you know I see all the time online like
people kind of downplayed the web and
that's what it's like for me my channel
I made it just about the web like I
could care less about anything else like
sometimes I talk about other languages
and other sides of the industry but my
whole thing is the web that's all I care
about you know because I don't want to
spread myself too thin and try to do
every single thing under the Sun and now
master anything you know what I mean so
what I tell people is like man web
development is where is that man like
everything that you can do right now on
the web is just like it's amazing I've
seen people create progressive web apps
right now that are better than even the
applications natively you know what I
mean there's so many things that you can
do you know even though Ruby the new
Ruby on Rails I haven't had the chance
to lie something that I was working on
Ruby on Rails was Ruby on Rails 4 and
then now I went in and just got
reintroduced with Ruby on Rails 5 with
all the new things that it has and I was
like yo man like you got the turbolinks
you got the a whole bunch of stuff down
like oh okay got the turbolinks you got
the active storage
you got the what else you got you got
the yarn integration now as of rails 5.1
you know you got the content security
policy going on you got the you got the
prefetch hints all of that you know this
is stuff that folks are like y'all whoa
whoa whoa slow down
No who said rails
who said rails don't got that that new
high a little bit of a little bit of
sauce to come yeah exactly you know
that's all thing there's like plus look
my whole channel is about like what I
tell everybody here I'm all about the
people that's trying to get into the
game
become developers but they want to get
jobs you know I'm not here you know to
come in and be like hey guys let's put
up you know three raspberry pies and
let's watch porn on raspberry pies like
I'm not into that right that's not what
that's not what I'm into I'm into it's
like hey how can we get jobs how can we
elevate people from you know even people
that are that feel like oh man I could
never be anything I could never get out
of this this social status where I'm at
this this class where am i from
it's like hey I was born poor and you
know my mama was poor my grandma was
poor and then you know me I'm gonna be
poor cuz that's how life is that's not
how life is man especially now now if
you have dedication on a certain thing
you you could come in and basically say
hey I'm either gonna be an entrepreneur
one will be a badass developer and come
in and make your money and then that
spreads around you know I mean like you
come in and you have a certain income
you can help your family you come in you
inspired that little cousin that you had
he's just out here of messing around
he's a damn bum look at my look at my
cousin he's doing his thing you know
it's like that's how you you inspire
people and it's just it spreads out man
I've seen a lot of people that you know
that you know they're already good let's
just say they're already good right but
if you're not good I feel like
development is it's the door for for
people to be able to change the lives
and to change the lives of people around
them you know cuz it that's what it did
for me you know I could have literally
been love Wayne
I freaking I was working in a parking
lot freaking after the parking lot I
graduated from school to working in a
freakin law firm of in Wall Street where
people was treating me like because
I was just the IT guy I'll never forget
this one day I'm in the office and I
come in and I'm like this guy tells me
oh man all of my data has been deleted
can you you restore this right
away understand that I got a meeting at
12 o'clock and I'm like bro this doesn't
work like that
and then the guy saying this is why you
got paid and you can't
do your job I was like yo I'm
looking around like yo we my little B s
a button-down shirt a little slack I'm
like you know like who are you talking
to like yeah because I'm in here doesn't
mean that I'm like your slave right but
to be honest with you if somebody talked
to me like that I'll take it if the
money was there it was worth it but for
me to be getting uh you know
forty thousand dollars a year and to be
after I graduated from school to get
that little bit amount of money I'm like
man this is B yes man you know I mean go
to school for like four years studying
freaking informational systems and this
and I'm like you know this is not worth
it you know what I mean
so it's like thank God I found this cuz
now I'm good I'm like I don't even have
to worry about nothing man and on top of
that just like me as an entrepreneur I
could come in and create an application
and that application just you know comes
in and just makes me like seven thousand
dollars a month just one application
that I just did it like a three-day
thing you know what I mean so I don't
think any other career would have done
that for me
you know I mean so that's how I look at
it you know what I mean so I hope that
you know I got I got a question for you
so I consider you I consider you a
leader in the community
yes excuse me got me choked up you see
somebody that I look up to for sure I
mean we both look up to each other I'm
trying to figure out from asking you in
particular Joe what are some of the
trials and tribulations like you have is
trying to be a leader like fight through
when it feels like you know not not that
you sitting here like you need a pat on
your back or something like that but I
mean like when you just need that extra
little off that coffee ain't gonna give
you and it's like you don't want to but
you you know you got to do it because a
lot of people depend on Joe yeah no
that's definitely you know there's like
this times down here right this sounds
like I could be upset this times I could
be freaking sad I could be tired could
be whatever but at the same time I know
so many people
were looking forward to that random
livestream that random video that I'm
just gonna come in and just give them
that motivation to come in and work
harder for that day that no matter what
I feel like I can't let them down even
though this whole video that's why I put
it on my Gil this this is my last video
for a long time this thing I might get
internet next week on Wednesday I might
get it the week after on a Tuesday
I don't know right but I haven't been
away from the community like for this
long more than two days like for two
days maximum
I always come in and drop some so new
content for them and you know as like I
always try to push myself and even when
I look into certain things like this
things that I don't want to talk about
but if I know that it's beneficial for
them I'll go out of my way in to talk
about it or to try to understand it more
on learning you know what I mean so plus
that's the fact that no matter you got a
machine I mean people have to understand
that there's the process and there's a
you know there's a there's a cadence and
you know they don't really see even two
behind the scene work like I already
know like what you do on the mic that's
just a portion of what you do on the
day-to-day I know already man yeah yeah
for sure because I gotta do so many
other things like throughout the whole
day I always tell people is like YouTube
is only 20% of everything that I do in
the whole day I mean there's other
things that I have to come in I have to
do research you know I never want to
come to talk about a topic you know at
this time so I come in and I do one
videos gonna take 20 minutes right but
I've been doing research for four or
five hours like before I even started
talking about Python and Ruby there's a
video that I did between Python and Ruby
I spent about five hours straight
looking into a whole bunch of states
looking into small cities you know the
little crazy little towns that you know
to figure out how many jobs are around
them that are for Ruby and are for
Python and I'm talking about for web
developers now talking about
development or data science I'm talking
about just web development so I had to
go in there and spend five six hours
doing the research before I ended the
video you gotta say so you know coming
in here and doing the video and hanging
out with everybody 20 minutes is it's
cool but the same time is like behind
the scenes there's like a five hour
thing that I had to do because the last
thing you want to do is come in and you
give an opinion about sign and somebody
calls you out and be like eight you got
the facts strong you got the facts wrong
man you know that mean I was watching
this I don't know if you've seen this um
this thing about what's this guy's name
Tai Lopez right to bring him up oh don't
even start with this guy Joe come on Joe
that listen man not to cut you off yeah
listen bro I've been in the crypto
community damn near since the beginning
and to see when somebody just pops up
out of the blue and like you know Bob
bitcoin al right next to my books yeah
anybody want to talk about Bitcoin
anybody looks a bit coy I don't know me
I don't knock him he elevates the people
mm-hmm but it's a you call you to close
mine yeah yeah man it's crazy because
the whole thing that I was gonna say
about him was at the same time that he
he has his own schemes he has all things
but you know sometimes when you don't do
the research on certain things people
call you out this is video that he they
live with somebody and they called them
out on a whole bunch of stuff and in a
way I kind of liked eye Lopes now
because now I feel he talked about
things like a human being you know
sometimes somebody might know more than
you but you could relate more to them on
a human being level and that's how I
feel about saiyr Lopez but all the
schemes that he does I know it's wrong
but at the same time I'm like man I just
feel bad for the dude you know what I
mean like he's smart too for marketing
but everything else is that he hasn't
done the research
and it's like the same thing with the
Bitcoin that you just brought up I did a
video on my website on my uncut videos
where pretty much I talked about them
like yo ty Lopez is a a Bitcoin expert
now like how you just pop up and be like
hey guys I'm popping up in all your ads
now it's like hey remember me now I used
to do real estate two months ago
I used to do marketing 3 months ago
today I'm the expert on Bitcoin you know
what I mean so it's like come on man
like you can't be doing that you know
what I mean so it's just crazy and talk
about Bitcoin man I mean I see you on
Instagram
oh Instagram and your boys at the
coinbase
like there's one thing that I gotta tell
you guys you guys gotta follow your
voice nuts on Instagram now you boy be
doing moves you know what I mean like
he's all all up in this big companies
like he's in there comfortable you know
what I mean like you know snug screw
going to Incheon Klaas if you know what
I mean
like the clear chunk plate that's do
word so tell me about that project I
mean what you're doing in there man what
you doing it going I mean you know you
know we did some things we got some big
dings coming along but I let's just say
this something is sometimes you work on
a project and it has its time but then
when we just start getting a little too
awkward you gotta know when to press
that ejector seat that's important to
folks gotta realize when you get on a
job you better know what that ejector
seats at because you might need to press
that button you don't want to be to do
that stuck in the cockpit when the
planes going down on and you don't know
where they eject to see buddy go
everybody bug something and nobody's
around you're letting it all right it's
like hey man what happened
go to lunch was like you know I believe
everybody
I believe everybody does hot crypto tip
I'm telling you what this is what to
focus on man so I mean I've been
developing I'm because cryptography is
cryptography I say crypto currencies
I've been involved in the field since
damn near the beginning but as far as
like oh I seen it I seen it in double
digits I seen it in triple digits
I knew what it was gonna do years and
years and years ago you know to me and
it's not about the price or the money I
get it you can make a lot of money but
I'll make it real simple for folks um
bitcoin is like the internet of money
email phase actually we're at the web
content publishing phase so think like
pre myspace error I don't know some
stuff like that whenever the internet
was like really old it's just that we're
an email and everybody's looking for you
too now I'm gonna tell you what because
all these crap coins are out and knows
people thing all it's the next Bitcoin
and that's just a destitute drawbridge
two words lightning Network I say await
me Joe lightning lightning Network all
brother just keep the eyes on that the
reason why I love it is because it
allows us to actually get to a level we
can start developing some cool stuff on
this maybe we can actually start writing
apps on this stuff instead of just
trading we just trading coins and
nobody's using them yeah that's what I
was wondering man to be honest with you
um like a week ago
I took out all my money from Bitcoin I
took my money out I took everything out
because first of all it was like a
nineteen thousand I bought in when I was
at two thousand and I made profit so I
say wasn't worth the $19 I was waiting
for that 20 I am once again 220 my cell
half of me
so then happy ones never touched that 20
engines dropped and I was like wait
actually dated went to 20 it went to 20
it went to 20,000 $1 and like 35 cents
on one of those exchanges I think like
bit trips or some it doesn't every time
right when it kisses that thousand it's
done that since 2000 by the way that's a
pattern if you look right when it kisses
that thousand mark it'll just
on me I understand folks don't get it
you know I know a dude who got in at 20k
this guy law this guy put 300 I'm
telling you
YouTube YouTube this do got put in 300
thousand dollars a Bitcoin at 20k the
thing crashed like 50 percent 24 hours
later this guy just got all my gosh it's
gonna be a massacre in 2018 I'm telling
you that folks gonna say shirts and yeah
that's why I'm like you know it's like
even right now I'm looking at was a
ripple and in a couple of other ones but
then it's like which one I want to
invest in the one that has like that
people are gonna use as currency that
won't I find inaudible but I just don't
know which one's gonna be because
Bitcoin you can't use it as currency
because the fees are too high that's
what the lighting networks for so let's
do these next to nothing transaction
times at the nanosecond millisecond
level that's a big deal Jo know if that
goes through man is gonna be nice it's
gonna be nice and definitely gonna be
worth it
I just gotta see I don't know I feel
like it's just for me as investment what
I would do is just like I bought like
two bitcoins and just keep it there
that's it but I don't know if I the
amount of money that I had in there I
don't think it was like worth it for me
to be seeing that up and down up and now
I was like nah you got 30 months bro
yeah 30 you got thirty months you have
until June 6 2020 at 8:13 a.m. and I
think something like 43 seconds I can
give you like the milliseconds but you
haven't the Lyne and like folks out
there like oh I missed out on doing that
way even all of that now you got until
June 6th cuz that's what the next
Bitcoin having is and that's when the
price goes to six figures you heard it
here first
I mean people I don't know I don't like
crystal balls I just go off a
performance in the past to having is the
price went up or order of magnitude it
happens every four years the amount of
Bitcoin miners can get gets cut in half
Oh thirsty people go on beef for these
last five million Bitcoin
so let me breaks out down to you the
first block was mined in January of 2009
it is now what 2018 yes mm-hmm
so it took how many years it's the
current supply is sixteen point five
million Bitcoin
there's only 21 million there ever will
be 822 820 is 21 mm-hmm so there's
sixteen point five out now the first one
came out in 2009 to get two-thirds of
the supply out how many years is that
like nine something like that yeah no I
mean the last bit kinda Capote was to be
mined in 2024 oh no 21 24 in like a
hundred years so that's what Soto she
did Satoshi put most of the Bitcoin out
at first and time released the last five
million over the next hundred years do
you know how thirsty people gonna be for
those last five million Bitcoin bro yeah
and I definitely a different thing that
that's gonna be a thing man but I just I
don't know it's like I've got a while
week a while although definitely not a
one more I going is pumping before then
no that's that's where I'm like right
now I want to like find out which one's
the one that's gonna be like you know
freaking 50 cents and then you know a
year from now is gonna be $20 that's the
one that I'm looking for right now you
know what I mean is because it's like I
feel like even Bitcoin if we come in you
know I feel like it's already almost to
me not too late but too late to be like
yo I got a hundred bitcoins you get what
I'm saying like you gotta be a baller to
say I got a hundred bitcoins I just
bought a hundred you gotta say what's
great what's on our very good list for
this week we got uh one two three yeah
that's the very good list right here
I'll just go ahead and throw it out up
there what's the three yeah these three
right here on a very good list axiom let
me see which ones you got index you know
a DEA
xlm which was of those mmm nope those
are the ones that's on the very good
list for this week that's all I'm gonna
get your idea bro
now cuz for me because I have my trade
of guys they write out these matrices
and then I'm just basically write to
bots and we just can't we just cook on a
 like some Yeezys on adidas so yeah
that's a thing that folks get into
Brobot but if I'm a developer right now
I will be knee-deep in a crypto because
all these api's are around here the
things that you could make you could
actually code yourself into your clock
job what job yeah no it's true
I mean that's one of the things that for
me I tell people I created on a course
which is like super simple which is
pretty much converting how much a
Bitcoin cost like let's say somebody
bought a Bitcoin in 2010 right 2010 they
had a Bitcoin how much is that becoming
worth now to sell now that's one thing
that a lot of people are searching
online and it's just a simple service of
just like you're converting one Bitcoin
at this date from that price how much is
it worth today now on 2018 all right
little services like that right I think
that a lot of people search all the time
because even I myself do this all the
time like let's say CSS generators right
a lot of people use something like
border-radius right you want to do a
border radius now everybody's gonna go
in there and remember every single
syntax of it what they do is they search
border radius and then from there they
find a generator on Google right the guy
who never had either gentle yeah like
you the guy the guy who freaking this a
guy that I know that basically he has
one of the the top to CSS generators and
this guy makes a bar like eleven
thousand dollars a month just from us a
simp
website some jQuery said that he did
three years ago and he's been making
that money consistently so now to do all
he does is travel the world and just
like chill and Thailand channel
Philippines being South Africa chill in
Colombia also I have this other guy that
was pretty legit you should definitely
check him out
his name is levels that I oh he's the
one that created nomad list he's the
creator of that website and like
everybody who is a digital Nomad goes
through our website to find out which
city is the cheapest so for me as a
developer I think all the people that
are in now are trying to get a now they
should definitely try to think like an
entrepreneur but I okay I bust my ass to
work here you know and learning all this
stuff how can I make this this skills
work for me yes I can work for a company
well how can I also make you work for me
where I could say hey I work for XYZ
company for six months out of the year
and then now I have my own application
now I'm about to launch and you know
make my money from so that's one of
things I'm definitely trying to get
everybody to be on because the more that
I like the more that I worked with
different companies I realized I'm like
young we're building all of this stuff
and there be times that I come up with
an idea that makes a company Millions
and I'm like wait I just made these
people like five millions this year so
on something that I created right and
then from there I'm like wait I'm not
getting I don't get that sprinkled back
to me you know what I mean cuz I'm not
part owner I don't have no equity I
don't have nothing I'm just a salary you
know what I'm saying you got your little
hundred thousand dollars go home and
shut up that's it but how about you
start building something you know your
own your own web application that you
can say hey man I make good money out
here you know what I mean let's say
let's take it to the chat let's see what
the chat one out here about next we
can't forget about them that's the third
one on the Hangout
let's see let's see let's see who's in
here I'm gonna share my my screen so
people to see the chatroom
people's likes nugs was yeah your
Instagram build the hood up Joe you got
some strong supporters up in here word
can't parry says for someone trying to
freelance what is the best way to get
clients I would say you know it's
interesting man you know that you know
that boutique that you see me post on
Instagram sometimes and clear port that
the one that looked like an airport on
the inside yeah was gonna ask you about
that so this is the cam cam I was just
running in and I was running around I
came across his new store that popped up
and you know I just walked in and I
totally dig dug the vibe and I'm telling
you it's there's something happening
that's more like a like a organic kind
of movement going on like people now you
should be able to just go down the block
to like your local cell phone store or
something like that and say like he'll
let me let me let me spruce up your
website a little bit or something like
that you know like you know I mean I
come from some parts of the hood where
it's like yo you start off by picking up
a broom that's how you get to the top
floor you know what I mean and and so I
see so many people they get stuck doing
nothing and I call it paralysis from
over analysis cuz you get stuck like
reading this book and the next thing and
the next thing you don't actually like
ever get to go out and do ya you know I
mean so I don't know that answer your
question is on that Joe I mean I we
addressing cams Club statement like how
is it how is it to get your first
clients off the ground well I mean this
is the same thing that I've been telling
them from the beginning it's like you
got a couple of ways you could literally
go in and say okay I'm gonna find them
on Craigslist my local area find on gigs
you could go on Craigslist if I find
people that is in there and you'd be
surprised this people are crazy but like
you know they're trying to build some
freaking a porn website or some people
trying to build hey I sell knives
whatever right you could work with them
if you find a project to be interesting
right now at the same time you could go
on Craigslist you could go in personally
to the business itself and say hey like
I told cam the other day like oh you
have a pizzeria in your neighborhood you
always shop from there but you notice
that their website looks like it
looks like it was made in 2002 so then
that's when you come in as a developer
and be like hey man listen I'm a
developer I can come in create a website
for you and basically make it like Jay
add extra features for you maybe have
your your own customer sign up for you
build a system like a loyalty system
where if they buy five pizzas right we
keep track of that and then the the
fifth pizza comes in at 25% less than
the original price so now you've given
them ideas and you come in like hey I
can build all of this for you all right
absolutely so yeah so you can pretty
much compete with you know Domino's and
whatever because now you have that
infrastructure to basically help them
out they can't do it on their own a lot
of this business they're like man
Domino's is is eating up our business
it's not because the piece is not it's
not as good as Domino's most of the time
is gonna be way better than dummies but
they don't have the infrastructure most
of these people write what they know how
to do is the pizza they don't know about
technology they don't know about the web
so you as a developer you can go out
there and and basically catch and those
clients and then those are people that
are know you you come in you do a good
job there's people that I have that I
still build or like maintain their
websites from like 2013 like it's like
almost five years ago you know what I
mean like I still come in the website it
looks outdated cuz it's one of my first
websites but till this day they still
love it and they still be like yo Joe we
want you to change this on the menu Joe
we want this this and that and then what
I do is I come and I tell them hey if
I'm really busy I could still give you
get everything done for you like let's
say for example
I could charge somebody that I know from
back in the days $40 an hour it might
just be just for me to change the menu
from $12 to $13 that cook that took me
two seconds to me but that's $40 it
doesn't matter if it's from one second
to an hour everything in between is $40
so that's like guarantee money that I
have until be honest that's like money
that on your report that's like hand to
hand you know what I mean like it's like
I just sold a nigger on the corner
you know I mean like you gotta say like
four people you come in you make your
money in and like you have your climbs
of course you can have different
situations where you you make contracts
if it's like a bigger business like
somebody comes in and but I hate Joe can
you build me a real estate website yes I
can do that I already built so many of
them that I have already my own knife
framework sport websites that I already
built that I could literally take that
code that I did a year ago and then
repurpose it for your website and
instead of me having to take two months
of time of what took me originally now I
could do this in a week for them they
don't know that that took me a week I'll
be like yo this is gonna take me you
know a month if I come in and say I
could do it for you in a week
but I'm gonna hire extra developers now
I'm charging them extra but in reality
he was gonna take me a week no matter
what you know what I'm saying like you
got to know how to play the system and
to make it work for you
hey Joe I don't have to go out there a
Cho cannot cannot cannot bless the chat
with know some just just some otherwise
I just wanna leave a whole bunch of free
jewelry all over to chat right about now
cuz I cannot bless it I'm gonna tell the
chat who's interested in figuring out
how to get free hotel rooms and your
favorite country that you would ever
want to go visit let me know let me know
put put up put it right there in a
common man this also a little delay
between the video I see it Andy I'm
coming I'm coming with your comment a
little bit later
that mobile desktop I'll see you Oh
so get this right so I'm in I'm in Paris
France I go there quite often and then I
found this hotel so here's my hustle
right this a finesse mm-hmm so a lot of
people they think about the money and
they don't realize well what do you need
the money for like what are you actually
gonna take the money and buy it for
that's really what a lot of that whole
crypto revolution is all about is like
instead of being that middleman and the
money like what if Joe you know like
what if Joe all of a sudden got some
chunk later I said I want a cop you know
what I'm saying and I'm gonna cap that
he want if we both see it as the same
value why can't we just trade you know
what I mean so I'm gonna go to I go to
hotels and I did this one hotel so I'm
sitting downstairs and the lobby just
working cuz you know we worked late at
night on on that keyboard it's like 3:00
in the morning and this guy's like what
are you doing man every night you're up
here like 3:00 in the morning because
they didn't have like a business office
place and so I'm like in the main lobby
and he's like what are you doing and I'm
like he's like what do you do I see you
in front of your computer I know you're
not playing around so us I almost messed
up I was gonna tell him I'm a developer
mmm that's how you mess up you know how
you win you say oh well I help hotels
improve their website design mm-hmm so
you know your audience is kyc you got to
know your customer you got to know your
audience cuz if I would have said I'm a
developer he would have been like what
would you develop like houses or
something like that
yeah it doesn't confusion we assume that
we know everything like we can say we're
developers that's gonna confuse somebody
even more but I told them I'm a
developer and I work on helping the
hotel's make their websites better
immediately he was like I need to talk
to you I need to talk to you tomorrow I
need to talk to the manager weeks later
all I got to do is keep their
TripAdvisor points going up answer some
of their questions maybe put a couple of
widgets on their website whenever I go
to Paris France I don't pay for a roof
over my head I got two rooms
if I mess one up I go to the other room
and then really what I'm starting to
notice is like now I just gotta pay for
the the airplane trip over there so then
how do I start working with some
airlines you don't know you see what I'm
saying
yeah no no definitely you could
definitely borrow your ear skills I mean
that that's going to what you were
saying to about the the title that was
something that was telling people with
some controversy that was here like it
wasn't even really big here on YouTube
but people were mad at my boy Chris
Shawn because he said he called himself
a software engineer or so for developer
and people were pissed off and it's like
sometimes you call yourself things that
technically for us it would be like okay
you're not doing software development
right you're doing web development but
you can't come to a regular person and
be like hey I'm a software developer and
he's a web developer they're gonna be
like what and you're gonna be like okay
the best way to basically explain things
to people it's simplified right okay he
works with websites he built websites
and this person comes in and he built
applications and this person builds
programs for your business that's if you
explain it to people in a simple way
then it's gonna be so much easier so I
definitely agree with you in that sense
I usually don't tell people be like hey
I'm a developer I come in and just be
like hey man I make websites I could
come in and get you the web design you
know upgrade your site just like how you
said cause it's like depends on who you
talking to
you got to readjust to you know
basically on how you talkin to them you
can't just be like come in technical
which is something where sometimes I'll
be like even going back to like how
other instructors and other people that
that talk about code they come in and
start talking to people in a super
technical way as if this people have a
computer science background like this
people is trying to learn on their own
they don't even know half of the things
that you're talking about right but you
want to come in instead of breaking it
down in simple terms for people to
understand you come in and give them all
this big
words and it's like you got a wing
people in you can't just come in and and
start giving them a whole bunch of words
and a whole bunch of theory and
paradigms in the beginning because if
people are beginners that's how people
get turned off for technology I've seen
it what happened with a couple of girls
that I know they told me yeah I went to
this boot camp you know and I went in
there and then you know after the two
days the guy was just like you know
everything that he was talking about was
going over in my head and then I sat
down with her and I explained it to her
and I was like she's not my god like
everything makes sense now why didn't
this guy talk to me like this how you
talking to me and it's like that's the
beauty of this freaking channel like I'm
not trying to talk to you like we over
here on a freaking scientific trip to to
Mars we're here just talking like France
I'm trying to help you out you know I
mean sometimes you got to know who's
your audience you know yes oh man is so
important yeah man
so yeah speaking of this audience I got
I see Andy in the audience he made and
he made a comment earlier you know one
thing I learned just like always if
somebody asked something or you know I'm
trying to go for every single comment
and he was saying that talk should I
develop I think it was mentioning should
I develop a mobile site and then go to
the desktop or do I develop mobile first
what I usually do in joke you know
they'll course fill in yours but I'm
always start off from mobile mmm like
just for off the rim and then I kind of
progressively enhance and add media
queries at certain points and most
people say well which media queries at a
point that's religious wars whatever
looks good yeah that's usually what
stick with your point Joe hopefully that
answer you Andy what's good with you
Jody say about ah I definitely agree
with you this sums that I do it on
mobile first
I might start mobile first and depending
on the on the design most of the time
that's how I usually do it like if it's
something how can I say like if if it's
not structured in in certain columns
because there's sometimes a designer
might come in and give you something
that the desktop version looks
completely different than the mobile
version right or you might not even have
a mobile version all they give you is
the desktop version so in that sense I
come in and I finish whatever I have in
and desktop and then from there I start
working myself down now when I'm
building my own websites or if I already
have the designs for the mobile site
then from there I start from mobile and
I start going to tablet and then I go to
to desktop it all depends on the
situation you know but the best ways is
like you said to is like starting mobile
first if if that's like if the
opportunity is there to start a mobile
first started more first cuz it's
actually better to do it like that you
know well everything is if everything is
a column it's just a column that's the
best part
yeah exactly yeah yeah man you know let
me see who else is in here anybody any
other questions man let me know yeah
what other questions we got going on hey
it's just fun man yeah you know what's
crazy Joe they probably don't even know
we've never talked to each other yeah
man you know it's gonna be like peanut
butter and jelly yeah you know I've been
wanting to go to your freakin meet up
man to the Ruby and yc1
I was like man oh man I'm trying to go
to that listen I'm here to tell you you
know we need to talk offline because I
need a I got some opportunities for you
to me possibly even pop off a meet-up up
in your area yeah no no that's exactly
that's that's exactly what I'm trying to
do like now I'm moving to Connecticut
now or this weekend so basically this
whole week is gonna be just moving doing
Auto BS that you got to do but as soon
as I'm like I hit the ground is a rap
like I'm finding I'm finding the meetups
I'm finding the the people that's trying
to get into this because I looked on
online and I was like okay the closest
cities will be Hartford New Haven or new
lung I think it's New London and I was
like man there's got to be something
either in one of those three cities you
know what I mean so and at the same
I believe Priceline is there in
Connecticut so it's like if Priceline is
there so they gotta be something ESPN is
there so they gotta be something you
know so I'm trying to go in there so did
I get my feet wet I'm gonna be like yo
I'm taking over Connecticut man you know
me man if I go in there it's like yo
it's like you know we taking over man
we're going in hard I'm trying to do a
meet up to man a a triple man listen I'm
here to tell you I'm here to tell you on
the record in front of hundred folks man
go out there and do it man you got
people behind you right now that's
looking the forward to sponsoring you
just just yeah you just keep doing what
you're doing keep pushing forward man
I'm working with some people right now
we got some things going on behind the
scenes that are gonna be very nice for
the development community and I need you
and your whole group a part of it man
because we're all wanting the same
together I mean you might see Joe and I
appear on a camera something like that
but people come here all the time like
everybody's times valuable yeah every
single person talks valuable you know
yeah yeah yeah not exactly man that's
what I'm saying like I think look I
think right now like what I said from
lassie last year you know I mean goals
for myself I say you know I want to get
this this channel up and running I feel
like it's up and running right now fact
he's facts I've been watching this is
January 2017 everyday favorite my
favorite woman is Joe at the barbecue
he was with the whole family and
everything side with the abuelitos dog
man it was I think that was right when
the baby was born yeah yeah yeah exactly
man yeah man so that's what I'm saying
it's like I bring G's like grinding it
out but now I feel like by you know
probably around March I'm gonna be in a
space style I'm gonna be super
comfortable where I want to start
traveling all over the u.s. going to
meetups I get invitations all the time I
got invitations from Spotify got
invitations from Microsoft I've got an
invitation for a lot of people because
it's weird I feel
it's weird because I come in here I'm
not trying to be technical this is my
host my host stick right I'm not trying
to be technical I'm not trying to be
something that I'm not like you know how
I act at work is not how I act here
right but at the same time if somebody
invites me to a meet-up I'm gonna you
know keep a professional keepin up to
par you know what I mean but at the same
time as like I want to be able to to be
comfortable be myself in places so this
year I feel like now I can be like okay
I got this this this things going on and
then now I could actually go and travel
whenever they invite me you know because
I get the the invitations all the time
by just before I was working full time I
was like full stack developer like the
company was on my shoulders it was me
and one guy just you know controlling
this freaking company and I'm like you
know what I'm gonna leave this
alone i'ma start working on my own do it
you know start you know breaking away
from all of this because in reality what
I want to do is just I want to be able
to go into like high schools I want to
go into you know small communities you
know minorities and tell them like yo
this is what you can achieve right these
are the things that that's out there you
know because one of the things that I
see all the time and from the younger
kids and even myself when I was in high
school was like yo man my my heroes
wasn't you know none of this dudes like
you know no Mark Zuckerberg no no this
guy's my heroes were the dudes who got
money in their pocket got a big chain
got all the girls and I'm like wait how
can we make development and just cold
and just education just being cool
period like you don't have to be this is
what I always say you don't have to be a
square all right let me show you how Joe
you know what I mean like you don't have
to be a square you could just come in be
yourself you know and and just kill it
just do what you got to do so that's
what I want to show to the people out
here man you know like so ever
body just like y-you see walk in the
classroom and you listen everybody pull
out a chairs and a keyboards and you
gotta hit them with that sauce a little
bit man just something different be
different I mean yo bro you know I
paint my nails black sometimes in memory
of my dead ex girl or girl who passed in
the car accident like whatever you can
to stand out in the crowd be different
do something that's your personal brand
that's what makes you different from the
next program the end exactly and and at
the same time I gotta say man I just
wanted to bring the regular people in
man like I think it is so how can I say
it's so corny when hey you know I feel
like even being a developer they certain
groups where it's just like it's just
like high school right it's like this
guys who are the jocks where it's like
super popular and super smart but it's
like they're an inner circle right and
it's like everybody else is like extras
now it's like you could be that but you
could also be out here just chillin just
you know you don't have to be the the
guy freakin work in our Facebook like
you could be out here working a freak
examples you could be out here working
at freaking macys.com you could be out
here working at Amazon wherever the hell
you want to work at and still be
yourself you know I feel like this is
the time where you have to come out
there and show it to the kids you know
like kids is not seeing this stuff like
I go to worldstar you know all the time
and I'm like okay all this stuff is cool
but I'm like most of these people don't
even have none of that stuff right I
know people who are in development or in
technology in general and have all this
stuff they have Maseratis I have a
friend with a Bentley
like Chile right so it's like how can we
show that to the world and it's not even
to bring it like all the materials
things but it's more like hey man you
could do whatever the hell you want like
it's not it's not how back in the days
people be like oh you have to be a
rapper you have to be a ballplayer you
have to be famous
naw you could be here living
very comfortable life because these guys
out here gaining you know what I mean
like this guys out here that you'd be
like man this guy he's just some regular
do it and then I don't know we're just
gonna pee pee and the Tesla just comes
picks them up like you know what I'm
gonna say like you that's what I'm
saying like you you you got you could be
in this world man like I want to just
show people the possibilities of things
that they can do you know I want to make
sure that people are not stuck in the
same classes because if we're looking to
me how I look at it is like when not to
bring in political but when trunk came
in everybody's oh my god trumped isn't
that when net neutrality came in
everybody oh my god the world is about
to end it's like nah man you make
whatever you want to make out of your
own life you know nobody's gonna come in
and save you you know what I mean so for
a thing you know development and
programming is a way to to get out of
certain classes and just going up the
ladder you get what I'm saying
and it's like why wouldn't you want to
do it you know what I mean it's not that
hard this is not a thing we you got to
be a genius it's more about can you
apply yourself are you patient you know
are you okay
yeah hey Chris Sean Christian just uh I
think that's Christian he said something
that was real interesting I always tell
people I have loose opinion
strongly-held you know and based on new
facts Chris made a very good point you
we were talking about Andy and the
mobile first web development he made a
good point saying that sometimes go
truth be told you just don't even need
to start off with mobile is just a
desktop app that folks need so that's
really a great point cuz that's knowing
your client needs they want and also
knowing how not to be complex because he
developers got this problem where it's
like you it's almost like and I'm guilty
of it myself of Joe but you own it's
almost like the more complex something
is the more we feel validated it makes
yeah but I'm Sam I'm guilty as charged
brother yeah no I I definitely agree
with you on that because I see this all
the time sometimes
we'll be like hey man let's use this
thing that's gonna take me half an hour
to do but because it looks difficult and
looks complex and you got to get those
little brownie points but it's like man
the client doesn't care about that
the client cares about can you get the
job done as soon as possible because I
got money to make
I got a product to sell I got a website
that people are following I have a blog
that I'm doing and if my blog is not up
I don't care if you created the the best
REST API in you know like I don't care
about what database you use all I care
about is the end product you know that's
how the client looks at it you know so
it's like sometimes as developers we
come in and spend so much time on
finding the most difficult thing or like
trying to make something that could have
been easier making it more complex you
know what I mean so it's all about the
right man but yeah let me see anybody
else what's good what's up with the rest
of these questions man this is this is
amazing man it says as funny this is
exactly the way I knew what was gonna go
down
yeah any questions I can't find any
questions let me see you found anything
Oh check out skillful skillful skillful
actor they got that free jewelry for you
on an internet connection on your
rendezvous man now uh got that internet
hookup on I watched him skillful
connector did it skillful actor did a
little research for you about the
Internet in your neighborhood it dropped
some free jewelry on you right if you
look in the comments skillful to see
okay I'll look up some stuff from your
frontier 30 month upload about 30
dollars on the my 20 your files I gotta
look that up yeah that might be a that's
a big deal for you that's almost like
Carly am i breathing or am I not no
because I I definitely need I don't know
about this internet this a hundred
megabytes down and five megabytes up
like this that sounds crazy you better
off connecting to a toward a mango
little mango mango yo who let the mango
password expired yeah whose man is this
who brought the mango in you somebody
come pick up your man's man whose
mangoes is this this money somebody
point home so I'm gonna put like your
snugs looking like a freaking drug
dealer from you know dude like Mitch out
here these take a picture in the
jailhouse pose you know what you know
about that being a Silicon Valley just
straight up in the toy like this let me
ask you this so what's like your back
with a rosy background as far as like
education I mean the you want you say
you went to zoos oh yeah but the school
play football I got a business degree
bro and then I just went to the school
the googles and then after that 12
programming languages later me and I
just went in man
wait they come with their computer
programs in the lab I didn't know how to
program but I used to walk out with like
a wad of cash in my pocket you have on
people like not that's wrong and you
want to go left there I didn't know how
to program no but I know I knew logic
you don't everything and so people
started giving me cash for helping them
tutor I was like yo its money in this
program is stuff bad I need to figure
out how to do it no that's not man and I
remember I always remember like back in
the days like you know I'm being into
like programming and I created a website
since like 2001 so that's what I really
started that's what I started and then I
left it off you know for a while cuz I
started doing other stuff I started
doing music and I started doing like you
know going back to school because I was
like
you know people used to be like Oh
graphic design they used to call
programming websites is that oh that's
graphic design they don't make no money
they there's no future in that it's like
you know back then they still have like
pace or builders so people be like oh
this paints bright like you don't need
like buy you know two years from now
there's not gonna be no jobs for that
like in me stupid enough I listen to
them and say now I see people writing
that on comments it's like oh my god
wakes is is coming out with this website
and and you could create website with
Squarespace and and this doesn't that
and I'm like bro they've been saying
this since I was freaking 14 years old
man like no matter what you still need
so much it's been doubling down on the
app on the YouTube advertising yes
anybody notice that yeah now they've
been going hard they they even got a
couple of people from YouTube like those
main I forgot the name of the guys those
two weirdos from YouTube like they have
a channel there and like they hire them
to like hey this is my website look how
easy it is to make a website and there's
like hey man that website got like two
tricks an essay like that was I can not
the two website to trick website
[Laughter]
carousel javascript menu or email with
the subject in it man it'd be crazy I
don't even know how people have people
just like listen to this stuff I mean
I'm guilty I should have never listened
to you know that's my biggest regret
that I stopped doing websites when I was
like 15 I started at 14 like just copy
and pasting I don't even know how to
code all I know how to do was just copy
and paste stuff and then later on I
started getting back into it again with
MySpace you know when myspace was
popping when you know before the the DMS
it was sending messages like you know
without my out here you know Queens you
know
Oh God myspace email or refresh Joe had
Joe was hitting refresh on the sidekick
like every five seconds yeah hell yeah
the cycle is the jumper was like yo any
hooky parties oh yeah we used to have an
AOL chat room we're like literally like
200 kids in there like it was me and
like 200 other kids from different high
schools as I go any hooky parties going
down today and it's like okay there's
one in Middle Village come down there's
one in the Bronx come down there's one
in Harlem come down like it used to be
poppin man but you know back then I saw
I started getting into you know a little
bit of coding just by fixing my myspace
page you know getting my little glitter
of you know showing the background
changing the background there the whole
squad like this like yo hey Jojo wait a
minute the whole chat world and your
boys Snuggs want to know one thing
yeah what was the track that you had on
when you first load the pager was you
one of them R&amp;amp;B cats was he one of them
are be dudes which we haven't play it on
it you had some Jim Jones played or did
did yes you had played in the background
oh you had but with a pink stars drop it
from the top yeah this is no I have the
camera because camera was my favorite
rapper all-time he's still my favorite
rapper all-time because I'm all about
sauce I'm all about swag you know you
could keep all the lyrics I'm not into
that I'm into like can you come in and
flow can you come in and just like show
that you just comfortable like if you're
somebody that's very confident I like
you already
you know what I mean like that's how
I've always been all about energies so
Cameron was my favorite rapper and the
son that I remember used to have and it
this is crazy
it was a wet wipes so I had the wet wipe
song so you know ever just gonna say hey
MA
I had the wet wipes from camp so any
shorty that got to that that website
that website page from myspace.com they
already know what it was it was like the
oh listen man like it was reeking oh man
I'm gonna go too deep into it but let's
just say it went have strangers watching
where do ya let me see anybody else got
any questions man let me see ya
so what framework are you into as far as
like you know this going to the debate
you know you got anger are you oh sorry
Perkin are you coming out with the bad
guys are you I got I got I got that fire
folks ain't even ready for it oh I got
that fire man I've been working on this
I've been working on this library bro oh
man let me show it to you man I'm just
gonna go ahead and I might as well go
ahead and do it let's see here will ya
where's the screenshare us on the left
side it's a lie all right no doubt no
doubt yeah okay okay you see my screen
mm-hmm okay
all right puking so I got this little
library to that god I'll call um call
slugsy right and I'm gonna show you
example of what's going on here so we
got so I got this city's HelloWorld
elements right and what I like about it
is I just used the chrome developer
tools to really develop man like I mean
I'm a very user uh everyone's like what
ID do you use I'm like I use them or I
use just the chrome developer tool than
a source panel and stuff like that
because the library that I'm using
actually I built a library I didn't want
to install webpack I didn't want to
happen no node I didn't want to have to
know react I didn't want to have to know
no front-end framework like I actually
work all right so one here's one thing
about me
one of the things I do I contribute
heavy to what WG I can
tribute heavy to the w3c web platform
tests I'm doing mdn documentation like I
think that mdn is awesome for
documentation and I like to get in and
help out where I can anywhere that's
custom elements related on the web
that's the new hotness with 2018 moving
forward yeah I'm all over it you know
and if the docs ain't there I'll make
sure happen mm-hmm this check this out
right so you're staring right here at
the minimum it takes to make a
HelloWorld custom element okay I mean
it's not the minimum it's actually
pretty rich you call HelloWorld it's got
a class just straight es6
this ain't no funky business this ain't
none of that JSX this is just straight
JavaScript modern JavaScript that's it
mmm you got a class that extends from an
HTML element I mean I got an initialize
function right here that runs if you
were familiar with Ruby and that just
puts a little globe at the end of inside
of the element and that append right
there like that straight JavaScript
that's not any framework and that's just
the way the browser works mm-hmm there's
a convention for all unclick so what's
cool is just like in Ruby if you just
give these names that you're you've been
familiar with the like however long
you've been writing in JavaScript mm-hmm
it'll actually automatically bind it to
each element so if I click on this you
see mmm and I click on this guy but
you're staring at all the code is taken
for all these custom elements to run and
have functionality and now where it says
get planet and get greeting you see
where says return from Mars and return
Bonjour mm-hmm so what it's doing is
it's actually looking at these HTML
elements for any tokens inside of them
that have the same name think Ruby you
know call a thing a thing convention
over configuration so I figured as long
as you have events and as long as you
have properties that you combine to
inside of the custom element and you
have a like an explicit this dot render
function mm-hmm like that's all you need
for JavaScript for every single HTML
element in your entire page that would
be nice too
so what I like about it is one kilobyte
and it takes the average person oh I
don't know maybe an hour or two only
thing you have to know is like some
basic HTML CSS and JavaScript to get it
going oh yeah we'll see about that
you know it's what you send me you got
it on github absolutely I got it on kill
you know it man hold it off for a second
you still see my screen here we go right
here def Punk Snuggie I've been working
on the for like the past year my life
man and I just I just didn't want to
accidentally use any frameworks I want
to see if I can only use Google Chrome
and develop entire front end web
applications is so far I haven't found
anything that I couldn't build and at
least a tenth would that every other
framework and I've tried like I know
view like the back of my hand
I know I know stimulus like the back of
my hand and Oh Stan selected back of my
hand every single one of them I know all
of the code inside of them and I would
even be willing to say still couldn't
hold the stick mmm that's a lot to say
you know what I'm saying but yeah that's
a lot to say but I would tell every one
of the people who were you know working
on the projects hey we write the specs
that you were trying to implement and
diverge away from like all of this
sudden watch the guy why is it every
front-end video right now the first 20%
of it or 50% of it is about your build
configuration can we talk about that for
a second that describes my damn Gaeta
and I agree with you I mean that's why a
lot of people's is they get turned off
even you know I got a lot of people that
come to my website in they get stuck
just on the what development starter kit
because luckily I already built it for
them
but even just setting it up and getting
getting everything started on their
computer is a headache like some
sometimes you got to install Python on
your computer sometimes you got to
install libraries that you don't have
like you know for people that use
Windows on Mac is like you're good and
you hit the ground running but on
Windows is like people are having
nightmares you know what I mean it's
crazy
you're right what do you know about the
template element that's a new HTML
element that everybody should know about
html5 we talked that talk you know
anything about the template element you
should be used to seeing it from like
polymer and view and stuff like I mean
I've been trying to get into polymer I
was looking into it yeah because I saw a
presentation on polymer I think polymer
three or two the new one is about to
come out and I was like yo this is
interesting this is like it's more
working with the technology that's out
there already instead of like creating a
CLE this fake Dom on top of what's
already there it's exactly that's the
way job just like I gave you that
lightning what network that's the wave
what you're gonna see in 2018 cuz I work
on specs man like there's no one don't
react that sits closer to the specs than
I do
mmm but I don't brag about it cuz I'm
like help trying to help out make the
web move faster so we don't get stuck in
Internet Explorer for the rest of our
lives
yeah no definitely no yeah use a
platform hashtag used a platform that's
where we at in 2018 as much as you can
at least it's not the same throw away
jquery go up what is it
so I could I could actually see um and
speak because for some reason the camera
only shows the screen win who I was
talking so if you can I'm missing come
on
okay what's what's what's up up or down
or down or up there no where's the Deaf
punks snuck see now what I like about it
yo did you notice notice in the
front-end frameworks what they typically
like to do like here's a perfect example
this unordered list right here they'll
use League first of all it's not even
HTML if you staring at is actually HTML
I don't care what anybody say that stuff
react not HTML we all know we know it
that's why you
a pilot could be naughty I don't care to
string enough for some reason I don't
know if it's the mic oh yeah oh yeah we
back look back yeah yeah I got a
Pomodoro Mike after about 25 minutes
this I start sounding like mr. Roboto
yeah you know freaky you know then we're
gonna have to cut this short I'm getting
a message right now cuz I still gotta
because yeah I'm in the middle of moving
like literally that's what I told
everybody yo this is my last video so
god knows when but basically I'm in the
middle of moving I gotta help out so
guys snugs it's been a pleasure to have
you in here Joe pleasures all mine
I can't Oh what happened to my camera I
gotta say what's up there you know you
know thank you so much for letting me
made a little bit of your time in the
group man this is an honor I feel like a
celebrity right now I wasn't just Joe
was driving in the Mercedes like your
podcast channel up and y'all just hate
on the sauce don't you think I'm gonna
dab on you but you know you guys
listening if you guys are interested in
this this framework that snug this is
work you know this is actually very
interesting because I'm looking at it
and it looks like Jay so I want to share
the screen for you guys and make sure
that you guys go check this out
snugs is freaking he's smart man okay I
think to be honest I haven't even been
on this game of working with the you
know with the template high quality say
template custom elements I haven't used
at all so I'm trying to get into this so
I mean everybody right now that's the
crazy part about it we've been working
on our custom elements down at the spec
level for over two years now and it's
just almost about the baked out right
there if anybody has any problem with
that unpackage link and installing it
and it says something weird and
to submit an issue I will fix it in less
than half an hour I just found the bug a
little earlier I'm trying to find them
bugs like Joe and be like squash that
bug
check this out goals is github.com slash
def Punk's with a s and then snug Z or
just search def punks and then you're
gonna see all his repos there this is
very interesting you know you guys know
me I'm constantly looking into new
frameworks and see how people are
building this things but I don't even
know about this you know the template so
oh no you are not we gonna tear on that
one because I wanted to show you some
examples and stuff like that so I want
that I want to help wherever I can and
your team in front end modern stuff like
so you don't have to worry about it I
work on the spec level me and I'll bring
you to I'll show you the difference
between the Diamonds and the coal and
that's a lot of coal out here I got the
diamond in a coast kid you're out here
picking cold man chat fam I appreciate
all you I love all of you Joe man I

out there cuz I know you you have like a
lot of skills that people need out here
like this things here that you could
probably explain a million times better
