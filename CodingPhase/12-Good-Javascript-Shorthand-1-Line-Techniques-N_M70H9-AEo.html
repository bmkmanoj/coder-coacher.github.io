again man coding face.com listen guys I
have another great article for you guys
that you guys should definitely check
out because it's very helpful for those
guys that are trying to master
JavaScript these are like twelve
techniques that are you going to save
you time because you're writing less
right it is like you know when you write
a one you know one line function all
right so there's 12 good JavaScript
shorthand techniques alright so I'm
gonna talk about each technique and I'm
gonna tell you why is good alright so a
lot of times we're always checking to
know undefined empty checks all right so
we always check it through this well
okay is this notice this variable knows
this undefined is this empty alright
well that can get done pretty easy you
could just say hey let variable 2 equals
value 1 or empty nothing with that right
there what is going to do is basically
want to let you know if this is empty or
not like you save yourself that whole
big line I've seen this done so many
times where you're trying to figure out
if it's empty string if is you know if
it's undefined if it's know right so
what you're doing here using hey it's
variable 1 there right if it's there or
equals to empty then it's true right now
if it comes out false a variable 2
equals to false then it means that it
has something inside of it it has as I
know undefined or you know it could be
anything could be a string it could be a
number it could be an object whatever it
is there's something inside of variable
what that's pretty much what you're
doing here so I think to me
so pretty good shorthand all right now
this will not I understand it because to
be honest with you I never write this
like this right I don't know who
actually creates new arrays I haven't
seen this done in like forever the last
time I seen this done was like I don't
know maybe 2009 when I try to get into
JavaScript I was like oh my god y'all
the scripts too difficult I'm not doing
it right so that's when I left this
alone but I've never seen this like
regular people at a job actually
declaring a new array I've seen this
done in PHP but I've never seen this
done in JavaScript so what they did here
was let's say an example you come here
and go okay I want to declare a variable
but that variable is in our rate so
you're saying hey I want to declare our
new rate and then I want to say a equals
to zero
my through 1 a 1 it goes from my string
2 and you know a 2 equals 2 my string 3
right I don't know who writes me like
this but I basically always have rolled
it like this well I say hey I create the
array and then I just put in the values
inside of it I guess that's the
shorthand for some people you know for
me this hour I've always done it so
double I don't know it wasn't much help
for me because I already know that way
all right now if true else shorthand
there's like you know single lines if
statement right so I'm pretty sure a lot
of people know this I hope you guys know
this all right so what it's doing is
saying hey let big so declare big right
so if x equals no if X is greater than
10 big it was true
now if it's not then big equals to false
so for somebody like you know if you
want to do in one line you can just say
hey let big equals x greater than 10
true or false I do this every single day
and react so I haven't done it like this
all the time so yeah this is a good
shorthand right everybody should know
how to do that really should know how to
do a single line this statement right
okay now declare a variables
shorthand this is helpful this is very
helpful especially now with you know es6
and everything right so sometimes you
want to declare a bunch of variables and
you know yeah I want to declare X I want
to declare why I want to declare Z and
then you say Z equals to three all right
but you want to have those X&amp;amp;Y
to be declared right you can just come
here and say hey let X comma Y comma Z
equals three and then I say you just
declare all three of them in one line
it's that simple
all right now let's say another
assignment operator shorthand so let me
see this one several operators are used
to assign value well I guess I know that
no matter what programming language you
use of course every single one right so
let me see why exactly is that he's
showing it so x equals two x plus one
okay that's fine
yeah the - count - count - one so why
wait what y equals y times ten okay
that's done okay X plus plus I know that
that's kind of equal you know if it's
one and gonna equal to two all right so
that's fine - count - - yes I know that
because - - is always gonna be one you
know like this is like so crazy like
people don't know this people don't know
how to deliver if we want to say y
equals 2y times 10 so let's say if y
equals to 10 right so we multiply by 10
that's 100 and now the new variable is
going to be named a 100 so the new value
for Y is going to be 100 so I'm
surprised that people don't know this
they don't
do why asterisk equals to Ted I'm
surprised people don't know that that's
weird
that's weird I didn't even have this
right I don't know to me that was on a
shorthand that's like basic JavaScript
all right so let's see another thing to
talk about regex object shorthand cool
let me see me regex expression that's
cute cousin okay yeah I've seen this
done I'll be honest with you guys I'm
not the best developer when it comes to
projects like I'm okay I barely use it
only using special occasions like
certain situations where I got to go
through a string and figure out if the
string has special characters like for
passwords and stuff like that our email
but I barely use it I myself I gotta
admit I gotta get better with Raju X so
let's see let's move on to the next one
if presents a shorthand this might be
attributable worth mentioning when doing
this checks all right assignment Ivor's
can be sometimes be omitted yeah oh yes
I'm guilty of this I'm very guilty of
this sometimes I come in and I search to
something I say hey I want to do is
steamy I want to if check right so let's
say exactly like you I say okay
live Java scary equals to true right all
you have to do is just put in the
variable if the variable is equal to
true is gonna run anyways but
psychologically I always write it down I
always be like oh like javascript equals
to true like I always do this so in
reality guys you don't have to put in
the you know equals to true at all
because if the variable itself is true
is gonna run the if statement all right
all right cool let's see here's another
example if C is not equal to true do
something I do this one for sure I do
this all for sure
so it's basically the same thing so if
the variable let's say the variable is
10 and you let's say variable X is 10
and you say hey our variable 10 I want
this estimate not to run when the
variable is 10 so know you think you're
basically coming in hold on I gotta do
it it is hot it's hard to explain it so
let's say we come here and we say X
equals to 10 and then we say if X not
equal or let's say like this if equals
true right all right if X naught equals
true run across the GOG hey let's see
what happens under 5 it's not running so
else costs a lot swag Co so it's running
swag so what you're basically saying is
if X is true X is true then rundas if
it's not true run the other one alright
a lot of times people do the same
and in reality it's basically the same
thing you come here and say swag is
going to run that but if you want this
to basically be the opposite of whatever
X is so you're basically saying if X is
true I don't want it to run this I want
to run the else statement so that's what
happens there alright if that makes
sense
cool alright so that was a dumb
shorthand but for some people they might
find some use to it alright so let me
see function
variable arguments short head okay let's
see our Glaros can take little getting
used to but season the developers
usually prefer over series of nested
functions variables you can argue which
technique is shorter but I enjoy using
object literal notation as a clean
substitute sort of functions or
constructors all right so let's see okay
this is the long hand have one function
string my number whatever and then do
something and then you're running the
function cool now let's see what's the
other one sure it looks long but only
because I have a console log in there
listen this look stupid skip this one
this one looks too big I don't even know
why he put it in I'll be honest that
looks dumb all right this will make
sense this is a good short head well you
know people might say hey give me the
strength of the character at you know at
the zero which is the very first one so
give me m right for me I've done it like
this where I come in I look at the
string and then I put in the brackets
and I put zero and it returns at this
how I've been doing it for a while you
know for some of you guys ya might use
the characters at zero I never use that
I know but it's good to know it was a
good little shorthand let me see sure
function calling just like number one
you can use ternary operates make
function calling shorthand based on a
conditional yes all right so let's see
what's the long hair long hair function
X console.log X function water who
writes like this okay let's see equals
to three Z not equal to three x else Y
okay so
so let's say functional eggs I find it
still a messy I don't know see people
give to the top highlight because this
is kind of messy no matter what no I
mean but this right here is fine but I
don't know if this was some reason this
coat both of these looked messy too I
never write it like that all right let
me see it was another word for
decimal-based all right this is cool so
instead of you writing 10,000 you could
just put in IE 4 which is 4 zeros and
then that's the same thing as 10,000
that's not bad it saves you what a Mele
section but to me personally I wouldn't
write it like this because not every
single person that's going to read that
code is going to understand what does IE
4 means it's better to be more clear and
say hey it's 10,000 that's what we're
talking about
alright so that's for me personally I
would just write 10,000 even though this
is the shorthand I would definitely
write 10,000 just because for the next
person the next person who's going to
come in and read this I'm like what the
hell is I e for instead of just saying
hey 10,000 all right okay but yeah man
