dig your boy is back I didn't did it
again been a while kids I'm gonna work
for two weeks
Oh back man I was taking care of my baby
my toe baby my god the baby it so that's
what whole lunch brings you know alright
so not a home though and I'm back I work
back doing my thing trying to catch up I
got so much work today man it's a lot of
work man it's like even though you go on
vacation I mean it's not really vacation
is parental was it China tea leaf
yeah paternity leave all right and most
of the stuff that's being done and react
I'm the one that created it and I'm
doing that knows how everything works so
I need to actually fix a lot of bugs
that are there and that's what we're
doing today man
today I was actually feeling really
shitty I woke up in a really really
shitty man there's still nothing in a
hundred percent so you guys may or may
not know like I
I'll be having like issues like
you know sometimes if I eat the wrong
thing like I feel sick I feel shitty the
next day and yeah I don't know I don't
even know what the hell did I eat
yesterday all I ate was just on just
steak but I think what messed me up was
I bought this new mullet salad dressing
which might have other type of
ingredients that I can't eat like
sometimes if I eat onions that
makes me sick
so maybe have onions I don't know but
yeah man
what's getting in the hoodie aids buggy
with the hoodie damn man so that's why
we have today guys here it's going to be
a quick lunch break because I gotta
actually do work today I gotta catch up
you know after this week hopefully there
will be no more bugs there would be more
no more issues so then I could actually
just chill I love it more at work you
know it we could actually take a
breather because you know everybody
thinks I was home hanging out and just
chilling and I wasn't you know I wasn't
just chilling at all I was like taking
care of the baby taking care of my girl
um cooking what else like barely going
to sleep so even though I was home
doesn't mean like a hot a vacation you
know it was more like I had a lot of
 you doing at home but yeah man
guess there's going to be lag guys get
used to it that's how the web developer
lunch breaks are man there's a lot of
lag you know that's how it is
there's no signal out here in Long
Island you know unfortunately I wish
there was better signal that was better
you know science I'm better you know but
there's not so yeah that's what we get
right now man
but what's good with you guys man kid
greatness man we had a great talk
yesterday man even after we stopped the
whole you know the whole show the light
the live show we still had another hour
like a whole hour and a half of
conversation just me Andrew your other
boy Isiah like no Co knew was in there
so it was pretty cool when I think that
was I was pretty hot that we actually
you know we hang out for a little while
you know
yeah man
we have fun I think we we had a good day
well I had I got to let people what
we're doing what was gonna be the next
chapter for coding phase you know like
I've created this new courses you know
it's going to be summed are gonna be
free some doc going to be paid but
always going to be cheap man I'm always
going to keep them cheap because that's
just how it is man like I feel if you
keep cheap then you could help
people out you know
the idea is now to to become a
millionaire either short ideas to
actually just be able to sustain
yourself and be able to create content
for people that people can enjoy you
know a woman hit that like button word
where there's 18 people in here every
time you guys come in here yeah I never
hit the like button man that's why the
channel don't don't get to go man if you
don't give it a like buy it and you
don't click the like button man we don't
get to you know googled oh don't show us
to other people and also it's like it's
cool to have the same community but at
the same time we want more people to
find us right it's like you guys found
you know some good I found the
clean water right yeah I can't be stingy
you got to click the like button so
other people can find the clean water
let me see
so beekeeper says completed tutorial now
I'm trying to do or redo the project on
my own without looking completely stuck
I feel hopeless well that's you gotta
take it one step at a time man you gotta
take one step at a time
you gotta go in and basically you know
you do the project right okay you got it
over with now from there start taking it
one step at a time start with the
beginning see if you could get it
through the beginning if everything goes
good and keep moving to the next step
but it's actually good for you to
actually challenge yourself to redo it
yourself because a lot of people they do
a project and they're like oh that's a I
know web development and they do one
project and it's like no bro like you
gotta really practice this you got
to check if you actually do it on your
own not just follow what the instructor
tells me
we'll stop coding phase was good soccer
number time Gregory what up
yeah - you know for you guys start
taking cold steel's web developer
bootcamp guys the best thing that you
got to do is whenever you finish a whole
section I'm not talking about a video
whenever you finish a whole section redo
it again on your own on your own
basically so like you know when he goes
through the whole section of HTML CSS
he's teaching you how to build a page
after you finish that chapter go and
create it on your own create the same
thing that you just created but on your
own you know so and then from there once
you get to bootstrap do the same thing
create it with him or his project and
then from there recreate it again we're
on another project separately
don't jump to no js' right away just
because you're following it because it's
like you still don't know the basics of
HTML and CSS so it's like you got to
still keep practicing guys you're both
84 without--without whatever up son it's
been a minute we back
and I will try to teach me for free
and if you want to learn something for
free man the best way to do it is just I
don't know
if you look at ten dollars for course
it's fine you can just start searching
through YouTube there's other people do
tutorials and try to get as much as you
can you know the only problem the reason
why I always tell people is again udemy
is good is because at least you know
what you're getting yourself into you
know and you know that somebody created
those courses because they took their
time and they actually selling it and
are they worth it yeah it's ten dollars
trust me I've gotten that back I
don't know how much does ten go into a
hundred thousand how much ten dollars
how many ten dollars are there in a
hundred thousand I don't know you guys
do the math I'm tired I've been doing
math all day but yeah so it's
like it pays itself man you know what I
mean so that's what's up you guys said
ten thousand exactly ten thousand ten
dollars right
Oh
but that's why I was saying to you guys
man jizz it's worth it man $10 ain't

it's the best money that you could
actually spend man cuz it saves you so
much time like for me the one thing that
I hate the most
it's like when I'm trying to learn sign
like for the past six months I've been
trying to learn gold alright goldang
right I haven't been able to learn it
because there's no resource there's no
place where they have four legit course
they don't there's not a place where
they have a legit instructor so to learn
gold you have to learn it on your own
basically there's nowhere out here where
they teaching golang the proper way and
what a cool instructor the only person
that everybody keeps saying is Todd was
tired MacLeod or some like that and
his course to me sucks so it's like I'm
constantly looking online searching
through YouTube so I spent more time
searching for the resources on how to
learn than actually learning so that's
why for me udemy comes in because I'm
like ill if I want to learn react I'll
go on udemy and just find it and I know
that that's what I'm there for
right and you can just find it right
away it's not like you're finding the
right YouTube channel with the right
instructor and the right personality the
right voice that sometimes if the person
has an avoid or an annoying voice you
can't listen to that person you get
annoyed you're like man I can't listen
to you know eight to twelve hours of
learning from this person right
so that's the type of that happens
is it okay to bill YouTube with HTML CSS
from scratch what does that mean Oh 8 2
k look it's right down my description on
the description of this video right on
the description of this video or any of
my videos there's a a link it tells you
it pretty much tells you right there it
says oh no js' web developer boo can
write which is actually cold steel's
web developer boot camp that's the best
course that will give anybody that's a
brand new developer ah oh ah yes some
guys on udemy have accents yes is very
annoying like I have an action and I
can't hide it but my accidents I think
is you know you can tolerate that
you know it's not it's not like a heavy
Indian accent it's not like who you call
this a heavy Russian accent like
it's not like that
my accents more like no how can I say
it's more New York it's a New York
accident man like that's just how it is
you know but it's really annoying when
you're trying to listen to somebody and
their their course is like I don't know
I don't want to do Indian accent I don't
want to do a Russian accent but I must
sound horrible it's gonna sound like I'm
making fun of them so I'm not going to
do it but it is bad you know it's like
to me is is really annoying it's like I
can't this is guy what's his name damn
and he created this Lera Bell course and
he also does of you jes courses his name
is Maximus something he's also here on
YouTube and I respect them I I think
that he knows a lot he knows a lot of
you know web development he knows a lot
of like view Jas and
angular2 he like he knows this
right because he that's what he does
but his accent I can't stand it
I can't watch his videos it's like he
knows his but the accident just
throws you off I can't really watch him
I wonder let me see
Leonardo you talk about me I wonder if
he's going to finish the new tutorial
series the track record is not good
yes I'm gonna finish it matter of fact
today I'm gonna finish it to a certain
extent right it's not gonna be like
extremely complete because I'm gonna be
honest with you like if you watch the
video that I made yesterday on the live
channel or live channel live video um
basically I explained it I'm not gonna
be doing tutorials on on YouTube anymore
because I'm only gonna finish the based
or tutorials right the waves or
tutorials I'm gonna finish it cuz I like
it I want to finish that one it's a
pretty cool site but I'm not doing after
that one I'm not doing too much
tutorials it's not worth it it's not
worth because you come in I could come
in and start making a tutorial series
and nobody watches it like you know it's
only gonna be Leonardo 84 music maybe
Matt not even Matt Matt don't even do
the tutorials that's how you know this
 in this game is up man
Matt Matt is here for all my videos and
Matt don't even do the tutorials so that
tells me that I'm pretty much wasting my
time it also it's like when I come in I
create tutorials that take a long time
cause it's not like you could just
freestyle this thing just be like hey
I'm gonna create a tutorial which I have
no idea what I'm creating no you have to
plan it out you have to decide what's
gonna be the best way to do it
but libraries are going to use how you
going to explain it to people like oh
that takes time right and
definitely sometimes with myself and you
got an editing or reshoot the video
again that takes a lot of hours
guys it takes a lot of hours and a lot
of time so to me is just not working so
what I'm doing is and not working
because like I'm not getting anything
back out of it not it's not working
because people are not doing it people
are not actually doing the
tutorials like a lot of the people that
come to my youtube channel are mostly
here because of my advice they're mostly
here because they want to hang out with
me I want to see what the hell I'm gonna
say they mostly here because they need a
little motivation that's why people come
to my channel that's how people found my
channel and that's how people come to my
channel right but the people that do
tutorials they don't get to come to my
channel like that right because Google
don't put me out there like let's say if
I put in you put in your search HTML
right incognito mode you search
incognito mode on youtube.com and search
HTML my my videos don't show up period
so they put me at like page 5 or page 7
which means nobody is gonna find me
right so when I come in out putting so
many hours into this and nobody do the
tutorials I'm not getting nothing back
I'm not getting no feedback I'm not
getting no you know like oh thank you
for the course
or I'm not getting nothing like you know
like I'm not getting anything out of it
you know like when I create a video here
and I'll hang out with you guys like it
I guess something back like I get in to
interact with you guys so that motivates
me to do more videos but when I do
tutorials I don't get nothing back no
feedback no comments no nothing
I told people hey give a start to the
starter kit the coding phase calm
starting at 2018 so I could see how many
people actually take into the course or
the tutorials and only 68 people gave it
a start that means how did thousands of
people
only 68 people meeting like it doesn't
make sense you know yes I can um bury 10
I mean that's that's sort of what I'm
gonna do like I'm gonna have this
multiple places where I'm gonna release
my courses right I'm gonna put one on
udemy I'm gonna have on udemy for people
that like to buy stuff from you to me
I'm also going to put the free courses
on udemy if you guys don't know there
there are free courses on udemy like
people forget like udemy is it's only
for pain like udemy has free courses
like people go in and put in frequent so
that's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna put
in the courses for free there because at
least I know that the people that are on
udemy calm are people that wanted to
work and want to take the courses
seriously so that's what I'm gonna post
them I'm gonna post any more on udemy
I'm gonna post some more Skillshare I'm
gonna post them on teachable
so those three places because I know
that that's where it's guaranteed people
gonna actually do it because it's like
this guy's like if you if you create
something right it's like you create a
song right and it takes you five years
to not for you it takes you five days to
create a song record it you know write
the song recording put the music master
it makes it whatever right it takes you
five days to create that song but then
you release it to the world
and only five people listen to it is it
worth it no it's not because you spent
five days and only five people got to
see it like that's hard you know that's
horrible
yeah man there's definitely a sell right
now I think I thinking if you live in
Europe right now courses are $10 if you
live in the United States they're $15
right now so you know if you want to buy
a course right now this is the time you
know take advantage
but yeah when
you see poor dokkaebi Jovi I'm sorry I
see you name oh I really loved the
course that I had for Adonis yes I
really loved that course you know with
nunchucks and everything and I think
that's one of my favorite courses and
nobody did it people say oh we want to
learn nodejs but nobody let me see this
nigga go ahead my car stop the shout out
over alright then you want to be parking
over here with this this but
anyways man oh yeah okay we good so I
getting ratchet up in this bitch but
yeah man is crazy
so I created that course and nobody you
know nobody took it you know thank God
the the Instagram course a lot of people
like it the portfolio course a lot of
people liked it too and those to me
those courses are bad you know they're
really bad like the baked so I think of
the bait store course is good
man leg and even the videos that have a
released yet they're good man
like you could get a lot of knowledge
out of it but nobody wants to take them
so you know what we're gonna take it to
a place where people are really gonna
appreciate it and I'm sorry freakin here
YouTube people care about more about
just watching a video or watching me
rant or watching me do a review or say
something so that's what I'm gonna give
them the people that want to take
courses and want to actually elevate
their mind and learn new things then I
put in a platform that's me for that you
know
Oh
ya know that's why I basically I wanted
to give people with the bait store it's
like I wanted to give them a real-life
view of how things work you know so
that's how it is man but there's new
courses that are building I got this new
course that is called learn web
development with real life real life
scenarios so the way how I'm teaching it
is it's like this is like I'm gonna get
I don't know if I should pay actors I
actually want to do this I actually want
to pay actors and basically paid them to
one person act like the designer one
person act like the developer and
basically create this course in the
first person view so somebody could
actually feel like their work they
actually have to do work and they have
to create this you know as I came the
designer just came in with this new new
landing page we need you to build it and
then it's like you know from there we go
on
so real-life scenarios real-life
that happens in everyday jobs so that's
what I want to do it nobody has ever
done this because I looked online and
nobody has done it hopefully
nobody comes and steal my idea
because you know how people are there's
a whole bunch of people that come to my
channel and they be quiet and don't they
don't even say nothing you know there's
27 people in here right but those 27
people there's probably 10 who are
actually talking or will actually leave
a comment so there might be like a you
know a hidden person in here who's just
here just keeping it quiet like I'm here
to steal ideas you know like that's how
they do it man
I know they're gonna try to eat that but
it's cool it's alright because when I
release it when I release it man and
people know where it came from you know
what I mean so yeah man
milk Mountain is already here man I
wouldn't be surprised
I really wouldn't be surprised
see 28 people in here yo I want
everybody right now everybody who's on
here I want you guys to leave a comment
right now just put the letter J I just
want to see who actually made it in here
so there's 28 people I want to see those
28 people see 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 okay we
still missing a couple 24 so who are the
hitting people there's six people that
we don't know who you are
let me see 27 28 29 well you see this
one person in here three people that we
don't know who the you are man like
that's what I'm saying like lurkers are
weird man we don't know who they are man
there's always three people cuz if you
look if you look at all my videos man
this always soon as I drop them this two
or three people who just give it dislike
automatically they use like dislike so
they get they get the nerd notifications
just to dislike my video like
this like doesn't matter if it's SEO I'm
talking about puppies and rainbows
dislike they're like yo you stole it
about positive this like doesn't
matter
they work for tree house yeah but get
the notification
we're men but yo guys I gotta eat
I gotta actually eat I've been here for
like 25 minutes my lunch break is like
35 45 minutes and so now I gotta eat my

in like two seconds right because I want
to be hanging out with you guys on my
lunch break and then I'm getting you

I will see you guys later man love you
too man
you know I got this video man I'm gonna
see if I release it today I got this
video that it's sad
I haven't released it because I was this
close to crying like I'm not gonna lie
to you guys
it was about story of me when I was
going to school I was this close to
 crying
I'm not even lying and then I haven't
put it out because of that so I might
rerecord it because it's too much like
you have me at this this mood of like
man it brought me back to that moment
where I didn't have nothing and I was
about to cry because I was like man this
is up like people see me that I
owe everything is cool and he's all
smiley phrases and whatever right but
I've been in situations that are just
 sad right and that's why I'm
like when I hear people tell me a sad
story like I try to help them I try to
feel you know help them out and try to
guide them the right way because I've
been in situations oh it's really
up so I think it's a good motivational
story you know I probably release it you
