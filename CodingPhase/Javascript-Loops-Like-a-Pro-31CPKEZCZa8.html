it again man calling face.com make sure
you subscribe and make sure you like the
video you dig it's your boy Joe back at
it again showing you four loops today
alright
so very simple okay so what's a for loop
for loop is just pretty much or even the
loop is just pretty much repeating
something something that you don't want
to repeat constantly right so like let's
say you have a list you don't want to
have to print out console.log honda
bands BMW for each one at a time right
so instead of you having to do it every
you know repeat it like 20 times you
just do it one time and then the for
loop does it for you so like let's say
an example well pretty much you start
with this you have an initial expression
a condition and an increment of that
expression so pretty much you're saying
okay
we start with this this is how you write
a for loop you say for and then you say
I equals zero and then you say I it's
less than the cars length there's four
cars here remember cars was a race they
start with a zero right so it goes zero
one two three all right and then from
there you basically have what you call
an increment expression which is you
seen I plus one so every time that it
loops it goes from zero and then it adds
one it goes to one not one becomes two
and then you add another one then two
becomes three and then it stops because
that's already four numbers all right so
pretty much you're gonna see what
happens it goes Honda Benz BMW m4 so
what it's doing is printing out each one
one at a time right now let's say we go
we just want to see the eye right now
it's gonna show you the index so this
was printing so it's running the loop
and it's saying okay it goes one by one
so it goes zero one so
three and remember is zero one two three
so that's a loop right all right now
that's a for loop that's the easiest one
all right
then you have two wild loop okay all
right so this is the same concept so
what I'm saying while I is less than
cost on that left which is I is less
than four run this loop so what it's
saying okay it goes 0 1 2 3 right now I
could have went in and done something
like you know it is 20 and it's gonna go
for each one he's gonna print it out see
what's happening there or I could done
gonna duck hungry you know so Dan's
gonna print out every single number from
zero to 100
all right all right yeah he does got
that one that's the wild loop that's
super easy - all right now let's do a
do-while so pretty much the same do
console.log i and then incremented by
one now remember that I is zero right so
what I'm saying do console.log I and
then add a 1 to the I every time right
so in a sense keep doing this while I is
less than car left which is 4 right so
let's see what happens it prints it out
you see well we could have done
something like this cause see print it
out I'm saying super easy you know
now the same four objects right let's
say you want to print out you have an
array right and a rate that has objects
inside of them right so you could do
something like a for in loop
where
it basically looks through the property
so what is the property this all right
so let's say an example we're gonna go
one by one so you don't get lost okay
right now is basically looping through
each one cards object this three car
objects here so it's like okay one
object here one object here and one
object here right so there's three so
it's basically going in so it's saying
okay inside a car a car objects that's
three three objects so basically print
out the index of each one so then that's
what happens here
you basically prints it out for you so
go zero one two all right now let's say
we want to print out the cars objects
names it's not going to do that because
right now what is printing is the object
remember that right now that's what's
inside of each each property inside of
the doorway right now let's say for the
other one if we wanted to print out the
name we have to do cars object and then
put the index and then do a dot name and
then it's gonna print it out how the
Benz BMW right now
that was the four in remember do what
you got to remember about this is just
pretty much it starts with the index
remember that I is always gonna be the
index of whatever you know how many
objects are inside the array alright so
let's say for this this actually giving
you the value so let's say for four off
loop alright
this instead of like this one this one
was giving you the index of it remember
that this one when you put on you know
you console.log eye is going to give you
the object itself
so instead of you having to write car
object and then put in the index for it
is going to give you the index or the
the I is already the object itself
already okay so let's say you wanted to
print out the name all we do is I dot
name and it prints it out alright try to
make this super short super quick I mean
if you don't get this man I don't know
what to tell you my like this is so
super easy now if you need to go back
into you know for the video rewind it do
whatever you got to do trust me
this is like super easy remember that
it's not difficult JavaScript it's not
difficult at all
remember that for loops it's like this
alright and all you gotta remember this
up and then show expression this could
have been whatever any other number you
could have changed this to any other
number and basically say okay i 0 as
slowness is less than whatever number
you decide to put here is going to
always add on another number to the I so
if it was 20 then here on once the loop
goes through is gonna become 21 and then
if it keeps going it's gonna go 22 23 24
super simple man any questions let me
know and that's it alright guys make
sure you subscribe and show you like the
video make sure you show some love I'm
delicious for you guys man there's a
super quick if you can't get this let me
know and I'll break it down to you you
know I'm in person right alright
guys I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
