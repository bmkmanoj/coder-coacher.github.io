and I done did it again yeah we here we
live where my peoples is that yeah man
sorry about that OBS been acting crazy
lately it's like I need to have a super
crazy connection you know for this
stream to actually work and it's like
man you know it's crazy like right now
I'm working with like five megabytes up
you get what I'm saying so there's like
OBS is 1080p it has a whole bunch of
stuff happening you know as far as like
you know you got the live chat room you
have a whole bunch of things man so I
guess we're gonna have to do an upgrade
I don't know to where I gotta call up
Xfinity to figure it out to see what
other services they got because listen
man I can't survive for five megabytes
up like yeah it's like you get a hundred
down but it's like what if you actually
need to be uploading or you need to be
live-streaming or you need to be you
know like gaming or something like
that's kind of ridiculous
you got what I'm saying so yeah I don't
know why what is saying like for some
reason saying like I don't know you guys
tell me how's the stream right now I'm
trying there's a different way of
streaming live yeah let me know can ya
ya hear me can you see me I mean this
this way actually works this actually
works I'm seeing myself and it actually
works perfectly so I guess I'm gonna
have to do it like this man it sucks cuz
I like having you guys on the chatroom
man
I like showing you know the chatter
we'll see how many people are online and
you know and you guys get to share your
message is live let's see how it goes
man but yeah man we just like everybody
come in getting here get you know get
situated
you know I'm adding this this link for
you guys go ahead is a pull fill this
out basically it's just like a very
simple form so I'm gonna show it to you
guys just let me know you know what I
mean let me know what do you guys think
I should be doing next react Craigslist
do well basically react a Craigslist
clone react Redux complete course react
router complete course bill your own
whatever starter kit gulp wet pack sass
pug basically everything it all depends
on you guys if you guys want me to do
that a lot of people have been asking me
that because I have my you know my web
developer starter kit in in reality is
just you know a whole bunch of things
put together like you guys can build
that yourself so I know a lot of people
been hitting me up like joking can you
go over go can you go over web pack and
basically so they could actually learn
and build their own so if you guys want
to do that if you guys want to say hey I
want to build my own application I want
to build a react native application we
can also do that if you are you know a
beginner and you're like hey man I just
want to practice my HTML CSS and you
know build a responsive site we can also
do that we can also do a phase of Jes
which is a game engine in JavaScript
which basically is like we will build a
game I don't know maybe a Pokemon game
or maybe like
I don't know we could build bomber
we could build high kalus flappy bird we
could build I don't know whatever game
whatever type of game you guys want to
build we can build it always javascript
so what it does it basically helps you
get better with JavaScript when you
build a game it's just like you
understand JavaScript even more so it's
up to you guys if you guys want to do
that and you could click on other here
and then just fill it out and add on
another thing that you think we should
be doing so it's up to you guys okay so
let me see
I'm surprised what is it three o'clock
people don't don't be online or maybe
nobody got the notification we only got
like what like 10 15 people at this time
usually lately I've been making live
videos beginning like 70 people online
is this a bad time for you guys it's
2:43 p.m. not a good time for you guys
man let me see yeah man now I want to
get it on on twitch but I gotta figure
out how to do it you know is the problem
is like look with OBS look at the the BS
that I had to go through with OBS like
OBS needs a more steady bitrate so
you know most people at work right now
what's good Aaron haven't seen you in a
minute man how's life man how's life
treating you
yeah I think I might just come back
later then if nobody's on this right now
I mean I know you guys are in here but
you know it's always good what we have a
lot of people you know I'm gonna go
the chat room let everybody know
squeak yes
Oh
you
all right so let me see let me see was
girls girls girls good yeah seems like
everybody's busy right now everybody's
like they're out it's like three o'clock
schecky is like
you should sweep before you come here
man yeah I do but I don't really use my
Instagram I don't use Twitter like my
Instagram is just I just post up like
family things that say I'd already post
anything you know what I mean I don't
really tell people hey man go subscribe
to her go
add me follow me on social media I don't
be on social media that much so I just
usually just wait until people start
showing up thanks to the notifications
maybe I'll do it later on do a nice
little livestream you know cuz I know
people probably right now what is it 247
people are probably people are probably
just like you know there's somewhere
else yes sir yes sir you know I'm deaf
gonna add a bot for a discord set that
up this week I mean I could set up how
you call this uh if this than that
to do it for me man good just I just
finished doing like all the freakin Ruby
on Rails videos I'm like man I want to
start working on the front end man cuz
it's just odd there's so much back end
in the like the last two weeks I'm like
yo it's a lot of work man I'm like I'm
gonna do some front end have some fun
cuz it's like back in it's fun but it's
work
you got what I'm saying it's not like
I'm chillin it's like I'm doing work you
know where people hit me up and be like
yo like do you even code anymore I'm
like bro I code every day like literally
things that I will be getting paid in a
company is exactly what I'm building on
my website every single day you know
what I mean so let's see people keep
emailing me like Joe to do a Python and
I'm like man I want to focus on what
development man like I want to focus on
web development and I'm gonna do Python
later on if people really want it but I
just want to focus on what developing
that's it to be honest with you
is a lot of work man it's a lot of work
because it's like you gotta explain how
everything works in the backend
you gotta also build it yourself you
gotta at the same time you got to plan
it out you gotta set everything up
sometimes you got to redo the videos
because for whatever reason the mic
didn't record or something might happen
you know what I mean plus I mean I
usually just go live like randomly you
know I that's how I like it I like to
just like surprise people but there's
certain hours like I guess from like
2:00 to 3:00 o'clock
it's never good two to three o'clock
it's never good at all all the time yeah
that's about
people don't even get the the
notifications that's why I told
everybody man you gotta sign up to to
you know the discord channel man so you
could get the notifications cuz they've
now you don't you're not even gonna know
where we get you know we were in we go
freaky laugh and stuff like that I just
did a portfolio to a portfolio review so
that was pretty cool there's a lot of
guys that they're stepping in their game
up man a lot of people are stepping the
game up they listen to what I told them
they listen to the type of portfolios
that were showing up in the beginning
and now they look like okay they're like
you know what we got to step it up so
people are actually stepping it up man
I'm proud of you guys man one of the
people sending me portfolios like new
updated portfolios is like yo ya
listened you know what I mean so
definitely appreciate that cuz it's like
you know I could tell that it's not just
me talking to the air you know like one
of the worst things is when you come
here to YouTube man like you're giving
advice and you're trying to help you Wow
but it's like you're talking to a brick
wall because people just don't want to
do it people don't want to do the work
or people just you know they got too
much things going on or like people come
in and actually the same questions
constantly and you're like why are you
asking me the same question you get what
I'm saying
sometimes people be like yo that like
they don't watch the other videos you
know what I mean so
so don't accessing question if you watch
the videos you will notice that I answer
all of those things already you know but
yeah Shiki says house health my health
is good man I'm chilling Freddy Martinez
is like you know you trying to play you
didn't get a life alert yeah man that's
how it is is YouTube ebk says you're
such an inspiration thank you bro man
check he says your channels late Thank
You Man I appreciate it
Joey channel he's in here brought him in
Joe do you see SS spirits on the daily
what do you think of his value versus
bootstrapping great frameworks
I think look CSS grids is great okay for
what it is do I think that everything
needs to get deleted because CSC is CSS
grids are here now
no like CSS grids is like a CSS trick
you get what I'm saying like you could
go in there and build a page however you
want like nobody's gonna look at you but
I hold God he didn't you see it says
like you know somebody's not gonna be
like oh my god he use CSS or flex boxes
instead of CS x-- grades like nobody's
gonna be doing that it's all preference
man you know saying
all preference for real dreaded dev yeah
we got a link up man I think he was
saying here the other day he was in the
chat room hanging out for a little while
are you affected by the new YouTube
rules I don't know maybe you know
somebody sent me a message saying Joe I
love your continent but you gotta chill
out with the advertising and I'm like
bro I don't even know what advertising
you're talking about most of my videos
are demonetized like let's say if you
watch a video right and you see that
there's advertising on it
you probably see advertising just that
one day and then the next day Google
goes in and flax it like you know people
flag a people going and putting like you
know they put in dumb things right so if
they flag the video or whatever that I
say I don't make no money so it's like
if one day you do get to see advertising
it's like hey man you should be like
great I'm supporting Joe because most of
his videos don't get advertising you get
what I'm saying cuz that's how YouTube
is now you know if you curse on a video
if you sound like you're cursed on a
video or you say something that sounds a
little weird then you know you're gonna
get banned you know what I mean so yeah
man you see now now we get into people's
in here you know the people's coming in
I bet most of you guys didn't even get
no notifications at all right
yeah even getting on notifications
that's my stuff right like google should
be giving out the notifications man but
yeah you know let me see what else what
else
seems like the majority of the people
are choosing Craigslist oh let's see
guys somebody added this score bought
this car bought to show when you go live
using the discord that J yes maybe we
could do let there is a laravel video
already there's a PHP 7 and lerigot
course it's like a long course it's like
20 hours long it's pretty big
it's already there I'm looking at the
results so the majority of the people
are saying to create a Craigslist clone
we could do that with react we could do
that I react your Redux complete course
we could do that tool and
react native so those are the top three
things that seems like everybody wants
make sure you vote man so you guys could
actually figure it out see what you guys
actually want man
Julius are was the question let me know
36 feet booing here man 36 people in
here man
says you will find the worst jobs on
Craigslist they want you to be an
all-in-one person IT support design as a
developer etc yeah ask her sometimes
I'll be honest they're not the best jobs
right but what you gonna do are you
gonna stay in your house complaining and
be like oh man I can't find a job or you
gotta go out there and get your money
you know sometimes this is not you know
it's not as good as you want it to be
but you just have to go out there you
got what I'm saying no matter what hey
what's going on
polymer polymers seems interesting but
polymer is not even is not even a factor
in like you know in the community and
whole right I mean I personally I wish
polymer was more popular than angular
because polymers API and like their
documentation is pretty legit and
there's not too much jargon that you got
to learn but for whatever reason angular
actually became more popular in you know
everybody gravitated to it let me see
master of the mash is crazy let me see
what else what else what else yeah bull
from was a yeah both in Louisiana
programming isn't it as big we can't
just get up and move to another area but
that's the thing when people say that
but like hey man programming is not as
big as you know over here as in other
places yeah that's true it can be it can
be true but I'm pretty sure that
Louisiana has a whole bunch of
businesses right every state has a whole
bunch of businesses like you guys have
two options yeah cool stay home and cry
about like damn there's no jobs around
the corner from me or you could say if
you have a car I'm gonna drive half an
hour away to the closest city and I'm
gonna go over there and work and I'm
gonna find a job over there or I'm gonna
do a thorough research on my area and be
like okay what are the companies that
are looking for people that know HTML
okay
that's a way to start right people want
to join company
that says web developer front-end
developer sometimes you join a company
that says product editor or product
manager or you know content editor
content manager right you join a company
that has those titles a lot of the times
you're gonna be able to use the skills
that you have as a developer and also
get to learn other things like marketing
so it's like you got your hands in in
both places right those jobs are
everywhere
doesn't matter if you're Louisiana if
you're in Alaska those jobs are there
you know as long as you're using your
skills as a web developer then you
should be able to be fine at any job
that they give you you gotta say it's a
process now everybody's gonna go from
zero to Google it's just not gonna work
like that you know what I mean so you
have to make your own journey you know a
lot of people take a little time to be
able to work in smaller businesses and
then from there get their money together
you know like right now you could be
like hey man I wanna get a hundred
thousand dollars but there's no jobs
like that out here so what do you do you
work in a smaller business you do a year
or two you save your money then you
basically jump to a bigger city that's
it yeah YouTube is
of polymer man they used to have a lot
of angular and now they switched
everything to polymer and the new
youtube creator studio is all made with
polymer
I don't know about visas man you gotta
find a channel that that talks about
visas man you got what I'm saying so you
gotta figure that one out
polymer is the new thing I mean polymers
been around for a long time but you know
it's like another thing that just came
out called stencil Jes there's a few
things out there where a visa phase guys
listening on the description I have a
link I want you guys to fill it out yes
it's a poll so I could know exactly what
you guys want to see you know this the
way how I come in and create my content
I I create stuff that you guys want I
don't create stuff that I want or you
know sometimes that things that you
might need I want to start making things
that you guys want you know
oh it's freaking hot I don't know I'm so
hot in here
vacuum net will react
I mean you if you'd know how to use
react with any back-end it doesn't
matter like all you're doing is doing
post requests and get requests you know
using Ajax it doesn't really matter what
exactly is it that you know you're gonna
be using as a front-end developer it
doesn't really matter what's in the
backend for you you know what I mean
because the the back-end developer all
he's gonna do is send you a JSON and
then from there you're gonna be able to
you know control your whole application
and
guys is supposed to be running stop
adding stuff from the back in like most
of you guys don't do none of the back
end courses yeah like that's the problem
that's why I'm just focusing on their on
on the front end you know I was like I
just I gave you guys Larry Brown a very
few of you guys even did it I give you
guys a Ruby on Rails very few guys of
you very few of you guys even touched it
so I'm I'm staying away of from the back
end I'm not going back in for a while
I'm noticing that everybody just wants
to do front end stuff you know cuz
people want to take the easy route so
you know we'll give them what they want
you know so I wanna I wanna make sure to
you what they want me back in
a script man I'm not touching I was
gonna do no no no Jes course I'm not
even gonna do it because nobody is going
to do it let's be honest out of let's
say there's 54 people here out of those
54 people maybe 25 are on the website
right if I put it up here on YouTube for
free nobody's going to do it at all
I've already tried this right and
there's the thing like all this stuff
takes a lot of time it takes a lot of
work to do so it's like not only do
Google not throw any of my tutorials
online like they don't show it like if
you search nodejs tutorials none of my
tutorials show up you search
laboratories none of my tutorials is
gonna show up okay now not only that but
then at the same time from the people
that are signed up to the website most
of you guys about 80% of you guys only
want to do the front-end stuff so it's
like I'm only going to do front end
that's it yeah I took down I took down
the nodejs course from the website
because I want to read the way with
cloud nine because that's another thing
too where it's like most people don't
even know how to set up their
environment in Windows so it's like a
lot of people are are using you know
windows but then they don't they don't
understand that that's the main reason
why I tell people get either a Mac or
install Linux on your computer because
you as a brand new developer somebody
who doesn't know how to debug your own
computer you don't know how to you know
set up environments do the whole process
the best thing for you to do is just get
a Mac or Linux because all you have to
focus on is the code like it sucks to be
a a brand-new developer and then not
only do you have to worry about the code
you have to understand it you have to
build websites then on top of that you
gotta set up your own
systems in in Windows because Windows
doesn't run
none of this stuff natively so it's like
you know it's over I'm finishing up the
Ruby on Rails is I just did like a whole
bunch of videos if you go to the website
you could go in and check it out
I just did the whole blog in Ruby on
Rails is already done
now the next project that I wanted to do
for Ruby on Rails was gonna be to do the
backend of Craigslist on Ruby on Rails
by looking at the numbers I'm just not
gonna waste my time because most of the
people don't want to do the backend
either they don't want to do it or
they're just so much a beginner level
that they can't even do the backend so
it's like if I go in there and I start
creating a whole bunch of back-end
courses it's like literally I'm doing it
for like five ten people nobody else is
doing them because most of the people on
the website are beginners you know what
I mean so I'm adding a couple of other
stuff too like you to me and and stuff
like that cuz for some reason the
backend courses are really popular like
the labral course is really popular on
udemy but on the website itself it's
like everybody is just like beginners
man
I'm mission says the thing the thing is
all this coding stuff sounds neat but
most people want to make real money not
the 70 $80,000 best-case scenarios BS
well obviously I want to know how much
you make right now and honest salary how
much you making right now how much are
you making this year on your taxes how
much are you gonna report this year you
know because I see a lot of times people
are talking about man I want to make a
half a million dollars two hundred
thousand dollars and it's like you're
making like thirty thousand dollars
right now and it's like
you could double your money doing web
development and then in two years after
that you can make $100,000 all right but
nobody wants to put in the work people
want to get this thing like this it
doesn't work like that
you think doctors get paid $300,000 in
one year nah
those guys they actually got to do ten
years of school and that's that's not
even counting you know the times that
they gotta go to hospitals and do their
apprenticeships and all the stuff like
it takes time people don't want to put
in the work you gotta say like that's
why it's so easier it's so much easier
to say hey man I just wanna you know
like like people from the hood like
people be like yo I just wanna you know
I want to make money now you know start
selling drugs or start robbing people or
doing dumb in this world instead of
putting into work like you're gonna get
all that money but you have to put in
the work you can't skip the part of I'm
doing the work you know what I mean but
that's what I'm saying
Irishman I mean have you ever touch
eighty thousand you know what I mean
it's like you're still a student it's
like when you say old man people you
know most people
what was the thing they say say the
thing about all this coding stuff sounds
neat but most people want to make real
money which is when you put that
statement that means you're counting
yourself it's like not this seventy
eighty thousand best-case scenario and
it's like Berlin I mean have you ever
had that in your muck like your bank
account have you ever looked at what it
is to have you know let's say six
thousand seven thousand dollars on your
back and count monthly you know what I
mean like it's good it's comfortable you
know what I mean
now what do I always tell people like
you gotta be an entrepreneur if you want
more than that you want to open on your
business you now you're not gonna make
more than one hundred and twenty
thousand dollars let's be honest like
most people are not going to make more
than that unless you're gonna go to
school for management or you're gonna go
and take some some courses on I'm
becoming a project manager and you do a
lot of ass-kissing on a company like
most people are not gonna go beyond
right that's like the ceiling you know
it's like $120,000 if you learn
something like goaling and you become an
expert on that then you could get to up
to 180,000 all right but there's a
ceiling after that right like you got a
either go to you know get your your
master's in computer science to become
an architect and like you know just an
architect and infrastructure you know
and not just programming and encoding
it's like how to set up you know a huge
enterprise from the ground up how to
architect this whole business right like
you have to go in and go out of your way
if you that's the route that you want to
go for me personally my route was like
hey man I'm gonna learn all this stuff
I'm gonna you know put goals for myself
at first all I wanted to do is just get
a tee you know I'll get 50 then I got 50
then I got 80 then from there I got a
hundred then I got a hundred five
thousand and I declined that say you
know what I'm not even gonna take you
there from there so you know what I'm
gonna continue doing other stuff got
a hundred there from there I started
doing other different things online that
generated you know twenty thousand
dollars here thirty thousand dollars
there you know and it just starts
generating last year I made one hundred
seventy four thousand that's 174 that's
I don't know that's like the average of
three people here in the United States
working I did it by myself so when you
code when you learn all this stuff it's
like it's the possibilities of where you
want to take it it's not really your
dare and be like oh this is all I'm
gonna do nah man once you learn this
thing is a skill you know what I mean is
like you know those guys that become
like it's a trade like let's say
somebody who becomes a construction
worker right you could be stay as a
construction worker but that doesn't
mean you have to die as a construction
worker because if you're smart what you
do is you say okay cool
I know how to you know build these
houses let me get three four guys if I'm
smart
let me save some money hire three four
guys so now I open up my own business
next thing you know you start getting
more houses more contracts more
contracts next thing you know you
earning two three million dollars a year
you started at the bottom it was just
the Mexican dude just you know putting
the little bricks alright that's how you
started but that doesn't mean that
that's how you're gonna end up if you're
smart so it's like a lot of people don't
want to put in the work you know if you
come from money who come from you know
if you come from money
let's put it like this you have a better
chance of making more money right
because you could become a developer and
say hey I have an idea hey mom and dad
sent me you know a hundred thousand
dollars so I could promote this on
YouTube and Facebook ads and then now
this idea that you had you could
actually take it into you know fruition
and just promote it and make it popular
out there because you had the capital to
promote it and if you don't have that
money your goals is different your goals
is you gotta work yourself up
you gotta continue that's what my
channel is not about the people that
it's like they're good if you're good
and you're making you make your money
already like this channel is not for you
you know what I'm saying I always tell
people like that it's like the channels
not for you if you're good if you're a
kid that's like you know papi and mommy
got you this channel is not for you
because your motivation is not is not
the same as the motivation that is for
me and for a lot of people that's in
here you know I mean like it's the same
thing when people come in and it's like
oh I want to learn I don't know I want
to learn Python for educational purposes
yeah you can learn Python and for
educational purposes right but that
means you you live in a very good
situation where you can say hey I could
actually go and spend five to six hours
out of my day to learn something that
maybe I'll get a job you know what I
mean like maybe I'll become a data
scientist if you have that option to
take those type of risk this channel is
not for you this channel is for the
people that it's like yo I'm here to
make something happen I'm here to get
this money I'm here to grow understand
I'm coming in as a self-taught developer
and I got a grind and basically you know
every year I go up if you're somebody
who believes in that this channels for
you you know what I mean but yeah but
it's like a lot of people
don't want to put in that work people
don't want to do anything if it's up to
them you know everybody wants to be a
superstar everybody wants to be the next
LeBron James every girl wants to be the
next Kim Kardashian hey why would you
wanna do any work why would you want to
go to you know study all the stuff when
you know you could go on Instagram show
you ass and its work and next thing you
know you might get some sponsors and you
might become a bartender at a bar and
make $3,000 in one night yeah but then
you basically degrading yourself and
it's like for what you know what I mean
it's like now you're just a piece of
meat out here you got a saying so it's
like nobody wants to do the work 84

with all the possibilities in the world
and and and you know they can do
whatever they want they have all their
paperwork they have all the things you
know they can't even make $50,000
because they don't even work that hard
you know what I mean like a lot of
people have a dream of building a
business but they not just they're not

gonna end you know so it's like it's up
to you what you want to do with yourself
right but like I told you guys man
hey you got a grind this is not about
coming in here but I came in so I can
know a be dowsing is not good it's like
bro you don't even know what money is
then man when I was making creaking you
know I was making like what like $9 an
hour as a parking attendant or queen
cents or more like I dreamed of making
that much money you know it's like that
means when you say $80,000 it's not and
that means you have no struggles in your
life you have no struggles you don't
even know what paying rent is you don't
even know what paying your own cell
phone bill is you don't even know what
it is to just to survive it costs like
400 500 dollars to eat every single day
like that's how much it costs to
maintain the house you know like it's
$600 just for food to pay your mortgage
could be like mm you know mm so $2,500
you gotta pay gas bills you know
electric bills you gotta pay a whole
bunch of stuff when you don't know
what's going on in the world and I hope
papi and mami got me it's like yeah

nothing but when you're grinding and you
working out here trust me
