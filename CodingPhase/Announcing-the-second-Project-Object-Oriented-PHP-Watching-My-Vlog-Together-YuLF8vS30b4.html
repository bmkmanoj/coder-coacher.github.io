backing out and did it again yeah we
here kids
alright listen I got new announcements
man new announcements coming through new
announcements are here all right and we
have something new you know we have
something new today so we can laugh
about it and I mean I don't know people
need to just relax in this world all
right
people need to have like a a sense of
humor people need to just like have fun
in this world you know what I mean and
that's what I'm here for right I'm here
to teach you code I'm here to entertain
you I'm here to keep your attention in
coding alright so you know instead of
you going watching the Kardashians
you'll be here watching the mentorship
right that's what we hear instead of you
going to watch Walking Dead watch the
reruns you can watch that tomorrow you
could DVR that man watch it boy coding
face we ain't here live man you know
this is very rare you know what I mean
very rare you know what I mean shout out
to my boy you know little B it is very
rare to see your boy out here live late
nights you know on a Sunday night I know
a lot of people going to work listen
come in tell your friends about the
livestream just come and chill with us
for a little bit I know there's gonna be
a couple of people that's gonna chill
with it chill with us for the long run
rain the whole livestream you don't have
to stay here for the whole live stream
just stay here for their announcement
that's it that's all I need from you
right you're coming in here right now
and you're like man what does Joe have
to say today we haven't seen no videos
of him today what's going on you know
cuz people start missing me on YouTube
that I like man it's a boring day with
our coding phase that should be that
should be uh a frickin motto you know
man it's a boring day without coding
fees Oh word
hey I'm just saying you know what I mean
like your boy I come here I get gifts
somebody came in and it's like hey the
assistant came in and brought you your
brand-new goggles sir now what what just
came through she's out here I guess she
just came from Connecticut right now
but this is cool all right so we got a
lot of stuff that we got to talk about
tonight the first thing that we're gonna
start talking about is the project right
so for Aaron cam Casey who else
Aaron cam Casey and Robinson right all
four of you have to do this project and
this is something that I was gonna
announce later on all right so the
project is actually giving you guys an
option you can continue to do the
project that you are working on right
okay you can continue to find you know
to try to fine-tune it in just skill it
so you have it's basically you have an
extra week to get it done right so you
have an extra week to get it done and
then from there what's gonna happen is
you have this extra week or you can go
to a local business in your neighborhood
right find a local business doesn't
matter what it is look in your
neighborhood and find a Chinese
restaurant find the furniture store fine
whatever look at their website and
recreate it but improve it in your own
way with your own design your own styles
whatever you want to do to it all right
so that's the project you have two
options option one continuing the
project that you're doing so go in there
skillet make it better clean it up right
and then you could add stuff like
JavaScript you know Casey actually went
in there and started working with
reacting you know what I'm really he
took it to the extra mile right so I
will say guys
you know I know a lot of people haven't
watched it if you haven't watched the
episode go to coding phase comment so
you don't be out of the loop right now
man and that's one announcement okay so
go to your to the website if you haven't
seen this coz right now you probably
lost you're like man what happened what
happened who who who's in the mentorship
program who listen that that's what
happens when you don't go to the website
coding phase comm mentorship show watch
it it's completely free all you have to
do is register to watch okay now first
announcement repeating it again you can
continue doing the same projects or you
can go and find a business in your
neighborhood and build their website
alright I'm not saying go over then talk
to the owner be like hey man can we deal
you know can we have a deal and be like
I'll make your website for five hundred
dollars now I'm not talking about that
I'm talking about going around your
neighborhood finding a company I'm not
talking about don't be like hey I'm
gonna rebuild Best Buy like you're not
helping yourself out right I'm talking
about small business I'm talking about
the bodega from the corner I'm talking
about the you know the Chinese spot you
know up the block I'm talking about the
furniture store from you know
mom-and-pop shop right those type of
businesses you know the travel agency
whatever right find one in your
neighborhood take a picture of it right
and then build a website for them now
it's up to you if you want to go the
extra mile and push yourself and
actually reach out to somebody and say
hey I build your website what do you
guys think I could build it for free I
could you know you pay me something I
set it up for you you could even out of
this he could make some money you know I
mean like these are real life challenges
this is something that I did before
right this is something that I did
before when I was going to school I went
to a company I build their application
it was actually in dotnet you know so it
was like a real application it wasn't
even a web it was like a real
application um we did that for a company
that basically what they did was they
picked up like animals like you know
puppies and cats and stuff like that and
when the person's at work they go pick
up the cat from the house and then take
it to the doctor's appointment or
whatever you know rich people stuff like
you know rich people in New York City
who are lazy you know millionaires and
stuff like that so we found a local
business that was actually doing that
and then we reached out to the guy and
the guy was like hey man can you build
this for me I mean we totally we gotta
build it regardless right and at the end
he gave us some money you know what I
mean so it was actually pretty cool now
this can happen to you guys but it's not
about that it's not you don't have to
reach out to them just find a business
and they're from there build a website
for them okay now what's cool about this
is gonna push it to create something new
everything that you learn from the first
website right now you're gonna bring
that knowledge and say okay cool now I
could fix this like this I couldn't you
know what I mean so like let's say an
example the website is a restaurant
right go to dribble comm find different
websites that are about restaurants
right use them as inspiration don't copy
a whole design from one one website
right what you're going to do is go in
there get inspiration from it
now another thing that you can do is
basically you can uh you know just
create it on your own if you feel like
you're creative like that the way on
your own if now then use multiple
websites use three to four different
designs and take the things that you
like so you say hey I like the header of
this I like the top section of this I
like the menu section of this and build
it right if it's a furniture store fine
you who literally put in furniture on
dribble comm and you're gonna find if
it's an e-commerce store you're gonna
put ecommerce and you're gonna find a
whole bunch of e-commerce stores there
so just use them as inspiration to
create your own website with
own style you know what I mean like
that's it
that's simple so you have those two
options continue working on the first
project clean it up add some JavaScript
and make it nice and fancy or say hey I
want to start from scratch I want to
find a business in my neighborhood right
and I'm gonna build a website for them
okay now that was still the first
announcement the second announcement was
and it still is right this goes out to
Sam and this other girl I believe her
name was mild Elena or something like
that basically my whole thing was that
this was gonna be a surprise for you
know the second week after the second
week right so somebody got cut Sam got
cut all right this week the week before
was this other girl mouth Elena cheating
I don't know she didn't show up period
all right so you know I wish I'm not in
the but the best too but the whole plan
was for people that get cut they're not
like cut him like we throw them away as
I hate your garbage we're throwing you
away it is not it's like you have to
basically continue making the projects
right and then we're gonna continue
adding you to a poor so now on the week
we could say hey you know Sam got the
most votes to state or whatever right so
now he has the chance to come back later
on sorta show right you couldn't make it
for the first week it's fine well then
it's okay Sam you couldn't make it to
the second week but this is what happens
when you just don't you know you you
jumped a gun right so now let's go back
to this is the second this is the second
topic if you didn't know we switch in
topic so the first topic was the
project's would give you guys everything
now we're in the second topic so we're
going to go you know because this I said
I wasn't gonna answer to no more
comments but this is actually part of
the show too when you think about it so
pretty much is like Sam got pissed off
so he feels like we actually like was
joking on him because of the Street
Fighter thing like so he's like there
were only two from the original but only
one got the oh treatment I see and
you know you you know your trade but you
are unlikable f head you've proven that
take no potential employers how he
treats his pain subscribers who have put
their trust in him out of 27 he picked
four and picks out of and picks out the
one out of the two of no-shows to mess
with very f with right pretty selective
guy he's got some problems
don't ever my debit card for posting
this eight hall now I'm guessing he got
pissed off because we put a countdown on
him you know like you don't have Street
Fighter is like when somebody's down and
it's like come on we waiting on him to
to press Start
he never press Start right that's not
messing with you Sam like that's just
like his life is like we're just joking
around and say I do the same thing look
at Casey Casey King you know came in
with the the crazy sound like you know
what I mean like people are too uptight
man you gotta relax you know what I mean
like if you were just relaxed and you
will see what was happening like I'm
telling you I'm I'm not cutting people
alright last season I don't even cut
anybody so why would I cut people like
completely like throw them to the
garbage like no that's not the idea
people can make it fine
so they I'm actually creating extra side
project for you guys to be able to say
hey now I'm gonna be able to be out of
the competition but I have the chance to
come back into the competition because I
missed that date I missed the deadline I
mean you have a deadline you know what I
mean you're telling me in a whole week
you know I read an email after the fact
that we
already it was already Saturday and I'm
like it's already Saturday you know what
I mean if you didn't reach out by Friday
and I didn't get that message everybody
else
hit me up throughout the whole week I
didn't hear not not even a peep from you
not even click a little type if you want
to say je the letter J if you were to
send me the letter J I would've been
okay cool right I've seen this happen
people here have seen this happen
people get nervous they don't want to
show up which I don't understand you
know why people want to sign up and to
something that they know they're gonna
have to pretty much you know like be
responsible you know and I mean like but
we didn't do nothing bad to you we've
pretty much put a countdown like we
waiting for Sam to press start that's it
we didn't even do anything crazy you
know what I mean like it was funny
people laughed I laughed people loved it
you know what I mean like you know and
we actually after this I'm gonna bring
up another topic after this cuz this how
are we doing man we come in we have you
hit you with the first topic now we're
in the second topic of Sam getting you
know pissed off because we we put a
countdown on next to his face of like
hey man
press Start we never saw you press Start
man it's like you know it's like
somebody playing against the goals and
it's like we're still waiting for you to
come in and press Start that's a it's a
joke man we joking around in here you
know it's not it's not that serious I
mean you wasn't taking this - serious
either
I mean anybody could look at the video
from everybody on the video on the first
first episode from everybody you
literally could tell like he wasn't
paying attention it's like we're talking
we over here talking about the topics
we're talking about the season well the
projects is gonna be and you're like
watching TV and I'm like I know you
wasn't gonna show up right so you know I
could have really went hard and it
wasn't like I'm giving you a second
chance like even right now you could
redeem yourself right you could redeem
yourself is like it's like putting in an
extra quarter it's like hey I'm putting
an extra quarter to the game
I'm trying to come back in I'm gonna do
the second project or I'm gonna continue
doing the first project and show up next
week and then let the people decide if
they want you back in I'm not choosing
it right I'll let the people decide who
stays who goes who gets cut you know and
that's it you know what I mean like I'm
not the one choosing this you know so
yeah so that's the first thing and now
what was the second thing the the third
topic that I wanted to get into um damn
there was another sign that was gonna be
important oh yeah third topic okay so
the third topic is guys if you haven't
really gone into PHP man good listening
I just broke down PHP like like a KitKat
son I broke it down like a kick acid
here's a piece here's a piece of piss
like you know take a look your low kick
cat I broke it down sign like I'm amazed
I'm amazed you know what I mean like you
know when I was like trying to learn
object-oriented programming especially
with PHP you know three four years ago I
was like man this thing is hard and now
I just broke it down I'm like yo this
huh I could tell the growth that I have
over the past few years I was like
constantly coding and building and
building all the stuff cuz to me this
thing was hard and like now it just
broke it down I was like oh man this
thing is easy so for those of you guys
that haven't seen this here like we have
a lot a lot of videos man we have a lot
of videos on this on this course man and
you know one thing going back the same I
do appreciate you know he did say like
yes I know what I'm doing cuz yes I know
what I'm doing I just wish you wouldn't
you know put in more time to it man like
cuz I don't okay we're going back to the
other side check of of Sam I don't
understand why people signed up if they
know they're not gonna show up right or
they not feel comfortable with showing
their face
or they don't feel comfortable with you
know showing their skills online because
you might be good you might be bad you
know what I mean like it's a learning
experience
all right everybody goes through it you
know it's like not everybody can win in
this world right right now in reality
I'm creating like a you know something
extra for people to be able to come in
and and still be part of the show you
know what I mean and I'm also gonna
leave that to everybody else there's so
many people that send me messages hey
Joe
I'm um you know I'm not part of of the
crew you know what I mean like I'm not
part of this season so what I'm doing is
oh yeah that was the topic so what I'm
doing is the people that got cut and the
people who are actually high coders who
actually want to be part of next season
or are actually doing the projects
themselves in their house you could
submit your project with the people that
got cut and then from there you have a
chance to come in like right now you
know this is three let me see how many
weeks it's next week well this Friday we
have one and then after that so you
could show up to any of those two dates
right if you come in and do the projects
two on your own we get what I'm saying
so you're also now competing with the
people that got cut if you got cut you
got cut right the people chose that
right but then now you have the
opportunity to have the people that
wanted to show up for this thing 27
people send me emails that they wanted
to be part of this and I chose this for
right and I had a surprise guest which
was Casey cuz I wanted to just like have
a little twist where people better oh
shoot Casey's in here you know I wanted
to show that to the people so what I'm
doing now is if you're one of those 27
people or people who didn't even see
this and didn't find out so last-minute
you have in our opportunity that you can
create this project project number two
I'm gonna create another video about it
just to make
more concise but I'm just doing this
live stream right but you have the
opportunity to come in with the people
that got cut and now you're competing
with the people that got cut to be able
to come back into the game and say hey I
couldn't make it to the first week well
I'm trying to make it to that third week
right you know what I mean
I'm trying to make it to the fourth week
so that's what we're doing kids that was
the the third topic we have the first
one which is the projects right the
second one was addressing Sam because
Sam got pissed off because he felt like
we didn't address the other girl
Magdalena who didn't get to show up we
didn't have no image for her we she
didn't even show up right so we couldn't
even add her to the time to the freakin
to the timer where it's like I was gonna
do that regardless I was gonna do it
last week but we didn't have a picture
of her so it wouldn't have made sense
right
this week we added you you cut yourself
off right so pretty much you didn't show
up so you cut yourself off next week the
person that gets cut by the people that
people are choosing this the poles are
there man you know if you go watch to
the the video the mentorship show at the
bottom there's a link where people get
to vote on who's going to get cut right
that person gets cut next week that per
I'm not even telling the person that
does getting cut who's getting cut right
I'm not telling them until Friday until
matter-of-fact Saturday when they see
the video that's when they're gonna find
out they got cut all right that's just
how it is man it's just exciting it
makes it exciting because none of them
it keeps them on their toes it keeps
camest keeps Robinson it keeps Aaron it
keeps KC everybody on their toes of like
oh man I really got to show up I got to
do my work because I don't know if I'm
gonna get cut now if I get cut I'm still
good because now it's like you're on
Team B the people who are trying to get
into the game plus the people that got
cut from previous videos they're in the
same pool now all right
so if you come in on the fourth week
with your project and the people say hey
we're voting for let's say an example if
Casey got cut right
if Casey did his project this week and
you don't show up on the on the show on
Saturday he's still in the competition
he's in the competition here on YouTube
because i'ma put everybody's project
here on YouTube and that people are
gonna choose that the people is gonna
come in and say okay we're choosing this
person to get back into the game we saw
he's grinding we saw him doing a lot of
work we want him to get back into the
game so Sam you know if you would have
just kept your head you know straight in
and you listened and instead of getting
pissed off for no reason and nobody's
guys listen I'm not trying to steal $4
three $3.75 I'm not trying to steal
three thousand 75 cents from you guys
all right people have hit me up like
about their money like they want or okay
somebody hit me up with they wanna
they're going to cancel like two months
from now something like that and they
wanna have extra three months free month
because they paid twice somehow and I'm
like okay cool I don't know how they
paid twice but fine cool you get the
extra free month right I'm not trying to
keep you for your $3.75 and when I give
you a refund you get the full refund
which is your $5 I'm not trying to keep
your father's guys like seriously make
people you know even when you do
something nice it's still backfires it's
crazy that's just how it is that's why
when I see people and you know like
famous people it's like I'm not even
famous right I'm not I'm just so regular
to do it right so I'm thinking in my
head like what if I was like famous or I
was like you know trying to give you
know like how this guy was his name um
Alex Rodriguez this week he gave money
to Puerto Rico gave money to to Mexico
but he's part Dominican right
the Dominicans were like oh why are you
giving to them and you never gave to
Dominican Republic and it's like doesn't
matter who I'm giving to if I'm still
helping people you get what I'm saying
like even if you're helping people
people got something else to say your
body so he's ridiculous all right now
that was the third subject man you know
pretty much is we're giving a chance to
everybody so if you actually want to
come in and say hey I'm trying to come
in on the third or the fourth week do
the project right
you gotta come in to the project in and
that's it then we letting the people
this is the second poll you know what I
mean there's the second poll for the
people to decide hey this kid he worked
hard you know he didn't show up to the
first week she didn't get to come in on
the first week this kid Sam didn't get
to show up even he got pissed off man
let's give him a chance he did a great
job right do your project let the people
choose to bring you back in right now
with this whole message in this whole
comment and that you left you know it's
up to the peoples they really want to
mess with you you know what I mean like
you know what I mean like you throw it
out there like oh I'm a paying member of
guys literally like 80% of the people
here on this channel at some point Dave
being a paid member from the website
right some people come in they you know
they stayed there for two three months
some people cancer they come back the
next month some people forget to pay it
because they use all debit cards or they
use or whatever then they realize oh man
I haven't paid so they come back in and
pay again everybody here have they have
put some part of of themselves to coding
face.com have either poor boy any
courses from you to me which supports
this channel so everybody here is a pain
member no matter what you guys you're
supporting me if you don't have Google
let's say um ad blockers you're
supporting me somehow you're supporting
you know what I mean so everybody here
is a pain member there's no separation
between there's
the free members this is the paid
members like it doesn't matter this is a
community you know the people that I
know every single person here all ten
thousand members which they will be able
to pay for the membership and help me
out help the channel up but I know other
people's that coming from third world
countries there's people who are or
don't even have a job right now that's
what they trying to learn right the
people that can help out will help out
right and that's just how it is I'll
treat everybody the same ways and just
because you you pay member is like you
feel like I'm gonna pay member I should
have never been put out there like it's
a freaking countdown
you act like we create we photoshopped
you into some Cree
some crazy gay porn like now all you got
was just a countdown like you know what
I mean like it would have been crazy we
we would have photoshopped you you know
banging or dunkey from the back you know
what I mean like then that you would be
like damn Joe you did me dirty right
well it's more like a countdown you ever
play video games you ever play Street
Fighter like it's a joke laughs it's
okay
all right now let's move on to the next
topic okay so yeah so we were talking
about the next topic which was PHP so
for the people that want to learn speech
P listening I'm gonna put right there
man this thing I'll be honest this thing
is definitely worth the $40 and I'm
putting it out there now of course when
you use my code you're gonna get 50% off
if you want to buy the course by self
twenty bucks
now if you just say you know what I want
to get every single course that Joe has
for pretty much ten bucks you could get
it alright so you use the description
below and you get all the courses man we
talking about like a lot of videos man I
really going deaf into everything man
and at the same time we got global
variables we got object-oriented
programming with PHP like this a lot of
videos and there's so much content here
guys and then on top of that we also
adding a project to it all right so this
really no point of you learning a
language
a project okay so we're also adding
projects to it that's why we do here
coding phase comm you boys backing out
and did it again damn kids like you know
what I mean like we in here like that
like dad the swag is real man you know
what I mean the sauce is out there you
know and the other topic which is coming
up

world at any moment right any given
moment as people all over the world

special and I'm like that's for the
people from YouTube like if you missed
out on that and you didn't believe in
the the sauce you don't believe of what
we was trying to do here three months
later you can't expect the the code for
the far out special you know what I mean
like that's how it is now the people
that find me from Chora Twitter even the
team treehouse blog thing three times

people that you know I really love out
here

which is you know we're about to be a
year now tomorrow well
pretty much let's say 12 a.m. it's gonna
be officially one year that we bring
here on YouTube let me see let me make
sure I got a make sure because I gotta
make sure I got a look at this the right
way I gotta go into my history of my
videos I gotta look at my very first
video very first video I believe it's
November 6 I just dropped a that day I
just dropped a random video just for the
hell of it right that's why I was like
me I don't know if I should do YouTube
in reality I started doing YouTube in
January I could say like I'm a youtuber
in January but when was the first video
that we dropped I'm gonna tell you right
now November 6
I basically dropped a video call why
become a web developer in 2017 which is
this one right here that was the other
topic man I forgot about that I forgot
to remind you guys about that why become
a web developer in 2017 November 6 2016

yeah man it's been a year man you know
it's crazy I was gonna bring our buses

dropped a video number 6 in there from
there I didn't drop I dropped another
video I can't drop your videos till
December something December 5th
like one video per week something like
that and then after that you know my
sister passed away December so I took
some time off and then in January yeah
after she passed an old after she passed
away I said you know what I'm gonna go
really hard and come into YouTube in you

numbers now man like we skyrocketing man
especially once I get this new studio
like you guys are seeing like the first
version of coding phase calm there's the
raw uncut there's like one of those
moments you know when you see somebody
that's about to blow up and you're like
oh man he's out he's giving out mixtapes
out on his car but his music is good I'm

multiple show stuff that's gonna
continue you know being entertaining
because we're learning how to call but
doesn't mean to it doesn't need to be
freaking boring we don't need to have a
boring time learning to code
we could have a good time learning to
code you know what I mean so that's what
I provide man also to like somebody
somebody took this the video idea for
angular they took it so serious oh my
god
people need to seriously have a I don't
know it's like they don't have like a
funny bone in their body like really you
know what I mean
I found that video I mean who who saw
that video that angular form is angular
5 video that I made this week I find
that video to be hilarious you know what
I mean it's like I can go you know
toe-to-toe with the best of them you
know what I mean when it comes to coding
man you throw the best of them I'm right
there back to back with them you know
what I mean like I like to have fun is
YouTube this is now you know when you
try to do too much serious stuff on
YouTube your channel stack meets right
because people come to YouTube for
entertainment people don't come here
just for education people come in and
use your channel as an encyclopedia like
oh I want to learn angular today so they
go to your channel and watch and learn
angular but that doesn't keep them
coming back you know what I mean like
people come back every single day and I
appreciate that
so it's like what we've been doing here
is great like I know what I'm doing you
know what I mean you know thanks to
everybody that's here supporting me and
showing love man you know one year guys
one year man man we're here man
Kevin Davis like here comes ghetto Joe
flashing honey listen man I'm about to
do I want to do a video like I was
thinking about this I actually did it I
did it about like five six months ago
right I was gonna do a video I matter of
fact no I was gonna do I was actually
gonna release it cuz I did the video
right I had a client which was one of my
friends I mean somebody that I knew from
back in high school he now owns a strip
club so he came in and gave me about you
know $7,000 cash right for me to
actually create a a a website for them
now I was gonna come in here back Oh
your boys out here trapping out the band
oh you know what I mean like I could
really do that you know what I mean cuz
that's why we I'll be laughing man you
know because I think that's the beauty
of it man coming coming from the bottom
man coming from the heart
like and you know it's funny like people
be like oh these kids from the hood I'm
not even really from the hood I'm like
if we was to go technical I'm like I
lived across the street from the hood
that's where we come you know if we
wanted to be technical you know I mean
like I'm not really from the hood but
like people wanted to be technical like
you know man
thank you boy I lived in really good
neighborhoods I grew up in good
neighborhoods you know what I mean it
just happened that we was like you know
we didn't have money that's the truth
you know that's how I grew up you know
what I mean so all the struggles that
somebody had living the glass eight in
the projects I had to go through that
but in a good neighborhood because my
mom was the type of person that she
never gave up she was like you know what
I'm not moving into the projects I'm not
putting my kids in that that system
alright so we never lived in the process
we never lived that you know like the
worst worst neighborhoods of New York we
lived in good neighborhoods in
you know middle-class neighborhoods and
then later on lived him even better
neighborhoods as we got older but we
never had anything right we just happen
to go to you know be in a safe
neighborhood when you you know when you
really look at it like that right but we
had all the struggles of like hey we
have no money hey don't freaking there's
no gas today we got afraid to turn on
the oven so we could get some heat in
the house like stuff like that like real
life stories you know and that's just
how it is you know but when you come
from the bottom man and you just be
getting money man I see my all my
friends man like you know things that I
do here you know some people be like man
you know oh this guy's not supposed to
be on YouTube and this and that and it's
like I'm not looking at other you know
even to this day on this channel I'm not
looking at other developers in and this
and that like when was the last time you
seen you know like one of these dudes
like you know a freaking magic City or
when was the last time you seen you know
like that's like bumping into a simple
programmer at cityscapes right that's a
that's a pretty poppin you know or
freaking over here Star City on on
Queens right like that's like bumping
it's a simple programmer right in like a
strict glove and like you know a spot
that's popping you know busting out
hundreds in and throwing money at them
that's you know what I mean like you're
not gonna see that you might see your
boy Joe do something like that but you
never see that from you know there's
other guys like we're not in the same
link I got Duke coding but it's like
those are not the type of people that I
hang out with like my my boys they make
me look bro you know what I mean like
I'll make money but they make money in
the streets like they out here you know
what I mean so it's like if I come in
I'll show some money sign like that's
the regular thing for us you know that's
like when if you gotta listen to that
jay-z jay-z jay-z
the 40/40 was a 444 album he's talking
about
Oh manda the money phone you know I was
like that's a disconnect or some
some like that right and I'm like
man that won't make sense that's that
makes sense for you cuz you're a
billionaire right but if you you on the
block and you're walking around with
$20,000 cash on you even though you're
you might be like oh I don't live in my
own house I don't own my own car I'll do
this and that but you got $20,000 on you
that's like walking around with a
million dollars in your pocket you know
what I mean so nobody in life nobody's
gonna come in and give you awards right
nobody's gonna be like all this kids
great you know when you are a star
athlete like you know you get little
awards to get every PE that this and
that so you get you know certain
athletes where you were like okay cool I
made it right when you were in real life
you at work you work African whatever
job like your ward is the money that you
got your ward is the things when you
come home and you be like oh I can
afford that I could do whatever the hell
I want you know what I mean like my goal
was to say hey I want it before I even
had a kid my plan was to go remote and
become a digital nomad that was the
whole plan like you see like right now
I'm working from home I quit my job I
did all that stuff because I already had
a plan this is the things that I wanted
to do right this is the things that I
was going to do regardless you know it
just happened I had a kid you know got
my wife so now we switching it up
switching the plans up all right once
she finished her college you got like
one more semester once she graduates
then we're gonna be you know there's
gonna be digital nomad Joe Wow here you
know what I mean like we traveling we
hitting all over the US you know give me
till next summer you know what I mean
but going back to the thing what I was
saying is like where I come from that's
how we are man we are here you know
doing it we just that's why it's like
people that old man like the guy goes
like oh how how can I get that black
that black accent that you got I love it
you know he's like from polling or
something he don't know you don't know
any better right but it's not really a
black accident just a sauce man it just
happened that black people got the sauce
you can't be mad at it you know what I
mean like black people got the sauce
they've been having the sauce for years
you know they come up with the sauce
they you know hit you with the gumbo
right black people got the gumbo you
know what I mean they got the gumbo that
pretty much the sauce give it to people
people run with it you know what I mean
you know they did it with rock they did
it with freakin hip-hop they did it with
everything right so people run with it
right
but the sauce come from from that man
know what I mean like I'm half black
half white that's how I consider myself
a mixed I'm a mixed baby out here all
right so it's like I have that sauce I
have a certain sauce that now everybody
has you know I mean so I'm just happened
to be a developer I just happen to love
coding doesn't mean that I'm gonna stop
out here you know hit him with the sauce
now Kay
this is coding phase this is why I
created this channel I'm gonna be myself
you know what I mean like this is why
people love this channel the int is
entertaining and at the same time they
learn you know it's like you come to my
website calling freeze calm I do a lot
of ant exam a lot of stuff here on this
channel
mess around but you come to my website
you're gonna learn I'm gonna break it
down to you in a way that you can learn
as a self-taught developer but just
because I mess around play around or you
know throw money in the air do a lot of
stuff I do a lot of stunts out here you
know it's just I keep on alone but if
you follow my Instagram you will see
your boy Joe out here driving a couple
of stacks you know what I mean like we
could be out here starting like crazy
but you know how people were saying the
other day Joe we keep seeing you with
the Nirvana shirt listen man their
violence for the house man is where am I
when you see me you see me in my house
when I'm outside you don't see me when
I'm outside you know what I mean we are
here like that kid
you know when I'm outside I got
different gear
there's my indoor clothes man is my
indoor there's my my comfy stuff I got
the the comfy sweatpants
you know we home kid yeah man it's a
good year man yeah man people gotta
definitely learn people gotta definitely
learn how to how to just be independent
man I'll tell this everybody man that's
what I have that no self fishing just be
selfish sometime with yourself like you
know I've done things in companies where
I'm like man I'm doing this for this
company huh huh and then at the end
somebody goes and takes credit for it
right you go in and work my heart
somebody else takes credit somebody else
in a higher place they like they get the
bonus things like that happens all the
time you know what I mean you gotta
learn how to play the game you know so
what are you gonna do you're gonna work
for somebody else for the rest of your
life or create your own company or
create your own you know Val Waxman VOC
Watson is like yo you guys are still
laughs yes sir we live kit we've been
live for what for like an hour and a
half and now we're ya know not even like
yeah now we're 45 minutes or something
like that yeah man
stir a little key word man listen I got
this is one of the worst things there's
one thing that I would tell you guys
back in 2013 right back in 2013 good old
2013 I was still going clubbing I was
still out here I was still out here you
know I mean like I how I was with wifey
but you know what that means but I was
out here you know I mean so listen one
of the worst investments that you could
do right at that time it was all about
the diamonds right again diamond chains
diamond earrings doesn't that right so I
bought myself a that's not a chain all
diamonds I still got it
I barely worry right I try to sell it
the other day all right cuz I was like
I'm never gonna use this thing like I'm
past that stage right and the guy goes
like yo we'll give you like you know
like $4,000 you know like wait what I
was like I'm never you know this is like
the worst investment ever if I would
have bought gold would have been
different
so if anybody wants to buy any like
change don't buy diamond change like as
soon as you buy that thing as soon as it
comes out the freaking the store the the
jewelry store like it's worth half of it
automatically if you buy a solid gold
like how people are wearing now like
I've seen a couple of dudes wearing like
solid gold chains that's a better
investment if later on in life you like
you go through our bad terms or you know
something bad could happen you know you
lose a job whatever you still got that
chain you can still sell there and get
some money out of it but don't buy
diamonds man that's a waste of time
diamonds in reality is for women you
know because they like the shiny stuff
and it looks nice on them but it's
definitely not worth it
near man Thank you Thank You Philippe
yeah now exactly you buy something as
expensive and then you think like oh
this thing is gonna keep the price if I
would have known I would have bought
like a Rolex or something cuz a Rolex is
timeless Rolex II could be like okay if
you maintaining you don't have no
scratches on it and everything's brand
new you can still keep your box you
could still sell that to a store and you
probably lose like a thousand or
something like that thousand five
hundred around there but a chain like a
diamond chain like that's a waste man I
bought a whole tennis court a whole
tennis chain completely I still got it
here I'm probably I'll probably bring it
up maybe I should do a video like that I
would you guys think my worst investment
as a developer right
um that's a good topic I'm gonna make a
video about that my worst investment as
a developer and you know what's funny
like when I I actually heard about
Bitcoin back then instead of me spending
those eight thousand dollars on that I
could have literally bought like a whole
bunch of bitcoins
we got salmon here got your boy Sam Sam
if you want to come back to the show if
you did your work just come back to it
like stop being so pissed off man
like it's part of the show why are you
upset like you got cut you didn't show
up your you didn't send an email by the
time that I saw your email you it was
like already too late and your your
email that you was talking about was

jack man this is what I have to go into
the the history files I don't even know
what's your email let's go into the
history file let's look it up okay

email says I just have it all set up
ready to go but I don't have any active
lines just the parallax and the other
version to show okay so I were to get
the screen to show on hangout I hope
that the window does not update because
I only have it on the computer and the
header and copÃ¡n I have that I'm lost
this whole part right here completely
lost you're like I think I would rather
wait until next week but that's up to
you it's been kind of slow had a lot of
plot of plumbing problems had that Krong
cropped up this week it was probably the
devil interference our current code
listen you still have a chance to come
back in if you did the work show the
work let the people bring you back up
like why are you so mad like now
everybody could win in this world man
like that's just life you know sometimes
you lose
so as you can see why why is he mad can
somebody explain to me why is Sam mad
you know because why is he mad can
somebody explain to me why Sam mad he
feels like he got disrespected because
he got cut you know he was gonna get cut
if you didn't send the files by Friday
like everybody knew that why why did
everybody hit me up why they Aaron sent
me he was trying to give everything done
by Wednesday why did this other kid
Robinson wasn't vacation and sent the
files you know what I mean like Robinson
was on vacation like he he to his work

his thing cam even said days off from
his job like that's just how it is bro
Lika stop complaining why are you
getting so upset

on man like bro you're part of this like
when you signed up for this
people are gonna bring you up you know
what I mean and from other seasons too
they're gonna bring you up then
everybody hey what happened to Sam like
it's recorded forever man like you can't
be mad at it you know what I mean like
it's not that serious
like Yuting freaking sent the files on
Friday you didn't do any of the things
that you needed to do and you got cut
that's it if you want you could do you
want me to send you a link to this right
now I'll send you a link to this Google
hangout so we could do you could chat
you know face-to-face and see you know
you could curse me out you could do
whatever you want saying I'm giving you
a time to defend yourself like all you
need to do is just do the project if not
then don't sign up if you know you
wasn't gonna be able to make it
don't sign out like don't sign up for it
man like like just come back I like him
and I like Sam I don't know why he's
pissed off he's pissed off because he
got the count down like why why is he
pissed off about that
you know what I mean like that's what
I'm saying you know there was this other
girl on last year what was her name not
last year on the beginning of the year
this girl
Trey when Trey Trey said that she was
gonna make it and she didn't send me an
email to tell me hey yeah I'm not gonna
make it
she just didn't show up that said she
got cut no she cut herself up you know I
mean like she's the one that got cut
herself and this other girl Magdalena
she cut her you know she got mad too so
mild Elena was another was the other
girl that was supposed to be in it which
I should make a video about this like if
you agree to it to come up on the show
then you agree to it
great you taking somebody else's place
that somebody that really wants to show
up here right so don't take somebody's
place and then you say oh I'm just not
gonna show up and now you mess it up for
me and mess it up for everybody else I
wanted to be here and then you're like
oh you expect me to not mention you that
you didn't show up you know what
like people are crazy man like sometimes
you bump into people in the internet
like I'm trying to just like exactly
don't sign up if I know I'm like that
the first thing I say on the website
let's go to my website coding phase comm
mentorship show okay so I told everybody
this is the date all right
October 27 November 3rd November 10th
and November 17 pretty much I told
everybody there was this girl that
really wanted to be on the show and she
said Joe I don't think I'm gonna be able
to be on on the show for November 17 so
I'm gonna cancel it and I'm not gonna
show up right so then from there I
actually gave Sam her spot all right and
that's it
and on top of that only reason why I
gave it to him was because he's the one
telling me that he wants to be part of
it so okay cool so you got her part and
there were other people I could have
chose but I said you know what it's
gonna be cool people know him from from
the channel they know his his nickname
wizzy what's this freaking nickname what
is it
yeah man here like a
all day like Oh Mandela effect so I say
okay he's gonna enjoy the show and this
and that like why is that my fault that
you didn't show up you know what I mean
it's just crazy so Philippe it wants to
see the countdown all right this is why
I pissed off all right for no reason
so all right okay okay I'm sorry
I wish that he was okay this week but
that's why it's up a lot of people's
gonna come in so I'm gonna make you some
not gonna make it I'm gonna get cut by
the peoples is up
who's that see who's not sick that's it
I mean is is there something wrong about
that like like what did we do that we
freaking we Photoshop and we Photoshop
them doing some crazy stuff nah it's
just a countdown like we would play
Street Fighter where the guy is like he
just got knocked out and he's like okay
we waiting for him to press Start that's
it
that's pretty much it kids and for that
he's pissed off you know what I mean
like that's what I'm saying yeah the
thing was funny
that's it's just funny it's not Zig
pranks is like Yale I feel bad for him I
didn't know he missed the deadline bro
like if you watch the video it says hey
he didn't hit me up like that wasn't on
me you know the deadline was on Friday
it wasn't on Saturday at one o'clock in
the morning you see what I mean like
this like this reminds me of like
college like you know how people they
leave things for last minute and they're
like okay the first thing I said on
Episode one was guys don't leave things
for last minute you could have guided
your whole project on the weekend done
and then from there you could have been
good you know what I mean then if
something does happen by the end of the
week you could be like okay cool I have
my project and even if you just send me
your project and you couldn't be part of
the show and say hey Joe my house is
flooding right my house is flooded the
plumbing broke I you know I took a dump
in o'clock the the freaking bathroom or
freaking everything just broke in my
house is underwater
all right if that would have happened I
would have been like okay cool you know
what I mean but like come on it wasn't
that serious man
exactly when I put into the little audio
on Casey Casey didn't get mad like you
know what I mean
like it's not that serious man he's like
yo fu Joe like Sam come on bro like why
are you getting pissed off like you
still have another chance this could be
your cinderella story right now bro like
straight up this could be your
cinderella story where you come in and
you basically come in and like you blow
everybody out the freaking water and
just like straight up come back with a
vengeance but here's my design here's my
work here's everything I did I'm better
than everybody you know what I mean like
like that's on you man I can't babysit
you man I can't hold your hand like what
is he so mad right now
somebody explain I'm still waiting for
somebody to explain it to me
why is he so pissed off you get what I'm
saying I he's just like mad for no
reason what bro Sam you know you looking
like a crazy person right now man why
are you getting pissed off just tell us
why you mad why is it that you man
maybe he thinks that I did it
specifically because that's what his
comment said before he said that I
specifically picked them to pick on
somebody I'm like nah that's the the
same countdown that's gonna be for
everybody that's gonna get cut on the on
the show you're not gonna be the only
one you're not special Sam for me to
spend time you know finding the Street
Fighter movie and you know the street
fighter video putting your photo there
you're not that special Sam like that's
everybody's gonna have the same thing
and you wanna see nobody's gonna be
crying I think he's just trolling I
think he's just really I think no I just
wanna you know I think he's just
trolling right now I don't even know if
that's really Sam I can't I can't think
that I can't believe that's him I don't
think so I think he's just trolling
right now well Sam you know have a good
one take care right if that was Sam I
don't even remember if that's really sad
but I think it is I just don't know let
me see Amy C Fargo search through here
does it come up yeah think I was him
I can try see this thing I think that
was him
but unfortunately for him man I don't
know man I try to help people out you
see like you do something good for
people and even when you do something
good for people like they still they
still don't appreciate ya Philippe don't
worry about him he's already blocked you
know he'll be a yeah probably he is
drunk yeah I was something I don't know
there's something a little wrong you
know what I mean yeah it's too bad that
he acted like that right like that's
done you know for him to be out here
like that man all we did was try to help
one try to motivate him to do some
working it's like you know that well you
came up with excuses and then you didn't
show up and then that's it that's what
happens when you know what I'm saying
like things happens kid and then now
he's gonna become part of the the group
of people that come in and give dislikes
to the video you know what I mean
because we can't see him right they
can't come in here and talk to us no
more cuz once your block to your block
we can no longer see that person you
know so now you'll become like one of
those ghosts those people that we just
we know they watch our show we know
they're there they watch every single
episode that I come up with but they no
longer are part of the community they
were blocked
and now he's he's editing or his
comments like come on Sam like I'll give
you a like before you get blocked I'll
give you a like man see like even
skeleton was like yeah what the hell are
you are you talking about face FinTech
is like y'all I'm genuinely interested
in what you have to say unfortunately I
have no idea what you wrote I'm like I'm
lost too he's trying to say man it's no
heart yeah we're really who gets mad
like that's like you know what I mean
like let's search for his thing so we
could run Bella search when did he leave
her comment you know right here let's
give him his last his last thing you
know we're gonna yeah hide this users
comments from this channel and there you
go I see goodbye we will no longer see
Mandela on this channel
that's crazy no man
wired he straight trippin yeah that was
him damn crazy right
he can't please everybody man I think
ak-47 I gotta think that dude was drunk
it could be could be he was drunk man
yeah I mean III don't know you know it's
like it's like you have a job to do you
signed up for it and then at the end you
decide to say hey I'm not the one I'm
wrong you're wrong because there should
be no deadlines like wait what guys I
think we hanged out long enough but yeah
man we've been here for a year man yep
on trial you better be watching my PHP
course man you better be
my PHP course man for sure man Salas was
the PHP project will be I don't know yet
I'll be honest with you I don't know
what's gonna be the project I'm going to
be adding I think I might just add react
you know create something with reacting
and do it like that you know and have
something with my sequel for sure but I
want to bring in like the full stack of
it so have something in the front-end
have something for the backend how to
deal with it with PHP and yeah so that's
probably got gonna be what we're gonna
do but I don't know exactly it
specifically was gonna be the the
project about you know what I mean I
gotta see what I want to do for this I
don't know or maybe if you guys give me
an idea what will be like a good project
for PHP that you guys would like to see
you
you
or
a facebook loan with PHP in the backend
that's so big that's the thing those
projects take too long man it has to be
like a more realistic project you know
what I mean I can't go and create
recreate on you know freakin recreate
Facebook project like that's a lot you
know it's gonna be a lot of work and
it's gonna be taking forever and like
even right now it's gonna be the same
problem that's happening with the nodejs
course right I created the nodejs course
but the project that I'm building the
portfolio is such a big system and like
so many hours that in reality I
personally wish I would have built a
smaller project because it wouldn't have
taken this long but you know a lot of
people get a lot out of it before you
know because it's like for the amount of
money that you're paying for it you're
getting a lot of content now for PHP I
want to create like you know pound or
smaller like microservices something
maybe like that recreate your air Airbnb
that's not bad
or like the idea recreate Airbnb I
Philippe when I were you not you're not
freaking going against me you actually
give me some good ideas man so yeah I
think maybe that could be cool man I
recreate Airbnb with PHP that's not bad
oh god yeah yeah yeah you guys are
seeing this cop yo you know what's funny
there goes there it goes we got Sam and
we got Sam over here creating new
accounts so come over here and talk BS
oh man you know this is how you know
something I don't know what happened I
don't know if the countdown was like
something that hit him in his
insecurities or something like what
happened Sam like what was it that got
you so mad like it's okay bro you're not
supposed to win everything in life man
[Laughter]
like that's sad
you know every like you're like you got
banged already and then you're like I'm
gonna create new accounts because I have
to I have to come over here creating
stuff right like come on Sam Oh God
word man link come on man yeah it's kind
of sad oh god you're gonna have to be
creating accounts and accounts and
accounts you know what I mean so go
ahead you know we're just gonna block
you - Sam is gonna be creating a whole
bunch of accounts man it's kind of sad
right
a word you know if can't I'm bout to put
cam as as the mascot like camp nut cam
Oh Sam sorry cam bringing you up but yes
I'm like seriously man I think you you
really don't want to get on my bad side
like I just feel sorry for you bro like
I feel like really you know I just
really feel bad for him like he's
creating accounts leaving comments and
he's leaving this and that now he's
creating other accounts so coming here
and talk BS like bro like you signed up
for it you didn't show up you came up
with the most craziest idea like he's
been trying to get get what developer
starter kit like the whole week couldn't
even get that done and I'm trying to
help to do it and then telling me that
he has half of the project tongs on cold
pan and the other half on on his
computer like wait what does that make
sense to you guys like you know what I
mean you know what I mean like we didn't
even freaking like we could have went
hard like if we would have had something
against him but that's like the
countdown that we gonna have for
everybody why is he upset like he was
expecting to waste my time waste your
time and then basically messing it up
for everybody else who wanted to be part
of the show you know what I mean like
you messed it up for everybody man cuz
there was supposed to be five people it
wasn't supposed to be four people
so you actually messed it up so now I
have to add an extra spin to the show to
bring in more people because you know
having two people at the final table at
the end doesn't make sense
you know what I mean like yeah you know
it's like I think he should just let it
go get something else to do before I
make him my mascot you know what I mean
like if he gets me in a bad mood like
you guys know me yeah yeah see how I get
when I get in a bad mood but if he wants
to get me in a bad mood like I'll put
him on blast on every single video and
for the rest of his life he'll be known
as you know that's the guy that got
pissed off because he didn't show up you
know what I mean like like that's what
I'm saying like now don't worry the
devil is the plumbing like he doesn't
have a bunny
you know these things are like excuses
for excuses and excuses everybody else
did their work and everybody did a good
job everyone who came in and they what
they didn't needed to do but it's like
why is this dude getting so pissed off
you know what I mean
yes
zing pranks all of that is going to be
in there I just literally finish doing
classes during objects doing our public
public a private protected I did those
videos I still got to interface
I got a do abstract what else I'm
missing for object-oriented programming
with PHP oh and then I think that's
about it then after that we should be
good word man don't burn my blood man
yeah get that boy some milk man where he
wasn't ready like this done my foot you
see now we like making fun of it because
he made it his choice you know what I
mean like now we gotta make fun of it
like there's like one of those moments
like where were you were when Sam freaky
started complaining you know what I mean
like this is one of those moments like
we've had a lot of good moments we had
you know the freaking the south to a
gynecologist we had Sam we had Sam
freaking complaining for not showing up
we had Barbara I'm only 19 what else we
got Casey we passing Casey around like a
cup a cup of coffee what else we got we
got like a lot of stuff man a lot of
good moments man you get what I'm saying
