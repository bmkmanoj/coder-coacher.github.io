like the dashboard the dashboard is a
simple course it's more like a project
it's not really a course it's more like
a project and it's pretty legit you know
sometimes I feel like people just need
to to have certain projects to practice
you know because you could be a
developer out here and trying to become
one but if you don't know the right
projects is like well you don't have
something that motivates you then it's
not working
okay so I'm putting all the screws and
all the tables
another tables the legs of the TV inside

that you know they buy a lot of TVs I
like a lot of anything that's technology
okay I like half I like having the
latest thing yeah I like to have the
latest things every year I usually buy
wall TV and then what I do is I sell my
older one I though I'm Craigslist or
Ebay but I always have to lay the state
no matter what even if I was broke for
some reason I have to have the latest
things no matter what I'm one of those
people even though I don't need it it's
like right now I'm thinking about giving
myself a higher calling a projector and
I don't need a projector what I'm get it
no matter what

spot is looking nice right now let's
just say the the studio that I'm

whole bunch of stuff coming in I got a
nice backdrop you know the quality is
you already know the quality is there
for my camera my camera is AJ I got all
$2,000 lens on it like its legit only
thing I make I'm actually missing
it's like microphones so currently I'm
using a small microphone that comes with
that comes with I think it's the rode
rode mic but I need to get something
else something more professional because
I really want to give you guys like
top-of-the-line like there's no other
youtuber developer that's out here doing
this like what I'm doing the quality
that I'm about to give you guys we about
to be like yo it's gonna be crazy it's
gonna be freaking crazy man like I don't
even know how I did it
what I did it
I definitely do not want to lose this
fuse anything
I'm gonna put this thing inside of
another back jar you sick of coding now
I love coding I can't wait to get home
to start coding but I do love showing
people how to code and showing things
that I already learned you know what I
mean tell my girl left off cereal here
she left everything all right
okay kids see what else ya gotta bring
the cutting board yeah I'm not gonna
forget the ghetto Kurt ghetto current is
coming with us even if the ghetto Karen
doesn't show up on the show anymore the
ghetto Karen is coming with us
you don't know J is still asking about
far from sick of development now man I
love development like why wouldn't I
I love it like you think coming to here
to you to talk about code every single
day talk about web development every
single day do you think I will be doing
this for what if I didn't love it I will
be bored I will hate it if I don't I
actually love like you know how you have
a passion for something but you don't
really hang out with nobody that does
that like that's how I feel about
clothes so it's like I'm hanging out
with my friends you know what I mean is
like it feels good oh sure really you
too got some new stuff YouTube YouTube
thinks that you they Instagram now with
filters now that then they they they
Instagram with filters right now look at
this your boy out here looking like it's
1930s yeah man it's crazy see what else
they got got the dreamy psychedelic just
dis on drugs learn how to code learn how
to code you just dis on strums learn how
to code learn how to code you just did
somebody
guys man a word you know really YouTube
thinks that that they Instagram now look
at this dance party dance party oh man
put this thing normal man they need to
stop it this is what I'm saying like
freaking you come up with an idea right
this one of them let's talk about coal
let's talk about technology right now me
sometimes you come up with an idea and
it really sucks that people come in take
your idea and then remix it and then
release it to the world as if it's
theirs like Instagram came out with the
filters and everybody came out with the
filters snapchat came out with stories
Facebook came in starting adding stories
to their freaking that like you know how
annoying us that gotta be so annoying
like you come up with a great idea and
then the next company comes in and steal
it for you been talking about your
looking with the right then mean of the
mean about tracking people for the
demeanor my sunny day yeah man I want to
go home and our wife in the crib right
now I got the baby in the crib right now
let's sing out cuz I I need help so my
mom's gonna help me out soon some other
TV
yes annoying nothing I think they can do
you know they can do what they want to
do but if like let's say I come up with
a an idea people shouldn't be able to
come in and create the same thing that I
created this is the same thing as video
games you know how when they the guy
came out with a flappy bird and a
million copies of flappy bird I'll be
like twitchy bird or or freakin flappy
magic carp like people started coming in
out of nowhere and just copying the same
game I'm gonna go there should be like a
law against that like you can't blame Li
copy somebody's work like that's really
a turn-off man what up Joe let me buy
your bitcoins fam I sold all my bitcoins
my bitcoins is gone man I got out of
that world man I'm not in the mood to be
losing money like that
and what part of your courses can we
start applying for jobs
I think after you learn sass and the
basics look after you go through SAS
which means you went through CSS HTML
you did a couple of side projects right
and you know future proof JavaScript
well you took the future proof
JavaScript which is all the basics of
JavaScript then from there you're ready
to start applying for jobs
Gaming gavels is like you know I'm
learning Python on coke Adam ey are your
thoughts on that
it's great if you want to learn Python
like I think Python and Ruby are both
two great languages if you want to learn
how to program right if you are here
just learning to learn and you just like
you have no no course you know no right
path off to get a job or to make some
type of money then you're wasting your
time you know what I'm saying like
that's how I look at it like I don't
learn stuff to learn it you know not
anymore
this time so I've done it in the past
like a reality learning crystal Lang is
something to learn just to learn it
because there's no jobs in it but it's
like an investment for the future
because if it pops off I'm gonna be your
expert by the Thomas it's like release
tool version 1.0 so whoever is gonna
hire me is gonna have to pay top dollars
cuz I've been doing it for years now
you're gonna say but if you want a
little python go ahead man
it's the Ruby course finish yes
now there's gotta be an extension to the
Ruby course because the Ruby course is
just all the basics basically you learn
in the language you learn how to use the
language you'll be learning how to code
with the language now what's the next
step is working with frameworks so that
I'm gonna put it in a separate course
which is what I'm gonna be doing the
next 2-3 days which is Ruby on Rails
creating an application Ruby on Rails I
don't know I was thinking about making a
real estate website with Ruby on Rails
or making reddit or making a Facebook
clone I don't know yet
you guys tell me what type of web
application will be good for you guys to
to learn you know something that you
guys will really be excited to to learn
about you know
cama cama so good
Big Joe CSS when you apply for jobs on
making LinkedIn it shows the number of
applicants sure you only apply to jobs
with reasonable reasonable number of
applicants a lot of them have you 200
applicants and you might be like
whatever number well you should just
apply no matter what because you don't
understand this this is something that
people don't take into account right you
could be the first person to apply to a
job right but the person who's reading
that email right Mike come in and be
like hey I just started going through my
emails and I saw somebody at the 207
place and then I saw somebody at the 180
place right which means those were the
latest people that that subscribed or
not subscribed with that actually send
them an email with their resume
sometimes people don't want to go
through the whole 200 so if you was the
first one didn't even see your email you
got what I'm saying by the time they get
to like 150 they already got the person
who they wanted to hire so just apply
you know it's like life is like that man
life has a little bit of luck into it
you know what I mean oh you might be
applied to a job that has 3,000 people
but you might be the person that came in
last and because you came in last it
shows you first on their email right you
know how it works with inbox there you
go into your Gmail you go into your your
your frequent websites email and the
latest one is the one that shows on top
the people that signed up or send emails
or resumes whatever date all the way at
the bottom so you know what I mean like
it's all about like a little bit of love
too you know so just apply you took
clone now I don't want to go YouTube
clunkers that's too big it has to be
something reasonable you know I don't
want to create a web
application that's gonna take more than
a week you know
are you working your own personal
project yes I'm working on the coding
phase website right now which is gonna
have a way better timeline system which
is gonna let you guys keep track of that
and be able to say okay I took this
course took this course so you could
check it off and that's what I'm working
on right now gaming gavel says I have
some app ideas that's why I'm learning
Python but what type of I if you know if
you're looking to build some some
application like for the phone make sure
you is Swift that you're building it or
with Java or copy you know what I mean
if you're looking to do web applications
you might as well do it in another
language like Python is Python is good
for what it is it's like an all-purpose
language the main reason why people are
really getting into it is because it's
an all-purpose language like you could
do anything with Python right you could
go in there and make a software
application you come in and create a
website you will come in and create you
know a scientific tool there's so much
things that you can do with Python but
if you are specifically trying to become
a web developer that's not the language
for you or even the framework like
Django is outdated
like even laravel has more cool stuff
and in latest things than Django like
it's really outdated so let me see
yeah I'm saying you make your luck hey
Jay you make your luck right and when I
say you make your luck is if you stay
home and you don't apply for any jobs
ever and you say hey I'm just gonna
leave it to luck Lady Luck is gonna send
me a job all right then
now you're just waiting for for nobody
to do anything for you right cuz it's
just not gonna happen if you stay in
your house and you don't apply to
anywhere but you make your luck by
putting yourself in the right place you
make your luck by sending it to the
right person you make your love by
having the right projects you know what
I mean like you can't just stay in your
house and be like oh listen I'm gonna
become a genius and I'm kind of good you
know I'll get that $250,000 from
Facebook and it's like you don't go to
no meetings you don't go to no freaking
conventions you don't bump elbows with
nobody that's close to Facebook so it's
like you could be a genius in your house
but nobody knows you you know what I'm
saying you're not building applications
that people are using you're not sharing
anything on github so it's like how can
you make your luck you get what I'm
saying
have you checked out cold Steel's
advance what the bump of course yeah I
checked it out I just don't think I
personally I don't like that one because
it's multiple peoples on that course
it's not just cold steel like I like it
one close to yours there I don't want to
hear Johnny the developer from San
Francisco I'm gonna if I'm paying for
cold steel I want to see cold steel you
know that's how I Joe you owe me a udemy
course on the giveaway send me an email
man you know I'll give you a udemy
course
let me see how many good solonius
working with audio
destro masters smack yeah man I couldn't
I couldn't take it man well you know I
was gone for like what a day and a half
or something like that you know me I
can't be gone for that long
plus I mean once I get home taste no
service over there there's no internet
so I went to Connecticut we dropped off
everything that we needed to move and
now I just came back to pick up my TV's
because I don't have no boxes for the TV
so I have to put the TV's on top of now
top but inside of my my car and I have
to do it late separately then everything
else I couldn't move it with the u-haul
and all that stuff cause it would have
broke
SoundCloud course they were started in
rails yeah and I'll be cold soon but
that's the thing
SoundCloud of course will mean I will
have to come in and do some fun and fun
and work and I don't want to do front
end like if I'm teaching Ruby on Rails I
want to focus just on Ruby on Rails
same way for those of you guys I've
taken the PHP course you guys know what
I'm talking about like I didn't do a
little front-end I didn't do anything in
JavaScript everything was done in PHP
specifically so people could actually
come in and and learning you know we see
factor to you some panels works well and
I will put like some blankets around it
like how you call that quilts I'm
putting I got to TV so I'm gonna put the
cheapest one at the bottom you know me I
ain't trying to lose on this $3,000 TV
that I have on my bedroom I'm trying to
lose money on that that's in the memory
that was like I paint so that would if
we get scratches on oh well you know I'm
not gonna cry for it but the other one
I'll freaking you you're gonna see me
cry something happens to it
