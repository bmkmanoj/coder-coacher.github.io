website like this okay is it gonna be
exactly like this design no we're going
to tweak this we're gonna change this
things up we're gonna mix this with
multiple designs multiple ideas that you
know I got from in different
inspirations that I've found ok so what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna create this
website to be a floating application
okay you're probably thinking what the
hell is that that's something that I
just came up with to be honest with you
this is a new design and I think like we
can actually take some risk we want to
have something that's functional but
something that's new and something fresh
something that nobody else has
okay so a lot of different designers
have been coming up with ideas like this
where they design something and show
them as if it was an application right
so we're actually gonna take that idea
and actually create our website to be a
floating application just like this a
grading in the background and then we're
going to build a rounded corner
container that's gonna keep our website
and this is for desktops right now I'm
on a 1080p are you call this a monitor
so we're gonna make it in a way where
it's gonna be like this it's gonna be
like floating around but it's never
touching the edges from any side maybe
later on we'll give the user the option
to click a button like hey fullscreen
and then I'll be fullscreen okay hope
you guys like this idea so to get
started the very first thing that I got
for you guys is I want you guys to go to
hexyl dock CEO pixel died CEO is a
pretty cool website they show different
places where you know you could actually
get inspiration and different fonts and
cool stuff a lot of you guys are not
designers and I'm not here trying to
convert you and make you guys a designer
right I went to school for almost three
years for a bachelor's in design so I
know what I'm talking about okay so what
I want you guys to do is we're gonna
keep it very simple when I click here
this is for gradients and what we're
gonna do we're gonna find the gradient
that we like you guys choose whatever
you guys want
there's a whole bunch of different ones
okay for now I'm gonna choose vanilla
ice okay so I'm gonna do this copy this
okay and I'm gonna search CSS gradient
generator okay go here okay
CSS Matic okay and I'm just gonna paste
this up on top for now so I'm gonna take
this one this first color and I'm gonna
put this here paste it there okay now
let's take this like that walk that out
all right Pulis the other color how long
you got that one and then we have this
one copy that okay hold on I want to
make sure I'm copying the right thing
copy
you
okay that's fine click here paces in and
there you go so those are the colors
that's the gradient that we want okay
now we want this gradient to be coming
from the top this color coming from the
top and then merge into this at the
bottom okay we're gonna come here copy
this and we're gonna go to our locals
holes 3,000 and then now we're gonna go
to our resources folder assets folder
then go to the sass and find your main
that SCSS paste is there save that and
there you go that's our gradient okay
sometimes you see like little things
like this don't worry about that let me
check something
make sure
you
you
you know second all right now the reason
what this is happening is because of the
height so I'm gonna do this I'm gonna
see background Ilan remove this I'm
gonna say height I'm gonna say minimum
height or minimum height sorry
minimum height 100 eh
okay so the minimum height of the body
is going to be 100% of the screen no
matter what okay and that's exactly what
we want okay now from here on I'm going
to come here and I'm gonna say app
container and here I'm gonna say
something like this so we got AB
container I'm gonna say with 80% all
right let's say 90% same 90% when I say
background white okay I'm gonna come to
the Welcome that edge and I'm going to
basically for now
I'm going to delete this or I can leave
that there for now so I could just gonna
say div and then say class and put in
make sure you put in class name so class
name app container
I see
everything is good
Tina classname put in class okay there
you go
so so used to react all right so we got
class the next thing that we want to do
we want to make sure that this is
centered so I'm gonna come here
I'm gonna say like this display sorry
display flex and sort of this we're
gonna say a line items center justify
content center save that and that's
going to Center us right there okay now
we're going to say here height we wanna
say minimum or say minimum height
minimum height we're going to put in
calc which is gonna calculate the height
of it so we're gonna say 100 H minus 10
percent or 10 V H okay so that right
there centers us perfectly now I
actually want this to be a little bit
smaller than that so let's try 20 V H
how does like that look I don't know
trying to see was like the ratio
okay so
let me see
you got to put a max width on this so
instead of this we wants a max width say
thirteen hundred pixels
or a wave
a hundred percent
seems pretty cool now the next thing
that we want to do and I say
border-radius
I say 5 pixels that's gonna create the
little border radius at the corner
okay I think we can make this a little
bit bigger I think we could go to
you like a 15 yeah 15 looks fine that's
perfect okay so it's like we have a
floating application just like this okay
and now the next thing that we're going
to do is we're gonna break down the
whole the whole website okay we're gonna
go section by section building piece
like that Piggy's in the middle and the
messenger section okay so it's gonna be
like this messenger content areas like
from there to there and then we're gonna
have like a Sai section was gonna be
like a menu or something I don't know
yet all right but I'll see you guys in
the next video I hope you guys enjoy
this alright bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
