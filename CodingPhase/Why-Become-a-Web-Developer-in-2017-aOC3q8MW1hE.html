why become a web developer right why
would you want to become a web developer
it's pretty simple it's just cool you
know what I mean like it's pretty cool
and you know you can make a bunch of
money in this thing man
buddy trust me like the average web
developer right now is getting 65,000
right
most people have to go to college and do
a whole bunch of stuff just to make that
much money right now on the top level
the big guys guys doing you know
anything above five years you know seven
years ten years they're looking at
$135,000 man that's a lot of money you
know what I mean
so you can't complain this is something
that you could pretty much make a good
living you know raise a family do
everything that you got to do get
yourself a house get yourself uh
whatever a sports car if you want to be
one of those guys like whatever you want
to do you know what I mean and also it's
a great way you know for you to get an
introduction to programming you know
just in case you wanna you know create
some video games phone applications
software development become a data
scientist whatever you decide to do all
right okay awesome
there's like a million jobs out there
and I'm not lying it takes me about two
to three weeks to find a job so you know
what I mean like there's a whole bunch
of jobs out there like if I was to leave
my job today I couldn't pretty much just
pick up another job in a week or two
from now it's that simple
and you know most jobs nowadays this is
what's gonna happen to them they're
gonna get automated you know so you're
either gonna be the one programming this
systems this programs this machines or
you're gonna be out without a job so
it's up to you what you really want to
do do you want to be the guy
in this or the guy that got replaced by
this so and at the same time it's like
there's no degree required so I mean why
wouldn't you want to do this you know
what I mean like you're making money you
don't have to go to school for this you
go pretty much straight out of high
school all the best developers I've met
have actually just pretty much made you
know straight out of high school is like
they make a lot of money and like you
know if you're time then you put in the
hours into this you're gonna make you
know a pretty good living wage you know
what I mean so you know this is like the
best best career move that anybody could
do right now so it's like it's pretty
simple you know I would advise this to
anybody be like hey what do you want to
do in you know the next 2-3 years
I will tell somebody hey just might as
well just learn how to code you know
start with front-end development and
then from there if you decide to make
video games that decide to make phone
applications jump into something else
you know what I mean
but what development is pretty much the
easiest route to you know learning
programming and that's why you should
learning anyways man by the way just
make sure you subscribe make sure you
sign up make sure you visit a website
