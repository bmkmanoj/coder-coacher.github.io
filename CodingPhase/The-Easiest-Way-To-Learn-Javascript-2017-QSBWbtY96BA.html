at it again man : fish calm listen we
try not new angles new you know
what I mean
all right guys yeah man I'm trying to
get some work as soon as possible but I
want to make a little quick video with
you guys just you know just to talk to
you a little bit
all right so people been asking joke
what's the best way to learn JavaScript
all right and what's the easiest way
well there's really never no easy way to
learn on how to code or learning any
programming language all you gotta know
is just the basic you know basic
features and the basic syntax of of a
programming language especially
JavaScript what you gotta understand I
think which is like super for it that
people don't really realize but it's
like if you don't understand the Dom if
you don't understand how things aren't
placed on a web page
you shouldn't learn JavaScript yeah
until you're very comfortable I feel
before you get to JavaScript because
people with being able to target any
element on a page and be as specific as
much as you can through CSS meaning if
there's a div and Assad died if there's
three divs and then inside those three
days
there's you know three paragraphs inside
of each one then how do you target the
second paragraph inside of that you know
thus each dish how do you target that
right if you don't know how to do that
or if you don't know how to Google if
you don't know how to actually find out
how to target that then it means that
you don't understand that much of the
DOM you know understand how CSS works so
before you jump into CSS JavaScript
sorry we jump into JavaScript learn that
right and then from there the next thing
for you to learn it would be to
understand the basics understand what a
variable is understand what a if and
else statement is understand what a
switch statement is understand what a
loop all right
then from there you're gonna understand
through you know data structures you
know strings integers objects
listen which are raised yeah once you
understand those things then you could
go you know deeper into the programming
language of JavaScript but I'll tell you
that those little points there's really
no need for you to go into deeper things
like you know people want to jump into a
framework right away then I go man
everybody talking about react every job
is hiring about you know angular and
reacting and it's like you don't know
the basics yet so it's like you're
jumping into something that you have no
idea what it is about you have no idea
what's going on behind the hood and one
thing you gotta understand this
frameworks they all bring a whole bunch
of new problems that the only way that
you're going to be able to solve them is
if you know the basics if you understand
you know the basics of data structures
the basics of object you know and at
least the basics of object-oriented
programming nowadays especially what he
is saying so if you don't understand the
basics of what JavaScript you should not
jump into a framework now something like
jQuery is different jQuery might be the
best option for somebody who doesn't
know JavaScript meaning if you don't
know JavaScript and you're not that
great you know manipulating the Dom then
I would say hey go ahead use jQuery
jQuery is going to make you productive
straight of the gecko you know what I
mean so
I will say yeah jQuery jQuery is going
to make your life easier as you learn
more jobs but don't think that it does
because you're using jQuery I think you
know JavaScript because it's no you know
it's just it takes time it's like a
numbers game this game no matter what
you do there's no cheat codes there's no
course that could say hey I'm going to
teach you Java Script in 30 minutes no
chances or philosophizing
very - whatever Eric banana whatever
heat his channel at the collegiate I
like it because I use it as a breakfast
I like to go to the channel check out
stuff like you know type script or other
programming languages that he has made a
tutorial and very good but just because
it's at a you're going to learn this in
one hour that's not true what he should
mean is learn the syntax or see the
syntax of JavaScript in one hour see the
syntax of type script in one hour
the syntax of Python
because there's no way that you're going
to learn Python or JavaScript or any
other programming language in one hour
it's impossible there is a numbers game
you just have to put in the hours it's
going to take you a long time to learn
order the state so if you want to learn
this right away and you say ok man right
now to the point where I want to quit my
job I want to get the hell out of here
and well the best thing for you to do is
say hey I'm going to study so I get home
my farm o'clock I'm going to study from
five o'clock to ten o'clock so I can
learn all of this stuff in one month or
two months you know so if you do that
and you're dedicated you're going to be
able to learn it right away but if
you're thinking oh yeah I'm going to
learn this on my part time whenever
half-time whatever I get to stay home
whenever I don't want to hang out with
my friends are you thinking like that
then it's going to take your little time
to learn
you know so is all about numbers about
the hours that you put we know as I hope
they say with it once you put in your
10,000 hours to know everything you know
so that's just holidays he's got to put
in that work not be lazy
nothing like oh I got there's got to be
a video out there that I break it down
for me I'm going to learn it right away
it's going to be better instructor than
nothing but it's not going to be a video
that's going to skip those you know 100
plus hours that you need to learn a
programming language nobody better
chemistry
yeah so for you guys to ask me all the
time what's the easiest way to learn
JavaScript low level education learn the
basics you know you can go through stuff
like you know coke Adam II just to learn
basic syntax right
and then or even here on my own time
we'll have a JavaScript tutorials there
that teaches you all the basics right so
you could do that or you can go directly
to one of the courses that I have you
know of course they're more full feature
meaning like they've got to teach you
everything that I teach is from creating
a page to building interactive menus
interactive sliders all that stuff
you're gonna learn it even the backend
especially if you learn all is it post
deals or what developer bootcamp so it's
up to you right it's up to you though
the way that you want to take
they already know simple joke okay I do
this okay
your boy I got make sure you subscribe
make sure you like this video man make
sure you share it to other people just
keep it simple guys just put in those
hours and like I always say man if you
want to learn what tutorials what voices
taught me how to become a web developer
is very simple
it's a wide description you will see
motor courses there that I took of
course I've taken plenty of other
courses but this other courses that I
know that if you take it they got a
teacher everything
all right guys I'll see you this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
