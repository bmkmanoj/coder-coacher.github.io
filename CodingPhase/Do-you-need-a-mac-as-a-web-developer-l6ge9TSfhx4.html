back at it again man : face calm listen
God your boy is back alright so if you
bring ask me hey Cho do I need a MacBook
glenda MacBook Pro 20 that I met when
the Mac Mini to actually do development
and I'll say no you don't need a MacBook
Pro for this or any type of Mac system
and any operating system Mac but what I
will say is one thing most of the
community as far as the open-source
community everybody uses magnets right
especially my patrols and you know IMAX
and at home they might have a Mac
problem whatever it is right but almost
everybody uses Mac OS not right now you
go to different companies they might be
using c-sharp they might be using Java a
lot of those companies they use
something that's called Windows which is
pretty much the worst operating system
that out there but real developers and
not not to go succeed on you guys are
using Windows but the real developers in
the community the guys that aren't doing
amazing thing for you guys I think that
when I told you yet that bring you our
react read us everybody uses Mac so
stream Mac OSX right now some people
might be like oh man why do I have to
use on that when it's so super expensive
as like man you could buy a Mac use and
you're good you can start doing what
tonight right away you don't have to go
explain $3,000
you know but it feels good you go to the
Apple store you know look at that right
there let me at that MacBook let me get
that like you feel good there's a good
feeling about it you're like okay I
earned it you know what I mean it's not
the same thing that's going to Best Buy
in the city back section where they have
a whole bunch of Windows PC and soon as
they come in to give you a Windows PC
they gotta dust it off because nobody
wanted it man that's a big difference
done but but reality guys you don't need
come back to actually become what the
brain don't expect them to come and eat
meaning like hey you want to work on
Ruby hey you got a dual workaround so
using Windows you want to do something
like no GS there's an intra cutable file
but it's not even as good as what you
will get in Mac or you wanted to use
something like crystal a man on Windows
is not working as good as it would on a
man when that happens all the time since
I mean sense of the gimmicks time guys
literally is there like this PC have
been for the home computer you know
that's the first computer you get when
you're a little kid and your mom is like
what do you want to get a kid you want a
computer here's a computer that's what
you get with you a little kid right as
you grow in your career and you become
more professional and you have a little
money in your pocket or invest into a
Mac man like your life is going to be so
much easier it's so much better it's
built for professionals by professionals
this is a big difference if you're just
going to use the internet for what it is
just for internet browsing ending this
watching videos on YouTube fine you're
going to do great with it just a regular
PC but you know you got a tip you have
to basically man
you know happy was Steve Jobs did you
know he always thought about making a
computers for professors you know
there's a reason why so so many
professionals developers actually use it
you know I'll be honest it's very rare
to find developers that are really good
in the open-source community using a
Windows computer so when you go to a
give a project when you go to UM
anything that's brand new like what I
happen to be through enterprise and all
that right you're always going to
find the easy route is just paper
install it to Mac you know it's just so
much easier like when you have Mac just
give you our community and you can hit
the ground running man that's a blessing
easy - you already knows your boy Joe
back at it again man listen make sure
you subscribe and make sure you like
this video man by the way if you want to
know exactly what courses I took to
become a web developer they right there
in the description it's no secret it's
nothing crazy is no secret gift that I
had is just pretty much I took the
courses they're pretty cheap that I
could see dollars each on specials and
just listen man change your life change
your lifestyle do something fun -
something cool that you could call a
career</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
