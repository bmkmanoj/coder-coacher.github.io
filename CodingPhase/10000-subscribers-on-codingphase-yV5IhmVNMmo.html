wasn't really going hard you know what I
mean I mean none of this stuff we're
here at that time you know the little
baby wasn't here you know he's part of
the journey man and this is pretty crazy
man like when you think about it 10,000
subscribers you know it was amazing
about it is this 10,000 subscribers
without paying Facebook groups 10,000
subscribers without taking anybody
else's content 10,000 subscribers
without getting a stimulus package from
other big-time youtubers yeah it's like
what I think about it was like yeah I
pretty much did this by myself right you
know I don't have no no big account from
other web sites I don't have nothing I
pretty much came from the bottom I
always do this I always keep saying this
man you come from the bottom you just
work hard and just keep going all right
you know other people try to downplay it
like oh 10,000 subscribers that's like
nothing but 10,000 loyal subscribers
that you don't have you know what I mean
like that's a challah cutting I'm like
yo a lot of people might try to downplay
it it's only ten thousand like it was
only ten thousand it's ten thousand
lawyer subscribers that you don't have
you know I mean so that's how I look at
it I'm like yo we chillin we enjoying
life man somehow with less than ten
