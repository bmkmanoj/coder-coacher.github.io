guys we in here we live coding face.com
your boys backing out and did it again
alright now with a real topic right now
we could talk about cold guys let's get
it poppin let's get it poppin out here
and let's talk about the future of
coding phase calm as you guys may know
November marks the one year anniversary
of coding phase comm I think we've done
a lot of great things as being a very
positive year and there's been a you
know a little rocky year I learned a lot
you know over this past year but you
know it's all part of of you know
growing as a channel and you know the
things that come with it you know you
can't you can't do anything about this
stuff you know but yeah man right now I
want to show you guys the website that I
I started coding and giving you guys a
little view behind the scenes of how a
website made with crystal lang is
basically going to be our new website
for coding phase comm you know there's a
lot of cool stuff that I'm doing out
here man there's a lot of cool stuff
that I'm I'm bringing to the table and
one of the things that I love that you
guys love and every one of us loves is
the fact that we we love the live chat
room right we love the live chat room we
love being able to come in here at any
moment
whenever I do a freaking you know high
cornice whenever we talk about code or
anything or we do like a live stream
it's great to have everybody here you
know what I mean like I love it I love
the fact that I can just come in and I
know that a lot of you guys is gonna
show up so I really appreciate it
but yeah man that's what we're gonna be
talking about in this video I hope you
guys
you know you know that means like
there's definitely a lot of cool stuff
man now going back to the other kid I'm
not gonna talk about him no more that we
gave him a video that's why we started a
new livestream so that one got saved and
then he could watch and replay and in
you know feel better about himself like
hey we talked to buy him great now it's
all about coding fees.com your boy is
backing out and did it again
man like I feel like a weight off my
shoulder like you know what I mean like
just like you know like this is the
thing about this channel and and what's
special about it is that when I come in
here and I have a great day I come in
and you guys know I'm having a great
thing when I had come in and I'm having
a bad day
yeah I know I having a bad day when I
come in and a livestream Ramsay just
live streaming the ball a live stream in
the car
live streaming a bad live straight until
you dick yeah like you know what I mean
like this is a special channel like
people coming here and you guys know me
like personally like you already know
who I am yeah I know how I am
what type of person I am so it's like
I'm glad that you know you guys are
definitely good supporters I really
enjoyed everything that we've done over
this past year I'm so happy that you
know I made a dream come true of me
being able to get to a certain point
because this is one of the things I had
two goals right when I first started
doing this whole thing of like coding
and all the stuff I said you know what
my first goal was to get $50,000 all
right my first goal was to get $50,000 I
was like man if I start earning $50,000
I'm good
we passed that then I had a goal it's
like man if I make $100,000 I'm gonna be
good I passed that right in there from
there my goals were like hey man I want
to teach it to people now I don't know
if that's gonna be you know it's gonna
be able to be
Lucas I will have to go to school for
like a master's degree and I don't want
to go back to school I'll be honest so I
don't see myself teaching like in a
classroom setting web development or
programming in general I like to college
students and stuff like that maybe to
some high schools but I'm not seeing
myself going back to school to get a
master's degree for a stupid you know
just to get that job but what's the best
thing out of this you know it's the fact
that now I got into a level where I
could come in and everything that I
learned I teach you to other people and
just pass down the knowledge and then
the people that learn from here they
pass it on to the next person and that's
it like that's the best part you know
what I mean so that's why I've been
doing this whole past few months doing
this and you know now I'm stepping my
game up because when you go to coding
phase calm before I had a community they
had a website where you could register
and sign up and you know you could come
in and add links and stuff like that and
then I said you know what I don't want
to do this cuz a lot of people don't
really want to do this because they
already have that type of thing they
already have ready they already have
Twitter that they could do that on so
say you know what I'm just gonna make my
website code offense calm redirect to my
courses but at the same time it's like
it's it's all about the courses on when
you go to code F is calm and I don't
want it to be just about the courses I
wanted to be like a community where
people go in there be able to chat will
be able to you know just chill you know
maybe have like a uh a forum maybe have
like stuff like that so that's why I
want to do now all right so one thing
that I have here that I wanted to show
you guys is actually the site I started
building it like yesterday or the other
night those of you who were here
in the nighttime yeah yeah I know I was
working on this you know just in case
somebody says I didn't code this there's
a live stream out there when I started
coding this so all right yeah so this
the website you know currently the
content is not there yet but I haven't
made this life so it's gonna be the
community has spoken coding faces every
developers favorite community more than
10,000 students worldwide which is also
true
we definitely I'm gonna have here like
order the courses and you know the
languages that I have for the website
JavaScript HTML CSS PHP crystal nodejs
I'm gonna do some icy cool stuff but
just in this section I want to have like
all the languages that are that I have
courses for all right I was thinking
about putting like the the frameworks
but I'm not gonna do it here I'm gonna
put like testimonials if any of you guys
have actually signed up to the website
or you know you see my tutorials here
and you to me or you see my tutorials
over here on YouTube and you've gotten
something out of it and you've you felt
like hey I want to give my testimony or
like you know share it to the world send
me an email to coding phase at gmail.com
I'll put you here I got a five of it's
the first five people that sent it to me
I'll put it and like you're always gonna
be there you know what I mean so that's
gonna be cool I'm thinking about
creating a section like a review section
so people could come in and just give
their honest opinion on on the courses
you know so they could just you know no
censorship if you're gonna hate this
 sucks there's this wack or whatever
it's all gonna stay there you know me I
don't like to censor anything so yeah
we're gonna do that there's gonna be
like a testimonial area there's gonna be
like a monthly yearly distil
lifetime and like always I always tell
you guys you know uh these numbers that
you see here those are for the people
that find me from other places you know
for Facebook from other advertising
companies that I'm about to start using
because I'm paying for every time that
somebody comes in in like register I'm
paying in reality to like through
advertising is gonna be like six dollars
per person right so if they paying if
I'm gonna come in and pay for them to
find me then pretty much it's gonna cost
this the prices right now of course I'm
always gonna have on my description on
my youtube channel my fifty percent off
of everything automatically it's always
gonna be fifty percent so this is in
reality this is ten dollars there's 75
dollars there's 150 you know but you get
a lot for for you know for the amount of
money that you're spending you get a lot
you know what I mean and you always get
50% off automatically when you come from
YouTube like everybody knows that now
yeah so we're gonna have the courses
section was gonna is gonna link to to
the code to the courses website right
we're gonna have gear which is gonna be
the coding face hats I got a couple of
t-shirts down working on like real
designs we're not doing like oh just the
logo like who the hell wants to walk
around with a logo you know I was like
it's like you you branding yourself with
somebody else's logo that's corny so
what I'm doing is it's just real real
high cool is like real designs that you
guys can relate to like the sauce you
know the self talk I know the I'm only
19 I got this this uh there's this this
t-shirt idea that I have of a girl named
Barbara for Barbara right so
with a mask on so she takes off her mask
and then it's like some Nigerian
Nigerian a scammer is like I'm only 19
you know what I mean so that's gonna be
like a funny funny t-shirt but it's
gonna be good my friend who's a designer
who's very good artist he's gonna draw
all the illustrations for it so we're
gonna have gear there we're gonna have
the resources page which is the one that
I've been having from the beginning like
where I put in all the best courses that
I found online or our websites that I
think that people should check out I'm
also gonna have a chat room area where
we're gonna have live chat so at any
moment you could just log in you could
just come to to your website and be like
hey let me go to the chat so you don't
have to register you don't have to do
anything you just putting a nickname
that you want and your email and then
you going down the chatroom and that's
saying you be set you know what I mean
so it's gonna be I'm taking it more
professional now I want to do this more
professional I feel like this year was
me finding myself on YouTube
understanding how YouTube works seeing a
lot of stuff here you know I mean but
those are the things that I'm working on
you got what I'm saying and right now
currently if you look at the description
of this video there's a link there that
will take you to the courses if you want
to sign up if you haven't signed up and
you want to try it out for seven bucks
literally 65% off on everything so if
you want to just to try it out for one
month it's seven dollars right now like
that's the cheapest thing that you're
gonna find out there this is for cyber
monday is called 65 cyber monday that's
the that's the code a lot of people are
signing up a lot of people are finding
out about this and sharing it to other
people so you know and it was cool about
it it's like it's not only just that one
month I okay seven dollars this month
and $20 by next

you get what I'm saying like same thing
there's a lot of people are signed up
for the fight out of special right they

they came in until this day they still
pay for us you know what I'm saying like
there's people who just you know they
they got everything that they needed you
know so take advantage definitely check
it out if you haven't tried to just give
it a chance
trust me we got a lot of cool stuff
working on right now you know what I
mean so yeah man can you log in a mobile
yes everything's gonna be you know it's
gonna be responsive it's gonna be great
all right so let me answer some
questions man let me answer some
questions let me answer some questions
all right yeah now now the new website
is made with crystal Lang crystal which
is very similar to to Ruby and it's
pretty legit man like now is is very
mature the language is very mature this
this new framework called
amber which is one of the reasons why I
stopped doing the rocky the rocky stack
because there's just people who are just
working on that like let's say if I
didn't have a youtube but I have a
website and I just work directly on the
on the rocky stack then my framework
will be super legit by now but I do do a
lot of stuff like I do work on a whole
bunch of stuff you know so I don't have
the time but these guys start working on
the amber amber framework guys man they
they killed him Andy is legit it's
really really be Jade so I'm excited
about that I'm super excited about that
it's like it's the same that was Ruby on
Rails same levels as laravel same level
as as camo so it's like it's really up
there like very
professional a lot of the guys that are
working on it is I guess open source so
you know what they're you know I mean I
want to be one of those websites that
were first built with crystal Lang C
spent in this 2018 it's like everybody's
gonna be talking about crystal lang
it's in the beginning of 2017 like
crystal Lang is is pretty legit and then
now everybody's gonna be talking about
it I reminder I was one of the first
ones nobody else out here was talking
about it period and it was a subscriber
who actually sent me the information say
hey man have you checked crystal Lang so
it's pretty legit now let me answer some
questions man so Robert Jones says hey
Joe what's your opinion on Django and
Python frameworks for web but they're
good I mean they go for what it for what
they are
you know beside hey Python is my
favorite language that's you decide that
that's your favorite language right
people do this all the time like to me
ruby is my favorite language so I always
gravitate to Ruby for everything but for
people that just they love Python you
know I mean like python is a all-purpose
language like you could do software you
could do games you could do a whole
bunch of stuff so people gravitate to
Python
similarly myself I don't think
developers or new developers that are
out there or Django is a good choice
because there's barely any jobs for it
you get what I'm saying like it's
already hard for you as a self-taught
developer to get that first job it's
hard for people to trust you when let's
say you coming from another industry
like let's say you all your jobs are
retail how are people gonna trust you to
actually jump into programming and then
they're gonna give you know the keys to
a freakin a Ferrari that's how it is
when they give you the keys to a website
is like you know this website
generates money and it maintains
everybody's paycheck you know so for a
company to come in and say hey we're
gonna trust you with our website you're
gonna work for us it's like we're
trusting you with everybody's money here
you know so it's hard for people to
trust any developers so Django and
Python they're cool but you know they're
like very similar to Ruby on Rails but
it's not Ruby on Rails you know it's not
up to that point plus just like a lot of
stuff that I don't like about Ruby not
Ruby about Python like this video find
it it's a very important video that I
think everybody who's looking into
getting into Python they should look
into it
so movie on freaked okay all right so
there's a video from confreaks the the
channel and this this girl cool
listening lauren Ellsworth right she
goes into all the things that you lose
when you use something like Python
especially for when you're coming from
Ruby are you coming from other languages
there's a lot of things that you lose by
using Python and another thing too that
people talk about all Python is ruby is
slow and this and that
Python slow tune like they're both slow
so it's not really about Oh which one's
faster it's like they both are slow so
no matter what it's like it's almost
next to neck but me personally I don't
think for brand new developers focusing
on on Ruby on focusing on Python is the
best choice at all
I don't think so especially when you
want to get that first job you want to
find something that is gonna get you a
job right away not just something that
you like because we all like something
like you know what I mean like we all
like something here some of you guys
might be like hey I love C++ hey I love
c-sharp hey I love dotnet but it's like
are you gonna get hired for those jobs
you know what I'm saying like that's a
big difference like you can go and
create those projects on your own it's
like let's say Chris hogs all right
Chris hooks loves he loves Python right
and he has a lot of courses in Python
but he's never worked from minus 10 he's
never worked at a company as a Python
developer you got I'm saying so if he
was like somebody frustrated with that
be like oh I don't want to work in
anything else besides Python who knows
if we would have had a job by now you
got what I'm saying so it's like
sometimes it's not just what you like
it's what you need that you need to
focus on like if you you know for him
I'm pretty sure he works a lot with Java
scripting and dotnet so those are the
things that he focuses on because he
needs to get a job he needs to work you
know I'm in people I feel like there's a
big trend right now with everybody
talking about Python and Python this
right than that but it's like most of
the stuff is from machine learning it's
not for web development like that I know
of
most companies is not using Python for
what development and that's one of the
problems that I had with was a Udacity
Udacity is like trying to pro promote
people to learn to do back in with
Python but then at the same time it's
like nobody's hiring for Python
developers ought to be going back in
they just not let me say oh what else
let me see any more questions let me
know yeah if you want to be part of you
know the testimonials and you've
actually used my website and you've
gotten a lot out of it semia email
coding phase at gmail.com I will add you
two to the front page that's one of the
testimonials no the people who signed up
to the old site it's not gonna be I'm
not bringing back that same database you
got what I was saying cuz I'm gonna do
this I don't know if I might do this
where's my Seco or MongoDB so I don't
know the other one was in I believe was
Postgres and I don't want to be dealing
with Postgres no more so I don't know if
I'm bringing those people that signed up
from before now the other website which
is gonna be kind of I'm not gonna have a
signup section the only sign up section
is going to be for the courses and for
the videos like that's where our user
authentication is going to be and it's
gonna be provided through teachable calm
but the website itself it's not gonna
have like a registration it's like
whoever wants to come into the chatroom
they could come into the chatroom and
talk anytime so we don't have to be only
chatting with each other when we do live
stream I want to be able to chat with
you guys 24/7 all day long and I feel
like this Court is cool
what discord I don't know if I can
connect to discord the servers then I'm
gonna continue with the discord the
discord is gonna be like a separate
group discord is gonna be like a group
for us when we go in there you know it's
run by Matt and Barbara but at the same
time I still want to give people the
option to just be able to chat without
having to register because a lot of
people tell me hey I just don't want to
download an app I don't want to do this
this and that
and I understand them because you know
people already have Instagram Facebook
Messenger whatsapp they have like 30,000
30,000 different message things and it's
like downloading another one it's like
it's annoying so this is gonna be
directly on the website no js' course I
got like two more chapters to do
I just gotta upload them but it's
already done I finished the last night
let me see
well you ever try this is a good
question Joe will you ever try for the
big four Facebook Microsoft Google Apple
and we could add another word Amazon um
I don't know I don't think so
I don't have that drive I don't have
that drive to be like oh man
I want to work at this companies you
know I just don't have that drive there
was a good post that I saw on Quora and
I see
Quorra declined
ultra there's this guy
man yeah that's like a there's a couple
of people there's a lot of people that
have to decline to work for for Google
you know sometimes we think like those
are like our biggest like you know our
biggest things like our biggest goals
and be like oh man my biggest goal is to
work at Google or work at at Facebook or
Amazon or whatever you fill in the blank
and it's like not to me not really you
know like to work in a company like that
it doesn't attract me you know is great
I would love to just I would love to go
in to work there for like a month or two
and then quit like to be honest with you
because in reality is it's like a badge
of honor for a developer right it's like
for a lot of people they they've really
how you call it they really appreciate
that and to be like they respect it so
it's like a badge of honor you come in
like oh I worked at Google I do this for
Google I you know it's like other people
will look at you different and you will
always get top dollar because you're
actually a X Google employer or whatever
but personally for me it's not like I
want to go there like there's so much
other cool stuff that I want to do like
I'm opening up my studio I'm moving to
Queens pretty soon I'm getting a lot of
stuff it's like I'm on my journey to
build my own Google like I don't want to
work for nobody else and be like make
them rich you get what I'm saying like I
already have the talents I already work
hard for this like how can I make my own
goal that's where I'm at right now you
know I always tell people go to levels
that I Oh levels l evey Els that I oh
that's my biggest influence in this
whole thing
that dude right there he's the reason
that I do everything that I do now
because I saw him grind I saw him call
from his house to now having you know a
business like he makes a bar like
probably like half a million dollars a
year or more
he has like four or five different
startups he started he had a goal one
year to say hey I'm gonna build 12
startups in one year and he built it and
then he sold
he sold most of the companies but he
kept one which is no mad list the IO and
three mo okay the IO
and those are two big websites that
people visit every single day and people
have memberships in there like he like
it's crazy like the way how he has been
set up we had the website I think it's
like thirty thousand people thirty
thousand paying members like calculate
that you get what i mean like thirteen
thousand times five per month
like how much no I think even more I
think he pays people pay $10 or $15 for
the membership and like calculate that
you get what I'm saying like it was like
war like 300 grand I'm sorry he makes
like I'm off just from one website
independently like those are my
inspirations you go you go what I'm
saying like me I'm taking different
routes like I'm having this website you
know coding phrase calm it's one part of
my life that's one part right like I'm
not looking to make a million dollars of
coding face calm who knows a year from
now we might have 50,000 members on
coding phase calm currently we have
about 2,000 3,000 members on the website
right but what happens a year from now
two years from now it could be fifty
thousand members right calculate that
you know if it gets to that point I'll
make it even cheaper you know because
I'm not looking to be like hey we gotta
become millionaires of this thing it's
just like hey if we're making enough
I'll put distinct for two
a month straight up you know me when I
say something I don't care like I'll
make this thing to like far out us three
dollars a month like I could care less
if enough people are signed up to it
yeah
like I don't care you know what I mean
but I have this website I have another
idea that I'm coming up with this
website called fun even if I should put
the name out it's a music website where
I have I'm gonna have other people go to
concerts go to you know interview
artists like I still got a lot of
connections with the music industry so
now what I want to do is be able to to
put a platform for independent artists
to be able to share the content online
and then it spreads it out to every
social network out there so that's
something that I I've been working on
and I have my studio so it's like I have
multiple little low businesses here here
here here so that's where I'm at I'm not
looking for no gogo who is gonna be
boring Google is gonna be me going to
meetings he's doing freaking Springs
like I don't need to be in that
environment right now like that's whack
you get what I'm saying like I don't
want to dust not my goals let me see
what else what else what else man what
about net neutrality oh I think I think
is good I think it's good that people
are talking about a kiss
in one sense is really it's really
messed up that people want to charge you
more for the speed all right it should
be like okay it's unlimited like if the
thing could go unlimited let it be
unlimited you know what I mean
but at the same time I do understand the
businesses from a business point like if
I'm Comcast right and my money comes
from cable my money comes from TV my
money comes from all
stuff right and I also all the internet
service why am I going to be giving like
unlimited Internet to my competition
which is Netflix right that's what it
comes down to net neutrality is not for
it and nothing else besides Netflix all
right because there's nothing else out
there besides Netflix in YouTube that
that people is like all watching every
single day what's the biggest
competition to cable Netflix in YouTube
so I understand them in that sense I was
like yo it's ridiculous how we gonna be
given the competition basically the best
things we don't make no money with them
you know what I'm saying like they don't
make no money with Netflix like most of
this company they don't make no money
with Netflix so it's like in reality
people are saying oh that this is gonna
stifle independent businesses now it's
not gonna start from nobody it's gonna
stifle and mess up the money for Netflix
and YouTube that's a and for people to
say oh those are independent business I
don't think Netflix or Google need to be
getting any bigger than what they are
already because they they are having a
monopoly of everything like Netflix is
already a monopoly like nobody nobody
really signs up for Hulu or YouTube TV
it's already everybody's on Netflix
alright so that's already like an a
monopoly YouTube is the same thing
there's no other web sites out there
that people can go to because like let's
say right now you have what was that
website that I was on forgot let's say a
Vimeo right let's say Vimeo shows up
somebody creates a video on Vimeo
you know what Google does Google doesn't
show that video on the tablet of the the
search results they only show the
YouTube videos on the top of the search
results for google.com so Google has
become a monopoly of the Internet of
information personally I think it is
gonna mess it up for both sides but I
think
for both sides is good because it levels
down the playing field like it's gonna
let other platforms grow YouTube
shouldn't be number one Google should
not be number one all the time you know
Netflix shouldn't be number one all the
time
give plan give other platforms the
opportunity you know they should have
something personally I think the
government should have something to say
about the way how search results are
being run because what happens is
there's no surgery or search engine out
there that's letting the little guys
show up no more it's not like how it was
back in the days back in the day so you
created a website it's like right now I
could create a website that's better
than Facebook
better than MySpace better than all of
this other websites but who's gotta find
it nobody because Google already has
that control Google says ok we're gonna
let the people that we want to let show
up on the first page so then nobody
could find a good social network or find
a good website and that's the issue you
know or even like for the little guys
who are let's say I'm a mechanic back in
the days you had keywords on your meta
tags and this and that and you could
show up on the top page nowadays not now
everybody that shows up in the top page
are people that are paying for that you
got what I'm saying
like there goes all of that goes back to
net neutrality like people are you know
a lot of people's gonna be like oh man
this is gonna be a slippery slippery
slope because people could come in and
start slowing down your internet and
this doesn't that but what people don't
say is like if you're paying for
Internet your internet is gonna be fast
right now
what's gonna slow down it's this big
services that hey they wanna have 4k
yeah they want a half a K and this this
and that but the companies don't make no
money from them like they're the
competition you know what I'm saying
like cable and Netflix are in
competition how the hell is cable going
to be given all the best
things to Netflix when Netflix is eating
up the competition and not giving them
anything so it's like a service that
they create a service and they make all
the money you know what I'm saying and
that's what happens a lot this was
happening on in society period right now
people are dominating everything there's
no more mob mom and pop shops there's no
more electronic stores there's no more
nothing all this big corporations are
eating up everything and then they they
just buying in the little ones whenever
a little ones popping up oh you start up
we bind you now you're part of this so
there's only like four or five companies
out here that are making money and
everybody else is supposed to be just
with a smile all day you get what I'm
saying so net neutrality is is hard to
say it's kind of good you know those are
the things that for me in that sense
that's where it kind of you know it kind
of messes it up I don't know man yeah
I'm about to start using the DuckDuckGo
somebody was telling me about that
yeah I'm not a capitalist because the
problem with being a capitalist is that
this is the problem with being a
capitalist the problem about it is you
always have this dream right everybody
has this dream that hey being a
capitalist I'm gonna become a
millionaire one day but the reality of
it is I only 1% of the people are gonna
become millionaires and you know multi
millionaires whatever right so what
happens to all 99% of other people they
get they get effed up right so you know
it's like I was watching this
documentary on Netflix which is pretty
good talking about all say I think
saving capitalism you should if you work
at McDonald's for example you work at
McDonald's you work two shifts you
should now be struggling because it's a
job no matter what it's a job me working
as a developer I should not be
struggling and these people who are
struggling out there and because I'm
already doing a job I'm working my hours
I'm doing other things that I need to do
I shouldn't be struggling you know what
I'm saying yeah me being a mechanic
I shouldn't be struggling me being
somebody working out of retail if I work
at Macy's and I work at Macy's for 40
hours a week
I shouldn't be struggling right we we
set up the system where all the money
goes up so the people that's already
rich and it's already up there right
nothing comes back down to us people
that are at the bottom so what happens
with that is like in capitalism people
has to have this dream like yeah I'm
really going to wait until I become a
millionaire I'm really gonna become a
millionaire one day but then what
happens if you don't become a
millionaire you worked your whole life
and you're still struggling like it's
that fear you know back in the 50s
people you know our freaking grandpa
grandparents and this and that they
could buy a house with a BS job on or
you know General Motors you know have
pension have social security have
everything that they need it now in
these try getting that from any company
you know what companies do nowadays they
keep people on on part-time so people
could have to they're gonna have to work
two three different jobs just to make a
livable wage like people shouldn't be
doing and going through that you know
what I mean yeah a doctor should
definitely make money it's like this
certain things that if if it takes you a
long time to become that you should
definitely get more perks all right but
what people what people shouldn't be
able to do is keep all the money
nah like you know like all this
companies like let's say an example like
for example people are working
McDonald's and so that's a perfect
example those people don't make nothing
right now they're gonna make $15 an hour
and that's fine that's cool but it's not
like amazing right but they work hard
they work hard all day they're okay
doesn't matter if it's McDonald's or
flipping burgers we all use McDonald's
right so as a society we should say hey
we should take care of those people the
companies don't do that companies they
they say hey I'm the CEO of McDonalds
this year we we made fifty
billion dollars how about we keep thirty
billion dollars up right invest 20
billion you know invest 19 billion
dollars into building more more
restaurants and in advertising all the
stuff and then give the same 1 billion
dollars that takes to pay everybody off
and that's it nobody else if the company
goes up nobody goes and it makes money
out of it right if you work at Walmart
you work out all these places the
company could be having the best year
nobody gets a bonus
nobody's guess a race no by
guess nothing so those people are there
they they make the they making a company
money so they should get paid from that
they should get paid some type of money
because it's like a you're doing good
you know it's one of the things that
where I couldn't stand from my last job
like the guys is like they make him
money and they wanted to treat you know
they will treat like the people that's
in the back like like they were freaking
high colas like like I don't know it was
a weird dynamic alright like people over
there in the back doing stuff it's like
they don't even talk to them they don't
care about the guys doing on the
warehouse like people care about the
people that are inside of the offices
but the people that are in the the
warehouse isn't the people that are
manufacturing those are people too you
get what I'm saying like I'm one of
those person like I like helping people
out it's like you can't be here
and you know just getting exploited at
some point people are gonna get tired
that and people instead of back in the
days people will be like oh yeah that's
great um mr. gently James Smith has is a
millionaire up the block and you know he
lives in his house on the hill but
nobody hated him right now in days
people hate those people
it's don't resent me because it's like
we make you billionaires and we don't
get nothing back we go is like the
iPhone we go and spend so much money on
iPhones and all this stuff
we made Apple who they are today where
are the jobs what why the jobs are not
here you got what I'm saying like we are
the company we are the country that buy
all that stuff from every every freaking
company out there in the world we are
the biggest market we buy all that stuff
why are we getting something back why
aren't people that you know if you built
the iPhone hey you should make you know
seventy eighty thousand dollars a year
so you can live good you can say hey
where that would have pride like oh I'm
a I'm a Apple product manufacturer
you know what I mean like you should
have that pride and we will feel even
better we'll be like oh wow we spending
a thousand dollars into Apple every
 year on a new phone and we feel
good but nowadays they don't you know
people don't don't bring that into us
you know what I mean you get what I'm
saying so that's what I'm saying like
net neutrality is part of all of that
and that's what I think is like you know
even with the current president that we
have now you know I know the guy was an
idiot I know the guy was dumb and he was
gonna be doing dumb stuff but there's a
point where everything is all messed up
currently in the economy and how society
works that at the end of the day all of
this stuff needs to get a reset button
you know the president that's right now
you know so much crazy stuff that he's
doing that reality he's a reset button
for this society so the next president
now we haven't got a high standard we
were like man this last one was crazy
now we gotta bring somebody that's full
of people that's really care about the
people that's not racist that's here
trying to help people out you know what
I mean like that's how that's the type
of person I am and you know not to bring
it back to with everybody else that took
BS about me but it's like if you guys
know me you guys know who I am in you
guys know how I am
like I come here and I'm all about
bettering everybody else and getting
everybody to be good and get jobs and
get money so it's like you know you
should know my stance I'm a lot of a lot
of this stuff right now
exactly yeah
he's the reset button and the middle
finger to the establishment you know
what I mean like people who want to
continue with this whole stuff is like
you know what fu fu
now here you go you get what I'm saying
like cuz it's not about you know people
be like oh it's a black and white thing
this racism just isn't that not really
it's everybody's messed up
white people are messed up right now
like people messed up Latinos we're
stubborn Asians are messed up
everybody's messed up there's only a
handful of people making money everybody
else we're just getting by no I haven't
heard of anybody that be like oh I'm I'm
balling now unless you like a rapper and
