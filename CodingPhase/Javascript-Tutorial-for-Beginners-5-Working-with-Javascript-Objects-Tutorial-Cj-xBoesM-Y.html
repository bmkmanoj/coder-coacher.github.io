we're gonna teach you a little bit about
objects today man make sure you
subscribe because and there's a
continuation to a long series of videos
on how to basically program JavaScript
the easy way right alright so let's
start with objects right so how do you
declare an object all right sorry about
that so the way how you declare an
object is pretty much the same example
you want to say a user right so inside
of a user we're gonna have different
type of data for that user right so
let's say we want to create the object
by basically starting with curly
brackets right we could do it like that
now when you say user is the clear as an
object this curly brackets means it's an
object right so how do you have
properties all right inside we're not it
so let's say Ecuador user and then I say
name equals to Joe alright so now inside
of user there's you see the name and the
name is Joe right so how do we get
access to that right to basically say
okay user that whatever the properties
name whenever you decided to name this
acronym this whole name or whatever I
want right I could name this like this
hey user name right so user dot username
and then it's going to return back Joe
right okay so that's one way to
basically add properties inside war are
using it now using an object right also
to let's say an example we wanted to do
this and say hey ok I declared the user
now instead of just putting one thing at
a time I want to make a list of
properties inside of this user so what i
will do is I'll declare inside of it so
manually right so you will say ok
username equals Joe so inside of this
you could put in any type you know
strings numbers boolean functions which
inside of a object is called a method
but it's just a function alright so
let's say username friends let's say
Jenny Mike right that's a little ray now
let's say a single false that's it olean
what else using a spare ok age 29 that's
a number now let's say what else we have
username you have a string an array a
boolean a number and then now we call
also have an object inside of an object
so like let's say let's say and hobbies
go in and put an object and let's say I
don't know baseball true
that's good full force so now we have an
object inside of a hot inside of an
object right that's one now let's say a
function right so let's say print name
and then let's say function and then we
say council god no let's say name is ms
and then i say this dot user name and
what this is going is this is saying
inside of this object go and search for
using it right so saying this instead of
this go to using it and printer here so
now whenever i invoke this function is
gonna print out my name is joe alright
so the same example if we wanted to
print out each one let's say we could do
it like this username and then I'm not
username using and then it's going to
print out Joe or i could say age it's
going to print out to 29 right so that's
what's inside of that property so this
is the object this is the property
inside of an object so there's the key
and this is the value the value of that
key so when I say okay user and then
basically though the property is key and
I say okay age and then it's going to
print out
whatever the value is which is 29 also I
could go in with the doc just how we do
here this stop using it we could do user
dot username and then that should print
out Joe you see now let's say for a
function we wanted to print out a
function right and we want to basically
run a function right let's say user that
the current name and then with this
parenthesis and means run this function
says if you run this by itself it's
going to give you what's inside of it
it's gonna say user that print name
equals to a function alright a function
name print name but if you put this
parenthesis that basically invokes in
just basically says ok run this function
now so that should saves it my name is
Joe because that's what we had here in
the counselor and that's how it is
that's how you basically work with
objects it's that simple you got any
questions leave a comment let me know
what you think of the video make sure
you subscribe I'm keeping this super
simple and you know dummy proof you know
there's no point of me giving you some
super large words and all of this let's
keep this simple man there was a
good thing that says kiss right keep it
simple stupid that's it so that's my
motto and I want you guys to learn this
super quick all right make sure you
subscribe so boy Joe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
