back at it again coding phase calm your
boys backing out and did it again
alright so I'm here to answer your boy
David Bissell I feel like David always
drops a bomb every time he drops a
comment like this daisies he's good
this daisies he'll drop something crazy
this days that I'll be like what well I
love I love seeing him here he's
definitely one of the most active users
on my channel and I'd love to see his
opinions and things but I'm gonna answer
this basically he said lol what the hell
is this is gonna take five years to
master all of that building a demo i
from a tutorial doesn't mean that you
know the framework language let's say
you learn react and got decent with it
as soon as you start to work with other
tools like Larry brow you're gonna get
weaker and slower I react you need to do
one thing every day to get good at it in
one sense you're right in another sense
you're wrong for one main reason is that
you don't have to be a master of any of
these things
alright so let me see hello it's my
website right now I'm working on the es6
course guys if you guys really want to
learn es6 go to my website right now
trust me it's coming out amazing alright
so he's saying like oh that all of the
stuff to master it might take five years
in a sense he's right it might take you
five years to master it but to get a job
you don't need to be a master of any of
these things alright the most that you
need to know is HTML CSS everything else
all you need to do is really have you
know exposure to it you know like I'm
being honest like in every company I've
been in they hire people that do not
know any of these things right like a
lot of times I'm not even lying to you
guys this is not even like I'm freakin
lying to you guys there's literally the
truth I've been doing this for five
years when I got hired I didn't know all
of the stuff
most that I knew was html/css responsive
and a little bit of JavaScript and I say
I got hired right now
just in this past week we hire like two
three people who are brand new
developers one doesn't know everything
under here under the Sun but he got a
good job he getting 60 grand 50 60 grand
to start right his first job right never
worked before never done any other stuff
but he's had some exposure to it just
with that he got hired you're not going
to master all this stuff from coming to
my website back oh I'm gonna be a master
of this no you're gonna be a master when
you get that job all of the skills that
I have here you're going to learn it and
you're gonna have the exposure to it
right now if I'll tell you hey a David
can you build me a page out of dribble
just build exactly how it is and just
HTML CSS after watching this course
you're going to be able to do that if I
come in I'll tell you hey David when
it's on tablet I want the letters to be
a little smaller you're gonna be like oh
yeah I can do that because I watched
this build a responsive app you know how
to work with media queries right if I
come in and I'll tell you hey David I
want um you know can we work on this as
soon as possible and just try to you
know knock out the CSS as soon as
possible you know yeah I know sass I
can't do this right away right you come
in and but I hear I want you to create a
little slider you're going to be able to
do that because you learn how to work
with the elements on the page now all of
this extra stuff here this R plus
everything else below here from one to
six is that's all the things that you
need to know to get higher everything
below this you know six it's all plus
it's like you know it's like saying hey
do you know how to work with es6 even
like yeah I know
ES 6 I've played around with it that's
all you have to say on your job
interview somebody actually have you
ever worked with angular react jazz
hi Brad you'd be like yes because I've
actually worked on it you've created
apps because that's what I'm doing for
you guys all right or even if you go out
on your own and continue making smaller
apps on react or angular like you
already have the exposure you don't
understand that you get hired because
you can get the exposure you already had
the exposure to a certain technology
that's what you get hired you don't get
hired to become a master on it you get
hired as a senior developer to be a
master of something like right now if I
go for an interview then I asked me hey
do you know like react like you know
front to back yes I'm like yes I've been
doing this for like two three years
already and they're gonna be like okay
cool they're gonna talk to me about a
I'm gonna have to explain how components
work how Redux work for you guys you
guys are brand new developers nobody's
gonna put you through hell with that
because you're not going for a mid-level
to senior level position you're going in
as a junior developer now to to think
like oh man
negative and blame I'm not gonna be able
to get a job because there's so much
things here under the you know in
development under the Sun that's gonna
take me years and years to learn you're
right is going to take you years to be
able to master everything but everything
that's here is for different people like
if somebody would just start it
yesterday and they don't know anything
about web development they're gonna
start at number one let's say you David
you probably worked at you know you have
a few you know a few years working with
you know JavaScript right you're not
gonna start on none of these numbers
right cuz you already know this stuff
you're gonna start down here year 6x
next and then you're gonna learn Larry
ball or you're gonna learn nodejs you're
gonna learn go this list right here it's
like a a guideline of the things that
you need to know doesn't mean that these
are the things that you need to know in
day one it's like you're a junior
developer know what is expecting you to
know go at all
nobody's gonna ask you that trust me
know what is gonna come to me be like
hey do you know go have you had any
exposure if you say yes they're gonna
they are
is gonna open up him oh my god this guy
he's very talented because this what
you'll understand this is your
competition kids your competition is
kids who came out of college who never
done any projects outside of whatever
projects they gave him in school most of
them are coming out with Python right
Python it's cool but it's not it's not
what every company use out there so if
you come in and you're gonna hate I'm
going for a job for laravel right it's
you and another kid who just came out of
school and his background is in Python
right he has a degree but you you are a
brand new developer self-taught but you
actually have an experience in Python
and PHP who do you think is gonna get
picked the guy who has no experience or
you who already at least created a
couple of projects on larva which one
you think is gonna get hired
crickets all right who do you think he's
gonna get hired like I'm just telling
you like the only person who's gonna get
hires the one that has to experience the
one that had the exposure to it right
we're not saying you're gonna become a
master at this stuff from 1 to 6
you could master that you could master
that in less than three months I'm being
honest in less than 3 months 1 to 6 you
can master this all right everything
else is gonna take you time those are
the things that you're gonna learn at
the job after you spend a year at a job
and like this things that nobody can
teach you online nobody nobody's gonna
be able to teach you the different type
of websites that a client might work
there's not gonna be nobody here who's
gonna be like hey create this type of
website this type of website this
separate website it's almost impossible
because every business is customized all
right so there's gonna be situations
that you can only know about by working
and that's what I'm trying to get you
guys in you know I want to get you guys
in that position where you could just go
in and just get that job that's saying I
wish somebody had this for me I'm being
honest I really wish somebody had this
for me when I first started and I
wouldn't have wasted so much time
you know like the naira lied to you guys
when I didn't even know JavaScript that
well I was already trying to learn
angular 1 and it's like bro you don't
even know jQuery you don't even know you
know sass you didn't even know none of
this stuff right because I was like
looking online I kept seeing oh angular
1 ain't gonna 1 I was jumping from you
know let's say one two three and then
jump into freaking angular which is
number 11 like you know what I mean like
it makes sense I wish somebody would
have taught me this from the beginning
you know what I mean so that's what I'm
doing for you guys so I hope this answer
your question David and your comment you
have a point is gonna take people years
I just really don't want you guys to get
discouraged and they're like oh my god
there's so much stuff that you gotta
learn guys this is a list for everybody
you know people that are gonna come here
they've been like let's say an example
or your boy Matt right Matt the one that
you know the Matt the bot my boy I love
that kid
right you're always showing love on the
channel created this court or always
make sure that he comments on all my
videos I love the kid right let's say
right now Matt comes here he knows all
of this stuff he don't need to come here
and try to learn this thing he's not
gonna start from number one or number
six you already know this stuff he's
gonna try to start from eight es6 and
then down because he already knows the
rest of his things right but like let's
say my boy Charles the say Charles comes
in he might start here and number two
the terminal you don't know the terminal
there from there learn HTML CSS build a
responsive app size future-proof
JavaScript then jQuery you know what I
mean like it's just everybody has this
own way in like their timing but what
I'm saying is if you come here you know
all this stuff and you have exposure to
this this other technologies other
frameworks this other programming
languages you're going to get the job I
guarantee it guys
I keep seeing this people are getting
higher that don't even have enough
experience in this guy's and because
it's like this thing is easy you could
get the experience in a month or two
working it in a job so it's like you go
to the interview and they actually my
hey how have you heard of react you but
yeah I took a couple of courses on it
they actually hey have you seen our
angular yeah I've worked with angular
then they actually Oh what frameworks do
you like that are you know or any
technologies that's out there you come
in and you say oh I like this new
framework hyper app the moment you say
that they say oh wow this kid is really
in the industry he's really in the
community he's really part of this this
community like you know you're gonna get
higher off that I'm being honest guys I
don't know how to tell you guys Martis

comment because I just want you guys to
really understand what you got here
right now I want to say thank you to
everybody who signed up this is crazy

great man because I really busted my ass
doing all this courses and building this
website for you guys like everybody who
who knows about this knows this thing
takes a long time to do this isn't
something that you could just do it in
five minutes
there was a economy I can't find let me
see if I find it it was a really good
comment let me see where is it it was
about the five projects oh man where is
it it's hard but ya know those are
common that somebody said it's like man
can you build the fire projects I'm like
yeah I could build a fire projects I
just need the time and somebody else
left the coming it's like man do you
guys know how long it takes to build a
decent ecommerce website like it it
could take a month and it's
yeah that's exactly how long it might
take you know what I mean so it's like
as I'm building I'm trying to knock out
all the basic courses for you guys to
get ready and hit the ground running and
then like the more advanced stuff like
the five projects that I've been talking
about I'm going to build those but I
need time to build it it's gonna take a
while because it's really it's like full
applications all right now I just want
to say you know thank you to everybody

hand guys I'm telling you this there's
not enough people to fill out the jobs

want to go through the process of
spending three to five months learning
you know programming what developing how
everything works nobody wants to do that
people want instant gratification people
wants to be like oh yeah I'll just go to
FedEx and I'll get a job you know what I
mean

guys they just want to apply somewhere
and get the job you guys really gonna go
in trust me man
right now I'm making money I'm not
talking about this website I got been
making money from my career and it was
the best thing that I did because I'm
happy I like coding I would like working
