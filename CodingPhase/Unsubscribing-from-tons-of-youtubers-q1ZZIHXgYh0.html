from people but I have so many
subscriptions that it doesn't matter I'm
not getting the right once so you know -

video that I could see that I found
interesting from Chris Hawkes that I
like Amy listen I love Chris Hawkes but
for me to get notifications like that's
a different level it's like I gotta be
excited to watch your new content and I
don't know sorry Chris Hawkes let's see
so Chris hooks didn't make the cut the

past I don't know the past
I don't know the past month two months

I know he got the divorce and everything
going on but it's like I know his
channel so at the same time I'm still if
I want to go visit Chris Hawkes like I
know how to go over there you got what
I'm saying like I hope people understand
why I'm subscribing and unsubscribing
from channels this is more like a
cleanup this is like cleaning up my
cleaning up my my stuff you know what I
mean you know just putting it out there
this is not throwing shots - nobody does
not me you know I don't know how to say
like me saying hey man unsubscribe
little crystal it's just me personally I
haven't found any new videos in like
in a while like I don't know the past
probably seems like January and that's
being honest I haven't seen any good
videos I can say yo this is cool I'm
excited it's a new topic or him giving
like a cool opinion of stuff I feel like
maybe he's going through stuff and his
content Connor has died down so I'm not
excited to see a Chris Hawkes
notification but it doesn't mean that I
won't check it the reason why I'm doing
all this cleanup is because I want to
make sure that died notification I will
turn on the bell for every single person
that's left and then I want to make sure
to follow every single person that's
there okay because I'm gonna be excited
to watch whatever content they drop in
if I'm not getting that excitement if
the channels not gonna make the cut
to the coding phase description so I
hope you guys understand that you know
and even though that I'm still gonna go
to Chris Hawkes channel you know still
gonna go over there now see Eric as I go

for you guys to actually do this once in
a while sometimes you missed
notifications from people sometimes you
miss channels that you really care about
at the moment even for my channel man
listen if you think like you're not
getting cool videos from my channel and
you're not excited
unsubscribe you know you can subscribe
for my channel you know I'd rather have
people that are here that excited for my
content and just to half of a number
you're gonna say like we don't need that
I'd rather have people that want to be
part of the community and you know
let me see who else can we bring this
down even more can we bring this down
even more man I don't want to do this
man yeah you can subscribe man yeah I
think everybody if you're not excited

you got my saying it's cool spring
cleaning
alright man so I'm gonna see you guys
later see a boy Joe back at it again
coding face.com your boy is back and I
don't did it again guys oh by the way by
the way before you leave go to the
website check out coding face comm you
know go to the members area if you are a
member take advantage guys we just
dropped this new nodejs course and go
check it out
basically I'm dropping the first project
here on YouTube for free so people who
get like a preview of the projects that
we're doing there and like the basics
but the projects is down here you see
all of this content here all of that
content that's oh no Jes kids I know you
love nodejs
I know you damn well loved nodejs a lot
of people been waiting for this thing
asking for it so I say you know what now
that we finished most of the other
courses here you go okay so doing this
we're doing project one which is gonna
be a crud so it's like a simple crud
with the easy store okay and then from
there we're gonna do an e-commerce store
which is like a full stack application
we're gonna connect to stripe API we're
probably gonna connect to the PayPal API
as part is the the payment gateway we're
gonna do that then we're also going to
be doing like something simple like a
simple project for you to also be able
to start building stuff by full stack
right and what's cool about this is this
is being done with my sequel and Adonis
Jas if you are a fan of Ruby on Rails if
you were a fan of laravel and you like
the structure of a frame working being
able to hit the ground running and be
able to have user authentication build a
massive project and have everything in
order Idonije yes for you okay guys so
it's the perfect way
for you guys to learn no J yes the last
time that I I didn't OGS course I
stopped it because to be honest with you
guys I realized that teaching with
Express is not really the best way for
people to gravity and learn everything
that is around OGS even though everybody
talks about Express Express Express I
also give express in this course
basically it's like four videos of the
basics of Express but using a Dhananjay
yes you will understand the concept of
web development right with JavaScript
not just like oh I'm learning Express
and that's saying it's like then you
watch the video and then you forget how
to build a website now this is you
building every different scratch if
you're taking the PHP course for me if
you take in the Ruby on Rails course
you're gonna see like this is very
similar to that and you're gonna
understand everything that you need from
nodejs
okay guys so I'm gonna see you guys
later simple Joe back at it again
