boy joke back at it again : face calm
man bow
alright guys so I'm gonna talk about you
know certain issues and certain problems
as developers that we will always have
and like one of the major problems is
you know leaving work at work meaning
like whatever you do at your job trying
to leave it over there like it's
extremely hard like especially for me
like sometimes I'm working on a project
and most of the work that I do in my job
is pretty much you know front end work
I'm constantly doing JavaScript and
sorry lately you know I've been working
on something called Tryon tool which is
pretty much the personal upload sub
image then after the person uploads the
image basically they you know they move
their pupils they place the cursor on
top of the pupils and then from there I
calculate depending on how far their
pupils are apart I calculate the size of
the glasses and pretty much you know
where the side the glass is supposed to
be placed in the person's face which to
some people they might say hey that's
that's easy well it's not fucking easy
you know why because I'm the way I'm
building this this whole component is
it's basically like super difficult like
I have to constantly calculate
everything from you know the the way how
the like let's say somebody resizes the
screen everything gots to re-render and
gotta you know recalculate you know
depending on the size of the image I
gotta calculate that depending on the
size of the glasses
I got a calculate that they're from
there I gotta calculate the angle that
consumer some people take pictures like
this or whatever like you gotta
calculate all the fucking angry
which is extremely difficult especially
for somebody like me like I'm I feel
like I'm a web developer I'm not a
software engineer like I did one year
computer science and then I left that
alone okay I got to calculus - I got a
b-minus and I say listen this is not for
me I don't want to be doing no fucking
math that's how I was you know when I
was in college and I was like you know
what I'm gonna do a communication design
which is pretty much front-end you know
doing the front end because I don't like
math I don't enjoy doing that so I'm
constantly frustrated at work because of
this and it's like you know I'm just
constantly doing calculations and I'm
like all I'm gonna do is just do fucking
websites I don't want to deal with you
know this stuff so that shit gets me
fucking stressed out and I'm like oh my
god I gotta get this project done so
even after I leave from work I come home
and I'm still stressed out about it
because it's fucking difficult and not
only that that I'm building something
that nobody else has built meaning
there's no other website out there that
has built a tool like this that lets you
you know well preview your the glasses
on your face and it's responsive because
most of the websites what they do is
they make a a desktop version and then
they make a mobile version but they
usually do it in an app because there's
so many limitations in the browser but I
try to do this all in a browser what I
happen to use nothing like you know
image magic or other back-end so I try
to do everything in the front end and
like that's like super stressful man by
trying to create something that nobody
has ever created in the world like and
then there's no references for it it's
not like you thought you could going ask
somebody hey how do you build this I go
oh you know like get an idea for
somebody because nobody has ever built
something like this you know what I mean
where it's completely responses you know
doesn't matter
size of of the browser doesn't matter
the size of the screen like everything's
supposed to fall in perfect so I'm
constantly bringing that from work to my
personal life and it's like that's a
huge challenge like for people like you
know being able to disconnect from your
job like you know what development is
not about a nine-to-five like yeah you
go into the office at 9:00 and you come
out at 5:00 but then from there your
brain still working on that it's like
okay maybe if I try this tomorrow maybe
if I do this so maybe if I try this
other library maybe if I instead of
using CSS I do it through JavaScript
like you know your brain is constantly
gonna be working on shit from work which
is like extremely difficult and then on
top of that like I come home and I still
do code like you know I'll do these
videos for you guys I do other stuff and
I'm like yo I don't know how a lot of
people do this shit like you know being
a web developer it's like a 24/7 thing
like you know what I mean like I love
coding but it fucking sucks when you
want to work on your own personal stuff
but then in the back of your mind
you have things of work you know from
your job and I'm like ah married like
this is literally like the worst feeling
you know so I just wanted to share that
I don't know what it's a quick rent of
like me talking about fucking bullshit
like you know bullshit from you know a
problem that you are I think a lot of
developers have that shit so like you
know you go at work and you work on
something at work and then when you go
home you're still thinking about it
you're still working on it like it's a
fucking headache man you know but think
the best way to do you know keep your
mind busy you know when you come home
keep your mind busy you know hang out
with with your family hang out with your
friends you know you know try to try to
just stay positive man because even
after you hit a certain point like right
now I have like five years
professional you know working as a
developer late and are still fucking
this times I'm still nervous and certain
things I'm still anxious about certain
shape what I like I still feel like oh
my god can I make this actually work and
I like this this thing work like I don't
know I don't know about other people but
like I figured like given which time
you're still gonna feel like that
doesn't matter how how long you've been
programming like this a lotta you know
you're always gonna be anxious about
something new or like you know you're
bringing you know your your job is still
with you at home which is a fucking
nightmare you know what I mean alright
guys so anyways that was just a quick
rant make sure you subscribe make sure
you like this video well you know leave
a comment I want to know if other people
go through this shit you know where
you're at home and you're still your
brain still working on stuff from work
you know what I mean let me know alright
guys I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
