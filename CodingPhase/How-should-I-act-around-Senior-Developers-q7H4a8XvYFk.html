high act or behave around other more
experienced developers I want to show
I'm committed but I don't want to be an
annoying guy how should you act around
like senior developers and mid-level
developers listen just go in there be a
sponge if you get what the hell what
that means right
soak up any knowledge that they can give
you you know sometimes you might know
some things that you might think like oh
I know more than this person like let's
say somebody might come in and you walk
into a company and they do all that net
right they don't know that much about
nodejs right if you know something about
nodejs or new technology share it with
them but don't show off with it
right you want to come in humble your
first two three years you want to be a
humble developer you don't want to be in
there like oh I know more than you
because those guys are more experienced
than you no matter what you might know
the latest framework you might know the
latest OOP D what you know what I mean
but at the end of the day they have more
experience than you they've been through
the struggles they've been through the
trenches you got nothing so going their
humble hangout with them if they
actually hey man well what you doing for
lunch you want to get some Peaks that go
with them you know just be humble and at
the same time if you have any questions
