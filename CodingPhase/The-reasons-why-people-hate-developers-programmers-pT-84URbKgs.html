again man Cody face.com your boys back
and out and did it again yeah we here
live man we're here about to talk about
the guidelines for building software
that will make people hate you a
practical approach to building bad
software all right now let's start it up
make it slow
yeah all right make sure that you have
images the size of 15 megapixels you
know 15 megabytes of of images if like
hey your images is gonna take a minute
to load and there's 20 of them yay
right no Ottoman sation no tiny PNG no
nothing just let's make it slow right
now another one is I don't know what
that is but I'm sure it's impossible now
this is 50/50 because people I'll tell
you like a couple of examples like I've
been in companies where people will come
in and be like hey we want to create
something that I saw on the new iPhone
app and you're like wait that's on
software this is web development so you
want to create something that's
completely not impossible but we don't
have the manpower or the time to create
those things so sometimes you have to
say hey man that's impossible here but
if somebody comes up to you and be like
hey can we put a hamburger menu when the
page resizes below 600 pixels and you'd
be like nah I think that's impossible or
you tell them hey it's someone else's
job go tell that to the designer go tell
that to the front-end guy and you know
you could do it that's definitely gonna
make people hate you for sure um another
one is uptime is not important you know
sometimes people be like hey man you
know we're gonna create this this cron
job it's gonna bring down the website
every day at 3:00 p.m. all right but you
know it's gonna bring it down for only
20 minutes
primetime of like business hours and
he's like yeah
only gonna take it down for 15 minutes
20 minutes it's alright we won't lose
that much you know that would definitely
make people hate you let me see all on
board with the hype train right somebody
comes in and be like man I just saw you
know but the best-of-the-best
framework online and it's like we've
been working in angular we've been
working and react but hey let's just
jump on you know the Harry Potter
framework you know view 3 came out can
we just jump on that the same day it
just came out I seen people do stuff
like this like what would happen if we
update everything what would happen if
we just update everything and then six
months later you realize it's like oh
yeah we shouldn't have done that because
nothing got tested and there was a whole
bunch of errors and we just kept killing
bugs with a software or framework that
we should have never used we should have
used something more safe something that
has been tested and then later on you
might in smaller features you might add
something new but not for the whole
website kids that will definitely make
people hate you
let me see make it completely
synchronous synchronous you know what
that means man that means it's like girl
you have to come in do one one thing at
a time right he's like hey you know it's
hilarious man
all of these things here we want me so
much of like things were done in the
company I was in like and that's why I
was like the last little bit of hair
that I have I was just like pulling it I
was I had no no more hair left I'm
pulling the things from the back I'm
just like I can't take this you know
people want to create stuff that like
synchronous like I created this uh this
trial tool where pretty much everything
is a synchronous meaning like things
gets loaded one time and then everything
filters out people really wanted to put
a loading bar in between things in
between views when you don't need a
loading bar no more because it's no
longer
synchronously before it was like every
time you click a page you have to load
the whole page again I basically created
something from scratch that saved all
that time and the user could get
everything instantly this Oh heads is
like nah man we have to come in and put
a loading bar bro users hate that users
hate having to wait just because you
stir your mind still old users hate
seeing something that takes longer than
what I needs to take especially now
because everything is like this you know
what I mean so make it completely
synchronous um so your users can
definitely pretend your software is so
simple everyone will get it this happens
a lot to developers when you know you're
a developer you be like man this is so
simple what I have to do is drag and
drop and then you never tell nobody that
to upload something you have to drag it
to the screen there's no message under a
there's nothing that that shows on my
hey drag there's no icon there's no
nothing it's just like a button there's
like a square
not even a button a square right what a
folder like people are supposed to know
what the hell to do with that I've seen
that done well there's like bro put a
message put a warning put a little great
message saying I hate drag a file to
upload and drop it here some people
don't even know that and they're like
don't worry my the users they're smart
enough there's like no they not trust me
validating forms it's not necessary you
don't have to validate forms people are
smart enough they listen though on the
email date you don't have to tell them
and make sure that says calm or.net or
or that's something people are used to
that they're not gonna go in and put it
in Johnny Smith without no location to
their email they're not gonna do that
right I seen that done before - let me
see your opinion is the only one that
matters
never say never access I see users about
what they think you're God's gift to
earth and know how to do a hello world
your
is all you need that's true there's
people like that they come in they have
an opinion like listen this is how we
got to do things in and even though
you're explaining to them why you should
do it a different way that I know
there's definitely this is the way to do
it you know it's like I've been doing it
for 15 years and this is the way to do
it
what the hell are you talking about bro
like you gotta listen to other people
you know okay there's another the more
confusing the better make sure none of
your form inputs have placeholder that
you make dubious which field mean means
what later you can be very professional
talk to your friends about how dumb your
users are and laugh about it where
people don't even put you know they put
placeholders or forms in and some places
they don't even put a placeholder they
don't even tell the user like hey
there's supposed to be your email here
they just put an input text field that's
it
means it's like okay cool now blame it
on the user do you want it come take it
never help your users remember anything
important instead let them check the
platform every five minutes
email text messages or mobile push
notifications are for lazy people use
words other than people don't understand
pretend you're a lawyer and add jargons
that don't mean or matter something some
tips are asynchronous request through
proxy brock's a proxy browser Krypton
[Laughter]
cryptography salts like you know people
you know I've seen this done so many
times when developers do this all the
time and this is you know there's some
things here that are part of you know
the usually upper management that the
that do certain dumpster decisions but
also to developers do stuff like this
man when they come in and they'll be
like yo is I hey you know start throwing
big words to people that you know people
are not you know technology savvy or
they have no tech degree they have no no
history in this
and then you start throwing big words
and then those people is like they get
you know they spin them around so much
with big words that they like oh yeah
sure whatever you want Johnny go ahead
do whatever you want cuz all they do is
just give them big words and act like
they smart and it's like bro you
couldn't just say hey we just kind of
basically won this button gets clicked
it's gonna wait for a second come back
send them the data and that's it
somebody comes in and starts talking to
a synchronously this isn't done and
you're like wait why keep it simple
stupid okay ignore all affordances do
whatever you feel like with the
interface for instance you could get a
youth you could use a floppy disk icon
for the leaving of record and a star
icon for logout yeah people do this too
like there's no references like you know
they they come in and be like hey you
know what instead of us using the you
know the pencil icon for saying
something like let's edit it or I do
something let's make that a delete
button for no reason like as if the user
has seen that pencil button used
anywhere else besides for editing and
now you you basically put it to delete
it make sure everybody's gonna hate you
after that all right let me see add
unnecessary loading screens man this is
what I've been telling people this is
what I was sending my own job and like
these people don't get it I was like
y'all bro don't add unnecessary loading
screens you don't need this people don't
need that people who actually hate that
they hate seeing something loading if
there's nothing to load the data is
already there why are you putting a
loading screen to access a fight hey
guys something is happening behind the
scenes
no I already happened like five pages
ago the data is already there there's no
reason for you to show people a loading
screen for no reason yeah the guy goes
like yeah this was for you Microsoft
yes they put loading screens of
everything like load all the data ones
and that's it
stop putting loading screens on every
singles don't need it okay add your tip
here what's your tip for building apps
people hate I'm waiting for your answers
in the comments I want to see what
people come in let me see if the people
put anything make sure you have a pop-up
that stops the user from whatever they
were doing to respond to it by reading
your app will give a feedback every 5
minutes only 5 stars are enabled
obviously oh man that's so true let me
see promote the mobile app for your
hands experience then just wrap the
website wrap the web sciences essays or
with reduced functionality yeah exactly
like people do this all the time so
don't go they rely hey man put on the
tablet you go to a website and they put
on the time tonight
hey go download our app and when you
download the app the app doesn't have
everything that the website has so it's
like why would I be coming to your app
and I'm losing functionality like come
on man ok use lots of red notification
dance maybe even make them blink angrily
until the user attends something they
couldn't give a crap I've seen that done
a lot of times where they start putting
like no thing that flashing you're like
wait I don't care about this
notification why are you flashing on my
screen there is nothing called bug
everything is a feature word I mean
there's a lot of good stuff man I'm
gonna put the link to to this article on
the description but guys check the
description below man I have a couple of
courses I have my website check me out
coding face.com literally I got a whole
bunch of courses there for you know you
got a all-access pass right you get the
all access pass you go for the whole
month you get access to every single
course now if you're like me and you're
you know you like to hoard courses on
udemy
I do this all the time I buy a whole
bunch of courses on udemy whenever they
are special check my description below
also right under my link to my website
there's a whole bunch of courses on
