joke back at it again coding face calm
your boys back in I didn't did it again
alright guys so before I go to sleep I
just wanted to put this out
you know once again it's like
misinformation kind of hurts people and
max fading I believe he's a subscriber I
don't know if he's a subscriber or not
but um I wanna you know just to show him
you know just would prove you know cuz
this is comment
I'm disappointed as I'm not gonna curse
and disappoint this ass ever
why do you promote this officially dying
framework your advice on learning PHP
verses no GS that's the first language
was legit but damn Ruby you startups
won't use Ruby on Rails anymore it's
gone all the new startups are using
javascript I live in San Francisco Bay
Area in the startup lane I don't see no
Ruby jobs you should be advising
learning PHP level as the first language
there's less framework to get the first
job and then jumping headfirst into Java
scary world where the feature is guys
nobody's telling people not to learn
JavaScript I think you have to learn
JavaScript to be in web development I
don't know
so you know what let's do the research
right which I already did I actually
went over every major city out there and
no matter where you go like Ruby or
rails are still doing good you know what
I mean like no matter where you go so we
did San Francisco Bay right so we got a
simple comic which I'm about to reply
right now you know what let's do it
right now live
so reply okay so basically all I said
was great we disagree do some research
nice nationwide I'm constantly getting
job offers for rails so
I don't know where you're getting your
info Google Trends blogs and Twitter
post not equal jobs any senior developer
can tell you that Plus same thing you're
saying about Ruby is being set by PHP
angular 1 Java C sharp and many other
programming languages and by the way
angular 1 it's not a programming
language but I put it in the mix because
people constantly say Oh aesthetic
angular is that well it's not because
the jobs are still there
yeah and many other programming
languages but they are not the case
javascript is hot yes is everything else
dead because it's not because it's hot
nope right so our older company is going
to scrap their applications nope
listen type this into your indie search
so you do search title right so this
it's like this this for you guys to if
you really want to find out if people
are looking for specifically for a
certain technology or certain
programming language or a certain job
that you really want you want to become
a doctor you want to become a dentist
you want to become I don't know plastic
surgeon do this so you could get the
exact thing that you're looking for so
you search title colon parentheses and
put in the name of whatever it is that
you're looking for so for now we put in
title colon Ruby on Rails alright so
we're gonna do that
there's San Francisco California today
is Thursday 148 in the morning January
25th 2018 okay so we do a search click
on there specifically for Ruby on Rails
developer there's 22 jobs okay 22 jobs
meaning and the minimum is $110,000 and
then it goes up okay that's in San
Francisco so those numbers don't don't
get too hyped if you live in Oklahoma
like those numbers do not exist in your
but let's look at node J yes
okay specifically write Ruby on Rails
had 22 and nodejs had 15 that's today
Thursday 1:49 a.m. January 25th 2018 you
know a month from now two months from
now three months from now six months
from now might change a year from now
might change but at this moment that's
what's happening so all the advice that
I give you guys I do research I don't
come in here I rather not even tell you
about certain technology unless I do the
research or unless I really really
believe in it okay now and like I said
you know he's not wrong about learning
JavaScript I tell people you gotta learn
in JavaScript it's the only way if
you're gonna do web development how you
not gonna know JavaScript it's like part
of the big three HTML CSS and JavaScript
like you need those so I'm not telling
people not to learn JavaScript but so be
honest with you guys like this is the
reality of things like there's a lot of
jobs for Ruby on Rails Ruby on Rails is
not dead it's something that even I
myself at some point almost thought
about it that's why I did my research
like a month and a half ago research
research research guys yeah and I mean
you can look at any major city you're
gonna find something very similar to it
okay so it's not just a thing where it's
like oh only in San Francisco this thing
happens notice all over the country I've
checked every major city out there and
it just happens the same way now there's
some city that you know nodejs might be
up by like five six jobs okay cool
that's fine
but it's the same thing as over here you
know the reason why I'm putting this is
like specifically because he's like yo
check I'm in start-up land
I'm disappointed as I mean startup
blandly bro I wouldn't start a plant to
man you know what I mean like we live in
the same area I mean I'm not in San
Francisco but I'm in New York City with
just literally you know you know I was
just in New York City I just recently
moved to Connecticut suburbs you know
what I mean but almost just in New York
City
so it's like literally like is the same
thing that's happening in New York now
there's so many people applying for
nodejs jobs because you gotta understand
anybody that knows JavaScript is
applying for them that's the truth even
people who are not even qualified to be
touching a node.js application people
are getting hired for it right so if you
look at something like Ruby on Rails
which has been tested and has been
proven and not only that that there's a
bunch of jobs out there like why
wouldn't you want to learn it
if you're a web developer like that's
why you sure you know really look into
it you know it's not just no js' it's
not just PHP it's not just groovy on
Rails or even that Nick I will say all
for those if you want to become a web
developer you should try to learn all
four of them right but I give people
options they decide which one they
wanted to stick with you know what I
mean like you decide hey you wanted to
know Jesus and you feel you got more
chances in your area do know Jes there
is an odious course there is a PHP
course there is a Ruby on Rails course
at some point there is going to be a
dotnet course now my job here is to give
you guys the options and give you the
things that really get you jobs you get
what I'm saying so yeah I just want to
leave you guys with this little video
cuz maybe tomorrow I'm not gonna be able
to post anything and I
I found it to be very interesting that
you know once again people post comments
and and stuff without doing the research
and I think it's very important that
before you even post anything open your
mouth to anything you should do a
research somehow you know and I hope in
this case stays as a subscriber this is
not getting him this is not putting him
out there this is me just like this
other things that people say online and
this is how you debunk it you know what
I mean you get what I'm saying like I'm
just saying like you know I mean that's
like saying hey man Bigfoot it's out
there and then you come out of nowhere
but I hey man that was a guy with a
monkey suit you get what I'm saying
so anyways man have fun man have fun
coding I love you guys man and yeah max
fading I hope you are just look look for
the research man look around
don't want nationwide research just take
your time do some nationwide research in
it's not just on theis on indeed calm
there's tae-suhk on this remote ok
that I or there's a there's a whole but
even in Larry jobs you see jobs for
Rubio rails like anywhere you go like
this jobs Rubio rails stack overflow
like a freaking up work like there's so
many jobs for like Ruby on Rails it's
not even funny so I was like when you
say hey man is dead it's like you might
as well talk to like the wall you know
what I mean like it just doesn't make
sense
like I'm no longer letting myself get
influenced by what other people say
unless I do the research you know what I
mean so yeah love you guys I'm out of
here
make sure you go to my website coding
phase comm currently we have you know
the Ruby course which is an amazing
course and they're from there we have
the Ruby on Rails course which is also
pretty amazing and you know me I
down topic star difficult and I make it
easy for you guys so yeah I'll see you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
