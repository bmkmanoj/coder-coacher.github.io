again coding face.com
your boy is backing out and did it again
guys today we're gonna talk about miss
opportunities as a web developer alright
guys so basically I'm gonna tell you a
little quick story about price was a
price line and me yeah so pretty much
I've been applied to to price line
probably like two years ago or a year
ago or something like that and for
whatever reason I don't know I guess
that was going through through the
resumes and finding people and looking
for people right and somehow they called
me up in January right around the
January 12 around there that they really
interested in you know and me and they
want me to come into the interview and
this just dying like loving what I'm
doing and
to be honest with you guys I missed the
boat I missed the Train
I missed the call right so I usually
give out my Google phone phone number so
most of the companies right and then
somehow I forgot that that phone number
was connected to my older phone so now
I'm going through my emails and I'm
searching a whole bunch of stuff right
and then I realized I'm my own way
Priceline called me up in January but
it's like what do I do I mean do I just
like do I call them back like what
it's February 22nd 2018 that was in
January 12 I mean whether I call back
but I hate you guys young you remember
me um you guys sent me an email and guy
called me up and I never responded back
to you guys so for me I feel like that's
already done now am I looking for a job
right now no I'm not um but I would take
if they would offer me the position at
Priceline right because Priceline is
doing a lot of cool stuff right they got
a whole bunch of companies on
booking.com
I think kayak they have Priceline calm
they have a whole bunch of them and I
think what is it the Priceline group if
you look at let's see stocks Priceline
yeah Priceline is one of the most
expensive stocks out there right and
it's one of the best companies out there
period
right and not only that that for this
opportunity
it wasn't the New York City offices
which I wouldn't want to work there
because it's like your their offices is
like right in the middle of New York
City which means is like you got a deal
with going to the train bumping into a
thousand people every single step that
you walk like I'm not internet right but
this was actually for the Priceline in
Norwalk Connecticut right so that would
have been nice
I'll be honest that would have been nice
it would have been pretty cool for my
program my resume and at the same time
it would have been a company that I
respect like I really like Priceline I
look into all the things that they do
you know like as far as like software
development and you know web development
and definitely I owned actually some
Priceline stocks so you know I don't
know it just it would have felt so good
to work there just because like I
believe in a company right I told you
guys before I'm not looking for a job
I'm not looking to work for anybody
right but the certain companies that I
would work for them because I respect
what they do and I enjoy their products
or you know like there's so many
different things that I love about them
right and I think it would have been
super dope for me to work with them
especially now that they actually Trent
transitioning from they have a lot of
nodejs in the backend a lot of Java but
now they transition into golang right
which would have been a great
opportunity for me to really be in the
field you know getting my skills up as a
go length developer I mean I've been
doing this for a while but this is the
challenge you know what I mean like for
me that would have been a challenge like
me going to a company into a PHP it's no
challenge me going to a company doing
nodejs is no longer a challenge the only
things that I concede that will be a
challenge for me will be to do either
game development or do golang right
Golding I'm not the best developer on it
I still feel like I still need more more
experience like building like real life
projects like being in a company not
just doing projects that I've built
before because it's like you already
built it before you know what I mean so
it's like you already know how
everything works and how everything's
gonna be but I want to get challenged by
somebody coming in and giving me a
project I'm like I've never done before
you get what I'm saying so I feel like I
would have had that at Priceline and it
really sucks
I'm disappointed myself that I didn't
look into my Google Voice I usually do
when I check it out I go through my
email but like I show you guys before he
goes to my gmail right my Joe Santos
Garcia it's like it's super spammy like
that whole email is like super spammy so
it's like sometimes you you miss things
like I have a whole bunch of like
different companies that send me stuff
to this email so it's like I miss things
man it really sucks that I missed this
opportunity so I just wanted to share
this with you guys because sometimes you
gotta be on top of your stuff man
you know like I'm trying for this
company like a year ago like this wasn't
like a week ago two weeks ago this was
like a year ago
and they call me up now like hey man are
you still interested and it's like what
do I do that I call him back a month
later like yes I'm interested I'm gonna
send the lady an email basically because
I don't want to burn the bridge but I
want to say hey man I just like I
totally owe
you know lost your email somewhere your
phone number came up in my Google or
phone voice whatever and like I'm sorry
but if if another opportunity comes up
in the future please keep me in mind and
give a rundown giving my resume again
and the whole shebang right yeah because
it will be really good to work at
Priceline and I believe they also have
different offices all over the world so
it's like Priceline offices
they have won any nor for nor work near
Norwalk Connecticut and then they have
one in New York City they have you know
half other ones I'm pretty sure they
have other ones and I think is Amsterdam
and from what I hear a lot of people get
to transfer between Amsterdam and here
so I'm pretty sure let me let me just
check rechecking live Priceline
Amsterdam sure
you
yeah they do have Amsterdam yeah I
thought I was bugging down like wait no
I'm not bugging out I know I know
somebody who went to Amsterdam another
developer that used to work in the same
company that I used to work with he
started working with Priceline and they
basically they flew him to Amsterdam so
he's actually a developer in Amsterdam
and another thing that's pretty
interesting talking about Europe in
companies guys you should definitely
start applying for jobs in Europe I'm
sorry for the people that are in Europe
right now and yeah keep telling me oh
it's hard to find a job guys
I just got an email from somebody that
they like ready to fly me out so proud
was it Prague you know Prague in France
for training it's like a two-week
training and then I could work remotely
if I want to I don't know if I'm gonna
take the offer
but like for those people that keep
saying like you know there's no jobs in
Europe like man there's a lot of jobs in
Europe man yeah I need to stop playing
you know sometimes people think like oh
it's only here in the US this isn't that
but it's like nah man like this job's
all over the world man I mean you're
sucks if you live in like third world
country if you live in Zimbabwe you live
in Tanzania you know what I mean like
yeah I understand but you're like guys
that live in Italy your guys are living
in Poland guys that live in in freaking
Colombia guys are living and Brazil guys
that live in I don't know freakin
Malaysia guys that live in freakin South
Korea send me emails like oh man there's
no jobs here maybe I should go to the US
as like bro why are those people trying
to hire us here in the u.s. is like this
jobs over there you're just not looking
for the right places right so yeah man I
just wanted to share this with you guys
cuz it's like you know one of those
situations where it's like man you know
you miss out on the opportunity
man so keep track of your emails keep
track of your phone numbers that you
give out to people and try to clean out
all that spam that you got like I gotta
clean up look like I got five thousand
three hundred sixty one emails like how
many opportunities are on this email
alone so it's like you know what I mean
so it's kind of crazy anyways guys so

just me sharing my my you know my
experience with this and yeah man like
and just to be clear out there man I'm
not really looking for a job I'm just
like I like to see what's out there what

swerving you know I'm not a type of dude
