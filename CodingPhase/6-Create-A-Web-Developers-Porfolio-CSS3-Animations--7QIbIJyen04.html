yeah alright guys so we're gonna do a
little animation I want this to have
like a hover effect when you go put your
mouse on top of it I want to basically
show something cool you know what I mean
so let's go back to this and let's say I
wanted to have something like this so
okay let's build this so inside about
this if we're gonna create let's try
with the first one first and then we
just copy it
all right now let's get this not this
one the RGB let's get this numbers just
133 165 204 all right that's this color
background RGB a and let's put this
thing in here say hi
let's say cane eyes on top of right now
I'm gonna see what box we hovered this
- Wallops 100%
now for this smoke this under here that
we hover on top of the box I want this
to move left to zero all right
yes oh it goes over now let's hide this
box here all right and let's stay
overflow:hidden see so now when I go on
top of it basically it shows that little
thing now I just work with a little bit
animations just do this transition you
see all 27 seconds
please see what happens session
showing up we have the transition wrong
you see see that little thingy but let's
change the color let's pick this right
so we got for what I'm copying is this
here we got 48 50 792 all right
you know also put comma and then we put
the opacity which is gonna be let's say
seven so now I'll show that and then
let's do something where I saw the hover
box we're going to create a little bit
sad the hover box we are going to put
three title whatever the same project
was
let's say a category design come in here
see how we have that let's clean that up
all the box
three
every time I just click command and r4 I
think the browser the windows is usually
window is ctrl R but for Mac is command
R and you basically refresh the page
well you can just come here press that
so whenever you do something different
on your code you basically come here
refresh the page make sure you save this
file and refresh it all right now let's
clean that up a little bit more okay
let's take this
okay we're gonna put this thing instead
of see how it's in the center just put
this to the left daddy
let's do okay five pixels on top 15
pixels to the left so top and right 35
no top and bottom 30 35 and laughing
right 15 so refresh now we're cleaning
it up now let's do text aligned to the
left yeah that's a little bit better but
I still still look better
now let's see what else why should he do
something else and I see we do opacity:0
and then on the hover box smooth this
backup capacity so now you see how fades
in fades out now we can actually what
else can we do to this now let's do that
okay let's take this let's bring this
code up let's take this now let's put it
inside of each div clean it up the way
how you clean it up like that and move
it to the right or the left
you press command and then you click
brackets are the brackets to the right
or brackets to the left the brackets are
the ones that are next to the letter P
all right guys
matter of fact let's darken this up a
little bit
where's our box
we'll see how cool that looks or we
could even do something instead I've
done it from the left we do it from tap
so matter fact bottle yeah I like that
better
and let's make that a little bit faster
so transition this is how basically how
fast the animation is gonna go you could
go and make this there's point five
seconds that means half of a second you
could actually go and put in three
seconds
and then it's gonna be super slow you
know you can put as long as you want it
but half a second is good now also tour
the side of the box let's put this
cursor which is your middle point that
this little thing is called the cursor
and let's call it pointer which now
gives us the little hand you see because
most people know that when you see the
little hand it means to click it all
right all right guys that's about it for
now
