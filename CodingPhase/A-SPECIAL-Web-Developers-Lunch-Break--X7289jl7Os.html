here man you guys can ask me anything I
will you know answer back so what is
left to do in coding phase calm
what is left everything think ok so
right now you guys want me to go into it
real quick all right you know what let's
go into it let's go into coding phase
calm so you guys can actually see oh
whoa yeah you guys guys to see what's
going on with my my website right now so
let's switch up right now I'm a my uh
website for my company right so we gonna
switch up we're gonna switch it up let
me see
and let's go into my website where it's
a main site all right so we got public
ok start server ok cool we starting it
up open this up here localhost
okay so coding phase comm what is left
right so technically right now you guys
who actually go on the website and
register right so that's farm that's
been our for a while I just haven't told
people but I might have to drop that
database later on so that's why I'm not
telling you guys to register now because
I'm not that data is gonna get lost
anyways because I'm still doing a lot of
changes so what's left from the website
so here remember tell you guys we have
channels right you guys are going to be
able to come in add a channel whenever
you guys want so you come here and say
hey I'm working on
I like Python right so you could come
here create Python say ah Python the
press right right currently right now
there's no file upload I haven't had the
time right
so you could pretty much come here and
say hey Python right I'm here images
whatever right get this image URL
oops get this image URL and go here put
the logo some me now is submitted
whatever let's say your name is James go
right and then games at gmail and then I
say okay you see the that's
as up up that's still having
being able to fix you know there's like
a whole bunch of stuff that I still
gotta fix so I say okay foreign key
constraint feels so torquey rolled on
the leaves can see update so I gotta fit
to fix this thing let me see something
oh please PR the setup CD called Eng
psyched and then PHP artisan migrate
good fresh SS lead alright so let's see
what's going on let's put this user 0 a
gmail okay so that's fine so I learned
to do migration on it so it should be
fine all right so you go come here let's
say you you want to add Python I
say Oh Python it's great right now let's
say we're the
I don't know some mate okay so it got
some MIDI then you know somebody I'm
gonna choose moderators and and people
who want to be able to to be in the back
asshole say okay okay cool so in the
admin section right come in here and say
okay channels view also depend on what
technology you added so you could add
anything so like let's say you like a
library from JavaScript let's say you
like I don't know something in Python or
a framework whatever it is no Jay yes
 Ruby on Rails whatever you want
to add then from there if I see it I
look at the name then from there I just
come and on Thank You Vic um then I just
come and actually just approve it right
so status approved so then technically
let me see you come here let me see
oops local holes in Haiti channels so
technically you can see it here but
seems like there's a lot of here
that it just gotta get fixed
like no matter what like it just gotta
get done you know cause like if I ask
something here and be like hole see qui
gonn whatever submit now comes channels
you see is not show enough so
there's something in there I don't know
there's like a lot of that I mean
to fix on the website and the only way
that's gonna get done is if I get a
chance like try got like a little break
from work
or something you know cuz all this
can get done by myself so right I could
probably do it on myself
if I had the time if I could just go in
at least a day of like you know two days
of the week at least five hours and I
could get the website done but it's just
like so much like I told you guys I
was going through database migration
creating a new website from our company
and then finally we just finished that
and now we're knocking out the
right and then from there what else I
got I left any of these days the little
baby's gonna come out and just I gotta
give time to that baby right so that's
where we are when it comes to the
website but hopefully before the end of
the summer the whole website is gonna be
done like you know even if I have to go
and pay other people to finish it for me
like I'm gonna get it done cuz it's like
I need this website like there's like
the bread and butter right here like
this website I know what this website
can do it I know what I can do with it
you know the ideas that are halfway so
you know that's the that's the man
wife you came through that's what I'm
saying oh I'm home ba I'm just saying
though che I'm ashamed I'm home ma long
yeah man so this thing a lot of on
the website that needs to get done but
the layouts and the designs is already
there the ideas that I have for it they
already here it's just I gotta take it
you know one page at a time and knock it
out you know and I said the user
authentication is done user rules is
done what else is left so then for me I
got finished the channels so the
channels you're gonna be able to post
and you know submit any channel that
people want you know they want to have
angular 4 or angular 7 gecko addict
right and then inside the channels
there's going to be different things
like somebody could come in let's say
you guys might find a good link for and
you're selling you bet okay I just found
a good article on angular 7 right future
proof whatever you put it up you
share it people get to vote on it people
that comment on it
people have to check it out right then
at the same time you can follow
different topics so topics are channel
so you can say hey I wanna follow this
channel I want to follow no js' I would
follow Python I want to follow um Ruby
on Rails so then your feet is gonna be
of just those those things and then it's
user generous so pretty much you guys
are in control I'm just giving you guys
option 2 where to post you know
something that's just you know
definitely mean or whatever programming
wise all right because that's for me
like that's one of the biggest problems
you can't find the right resources
online or the right blogs or the right
places so if I find something cool I can
share it with you and then not everybody
get to see it you know so you know
somebody might say hey that's
ready there is all whatever
 Cora
a whole bunch of different places but I
don't think there's gonna be a place
where it's gonna be specifically made
just for resources like ready you could
go and read it and it could be
somebody giving a long-ass speech about
how much they hate Ruby on Rails
or whatever or they say some dumb
you know hey a little cat kissed a
 dog and now it's popular so this
whole website is gonna be about just web
development in general programming in
general so yeah that's what we add you
know that's where all my my money is
gonna go to all my bread and butter
this is gonna be this that's where I'm
putting everything is I know what I
could do with that website I did it
before in other type of genres like I
did it with the music site I had a music
site which that millions
of views right so if I could do it with
that one I could do it with this and the
only difference is it's just a different
topics but your boy knows how to promote
 out here I know how to make
happen so yeah man if you guys follow me
ya got to get your boy I'm gonna take
care of you guys all right so let's do
this
let me see what everybody's saying on
the chat we are having without chance
check core emo is to move Joe I signed
up when you're gonna make a vlog channel
with Mama Joe and baby just um it's
coming one of these days man it's coming
for sure
let me see what else what else what else
what else what out Jerry what up I have
read of course when you do me that
teaches my will do B instead of my
sequel me as a phonetic beginner is that
okay writing to the game with my seat um
MongoDB is fine to start with you know
it doesn't really matter which one you
picked
of course there's more jobs for my
sequel but if you understand the
concepts of dealing with databases and
saving them to a database in and doing a
query to get a role from a core database
or whatever right if you get those
concepts then you're gonna be fine you
know that's what people care about
Macie so what else man in almost crazy
guys like I've been trying to get into
gaming man I've been trying again to
game development but I can't find the
right engine because I don't like unity
I really don't like unity um I'm not a
big fan of of c-sharp so I've been using
this thing called phaser Jas to make up
you know a couple of little games but
let's see man it is like right now I've
been doing a lot of web development is
like I'm not I'm not being challenged
you know it's like I'm not learning
anything new and what development uh
everything that I already know is the
same I reused for every other
language when I will say that I learned
from back in the days of no js' I
implemented into PHP and then from PHP
to Ruby on Rails from Ruby on Rails to
Python anything now is go whatever so is
like I'm not really learning anything
it's just I'm learning different syntax
but it's gonna be poor I'll be honest
with you guys so I'm trying to get into
something else man
man OpenGL man I mean that's fine but I
don't know how you got sort of pixie Jas
I hear that is pretty good too so I
might be jumping on that so I'm real
engine is good so it just I don't like
dinner with like c-sharp C++ or that
 plus I don't want to do like I
don't like the 3d gaming I wanna do like
2d games
ma let me see the Missy was poppin
let me see was poppin in the world of
online a fox though was voxel vÃ¤xjÃ¶
looks pretty how I was seeing this
I've heard of it
see see what's up
God baby mom's in the chat room yeah I
brought out baby moms to the chat room
yo Oh
let me see PI gaming I don't know
 Python for gaming I don't know
if I like that
do employers look down portfolios with
bootstrap being used instead of another
CSS grid no nobody's gonna look down or
not listen when you get hired people
care about speed a lot right so if they
know you know how to use bootstrap they
know you can prototype a website quick
all right
now the problem is if you don't know how
to do things on your own
don't use bootstrap because then when
you get hired when you get higher you're
going to be expected to be able to edit
things or create things on your own so
if you don't know how to do it manually
and you're like oh wait I gotta find
bootstrap I gotta find the full strap
way to do this then that's when you look
stupid but if you have your website
build on a bootstrap that's fine I'll
build everything run Buster and not
because I can't do it because if you
don't have the time and you got to
create something quick why wouldn't you
use a tool that's going to help you
finish it quicker
you
we're young
let me see a voxel I like box Oh
something looks pretty good box OD is
open source blocks out game building
toolkit come on work development seems
cool let me see what else what else
Thomas what up when that effect what up
the some gaming language called I or
something like that fast I have a harder
how many users can can a free server
hold before you need another one I don't
know it depends number fifteen years
those devs I my company just use one
strike on free section or he was writing
to me that that line yeah I see C++ what
I an unemployment help wanted
I never heard of who write I think it's
fine that you already know what you're
doing but you're just learning you
shouldn't rely on the framework exactly
Barbara yes let me see what else it's
only four hours an hour w2 to hive to
ask in New York City for ERJ yes alright
imma see 72 times 40 times let's say
four times four times twelve yes
that's extremely high to be asking I
mean I don't know
I'll be honest guys some people they
know how to gain the system some people
they look like they know what they're
doing when in reality they don't know
 alright if you go by my looks or
how somebody might come in these people
have worked with before that on
paperwork they seem like oh man this
person graduated from this school this
person did they
this person that that and you will think
like all their amazing developers and
the reality not really right so they'll
get pay a large amount of money but then
there's usually like one guy in a team
who really holds it down so everybody
else is getting paid because that I got
pretty much and a lot of times you might
just fall into a position like that you
might just say hey hired me for a
hundred thirty grand $138,000 and then
you might get hired you know but is it
likely that they're gonna hire you and
like you're a beginner I doubt it man I
gonna be honest one hundred thirty eight
thousand dollars for uh developer who is
not like a senior and was not a expert
at JavaScript is extremely high like
that's not gonna happen unless they just
giving out money in then next thing you
know in six months the company's gonna
go bankrupt anyways when you think about
language to learn you need to think
about what do you want to work on or
also what's in the man in you city
exactly
how can start a PHP I mean from what I
know isn't hacked like almost like a
deviation of like what PHP is so if you
know hack then pretty much you probably
know PHP already
man I'm sorry guys I don't have I mean a
half a Windows computer
this piece of here which cost me
like two thousand dollars is
actually a PC do I use it
no you see that a whole bunch of dust
because there's a piece of like I
don't use Windows guys like it's a piece
of and I'm trying to get rid of
that computer but that's the the other
thing about Windows like the resale
value you can't get nothing back for it
like I could come here and try to sell
this to somebody and I'm probably
gonna lose all my money selling me cuz I
want to get rid of it but somebody hit
me up online it was like yo I'll buy it
for you $800 I'm like I'm losing $1200
if I sell it for $100
all right and it's a piece of I
don't even turn it on Windows sucks guys
I'm sorry but it really sucks
you know like I feel bad because you
guys are are using Windows and some of
you guys don't have the option to to buy
you know buy a Windows boy but
suck Louise I'm telling you it's not
even a personal preference man it's just
a lot of people are conditioned to a
certain thing it's like if you don't
know about another another system or
another lifestyle whatever you want to
call it um it's like to you then she
sucks but for me I spent what like
20-something years not even so exactly
like 15 years on Windows and I know
every problem of every Windows
computer blue screen of death
 hacking a whole bunch of
very cold viruses
you can't download anything from
you
or bits or whatever because there's
always viruses on your and
your computer gets slow start
slowing down then from there on the hard
drives I don't know why every hard drive
I've ever bought from a Windows that I
put it onto a Windows computer for some
reason it blows up it becomes
 it doesn't matter if it's a Samson
evil SSD is a matter so your
Western page there's something in a
 system it just makes it into
shape and that's I'm not even lying to
you guys like this the truth
everything that Windows touches it
up that's my experience for me
now if you guys if you guys don't don't
want to admit it to to the fact that
 Windows is a piece of I'm
sorry that's on you guys but I'm only
telling the truth like it's really bad
like Windows is really bad
yeah I know that's why I'm saying yes I
can avoid a lot of on a Windows
computer but it still doesn't like guys
for web developers somebody who who does
this as a living at one point you guys
is gonna have to get a Mac computer it's
not what a lot of people think Oh Mac's
are for hipsters and Mac's are this and
that
no max are for professionals you like it
or not all right
some people have bought max because they
think is the status symbol with a bi oh
I got an iPhone it cost me $900 oh I got
a a MacBook that cost me $2,000
oh I gotta back from that coma
cost me $5,000 people use it as a symbol
to basically say oh I have money but
that's not the real reason why it was
created like if you go if you go and you
 and you check online on the
 history like Steve Jobs when he
started this whole he wanted to
make these different professionals even
the first I believe the first color a
computer was a Mac to my knowledge like
this has been around the first time that
they started using fonts different type
of fonts was for Mac computer like this
 has been around forever like
there's a reason it is made for
professionals like I don't know I'm
sorry guys
your windows is okay if you started like
you can start with windows but like for
me I'm not touching the windows like you
know I'm sorry like that's not what I do
I can't mess around with the windows I
hate the fact that I have to use this
shitty-ass windows keyboard so
tight because I haven't had the time to
order a keyboard for my Mac but it's
just like that man like trust me guys
I'm telling you believe me when I tell
you your life is so much easier
everything works
every type of development tool that you
could think of works perfectly on Mac
even look a lot like try to do
like Android development on on Windows
try to do like any type of
development on Windows do you have to go
through hoops and hoops and
loops installing this install that if I
can set up this set up that just to do
anything while Mac straight up
from the terminal you're fine
but you may think I'll be here long
enough guys being here for a while then
my lunch break is done I gotta get back
gotta get back to work kids got paid it
the bills nah man there's a final thing
guys this is the final thing I'm gonna
say Windows is not the worst in the
world right there's some Linux distros
are really bad but when it comes to web
development to the vitamin in general
for programming for doing stuff when
when it comes to design when it comes to
Photoshop when it comes to Final Cut Pro
like you can compare a Windows computer
which were made for offices there's a
big difference windows were made for
offices all right now max were made for
professionals professional designers
professional developers that's why it
was made for if you don't believe me
look it up I'll see you guys later all
right good talking to you guys you're a
little boy jump back at it again
man coding face.com all right I see you
later ah
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
