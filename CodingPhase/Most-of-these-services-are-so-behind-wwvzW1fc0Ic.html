back at it again man coating face.com
your boys backing out and did it again
guys listen one of the biggest problems
that boot camps have and a lot of
schools and and not only the schools but
also to like different places like you
know you got Pluralsight you got teen
treehouse cold school calm one of the
biggest problems that they have is the
fact that they always behind this
industry changes constantly so as i once
you think you you you learn something
it's like everybody sound to learn
something else so this happens all the
time guys so this is one of those things
where I don't know I mean what's the
answer to this right what would be the
answer to say in you know the solution
for something like this do they just
keep on reinventing the curriculum every
six months or what exactly do they do
you know what I mean like how can they
solve that problem because even you know
I was watching this guy what's his name
something engineer truth or something
like that when he was going to death
boot camp right and from what I saw I
think he won in 2016 and I see a burn to
the boot camp or maybe it was this
yellow room I don't know
I know it was between last year to this
year he went to deaf boot camp they they
basically gave him a free access to the
boot camp this and that and I said cool
let me see what he got
let me see what what exactly they
teaching him out there and for what I
saw it was a angular one and I'm like
wait what what angular one in 2016
they're like two years late you know
what I mean like why would you be
teaching angular one in 2016 you know
what I mean like angular 2 came out
react was out like why was somebody be
paying ten twenty thousand dollars for
your boot camp to learn something that's
outdated by the time they come out did I
even prepare you know what I mean like
they gave you some I guess some
experience to the backend with like
nodejs or something like that but guys
that's not that's not up to date you
know what I mean like they like so
behind in every boot camp that's out
there that's one of the main reasons why
they closed them down
people kind of starting to notice that
they're like wait you guys are teaching
me you Ruby on Rails but in jobs they
won't seen you developers for Ruby on
Rails that don't make no sense you know
I really like you guys teaching Ruby on
Rails but Ruby on Rails in reality so
it's on a decline it's going down
there's less and less new companies
starting their their stacks with Ruby on
Rails so why would you be still be
teaching them
you should be teaching something else
something more modern or something more
practical even a c-sharp boot camp is
better than Ruby on Rails boot camp
why because c-sharp you're never gonna
go wrong like this always gonna be a job
for a dotnet the developer out there
always because most of these companies
they trust Microsoft even though
Microsoft might not be the best in the
world but people think like oh my
crystals been around for 20 you know 20
30 years like of course we're gonna go
with Microsoft alright so this always
gonna be developers for that there's
always gonna be jobs for it so that's
like a major disadvantage that boot
camps have man like they're always
behind and you know team treehouse is
the same thing man like trust me I tried
every service out there you know I'm
like man why are they still talking
about you know like when angular came
out they wasn't even talking about
angular they were talking about backbone
I'm like wait what and then when react
came out they was just basically they
just took out a video for angular of
course for angular I was like wait what
and when nodejs
this is funny when no J has already had
like four years out they had just
started doing long video not even what
course it was more like a a walkthrough
of what Xpress is I was like yo I need
to get the hell out of here
I can't because I know this this new
stuff coming out and every time I go to
an interview they ask me about stuff
that insane tree house they don't have
they haven't even started talking about
it sometimes they do a blog before they
even do a course on it
like who cares if you do a blog do the
freaking videos that one freaking paying
you you know $25 a month I mean luckily
I was still going to college at that
time so I have our my student discount
which is something that's good about
teen tree house if you go to college you
could get a student discount which is
great but at the same time man like come
on man
step your game up
like that's one of those things that
that pisses me off man because you pay
for a premium but it's like you're so
behind
it's like Linda when Linda was around me
I think Linda's still around but I don't
know who goes to lynda.com right I think
everybody has already switched to
udemy.com
because it's just about a service you
know and like I said guys on my
description this a couple of courses
that I have from you to me that I
believe are the best works Perry you
know
but here like as far as I Linda that
comment it's crazy you know lynda.com is
is one of those websites where they have
courses from 2001 it's still promoting
it I went to the website and I saw a
video on the front page and I said 2002
October 2002 are you serious
you're telling me like I don't care some
people want say oh man you know it's
programming is like if it's a good cause
I got the fundamentals it's still gonna
be good 10 20 years from now I was like
that's super outdated you know I mean
like I saw a PHP quois on like PHP 3 or
something like that like we own PHP 7
there's so many new things that came out
like they still using like arrays
instead of using brackets they're using
mysteries and square brackets to using a
rain
the arraignment that to create an array
I'm like bro you don't have old that
shit damn man you know how old that
thing is every time I say any type of
curse I can't even see the S word I gave
me say the F word
nothing I get freaking bad but you know
me I don't edit none of my videos I'm
just trying to try to learn how to cut
it down and just be a professional out
here 9 days but yeah man I can't believe
it Linda you know like 2002 October come
on you can't do it
your boy like that
nor a lake
you've gotta give us the good stuff man
we paying you 2530 dollars give us the
good stuff man keep us updated higher
developers are in the industry don't
hire people that haven't been in the
industry in like over ten years you know
what I mean like there's people that I
see on Pluralsight with courses that
haven't touched how did they haven't
created a web application in over ten
years and they hear teaching about you
know best practices I mean this and that
and writing books and it's like you're
writing a book but you from Nevel I mean
you've worked before but you haven't
worked in like 10 15 years saying what
does your your advice mean it doesn't
mean anything because it's like you've
given me advice from 20 years ago you
know what I mean like that's how I feel
that's how I feel about a lot of things
in Batman I like to keep myself updated
I don't like to see things that you know
it's just outdated you know every six
months something new comes out and
worked available
programming in general no technology
keeps on going up another song is gonna
be like every two months like you gotta
keep up
so if you leave it to this third-party
services they're not gonna give you the
latest things they're gonna give you
something that's out dating something
that they consider safe something that
they could be like oh yeah angular one
yeah that's a safe that's a safe
framework to teach people even though
it's like four or five years old already
and basically all the new companies that
are going to give you a job are not
using it but hey you can start with
angular 1 and then from there on your
own time you learn react in it on your
own time you learn angular 4 it's like
no bro like I came here for a reason
teach me the good stuff don't tell me oh
I'm gonna teach you the basics charge
you $20,000 and then as I hate on your
own time learn the best things that's
artwork that's out there nah man I'm
paying twenty thousand dollars already
you should be teaching the latest things
you know so that's like one of the
things that I I had a problem with like
after seeing the whole thing from
engineer truth where he wants a death
boot camp I was like man that's kind of
ridiculous like it's like 2016 2017 and
they teaching him angular one you know
how crazy that sounds
so I was like oh no man this companies
they be so outdated man and it's it's
because they don't want to update their
the curriculums it's just like colleges
you know universities man the I remember
when I was going to school they were
like teaching C++ in computer science
I'm like okay this is cool but I know
there's barely any jobs out there for
C++ you know it's not like one of those
skills that every corner that you you
turn there's like oh yeah we're looking
for C++ developers so why are you
teaching it to me you know what I mean
that's how I feel
teach me the things that are going to
give me a job right away you know
prepare me for the world don't won't
leave me out here you know without no
knowledge and I'm going in in debt it's
like I'm starting my life in negative
you know it's like god I'm already
starting negative fifteen twenty
thousand dollars down more like even for
myself guys like right now if I was to
get myself into $15,000 $20,000 that
it's gonna take a couple of months for
me to pay that off you know so zinc you
know I could imagine somebody who was
like starting with nothing no money in
their pocket you know and then just be
like hey I'm just gonna go to a boot
camp and get myself in debt and I'm
gonna come out fifteen thousand dollars
down like and it's a lot of money it's
definitely a lot of money you can't just
be out here like that well especially
somebody comes in with you know I see
this all the time people come in with
like this you know this hunger of
learning and achieving new things and
they're like man they just want to you
know they want to get into the industry
they want to be able to create cool
stuff they have cool ideas that they
want to create but it's like the boot
camps and all this other services don't
prepare you
you know the worst thing is when you
sign up for something and then you got
to sign up for multiple other things
like if I sign up for team treehouse I
shouldn't have to go to freako camp I
shouldn't have to go to unity I
shouldn't have to go to coke Adam II
like I'm already paying you to teach me
these things and it's like people are
expecting you to learn something learn
the basics in their services and then
jump jump around and oh yeah don't worry
you wanted to learn how class is working
es6 oh no you can't learn that here
we're still in JavaScript five it I was
like go learn es6 on udemy and then oh
no you wanted to learn a little bit of
back in oh no you can't learn that here
you gotta go to co school.com
you wanna learn a little bit for the
shop oh you gotta go back to you to me
like you know we don't have that here
like what yes I guess I'm a different
type of person man I think that if I'm
paying for a service and the service is
supposed to be teaching me the latest
things things that is gonna guarantee me
to get a job don't teach me things that
are safe for you to teach these were the
things that I need all right I'll see
you guys later guys make sure you go
check out my website : face comm go
register man I have a whole bunch of
free courses there and I have some paid
courses but the good thing about it is
like I was saying I break it down the
things that you thought that was hard I
break it down pretty simple all right
I'll see you guys later back at it again
man listen make sure you subscribe and
make sure you like this video man by the
way if you want to know exactly what
courses I took to become a web developer
they right there in the description it's
no secret it's nothing crazy there's no
secret gift that I
it's just pretty much I took the courses
they're pretty cheap they're like $15
each on specials and just listen man
change your life change the lifestyle do
something fun and something cool that
you could call a career</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
