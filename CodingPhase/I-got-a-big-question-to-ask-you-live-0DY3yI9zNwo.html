right now see who else is in here
Harrison fam oh yeah man
so I was saying like I was just
wondering this um I'm not gonna say I'm
the best at phasing Jes I'm pretty sure
this probably thinks I haven't touched
yet but I'm pretty comfortable now right
so face of Jas is a framework it's a
library to create games and mobile games
for you know for the web for your phone
you know etc all right doing it with
just JavaScript I mean you know I wonder
who who will be interested you know this
what I've been working on like the past
few few months you know getting my
skills up and I was like ding I'm like
you know what man I'm pretty sure
somebody out there would like me to
break it down for them you know I mean
cuz so they don't have to go through the
whole headache that I went through to
learn this thing you know I wish there
was like somebody who gave me the
shortcuts which is what I'm about to
give you guys because it's like it
really sucks
when you learning some things like you
know and you have to go through the hard
way because there's really no tutorials
are good no video tutorials at all that
you could say hey I'm excited to watch
or like anything and like people are
selling books about it and I'm like bro
who sell books in 2017
you know what I mean like 2017 2018 like
I bought a book from the creator of face
of Jay s and I'm like man I gotta read
like whoo
nobody else has this in video format
like that's how I learned I don't learn
by reading you know but whatever so I
was thinking I'm like yo I'm gonna
create some courses but only if if you
guys are excited about it right you know
only if you guys will will really wanna
see it all right so I'm gonna show you a
little something so you know me I
already created came out with a starter
kit you know we're gonna get it trending
on get up
so um let me see me show my screen real
quick now I'm coming out a game I'm
making a game for the fam all right for
the fam and you know it got your boy
okay now all of this art it's me doing
it myself you know if I was to create a
course of course for you guys I will
create the art itself for you guys so
you already know you got your boy
yeah probably laughing rate I like you
okay go with the purple shirt of brown
pants yeah man I wanted to do it like
that like real funny stop it supposed to
be funny
um yeah so you got your boy
and Joe all right here all right gotcha
girl LV right here got baby Ethan right
here
now so dis the fam so pretty much it's a
game damn coming out but I'm just
creating the sprites for it right now
now let's go into this let's go into
facing j/s so we're gonna say MPM run
watch like all my other starter kits
well you guys should be used to this
right now
boys there's a couple of things that
we're fixing now there's like the most
simplest thing that you could do and
face it yes right so it would go running
out here yeah and you know of course I'm
gonna put in my sound effects sound
effects sound effects man I need some
water man I'm dry I've been recording so
many videos man today just a lot yeah so
I just drink some water oh yeah
now this is like a super basic this is
just to show the basics of like facing
KS right then now you come here and you
start going to the deep end you start
creating some cool stuff you know okay
I'll see what you're doing you got sunny
land you got pressed enter you got the
little thing tells you hey move with the
arrow keys jump with the spacebar got
audio okay okay Oh
oh man
oh no I suck all right there you go
now all of this is done in facing you
yes I messed up there you go
skills kid what you know about that Hey
look you know what that kid Oh
struggling the struggle is real and
there you go
all right I mean this thing yeah so it's
pretty cool man I mean all of this is
done with JavaScript now also too you
can create this for the phones all I see
are four six let's flip it I phone will
look like that bad boy Zico also change
the images to fit more better on an
iPhone 6
I was like a little preview for Android
now it's like you know two million games
you can come up with you know it's just
like what development right you get an
idea you learn the basics you learn how
to do things and then it's up to you and
your creativity you know so sky's the
limit you know what I mean so pretty
much I was like you know what let me ask
the people man before I even waste my
time and post it up on on here you know
and you know spend like seven eight
hours creating a course for it let me go
and ask the people like who here would
like to see a course on it
just leave the letter J you know leave
the letter J in the comments leave the
letter J on the chat room right now and
let's see you know me personally let me
see what other people are saying here
Joe jumped over the jump man you know a
small boy Kanye Kanye to the you know a
purple v-neck word well I think course
like this will really help you out I'm
reading too through the comments you
know so let me go back up let me see see
what people are
what I went out what up I'm reading
through everybody's comments seeing if
anybody has any questions or anything
that I see will be good for me to answer
yeah I was thinking about like doing
some phaser stuff man
cuz it's like at the same time it's like
there's not that many tutorials of
courses on it at all and I think it's a
really good way to learn JavaScript like
if you guys look at the code it's not
complicated at all it's just JavaScript
but it really helps you out to
understand like you know object-oriented
programming especially with JavaScript
so I think it will be great for you guys
now all the people that are struggling
with JavaScript man like Jason covert is
like Joe I'm still trying to give
another JavaScript under my belt
then on to node hope I'm not the only
one feeling this way but javascript is
pretty tough well I think JavaScript can
be tough in the beginning right once you
understand like the basic concepts you
should be fine like if we go to my
website and you follow the timeline
right
you're going to be pretty much good
because I think people make you know
make JavaScript more difficult than what
it needs to be and that's one other
reason why like I feel like I break it
down in the way that I break it down
because then you don't need to know
everything about JavaScript to be good
right
once you're good then as a you know a
really good developer you're gonna dive
deeper into JavaScript but for a
beginner you don't need to know
everything once you understand
everything that's the basics and how to
build warm you know web pages how to
manipulate the Dom you know how to do
animations and stuff like that then from
there the more advanced stuff you learn
it as you need it
you just don't be like hey I'm gonna go
in and become you know a JavaScript
master I wanna be the very best that
know whatever one JavaScript JavaScript
you know yo for a bit sometimes I'll
just be having fun guys but yeah you
know people come in like I'll look at my
video right now yeah I look retarded
moving my head like that
yo Pharrell but you gotta have you gotta
have fun man like javascript is easy
once you get over the fact of
programming right let's say you got to
think what think like this guy's in
JavaScript is very simple let's say you
have a variable a variable is basically
a space think of it like this a box that
you want to put something inside of me
hey you want to put your name inside
that box that's it put your name
variable a equals your name that's it
now a is equal to your name so wherever
you use a is actually meaning your name
that's it
why will you use a loop because you
don't want to write that same code
multiple times
right so you will write a loop that will
do it multiple times automatically
why will you use a function a function
is usually used whenever you want to use
a code and use it multiple times
later on you want to reuse it again
right if I wanted to add two numbers
right why would I do a plus B every
single time and write it down instead of
just saying hey I'm gonna create a
function that all I have to do is put in
two numbers on it and it adds it for me
and then gives me the total that's when
you use a function
that's a so that's if you know
understand those concepts you're good
let's say you understand programming
pretty much now as far as like when you
go into deeper stuff like objects think
of it you got to start from the
beginning you got to start with what's
the string what's the number was an
array and then from there you jump into
objects right so I mean these little
things if you go to my website Coney
face calm pretty much I'd go over all
those things in an easier way and I give
you little examples that will get you to
understand it then after that give you
some projects to see how the Dom will
work you know how to change things one
of the things that you always gonna use
for some reason this is how the internet
works you're always gonna be adding
classes and removing classes as a
developer that you're gonna be doing
that 24/7 all right that's it adding
class removing class if you're really
good with CSS you could do any animation
you could think of and then use
JavaScript to add the class of the
animation that's it that's important
that's JavaScript for web developer now
from there you gotta do the backend you
know back in it's more more stuff but
you don't need to worry about that until
you're more comfortable with JavaScript
you got to start building little
projects that will get you thinking like
a JavaScript developer but yeah you
should be alright man Barbara's like
then you draw all the sprites the ones
that I did for myself here for this game
not coming out with young eating that
one I definitely did it the other one no
that's like Chris brights that I got
from online but as
to do a blank oh yeah let me see reading
through everybody stuff time you guys
are writing a lot definitely in the
writing aloud I'm trying to catch up and
like read through every single one of
you guys yeah I will see you like a good
40 50 % its interested and seeing a
course on facing Jes and I think like
for you guys there's one thing that a
lot of people don't notice and like they
don't focus on like there's a lot of
jobs for guys who know animation with
JavaScript like a lot somebody I think
fainted or somebody asked me something
crazy today or he said like a crazy
comment it was like man you know I
haven't seen nobody get hired with just
HTML since 1999 and I'm like wait we
just hired and the last company I work
for we just hired somebody who all they
know is HTML and CSS so when you think
about it like yeah people get hired just
with that all the time like every single
day you know there's jobs out there guys
now let me see
like there's so many different jobs guys
like you could just become like if used
to say hey all I'm gonna do is Google
ads html5 ads like there's a job for you
alright and you can make a lot of money
if you say hey all I want to do is I
want to make games there's a job for you
right if you say hey all I'm gonna do is
just front-end and I don't want to touch
the back end there's a job for you if
you say hey all I want to do is edit
HTML there is a job for you there's
something called content editor that's
it that's what you have to know and you
gotta know basic English that's it guys
my first job was as a content editor I
didn't get hired as a quote unquote
developer until probably my second job
you know
this is something that people don't talk
about people think like hey your first
job is gonna be iGoogle
hey you're working at Google as a
developer guys it doesn't work like that
your first job is the first job that you
get you know what I mean like your first
job could be doing WordPress your first
job could be fixing eBay listings your
first job could be fixing Amazon
listenings
all of those things are gonna give you
skills and basically a little badge on
your shoulder or right there in your
chest where it says hey a company hire
me and they trusted me so now can you
please hire me as a mid-level developer
and give me a lot of money but that's
what it really does for you you know
what I mean that's what I did you know I
started from the bottom on it my story
doesn't start at a big salary my story
doesn't start at you know oh it's like
hey you're a developer now now my
stories
are they pretty much editing eBay stuff
like let's see if we can find I'm gonna
show you right now I think I showed you
guys before let me look let me add this
tool to my screen eeehm distribution let
me see put this together okay here you
go
let me see if I could find it let's see
if I could find a product that has my
work on it let me see let me try to go
into the store itself I'm trying to see
if I could find it maybe let's look it
down but there's like a whole bunch of
products that I did probably like in the
thousands or something like that and you
know what's funny like when I look back
on it like this guys they were like one
of the owners was cool and then the
other owner was just a whole like I
remember like he was about to get
married and he was like asking about you
know like different good areas like
where people live and I was just like a
worker there and the guy goes like he
goes like no he was like talking about
it and I was like telling him I was like
oh you
you definitely move to two why stone
like that's where I live is a really
good neighborhood he goes like you don't
live in white stone like because I was
like a low-low worker you know like I
was like working in the warehouse
editing all of this products and to me
it's hilarious now I mostly see full
item description here you go there you
go so this is my work this is my first
job guys I came in created this whole
thing kritis all of this stuff make it
look a little nice of course with time
this is super dated and this looks
horrible now but you know it's funny you
know what I mean looking back at it so
this was my first job
ZM distribution and every time I think
about that moment I was like man I
lasted there I think like maybe three
months three four months and it was
hilarious to me is that like I said one
of the owners who was pretty much like
he was like him he you know like one of
those people that their parents just
give him money it's like this a big
difference there was two owners two
partners that was one who had the money
to invest into that whole company who
was who was a able and then there was
another one which was super cool but you
could tell the a hole was just like they
gave him money he funded that project to
get that company going the other one was
the brains but the one that had the
money was just a whole like you know I'm
telling you right now like I was like
telling him he's like he was about to
get married I'm like oh just you should
move to like my name is why stone he was
like you don't live in why stone
I'm like bro like you don't know me from
a hole in the wall like in my head I was
like thinking I'm about to rock bottom
this dude
hit him right through a table some Shh
right but then I was like man this dude
is a clown man like there's people that
you know they just don't know where
you're gonna end up at all right so this
guy's they own this company right and in
total they make about at that time they
were making probably about like three
hundred four hundred thousand dollars
cash for each right because even though
a company might have a lot of sales but
you got to think about it let's say an
example all cameras cost $900 right 950
dollars right and you sent it for $980
how much profit you made all right you
start thinking about it like that you
only made thirty dollars in profit right
so they would have to split their money
between them so I mean when I went in
there I was just observing and watching
every time the type of person I go into
a business I keep it quiet my my my own
business keep keep quiet do what I do
but I don't really show what I do
I don't really show what I have here I
just keep it to myself
so that's how I was when I went in there
and I was like man this guy's just doing
it up and then I started doing the math
I was like wait they selling about two
three million dollars in in merchandise
leaving out of here with three hundred
thousand dollars each
they doing so much work working almost
24/7 to make 300 grand and now I'm
thinking in my head I'm like yo I'm
about to kill you I think you know what
I mean like you know I'm touching 140
160 you know this year and I'm thinking
in my head I'm like did I work that hard
like those guys were working for that's
300 grand I was like I mean I work a
maybe 20% of harness they were working I
was making there's a month of money but
in my hand I was like man when I look
back on it I was only getting like 3035
a year you know you guys do them
divide that by by 52 right and then and
then multiply that by 4 and then
multiply by 3 so that's how much I earn
in that job right almost nothing so but
when I think about it plus tax you know
taxes they take 25% almost of everything
New York state tax and federal tax but
that's one of those moments where you
never forget you know what I mean like
the certain people that you just never
forget you like man like yeah I was like
a very low wage worker in your company
but what made you think like I wouldn't
be able to live in Whitestone like
that's one thing that I take pride on
like you know my mom my mom you know we
was like we came from the bottom but
even though my mom work hard and me
freaking she worked taxi driving there a
whole bunch of stuff and like to get the
money to be able to support us but we
always live good like like good you know
what I mean like now in life I'm gonna
continue that trend
you know I will continue that trend for
my team our kids always gonna live good
so when that clan was like even live in
Whitestone it's like bro you don't know
me well yeah so going back to the story
to for you guys like man you guys got a
freaking you know so long as you get the
job it doesn't matter if it if it's a
freaking you know somebody told hey man
we got a job at a FedEx to pretty much
edit the HTML for FedEx who cares it's
20 bucks an hour you go in you do it for
two three months now that's a little
badge on your resume a little badge in
your shirt like hey I work for FedEx
nobody cares if he was a low-wage worker
at that moment with FedEx doing HTML
what people care about is like hey
somebody let you touch their HTML
website that's it
you know I mean so you guys sky's the
lid skies the there's no living sky is
not even a living the sky is there it's
like something and then we just keep
going to the sky past the sky we pass to
the universe until we get to dark matter
you know what I mean like there's no
limit for you man
once you have two skills you good well
yeah man I want to get back to crystal
Legman but the problem is that the
audience here is not advanced I'll be
honest the audience here is a lot of
beginners so I got a you know help them
grow so you know in a couple of months
even a year I could be like hey guys
remember crystal Lang when I was talking
about it you guys know the front end you
know the back end you got a job already
but let me elevate your mind and let's
work on crystal man that's when I'm a
doing right now it doesn't make sense
for me to do it you know I spend eight
eight ten hours you know and even when
you guys see like those videos that's
like eight 10 hours in of like content
like guys it's double that multiply that
about - right it's like 16 hours of work
right because in reality this things
that mess up sometimes the the hard
drives gets full I might be recording
like you know the same way how happens
with you guys like I might be here
talking to you guys and then there's no
audio that happens to me all the time
I'm like recording a tutorial and next
thing I know the audio is not playing
like right now can you guys see me I'm
scared right now
can you guys hear me right now like this
happens all the time it because it's
like I have disconnected my laptop so
every time I disconnect the laptop
and I'm moving around somewhere else
then like the audio interface and all of
the stuff is gets messed up I got a
reconnect it and make sure that the
browser makes sure that the the program
that I'm using to record they're using
the right microphone
if not then everything is messed up here
man
let me see what I'm gonna do another
portfolio review I think tomorrow
another one drops tomorrow morning I
have everything scheduled guys like a
lot of the videos that you might see
unless I'm doing it live like here with
you guys
they're probably scheduled you know
because most of my day is me recording
videos for coding phase comm and then
after that I have to go online check my
google adwords go online check Facebook
ads go online check emails help people
out that send me emails oh by the way
guys I sent out an email I don't know if
you guys are getting my emails check it
out man cuz there's a couple of you guys
that signed up and I guess you guys used
bank cards like you know your bank card
so what happens is because you use a
bank card you basically know because you
use a bank card there's certain
restrictions with charging it again
right like it lets you go through the
first time but then the second time like
you know on your second life that you
come in pretty much a lot of you guys to
your credit cards are getting not credit
cards your bank cards are getting
declined or a lot of you guys for some
reason you guys are using bank cards
with insufficient funds
and pretty much you have like a few days
before your service get cut sucks I know
right but um guys you guys gotta you
know if you really want to just like
wash your hands off it just by the the
yearly man
just be smart go by the yearly trust me
there's gonna be content here forever so
by the yearly for a whole year you get
that thing for $45 right now man
like I think I'm gonna do a video about
this tomorrow because a lot of people
you guys is gonna lose out on your
five-dollar specials right everybody
that's paying $5 a lot of them did the
cards are getting declined because they
either used a bank card or they have no
funds so it's like you love the content
you want to support me and at the same
time you don't want to lose that price
then just sign up for a yearly its $45
guys I'll be honest like that's like the
best choice in reality I lose because it
would be better for me if everybody
would pay $10 or $20 what the price is
really yet but what can I do nobody
really wants to pay that much so you
know at $45 that's not even half when I
think about it it's like let's say a
year let's say at the 50% rate right is
$10 times 12 is 120 right so that's a
$60 so I'm losing $15 every time that I
give the yearly because I do at 45 all
right so I don't know for for people
that's actually like such a good deal
man
like I'm telling you guys I've been
going to like a lot of people who create
courses and see what they doing and like
just so understand how they're pricing
things and I'm like man they charging
like $200 for course and then what they
do is like hey we're gonna charge you
$39 a month for like four or five months

comfortable like I got it in the bank

Johnny's Hospital in 1998 it says here
it was 50 bucks
now it's $2,000 we would take $800 from
you today and we could do a payment plan
there's people that fall for that
there's people that they go and they'll
do a little payment plan they'll give
him $800 of damn mm damn boy I gotta
give him something right before that
interest still keep going up they pay
$800 right and listen you go back to
that same company as they sorry these
numbers I service
and then you try to find out who was you
know Johnny's new freakin mutual as I
got a fake company that they created for
one day you know man let me see next day
you go in you're going like oh man I'm
trying to find I find Johnny's mutual
you know I basically gave you guys $100
and when I go to the office this is what
I mean empty that's it boy you got debt
it you know they got you that's it
that's when people in the back you know
if you listen closely to the phone and
you go like this and you're like soon as
you give that credit card you hear
somewhere in the back daddy like it's
like a little echo you got to put the
phone real close you know you will hear
it in the background they got that guy
that retarded guy just in the back body
$800 got him you know man that's why was
like yo sorry guys I'm sorry you know
sometimes I I fall into this this funny
trap was like yo listen bro Nigerians be
like I'm only 19 but a lonely night
thing but I i'ma stop stop that's it
let's get back to this let's come back
in there is a serious Channel
if you didn't know so because this is a
serious channel we're gonna hit you with
the serious voice and you know for you
know for $10 a month you cool get all of
this
more you know and a little side of Casey
$10 a month coding face.com we here we
live we chillin we had a good time you
know it seems like only 40% of the
people want to get a face at JS course
which means I might do it I might not do
it I'm a flipper coin honey I'm gonna
let Jesus drive to the car on this right
Jesus drive the wheel on this one I may
just be like yo go ahead oh my name
Matt Damon oh right so we don't know if
we're gonna do a course on on face of
Jess personally me I would love to
because this is dope man like you guys
you know this one thing that I'm really
big on and I always keep telling you
guys I'm gonna teach you how to code I'm
gonna teach you how to get a job but I'm
also gonna teach you the exit plan I
don't want everybody here working for
somebody else when you have a skill that
you can build your own business and
build your own money make your own money
right why would I tell you hey just be a
pawn out here just work for somebody
right it's great sometimes you think
about element I'll be making $100,000
yeah you're making $100,000 but you'll
be making that next person fifty million
dollars alright and when you think about
it like that you're like wait I'm the
one doing the work I'm doing creating
this why should I make him fifty million
dollars when I could make that myself
right you know so I'm always gonna give
you guys the exit plan and try to help
you guys out you know what I mean so
this is one of those ways where I could
say hey man if you guys look it up see
how much money this game developers out
there like literally you can come out
with the stupidest game in the world and
if you know how to market it you know
sell it again but I hey I just created
this game super simple HTML CSS works on
Android works on iOS somebody sent me uh
information that you could actually use
this for ps4 and Xbox 360
I don't know about the Xbox one but I'm
pretty sure it says it's box 360 so if
you could go four three six they
probably have something for the Xbox one
right
it is a pretty simple game nothing crazy
nothing out of this world that's it
we put this online put this on on the
Android store you know make passive
income you know $100 $200 in your pocket
extra it's not gonna hurt you right
that's like money to drink money to go
out money to hang out with your friends
I'm all about the passive income I don't
know if people were internet I'm
thinking about either creating an e
channel or creating on your section and
this website cuz I feel like nobody
talks about this how to make money as a
developer with passive income no meaning
like money that's just generating like
let's say right now if you guys have a
bangin Facebook like this a whole bunch
of games there's a whole bunch of little
apps like hey crap my my image hey put
this this glasses on top of my image
little things that you could do with
HTML CSS and JavaScript right and guys
are making a killing from the
advertising guys are making a killing
from from money that's you know from
people buying into things like hey could
you put those glasses on my on my face
for $0.99 you know what I mean
when you think about it is like yo what
people make money with this so I'm
thinking about creating a session a
section about that because you know I
also was like I want you guys to get
jobs but that's not where I want you
guys to be doing for five 10 20 years I
want you guys to go in get the things
that you need get the skills that you
need and then be able to become
entrepreneurs and start making your own
money start creating your own apps find
out you know do the research and find
out a type of service that people really
need you know what I mean so Anton Koch
says oh that's a good question too so if
I buy one course is it for life or
monthly payment yes it's for life
all right you like let's say right now
you want to get the html/css course
that's a you own it for life that's
yours I'm also thinking about doing this
that if you buy on my website I'm gonna
give you the code for the udemy course
to like let's say if you buy a course on
my website right I'm gonna give you the
code that you could add it to your you
to me account so pretty much you could
go to you to me and get it for free
right cuz you already pay for it so you
pretty much owning every platform out
there so I'm setting that up now for the
people that that buy the courses and
I'll be honest it's not that many people
because you know doing a
subscription-based to be honest I shot
myself on the foot because in reality I
could have probably for as many people
that signed up to the site I could have
probably made way more money by just
selling it on you to me you know the
people from you to me they broke it down
for me I actually got a meeting with
them in like two days from there oh no
tomorrow because it's already Wednesday
so tomorrow Thursday I got a meeting way
when other girls from
me and they pretty much they broke it
down for me that like hey how many
people you're getting on your website
how many people signing up this this and
that
and they're like right now you could
have probably made about ten times as
much as he made this month if you would
have sold it on you to me plus the fact
that you would a guy in all those sales
and that would have made your course
trending on the website so then the
people that don't know you would have
had you your course and they would have
been like oh this course is trending so
let's buy that one so pretty much I shot
myself in the foot but that's why I said
hey guys this is my gift to you guys
alright you know whatever who cares you
live and you learn
um but at the same time it's like if you
know if you support the channel man and
you support the channel right $5 $10
whatever it is I appreciate it and I
think the fact that you get the courses
you get every course that I make you
know I'm doing a lot of work guys I
actually work more now than when I was
working full-time and I'm making fifteen
percent less then I was then I was when
I was working full-time for a company
but at the same time I'm happier I'm
happy I get to hang out with you guys I
get to create new content I get to learn
more right so I'm really enjoying this
but I really I hope you guys continue
supporting me supporting the channel man
like I'm all about you know just try to
live at the minimum before I used to
think man I wanna you know I wanna ride
around with a crazy car you know get
some crazy chains guys I already did all
of that stuff you know so I burned that
out of my system I'm like okay cool
now all I care about is just taking care
of my family having them to be happy in
a few days or yeah probably a few days a
couple of weeks
having the babies or baptism baptism
yeah baptism pretty much and that's it
it's like little things like that I'm
happy I have enough to be able to
support my family I have enough to take
care of them I'm not looking so good I
hear I have money to burn now it's just
taking care of family that's about it
man plus there's an investment man I
feel like you know me helping you guys
out me giving you guys so much content
at such a small price in the long term
helps me out because this is
word-of-mouth right this is an
investment I'm doing on you guys when
you guys really start getting in this
industry start getting these jobs when
people ask you hey what do you do to
become a developer you know somebody
already might hit you up like oh you
know somebody sees a question how do you
guys know any good resources that you
got I could check out one of you guys
will probably be like hey go check out
this guy coding phase car the long-term
that's gonna be so much better for me
you know because it's like I have this
community where now the more I help you
guys the more better is gonna be for me
and for you guys in the long term right
I want you guys to succeed I want you
guys you guys are like my first my first
batch of like subscribers right yeah my
first 10,000 subscribers like this
channels gonna blow up and especially
once I get that new studio It's A Wrap
and like I'm talking about legit cameras
I'm talking like it backdrops talking
about real content I'm gonna have a
studio where people you guys are gonna
be free to come in whenever you want you
know come check out how we do coding
phase com come hang out we do live
videos like I'm doing a big man like
that's what I was like saying the other
day I'm like man I wish I would have
like if I would have been comfortable
how I am comfortable now cuz when I was
doing this five years ago
I was just like you guys right I was
just like learning how to code learning
how to get out there learning how to get
a job how to learn all the skills that I
have now but I wasn't comfortable so I
wouldn't have been able to create a
channel like this back then cuz what the
hell I would have been like other
youtubers here who is clear like Dana
like legit developers yet or like they
start giving you advice on things that
it just sounds like super fake and you
people notice that people be like oh
this guy's fake all this guy don't know
what he's talking about all this person
you know it's like they barely got a job
right now like people could notice
though those things so that's how I
would have looked if I woulda came in
five years ago so now you know I look
look at it I'm like man if I would have
been where I'm at now five years ago I
would have had like a crazy following by
now you know what I mean
but what's cool about this is that five
years from now this channels gonna be
crazy like you know all this work that
I'm doing and all these hours that I'm
putting in to create all this courses
it's just like what I said to you guys
it's passive income like those courses
are always gonna be there those courses
are always gonna have people signing up
and always gonna have people buying into
the courses because their their courses
that everybody needs you know HTML CSS
is not gonna go nowhere javascript is
not gonna go nowhere react it's not
gonna go nowhere all the basic stuff is
gonna be there like I'm thinking in my
head a year from now this is gonna be
like 30 40 courses right like there's
guys on udemy making half a million
dollars a year we're like three courses
right like was this guy's name Steven
Grider right not Steven Greta awesome
crowd I got a lot of courses or coal
steel coal steel got a lot of courses
cotton Nala he got three courses right
three
or two courses that he created and
that's all he need right because what he
did was he took a whole bunch of courses
and put it into one right if at some
moment a year from now say hey I want to
take all my basic courses and put into
one on udemy guys we're talking about
like forty sixty hours of course content
you know for people for like ten twenty
bucks
you know by the end of the year you know
it's like that's gonna be crazy that's
crazy passive income you know what I
mean so that's what all of I'm about
right now man it's the long term I don't
care the short term I don't care about
you know I thought of people you didn't
mean yeah I could make a lot if I just
put put this out there on you to me just
directly if I was like they were trying
to convince me to like leave my website
and just post on them exclusively and
then they're like oh we'll we'll give
you a better a better cut off of like
like you know constant I think the way
how they do it 50 percent 50 percent for
for them 50 percent for the person who
creates the course now if they use your
coupon code you get 97 percent of the
whole course and they get 3 percent but
if somebody comes in you know if I
create a course right and you guys go
see somebody another youtuber here right
and you click on their links if you come
to my my link not smiling if you come to
my my channel on you to me and you buy a
course through there automatically out
of ten dollars I only make three dollars
because fifty percent is to two stupid
udemy and then 25 percent is to the
affiliate and then the other 25 percent
is to me so I'm making like three
dollars sounds like that sounds crazy I
mean that's almost what I'm making now
Trung a lot of people's like yeah I make
3 something 3 3 45 from like the people
that
five dollars a month but passive income
it's like man that's the future kids
well that's what you guys want to be
doing I'm not saying you guys gotta be
seven coins you guys gotta be creating
courses there's so many different ways
man and like I'm I'm pretty much jumping
on all of them like I got the courses I
got other websites that make money on
the low I'm not gonna throw them out
here because those that's like side
projects I don't want to show show them
here to this website to this audience I
got a couple of apps on or Facebook you
know generating small amount of dollars
like you know fifteen dollars like this
one one app that's so stupid on Facebook
that I have that it generates somehow
you know out of thousands and thousands
of people it generates like nine dollars
a month not nine thousand off nine
dollars a day but then all that money
start adding up so I got three of them
there so in total just for Facebook
along it's like forty fifty dollars a
day that I'm making like stupid ads like
little things that that people want to
have like you know create an image I
have one that's done like create an
image with a pixel type font like you
could download the font for free but to
create it through Facebook people pay
you know it's like 99 cents and there's
like thousands and thousands of people
see it and it's like out of those
thousands of people only like 0.001 buys
into it but it adds up you know so
that's where the future is at kids
creating passive income you know you
know maybe I'm talking I'm trying to
give you guys game you know a lot of
people here they here because they want
to learn code
strictly you know sometimes
it's hard you know sometimes it's like I
want to give you guys everything I want
to give you guys like my whole brain all
the things that I've learned over my
whole life like I know so much things
and I want to give you guys everything
but you know it's crazy I don't know I
don't know if people would even care
about that type of can't you know yeah
three bucks from you to me man that's
why it depends on the depends on on like
if somebody clicked through an affiliate
so like let's say an example you guys go
in and you're going click you watch
let's say an example whoever whoever the
hell has a course on their description
right a lot of people took that 90
percent of the people here who are doing
that they started going to after me
right so and when I first did it it was
just because I want people keep asking
me which courses like this and that so I
said okay do it and then somebody told
me hey you could make some money from
the Philly it sounds like a word
so the courses that took people gonna
want to use anyways so I'll put a link
the link but yeah so out of that you
make 25% so if a course is ten dollars
you make two dollars and fifty cents all
right
but in the long term you know it starts
adding up now for for you to me for me
now as a creator content creator and you
to me I make ninety seven percent if you
guys use my link but the problem with
that is that you gotta use my link and
you gotta use my coupon which is
ridiculous
like nobody does that right so that's
the only way now if you guys come in
from let's say Johnny Johnny programmer
description and you click on it and then
you go to you two mean you search Joe
Santos

okay okay I get that I'm missing yeah I
feel sometimes I feel I don't even want
to use credit cards I feel like I just
paid like $2,000 and like literally in
two days it's already back up to like
886 dollars like that's ridiculous
like it's like a never-ending cycle like
where where do these charges be coming
from like I feel like every time I step
out I don't move out to be honest with
you guys I don't even want to go outside
every time I go outside it's like 300
400 dollars literally I don't want to go
outside someone girl I'm like you I
don't want to go outside every time we
go outside it's 300 400 dollars gone for
no reason I don't want to go to no malls
I don't want to go to like anything I
gets really ridiculous and then freakin
Citibank just comes in and say oh shoot
you got like I just paid it off like the
whole the whole statement and they're
like oh shoot we got you for half an
hour in so it's like there was like I
guess order the the charges went in
right before it hit twelve o'clock today
so they're like okay I got you even
though all this stuff falls into the
statement for today until next month
they came in and there was
basically get all the charges before two
o'clock they put them in somehow charges
that was supposed to show up tomorrow
they put it in yesterday 11:30
they put all the charges and put in 886
dollars in just to be able to be like
we're gonna eat off you can you're gonna
have to pay a $20 fee for this freaking
credit card yeah it's ridiculous man
like the way how the game works may not
for real
listen every time I step outside like to
200 to 400 dollars every single time I
haven't seen since I don't know for like
the past three months every time I go
outside I'm looking at $200 minimum
every time I go outside I don't want to
go outside or more like I want to take
some time off from going outside like I
want to stay in my house don't invite me
to anything don't tell me about no baby
showers don't tell me about no
get-togethers
don't tell me about family situations
don't tell me about family invitations
every time I step outside I'm looking at
$200 minimum that's ridiculous
by size match about the lady boys now

thinking about one of like most extreme
porn things that you could get caught
with and be like oh my god is so
embarrassing like I don't need to be
watching that I got a wifey out here man

Barbara calm down yeah yeah for real man
I'm not even lying I'm lying I'm looking
at my statements right now every single
time I go outside I'm looking at 200
$300 the minimum $200 every single time
I've gone outside for the past month and
it's like I keep paying the credit card
off I'm like okay cool I just paid it
I'm not using it then we go outside use
it again
okay pay it again at the end of the week
then we use it again there's a man I
don't want to keep paying for this
because then it's like if you mess up
once they'll hit you with a fee of like
you know 20 bucks like and somebody's
probably there Joe start complaining
about 20 bucks nah man 20 bucks is 20
bucks man 20 bucks that's like that's
like cool right there and that's I could
eat with that you know I could buy three
meats with that well you know that 20

all messed up that's how I am on the
type of person if I drink I can't stop
drinking
heyyo Philippe trying to get that you

I've been peeping it Philippe trying to
get that man people have tried with
Barbara Philippe lots of people have
tried not many have succeeded let's see
if it happens man listen you got to
invite two to this Court that's a start
you know that's how it starts man next
thing you know it's a Skype call next
thing you know we out here seeing
Philippe sending twenty thousand dollars
to the UK and then we find out Barbara
is a guy named Ramon we find out we find
out is the real Barbara yeah we find out
the real bar where his name is James and
he's only 19 you gotta be careful man
you gotta be careful out here the
internet man I need to go to sleep guys
stop making me laugh man
that's why I can't be on the live videos
man live videos are dangerous for me
because my videos is like I'll be
laughing I'll be enjoying myself I'd be
cursing it's like right now we just did
two hours we made no money out of little
kids we have fun and then I gotta go to
my girl like hey I just spent two hours
we was doing real productive stuff you
know and I just been messing around by
science magic thank you I appreciate it
I hope you know anything that I can help
you out let me know you know I want
everybody to sign up man listen I don't
even care if we just need 10 we need
1000 people 1000 people know you people
we're almost there we're almost there
I feel like I got about 800 lawyer
people that support the channel but we
need 200 more people that's it you know
you're gonna get everything out of me
man
even if you come in you know like
somebody there's somebody in the chat
room that not a charm on the website who
keeps saying like Joe can you please
make the videos downloadable and I'm
like bro if I put this if I put this
online man and I put downloadable man
this thing is gonna be old the Pirate
Bay the next day like in two seconds man
like there goes my my freaking website
I'm some coke says I'm llama sober and I
say so poor Aveda sauce is done yeah nah
man yeah you get access for my
man pretty much and not only that I like
I told you guys if you buy a course like
an individual course cuz right now you
signed up to the website right you get
in a whatever price you get it right
monthly the moment you you stop paying
the monthly that's it you don't have
access to it but if you say hey I want
to buy a course then that course is
yours so you know what I mean like you
gotta always gonna be able to when you
log in you see that course on your
account so it's a it's a good deal and
then on top of that I'm gonna give I'm
gonna start maybe tomorrow I'm gonna
start giving out the free coupon codes
for you to me so that people that buy
the courses individually on my website
you're gonna have two courses on
udemy.com cuz I know a lot of people be
like man you know it's like I don't know
what if your website goes down or
something it's like I paid for the
course and I want to come back to a year
from now and I was like you're right if
you feel more comfortable to have on
udemy you can have a new to me too you
know so yeah bitesize thank you I really
appreciate it see that's one of the
reasons why I think the subscription
works better because it makes sense I
think if you support me you you like my
content you know what I'm giving you you
know breaking down topics started
difficult and making them easy and at
the same time it's like you have
somebody that's there for you throughout
your journey then the subscription is
the best thing cause it's like when you
buy a course from you to me it's like
hey you could leave a comment and it's
like you don't know who the hell is out
there it's like cold steel's course
right he's a great guy but at the same
time it's like damn it's like am I
really talking to Costilla no are you
talking to you know five five guys who
random guys that you don't even know
where they came from you know somebody
told me today like hey why don't you do
a review about
new Cold Steel course and I'm like I
don't know if I would tell people to buy
that course because that core system
makes version of like five different
developers teaching like a whole bunch
of different topics in like it's not
consistent to me so that's why I haven't
told people to buy that course yet I
gotta go through it again and like see
it again you know I mean cuz it's like
when I first told you hey guys
I took cold Steel's what developers boot
camp and that worked for me
that's because I really worked for me
but the whole course is cold steel all
right the new course is like cold steel
and friends it's like spider-man and his
 oh god frickin cursed man
spider-man is friends right so I
didn't wanna curse every time I occurs
they flagged my videos man don't make me
curse guys yeah what ya call seals
definitely god man he's legit he's Lee
Jae Hee
I think in in one sense like he knows
what he's doing he took like almost a
year to do just that one course you know
he took almost a year to create that one
course but look at that he he makes
about like two million dollars a year
right and he has enough to pay those
other guys to help out like probably 30
grand each to be there working remotely
you know what I mean so he's doing good
you know those sort of people I look up
to that's why I was like for bite-size
we just got here a few months ago like
people on YouTube were like oh man
creaking you know Joe is like you know
Joe is competition and this and that and
I'm like people don't even understand
that I'm not nobody's competition from
the older developers down here in
YouTube I'm not their competition
because we're now in the same lane we're
not doing the same things we
don't have the same goals like I'm not
looking to have a million subscribers
like I don't care about that I want a
dowsing lawyer subscribers that's it I
want you know a good 50,000 subscribers
that could say hey there's are people
that would I drop a video or thirty
thousand of them show up right you know
most of these guys they they do those
guys that have a hundred thousand
subscribers that do a live video they
don't even get past 15 20 people on the
live chat and I look at everybody I'm
like okay this or disconnect you know
