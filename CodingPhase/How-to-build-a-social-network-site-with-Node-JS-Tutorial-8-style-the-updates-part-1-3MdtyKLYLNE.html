continue styling this up we did the HTML
now it's time to bring it to life okay
so let's get started let's go to the
main de SCSS okay now we have to create
a new section for this or what do we
have here so we got the updates all
right so we got the update and we got
the updates container I'm gonna make
this into an ID so this say updates
we got owed a container contain you know
we're gonna say max with 600 pixels wave
100% we're going to say margin:0 auto
save that
refresh this there you go okay make sure
you have everything open as far as like
the things that you need you need to
have your server on so pretty much go
yarn and run watch a server you also
need to have your yarn run watch okay
run that up
all that's complete then you're good
you're ready to go so go to localhost
3000 okay
and there you go so everything is in
order how we want it now let's continue
let's look at the image okay so first of
all we're gonna start with this section
here okay so we gotta get a user image
right there so for now I'm just gonna
take the same image that we used before
so I'm gonna do a little quick search
okay
copy this
it's pretty much everything that we need
so I'm gonna copy this floor okay come
back down
so over here two updates says update
container let me see what's the name of
the section we got up the container out
there info okay let me close this and
close this so let's open this up so we
got the author info that's where we work
in it so up the container of the are was
it alter info and then we got user image
paste that in
okay now refresh this let's see what's
going on with this thing
okay so usually
image we gotta make this into a
display:inline-block okay
and the
cool now let's add a link to this or
let's see H ref just putting hashtag for
now
okay there you go so when you click
there it'll take us to the user profile
all right cool now next thing that we
want to do let me see
we want to make this
let's say display flex so let's do that
now so all their info let's make a
display flex okay now we have everything
like that let's make this okay we have
display flex say a line items center
justify content center let's see what
that does for us okay that's entering in
the middle that's not really what we
want so we're gonna take this copy it
delete this from here and we're gonna
come right below the user image we're
gonna start another class which is going
to be for c-diff and for put yeah div
info okay the diff info right save that
so see class info sorry
so info we're gonna come here paste this
in and there you go so what that does is
it just centers this right in the middle
of the image okay now we
make the the fonts smaller so we're
gonna do this we're gonna say font size
font size we're gonna say 0.8 Ram
yeah that's fine point a trim just a
point a trim and then we're gonna say
the anchor links that's inside of that
info class we're going to make them
color H text and
we're also going to see
text-decoration:none and that's to
remove the little on the line that we
have right now like we don't want that
so save that as you can see there you go
now let's say font-weight let's say 700
okay
that's fine now we also want to say
margin 15 pixels a zero top and bottom
okay so on James doe shared the story
let's make it a little bit less than
that so let's say ten
you
okay now
we want to change the color of the info
so we want to say something like this
color we want to be p text okay
all right think that's fine because it
gives us the the chance to actually have
space between them so let's say James
still shared the story so if they click
the story I'll take them to all the
stories
James stow it will take them to the
profile okay so that's fine all right
let me see what else now we got a jump
into the next section which is the image
here so let's go into this updates let's
close up the author info because we're
done with that now we're working on the
div class media okay so here we're gonna
come in and basically we're gonna create
a new div it's gonna be called class and
whatever the media is so this was gonna
be our image all right save that
now we've got to come here I'm gonna
copy everything that we already did on
the user image okay
and copy all of this alright now let me
close this we got the info all right so
right below along
below order info so right below out the
info give me one second thing up press
ctrl-z so many things
let me see me save that everything is
working okay so we got
info now the next thing is right below
that we want to add media and for the
media we're going to sing like this then
we're gonna do
image and then here we're gonna paste
this okay that's fine
instead of doing it like that what we're
gonna do is we're going to basically say
height 300 pixels with 100% now the
border rate is we're gonna remove that
okay so for here we're gonna come in and
basically do something like this what we
see see
with 100% and then the media section is
going to be
let's say position relative position
relative and then we're gonna say let me
try doing this i'ma say
position:absolute top:0 left:0 okay
top:0 left:0 right:0 and which is gonna
say negative fifty pixels and negative
fifty pixels
you
okay so this is same it's zero you got
to put in a height
let me see so we got this
you
okay
I'm trying to figure it out because what
I wanna do is I wanna have this to be
like this right so as you guys can see
the container oh okay perfect
I know what to do I just figure it out
because technically this this element
needs to be bigger than thing everything
else right and then this is like a
couple of pixels in so it's like 15
pixels in so now I just figure it out
okay so what we're going to do is we're
going to basically say over here for the
author out there info we're gonna say
padding 15 pixels alright because we add
in 15 pixels is gonna end up looking
like this but we don't want that to
happen so what we're gonna do is at the
top since we want this to be a 600 pixel
maximum wave but we're adding 15 pixels
for padding let's make this 60 is 630
okay so we got 630 and now everything is
aligned exactly how we want it and then
we're gonna do that so if max width is
630 we're saying padding is 15 pixels
okay so we add in that 15 pixels there
then let me see oh there
fine over here for this section for the
media we're removing this we don't eat
this we don't need that at all
remove this okay save that all right now
what we're gonna do is we're gonna say
border-radius let's say five pixels
okay so five pixels that's fine
now the next
we want to do we're gonna do box shadow
so box shadow generator CSS generator
now what we want to do is we want to
give this shadow down here see that so
to do that we're gonna come here get
this like sorter sort of like blue but
not really it's like a blue grayish okay
then we're gonna come here we're gonna
say zero zero four now we're gonna say
spread and I move this down okay make
this smaller now there you go now we
come
a little bit vertically like that okay
so I'm gonna take this so we can see how
it looks okay
paste out here okay and let's see how
that looks
okay cool now for this we're gonna do a
margin bottom same margin bottom say 50
pixels
okay now
yeah that's pretty much what we wanted
now this I think I can move it up a
little bit more it's a little bit too
high yeah and there you go so take this
we're gonna paste it here
let me see
now it's a little bit too high let's
bring it and bring this down a little
bit more based out there
and they that's fine that's perfect okay
so that's completely perfect now the
next thing that we want to do is give
this up margin at the top so
let's put this like this let's see
margin let's say 25 pixels on top is
they were on the right 50 at the bottom
and they were on left and right
all right data okay now let's take
another image so that's fine
I don't know
you
you
okay I'm just taking a random image you
could put whatever image you want okay
guys this is just so we could have
something different than the image that
we have there okay
okay cool now what I'm going to do is
I'm gonna take this from here because
technically when we are building this
right and we we loop over all of the
different articles we're not gonna be
able to put the the images on on the CSS
we're not gonna be able to change that
to layer so the only way that we're
gonna be able to do it is to inline the
styles so we're gonna say style unless
we will see you something like
JavaScript and we could do it but for us
we're gonna do it like this we're gonna
say style and then do that there like
that so let's see what's going on here
oh no see why this isn't working should
be working let me see something
background
okay so it's because of the quotes so
make this single quotes okay so now we
should be good
okay cool also let me see background
size cover
background let me see
position we already have that and
something else that I'm missing carry my
brace background fixed I think this up
is fixed right now so let me see
No Allah
okay so to fix this what we're gonna do
is we're gonna bring all this different
properties make sure they are in lined
okay so we're gonna put this here okay
now let me see what's going on
what's the sure that's a background
position center okay that's what we want
but instead of contained we want this to
be covered and there you go so what that
does is always whatever the image is or
however the size is it's kind of
basically Center it inside of this
container no matter what okay
so we're doing that now the next thing
that we're gonna do is
work on this here okay so to do this
let's come in we got a look at the HTML
that we have so far let me close this
let me see how can we close this all all
we got
background URL background size
background container okay there you go
so try to put everything in line no no
enters or don't press ENTER on it just
try to keep everything in line so the
HTML don't don't really break as far as
the syntax you can open this one up but
if you want what yeah okay
so that's fine that's completely fine so
we finished the media now we are up to
the update info okay now for this update
info what we are going to do is
let me see okay
so
you're going to do in this situation is
create create a container for this so
this is like a lot of CSS tricks there's
a lot of like working with the elements
and building things so it could look
nice so let's say class equals to gray
container okay
put tabs on that so basically you have
to update info update stats compose
component on compose comment inside of a
great container okay now click here find
the ending of that so right here we're
gonna see gray container so a great
container we are going to basically see
background and what was the colors that
we have we got background content online
we got to figure it out once again
let me just use a Photoshop for this you
guys could get it from here
yeah um I have to try to do it from
color dye Adobe I'll give it to you guys
from here okay so
the color for this is f6 f6 okay so cool
I'm gonna see great container background
matter-of-fact okay oh I think I already
had it background content okay so it was
background content so here we're gonna
say background content okay and there
you go okay so that's what we have now
the next thing that we want to do is we
want to move this up so remember we gave
like a 50 pixels 50 pixels container
here right padding
matter of fact yeah so we gave you a 50
pixel padding so lift let's give this
container 50 pixels so say padding let's
say padding is going to be
50/50 pixels on top zero left and bottom
left them right okay all right cool
now the next thing that we want to do is
we want to move this up so let's move
this up we're gonna say position
position:relative and we're gonna move
this all the way up so I'm gonna say top
negative 50 pixels and there you go okay
now we're gonna put a C index on this
when they see index of one on the gray
container and on this image we're gonna
say Z index of two I say position
relative on it and there you go say so
you can see now this is above the the
background right in the container okay
now
actually do another thing I think we're
gonna have to put it inside of another
container so I'm gonna do this I'm gonna
say say div class equals two
let's say patting container I'm just
naming a patting container because we
actually need to give this a padding
inside
okay so let me come here
what do we have for you we got a great
container I'm gonna put this in here
like this padding container
okay so padding container and we're
gonna say padding:0 on top zero on
bottom but 15 pixels left and right and
there you go
so now we have to effect of everything
is aligned okay everything is aligned
but we have that padding around
okay
and that's the follow the design that's
there okay guys
now we're gonna come here we're gonna do
the same thing that that we did as far
as the Box shadows
okay so we're gonna do the back box
shadows okay on this but we're gonna
bring this down to
like 50 okay
so 50 copy this here and now we're gonna
go to the gray container and we're gonna
do this like that save it what that's
going to do it's gonna add that little
shadow that's there okay so the shadow
that's below it is actually smaller than
the one that's here so let's edit that
so the same vertically bring it up a
little bit okay copy this paste it here
okay let me see
all right is it like that
you
I think that's fine think that's
definitely fine all right
so for now we're gonna stop here we
already been recording for 30 minutes
we're gonna continue doing the styles on
the next video alright guys see you guys
later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
