back at it again man we gotta talk about
you know how to stay motivated while you
all be here learning how to cope right
you're running up listen the first thing
that I will say is think about why you
actually doing this right while you're
learning how to code what is it that's
actually bringing you to this career a
lot of times you know you might say hey
I'm doing this for the money I'm doing
this to do a change I'm not happy with
the job that I'm doing you know it could
be you know anything could be working in
retail could be in that office that you
hate the people that you hate your
co-workers and you're like oh my god and
to get out of here there's something
better for me out there
so think about those things before you
quit about you know coding if you feel
like it's too hard think about it and be
like hey I gotta do this because if I
want to reach this goal if I want to get
here in life like the only way that I'm
gonna do is to this right this my only
means you know so right now just make
sure you keep you know keep pushing
don't worry your body like at first it
seems hard but trust me you're gonna get
through this part right get on a project
right this is number two right now let's
say you're working on a project and the
project seems so big and you're like oh
my god how am I gonna finish this and
like there's a lot of things I don't
know yet
but how am I going to build this website
let's say for example you have to create
uh you know a website out of the design
what do you have to do I will say hey
break things down into parts then don't
try to do everything I want think about
it like hey I'm gonna do this section by
section or for example you're working on
a on a website like this right so you
know this is the menu right so what I
would do is I will start with the header
start with this basically with the image
and then from there after you finish
with this image and you put a logo here
then from there build the menu which is
on the top and that's when they start
breaking it down by section by going
section by section until you get
everything right on the right areas you
know the right pixels the
sighs that font don't give up don't
think unlike oh my god I got to do this
homepage I got to do this by myself
I don't know how to do it don't get
overwhelmed man like all of this stuff
is super easy all you have to do is just
break it down by sections and pretty
much say hey this is the top image this
is the logo this is the menu and then
from there start breaking it down
section by section it's okay there's one
section there's another section there's
a full section there's one section here
there's another section here this one
section another section and then like
that you know this foot is a full
section and definitely you say okay I
have this two or three icons here and
then I have like a footer logo right so
it's pretty simple man all you have to
do is make sure you you know break
things down don't feel don't feel like
you are overwhelmed then you're like oh
my god am i ready to create this you
know whenever you feel like that take a
break which is number three right make
sure you take a break sometimes you feel
like you might get stuck the same
example you're trying to build something
in JavaScript and you keep getting
errors the best thing to do is relax
take a break don't get agitated and just
chill you got to think about it like
this like you're going at one point
you're gonna find the answer like it or
not you're gonna find the answer so this
is something that you just have to keep
pushing forward but just take a break
you're not okay I'm gonna come back to
it in a little while clean my mind you
know if you smoke a set your head go
smoke a cigarette if you if you need to
go get a snack go get a snack when you
come back your brain is going to be
clear and then you'll actually continue
studying well continue building the
project that you're working on number
four try to nine on a schedule right so
let's say you work from nine to five
right you say hey I got a beat at work
by nine o'clock
what if I wake up everyday at 6:30 and I
do half an hour in the morning of just
cold just wake up
brush your teeth you know just listen to
a podcast or something just cold for a
little while
cold for 20 minutes right before you go
to work just to get your your day going
because that's the best thing about you
know learning how to program that it
never stops like once you start it never
stops in your head like you constantly
think oh what can I build what can I do
or how can I make this loop how can I
make this this page it's throughout the
whole day is going to be in your mind so
if you - 20 minutes in the morning then
you're going to be golden then from
there let's say an example you come home
to five o'clock it takes you awhile 5:30
5:45 let's say you need to get holy to
cook something and it's yellow something
then you have until maybe at 7:30 it's
okay I'm gonna start coding from 7:30
till 9:00 o'clock right now that's an
hour and a half that you got right but
try to keep that as a habit try to keep
that in the sense of always coming back
to it meaning you will do it at least
three four times a week keep that as a
ham and keep it in a way where you could
always come back to and say hey it's
7:30 minutes I'm not a coach for a
little bit I got this idea that I have
in my head and I want to build something
tonight you know I mean like yeah you
could go out you could go out for drinks
equal to listen that will keep things on
the schedule so you say hey if I'm gonna
hang out with my boys and my friends on
Friday night well this is what I'm gonna
do
Tuesday Wednesdays and Thursdays those
are my coding days those days is for me
to code the rest of the week hey let's
party on you did number five the last
step to keep yourself motivated man
while you're learning to code it's very
simple man whenever you feel like oh my
god this is so hard I can't get this you
have to understand it this people who
actually have done this before it's not
like you you're going to Mars it's not
like you're the first person that's gone
to Mars you got to think about this
thousands if now
means that people have gone through this
problem before the same one that you're
going through and then think about it
like if they could do it I could do it
like we both human beings we both have a
brain there's nothing that's you know
better then you know he's not better
than me it's that simple like there's no
way that you could think like that you
know you don't think in your head like
oh my god I suck at math I suck at this
how can i I get to learn how to code
maybe I need to be a math genius
no you don't need math you don't need to
be a genius to do this this is more
about dedication think about it like
this
listen think about Michael Jordan right
Michael Jonah was constantly shooting
Treecko Treecko Treecko free throws when
he was young when he was a little kid
you know he will always play you know
basketball his backyard always play
basketball with his friends like the
reason why he became number one it's not
because he was like the most amazing
athlete in the world it is just about
actually you know put it in that word
practice makes perfect you got to think
about that you don't have to be a genius
you don't have to be a prodigy all you
have to do is pretty much be determined
to become something so hey I will become
a web developer hey I'm gonna become a
software engineer hey I'm gonna become
our iOS engineer whatever you're going
to become just pretty much just push
yourself to the next level then and just
keep going don't let nothing stop you
and don't put any blocks on your head
while you're blocking yourself you know
think about it like that if somebody
else did it
why you can't do it alright guys I hope
