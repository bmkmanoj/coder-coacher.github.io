it again man coning face calm listen
guys people want to know how to find out
the stack on the website right and by
the way I just finished doing the NOC
podcast things went crazy lights went
out this happened throughout the whole
neighborhood so I want to apologize for
that but you know that's how it is when
we basically now if I you know what I
mean yeah so how do you know what was
the stack that a website has right so
there's this cool apps that I have well
extensions right this one's called
similar tech right so similar tech and
then another words call I think I pizer
this was called built with the other one
is called wife Eliza so pretty much I
could see exactly what I have like whoa
what a website has so for example we
could go to cold pan that I oh all right
now we got to see that it's made by ruby
on rails so their stack uses ruby on
rails and then you see all the
technologies that they have you seen the
this website is built on Ruby let's see
sometimes some websites you can't see it
but let's check on Facebook right
see what stack is facebook working on
see sometimes they some websites they
block it my Facebook uses a certain
technology that blocks the information
but that's 25 to the energies it's esli
javascript jquery there isn't a party we
know that they use our reactor on their
page too but they're actually blocking
it but most websites you could actually
see exactly what they're using now every
website is blocking stuff so let me say
marvel com week we'll actually see that
it uses laravel okay this way he uses
pjs I'll go Leah real time using holding
Jes all right it should be videoed ideas
using google save framework you see
Naruto alright so this values and you
know I really like this with similar
tech because it's pretty legit so I
going to say an example a lot of you
guys been asked me why am i teaching you
guys who basically learning PHP well if
you look online a minute PHP hold like
the most websites right right now
something decline but that doesn't mean
that it's going to go away because
there's millions of millions of websites
that use it PHP so like let's say an
example let's compare how many websites
are using PHP compared to express all
right there is no Jas only 445,000
websites are using Express all right
let's do the same compare so directly to
know Jas 443,000 normally like you can't
compare it now let's compare it to
ruby-on-rails two million 240 million
like that's a big difference
lei let's see asp.net let's go compare
to it c asp.net and PHP exactly what i
told you guys c sharp PHP and java
they're always up there right there
close to each other but that's a big
difference between 40 and 60 million
websites there's a big difference no I
mean and this is worldwide this is not
like just in one certain area like this
thing tells you exactly where PHP is
dominated so pretty much PHP dominates
throughout the whole world asp.net has
more power in China what is this Turkey
the US even at that you see like it's
almost 50 51 has that net has 647
thousand PHP has almost a million
websites in the United States you know
what i mean so learning PHP is
definitely the way to go guys especially
for guys who are burning developers like
you can't go wrong at all so yeah so
this website similar tech is pretty
legit you come in here and find out
exactly how many websites are actually
using the same technology so this is the
top let's say top one minute website
right then the top 1 million websites
PHP it holds twenty percent that means
obstacle home welcome you know the whole
 world oyy and most of this web
sites that said apache and you know
watching it nginx most likely at least
sixty percent of them are actually using
PHP so if you say hey we got PHP let's
say ten percent of that that's thirty
percent and type of song on another ten
percent from that that's forty percent
so PHP holds at least forty percent of
the whole world wide web you know I mean
some and there's just a server
alright this is just all about the
server technologies but you can search
other stuff you can go to hear mr. react
yes right and then you'll see
ninety-five thousand websites are using
VIP is now but when you compare it to
jQuery jQuery is being over 70 million
websites like you cannot go wrong I love
this thing because numbers la you know
women lie men lie numbers don't lie you
know what i mean so you'd actually come
in here and basically put a whole bunch
of different technologies head to head
and see exactly what's going on on the
web because people tell you oh this is
the best this is the one that's blowing
everything out the box but when you look
at it you like not really buddy let me
see show you a little something one big
I compared it compare this to react es
angular should be holding this on top no
matter what you see and it was still
king no matter what how people hate on
it or anything like if you know angular
you're gonna find jobs now in the United
States if you know react you're
definitely going to find a lot of jobs
too but angular is king like it or not
people's gonna hate it you know you know
look at this all of this is angular like
you know what I mean like people talking
about you Jay yes and it's like man I
UJS is like a little dot compared to
other you know frameworks Lucy
so few geniuses five thousand websites
so you guys is putting all your your
little you know little eggs in a basket
trying to learn something like few j/s
and it's like guys there's really no
major companies hiring for this thing
it's like the numbers are there this
 doesn't lie know what I mean like
yeah in China is growing and you see in
China is the only place was like really
growing like that here in the united
states united states they tryna promote
it and trying to bring it up but only
892 websites are actually using it come
on guys let's be honest here the numbers
are there you know and this is a great
place to just learn about this and learn
about different technologies i know
people be like hey man should I now
learn jQuery is like come on man jquery
look at this 70 million to four hundred
ninety six thousand like everywhere
you're going to go every job that you're
going to go to at one point they're
going to be you know pretty much for
game you know using jquery like it or
not you know I'm sorry about the Hat
freaking messages from my girl and my
boy angel but yeah is crazy ring on
hey guys so I just wanted to show you
guys some some love come on girl here
yeah electricity is back yeah this how
much I love you guys like you know and
the tricity went out and then it came
right back on and the first thing I did
was come back to you guys show you guys
some loving let you know I'm okay
everything is okay and teach you guys
something how to find out the stack of a
website make sure you check that out man
similar tech some of the tech com Oh lap
Eliza and then the other one is I forgot
that long built with technology so built
wood is actually pretty good too
cool to live com you can check that out
but this was it they don't give you that
much information and you gotta pay for
it that's the reason why don't like it
but wife Eliza I like waffle ice it
because it gives you the little icon
here I can go to you know listening naw
Kham we was gonna use a little icon of
what they're using see they still using
moment j s modernizer yui which at one
point was a very popular framework and
now nobody even uses it right so that's
the same thing that's going to happen to
all the frameworks you guys is going to
learn a whole bunch of frameworks and a
year two years from now nobody's going
to be talking about it alright guys
anyways man make sure you subscribe make
sure you like this video and make sure
you share this man show it to other
people let them know you know motor
similar tech com listen men lie women
lie numbers don't lie alright just show
them the numbers right all right make
sure you subscribe make sure you like
this video check out coal offense calm
you already know one halogen boy they</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
