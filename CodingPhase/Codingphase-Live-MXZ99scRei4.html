Oh God what else man
yo Joey can kumbaya 88
yes my channel is for everybody
everybody who loves
and trying to get into the industry
Hey
and people here for developers right and
helping other people out like my goal is
to make everybody a senior developer in
a year right get you guys up to date
with what you need to learn
you
I'm trying to sharpen my HTML CSS skills
any advice I have a website called :
face comm right if you go check that out
I have a great course in HTML or CSS
where you pretty much you learn
everything that you need to learn and I
show you how to break them
all right and even if you don't want to
pay
was the other one on Netflix clone like
there's a couple you know to practice
your HTML CSS like there's no way you're
gonna get good unless you practice you
know like people somebody sent me a
message like oh I signed up for the web
site because I want to do laravel and
then I look I go to the web site and I'm
like they could barely do a HTML and CSS
I'm like why are you trying to skip
steps man like focus on one thing get
good on that then jump to the next thing
right so if I have of course the first
courses are gonna be beginner levels all
right HTML CSS future proof JavaScript
which is like an introduction to
JavaScript only the things that you need
to know right because later on I'm gonna
do intermediate course and then I'm
gonna do an advanced course but right
now all you need is that the beginners
course all right to be dangerous and be
able to call it and start learning right
but if you say oh I know how to somewhat
mess around with HTML CSS and then you
know I'm just gonna jump to tulare well
as I broke you jump in the head
no I don't mind that larry bowa's is you
know the website is using view j s my
only problem is when they try to fucking
force you down your throat then i hey he
is fucking fucking view whatever right
if you guys have looked at 5.30 wasn't
there you look at 5.4 somehow they
fucking went and put it in there right
forcing you to to fuck with you and I'm
like bro don't fucking force me and if
you guys look it up there's a post that
I did on Larrick ass maybe you guys want
to take some time often and look at that
right so I'm put a post where it says
Larry cast and search view Jes or just
search Larry cast Joe Santos Garcia or I
don't know or coding fees right search
that you know search that online and you
will see a post right where I basically
explained how laravel was fucking
forcing people to learn view Jay yes now
the guy who who deals with mostly of the
front end right his name is Jeffrey way
he does Larry cast com2 right he he was
fucking pissed off because I'm just
being honest with people people don't
fucking like it look at the fucking guy
to even you he got pissed off too
alright I'm just fucking being honest
don't force it on people right now
thanks to me I'm taking credit to that
shit thanks to me in five point five now
they're giving you the option of either
choosing view or chosen react that comes
with the fucking framework take a video
about that shit imma be like here
Jeffery way thank you and then I feel
like cursing him up well I'm not but I'm
like y'all don't fucking force people to
do some shit if they don't wanna fucking
do it
like laravel 5.4 when they introduce
this thing called mix mix that'll work
with react and it didn't work with
angular but somehow it worked with you
perfectly
that's my problem that's like if you are
fucking back-end framework don't fuckin
choose which framework in the front-end
people should use I don't know is that
too much - fucking last I don't know
yeah tell me but yeah man yeah that's
what I'm saying like yeah like yeah no I
think then they're not showing
angular they're not giving angular a
piece of the framework yeah they had to
cut fucking react because I fucking I
pretty much I became Jesus Christ for
fucking react right I got crucified
online right and even the whole shit of
with even you right I'm getting
crucified in for rules and shit like
that by people who are fucking fans of
it and I'm like bro all the fucking
people is gonna fucking thank me later
for this shit alright I could get
crucified I don't give a fuck like what
the hell nobody fucking puts money in my
pocket a couple of nerds in a basement
ain't gonna fucking hurt my pockets you
know what I mean but if I have to be the
fucking Jesus Christ of this shit of
like fucking front-end frameworks
especially for react fucking I actually
I actually use used to use a tree house
and it's good I think
tree house is good for what it is
country
I can't learn from YouTube then is the
same shape
Oh
freon treatment team treehouse which is
is fucking behind like right now a brand
new technology like let's say larvae of
5.5 comes out there's people already
talking about it here right in team
treehouse because their production is so
big and they have so many in fucking
animations and so much shit when you go
there you're actually six months behind
of what's going on in the industry
and people don't know that like when
you're beginning you think oh everything
is gray is the same shit but there's six
months behind and also that's my only
problem you to me I rather go to even
here on on youtuber I'll go to
traversing media this channel right and
just do a little crash
yeah man I'm about to go in man maybe
you guys see if you I want yeah yeah Co
chill with me bottle if I'm open talking
cuz I'm gonna take this shit to the
office I'm gonna be working on the
project you know what's cool now I'm
making a game boy you guys he's gonna be
like God a Pokemon emulator not Pokemon
emulator we're emulating Pokemon like a
Pokemon battle so I'm actually gonna
work on that right now so you guys can
learn JavaScript
you know Roger
not for nothing man but you can't
compare a freaking MacBook to so
anything else out there like look how
beautiful this dais stain
superfast screen is super crystal-clear
got a Retina screen
with a turkey sandwich man
got ready for this Pokemon game I'm just
saying no are you guys ready for this
shit

dump the soda where I need to do some
weight man don't worry it's my last time
I drink some Heather you know how to
taste that good oh yeah no man I'm
trying to get back my shit man man
fucking people's gonna come in here
we're gonna get a break don't worry
primitive index is you know how you
looking into an array right you have
multiple items inside of an array the
first item is zero so that's the index
of that item it's just basically the
place of like where the item is inside
of an array that's it simple guys I'll
tell you say you want to to my website
and you started checking out the course
permit if go back to arrays and look at
what I'm doing there you're gonna notice
this something that say index sometimes
you got to rewind back to videos man if
you didn't understand everything rewind
it watch it again it's only five minutes
yeah exactly
yo that's so true
Chester Darrow basically said it not
because the problem is our work is
different man the work is it's a
different type of environment man
like I don't know about you guys like
being here by myself and this fucking
big-ass company and then if I can every
time there's always a error there's
always some shit this times that I don't
want to talk to people like right now I
really don't want to talk to nobody
because there's so much said that I have
to fix on a website that I really don't
even want to see anybody
ATK's got anywhere man yeah some people
are lucky to even get 45 if you're
getting 80 that means that they really
need somebody they desperate it's not
even about the skills no more if they
throwing eighty thousand that junior
developer they're desperate
