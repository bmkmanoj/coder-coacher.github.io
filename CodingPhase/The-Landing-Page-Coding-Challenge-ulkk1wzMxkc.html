this old-ass TV well to be honest with
you that this TV has been there for a
while and I've been trying to take it
down but it's so freaking Helina I need
somebody else to help me out with this
 because it's like literally like 70
pounds look how big that is I don't
know I don't know how to do that a lot
of these days I'm gonna get it done I'm
just waiting for you know one of my boys
come to wear and pass by help me out
with this thing but yeah man I'm trying
to I'll try to do some new videos
tonight man will you guys for the
weekend but before that I actually have
a challenge don't go there new
challenger ah alright build a new
challenge guy listen I want you guys to
actually this weekend I want you guys to
actually build up a page I'm not talking
about our full website i'm not talking
about a whole bunch of pages I'm talking
about one single landing page right I
want you guys to go to dribble com
search landing page right and I want you
guys to convert one of the landing pages
doesn't matter you choose which one we
want to do which one you think looks
great and looks beautiful I want you to
actually go and build so just pretty
much convert it into HTML CSS right you
don't have to do jquery or javascript
but if you do you will get extra point
right so the challenge is to just create
that page and then on sunday i will give
a free course
so somebody out of the thousands of
people who come to my page to come to my
my you tube you know what I mean from
the thousands and thousands of people
that come to my page in my view too I
will give you a free course right now
for you guys that are ballers the ones
that don't care about a free course well
and if you still haven't what of course
yet go to the description the best
courses that I've taken and actually
work for me and I could allow short
there on the description and why are
those courses so important well where's
those coaches when you buy a course you
pretty much help me out to help other
people out here on my youtube channel so
basically give them free stuff like
right now I'm stacking up money to
pretty much start giving out free
laptops which I said that from the
beginning I said that when I have 50
subscribers I said hey Dad if everybody
starts you know supporting me and
helping me out i will start giving out
free courses and free laptops yeah you
can get a free laptop by yourself if you
got a laptop on your own whatever
because you're a baller but you know
there's people third world countries who
can't afford to get a mac they can get a
macbook pro they can get a a regular
windows computer so that's what somebody
like me comes in you know what I mean
like I'm here to help out other pupils
it is not about means is not about
freaking stacking up money because I
have my own money which luckily I don't
need to come to the Internet to you know
bags but I really want to help out other
people because learning to code actually
changed my life it helped me become a
better person it helped me become
independent sense of hey when I was
encoded also they were living with my
moms like under her you know I wasn't
helping our paying rent
hope we're not paying instance if I
wasn't earning enough but now thanks to
you know what development like now an
amount create I like mom crippling our
little you guys were opened up an
accomplishment in there next year i'm
planning on buying another house and
then like it's going to be just all
crazy and all of this stuff came from
web development it didn't come from me
talking share on the internet didn't
come from me that you know complaining i
say hey why do I have to come from a
poor family why do I have to be you know
immigrant in the United States whereas I
get out I don't come from people with
money I come from the bottom why I
didn't come here to complain what I did
after you know what man I gotta change
my life around I saw a lot of my friends
either getting locked up I have other
ones that freaking gorgeous you know
ending up in dead-end jobs I saw all of
us having two three kids different you
know baby mothers and I realize you know
what that's not what I want to do I want
to be somebody else I want to be able to
be one of those guys that you know by
the time they're like 30-something they
have the nice car they have a nice house
they could go anywhere in the world all
of that I'm getting there I'm not there
yet well I'm pretty close and all of
them I'm getting there thanks to web
development and coding and programming
and I think what everybody dis is like
super helpful so for this weekend like I
told you guys that's talent I want you
guys to start coding more I want you
guys to start challenging yourself and
say hey every day I'm gonna do something
different I'm going to actually like to
do 30,000 pages i'm asking one Pete go
to dribbble.com final design that you
like building
after you build it come back to me leave
a comment of the basically does URL of
either the web page or the jsfiddle or
in the cold pan or with a clunker or our
EPL that IT whatever and wherever the
hell you decide to share it but come
back to me can tell me what you guys did
this weekend I want to see it here in
this this video I want you guys to leave
a comment this is the challenge man
every week I'm going to channel to that
with something and I i'm going to give
back as much as I can but remember guys
the only reason in the only way that I
can give more to everybody I could come
in and put in my own twenty thirty
dollars which I always do so when I by
courses but the only way that I'm able
to give out some more people's is when
people buy courses that's the reality of
things this is like the Obama plan
aranea this like the Obamacare plan
right now if nobody puts in and nobody
buys most courses I can only give out a
certain amount of courses to people for
free or give up free laptops just a
little bit because i also have expenses
you know me but if we all say hey these
are the courses that work for Joe and I
by one course and then when I buy that
course I actually how about somebody
else can't afford it because we do not
have said this course is not like 10 $15
$20 if you live in the United States
there's no way that you can ask for ten
dollars sometimes will turn out there's
no way but you have somebody in India
freakin China or Latin America some
parts of Europe when you live in those
places definitely Africa when we live in
those places you cannot afford ten
dollars ten dollars is like 200 hours to
somebody over there
so my plan is to help out those from
those people and people here in the US
there's people here that lives in Miami
who are extremely poor that nobody knows
and nobody cares about but they sent me
messages like hey buddy like guilt I
can't afford a course can you help me
out what do i do I help them out i pay
it myself because i know how it is to be
out here without no money in your pocket
there's people who are privileged that
they had everything me and have I
come from a bottle like and then stuff
to give you like a big story and a big
thing but man when you come from the
bottle you know how it feels and you
want to help out other people's to get
out of it and that's just my plan so
yeah guys that's the challenge for this
weekend do your thing I want to see what
you guys create and I want to show it
off here you know or someday once i do
my my live show i will say who's the
winner and guys if nobody fills it out
so or creates a page over this weekend
then if only one person sends me one
page then that person is the winner
because nobody else decides to put in
the time and just challenge themselves
okay just go to dribble com fine search
so it's landing page create that landing
page and then come back to or even if
it's something let's say you go to the
landing page you say hey I'm gonna take
this idea of this image this design that
somebody create and I'm going to make it
my own way that's fine but you have to
also have the length of the page and the
link of the design that motivated you
are inspire you whatever right that's
the only way that I'm going to give you
a free course anyways man is you already
know your boy Joe back at it again yeah
you gotta have fun it is in the world
man have fun guys he already knows the
weekend man but put in that work today
