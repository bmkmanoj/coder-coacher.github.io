to create a to-do app with HTML CSS I
have this design that I found on dribble
and I'm going to be inspired by it
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take
some of the colors out here and then
just create the pages according to what
I need but I'm gonna use this as a so
like inspiration alright so that's what
we're gonna do right now first thing
that I'm going to do though is I'm going
to come here to github.com slash coding
face calm so that I started K - K will
started - kick - 2018
alright or if you just say coding
github.com slash still coding face calm
and then you're gonna see it here my
starter kit 2018 click on there you're
going to download this right after we
download it it's going to show up in
your downloads folder and then now we're
gonna move this into the projects folder
there's where you have all your projects
everything that you're working on right
and for me I'm going to put to-do app
HTML so I rename the starter kit 2018 -
to do what - HTML right ok so now what
I'm going to do is I'm a go on Adam open
up Adam and then here we're going to
switch it up I'm going to let I think
I'm going to leave this here for that
we're going to open up a new window
because that's for another project so
I'm gonna leave that alone I'm gonna
open this up new window and then go to
the projects open up to the left past
HTML
then here what we're going to do is I'm
going to press here in terminal and so
let's I click that I'm already inside of
the project so as you can see we have to
do that best what to do at and HTML
sorry I keep saying - but you know
alright so in here what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna say npm install and it's going
to install all the files that I need all
the packages that I need to start my
project and then from there once this is
done we're going to run NPM start and
yeah but for now let's look at the
design with this thing is loading so
first thing that I want to do is it is a
to-do app right so we have an index page
which is going to be the one that you
know people enter so it's going to be
like hey welcome to Joe's to-do app
right that's like the home page then
from there we're gonna have a index page
when people log in right when people log
in and they see you know the index page
with all its of the last one that's the
way order to do tasks right all the
tasks inside of it and then from there
well we're gonna have one that's gonna
be just for creating and then another
one for editing and I think how many
pages about us home page index page
create page and edit page so that's four
pages that we're going to do so we will
do it one by one all right let me see
this finish
okay since it was pretty finished
alright cool so now that I have all my
node packages here all I have to do is
say NPN start with NPM run start let me
see which ones are they
sorry okay oops
NPM run lots okay yeah that's all I
needed
NPM one watch Oh
now not only in here what we're going to
do is we're going to come here and we
want to come to the public page the
index.html closes up those downloads
download so we have that we're going to
delete this this app and we want to come
here to the gulp file and let's see I'm
going to come to the web pad so we're
going to integrate the web pack and what
we're going to do is we're going to
comment this out okay okay what I was
going to come some of that out let's see
let's run let's run this again and say
one Watts make sure that I will swallow
it's close this what's this so soon as
it opens all good now the other thing
now missing to remove is this vendor
library comment that I'll save it if you
run watch one more time
so let's see if there's any errors
everything one good this is fine good
alright let's get back to this and this
is where we going to go to the next
video because now we're going to start
coding alright so you guys know a little
bit
