freeze calm your boys backing out and
did it again I'm here to introduce a new
section right so we're basically
creating new ideas new content for you
guys and thanks to the subscribers they
sent me a lot of good ideas right so
once the Skaro sent me this idea of like
hey can you go into this website and
figure out what did they use and just
let me know exactly what libraries how
they did it
and yeah I guess that's gonna be my new
challenge now right so this is what I'm
gonna do
he sent me this website the chick-fil-a
I'm not a really big chicken type of
dude I actually don't eat chicken but
yeah basically we're gonna go in here
see what they got I hear that the food
is great from over there right so
there's an animation okay cool all right
I mean this right here I've seen before
this stuff is could be used from scroll
magic there's also another library that
does this pretty good that every time
that you scroll it's a new page alright
but let's continue looking at it okay
and there's animation I could definitely
see that there's like some tweens
animations in here because most of the
stuff can I mean it can be done with CSS
but it's not gonna come out as smooth
and nice as with tweens and tweens is a
library
alright G SAP is called G SAP actually
so let's see let's continue
what else they got alright so you can
see that's probably done way SVG's let's
see what else
okay a little animation and that's about
it is this a very simple page is a
single page app it's very simple now
let's look behind the scenes hey I bet
you it has tweens I bet you have scroll
magic who wants to bet money with me
right
all right so let's go here to the
network let's refresh this and let's
click on JavaScript let's see what they
got
all right so they're using jQuery which
makes sense is a simple page so use
jQuery
okay the using bootstrap J yes all right
that makes sense they have a custom
script here of course like I said scroll
magic they have time line which is part
of G SAP a tween light part of G SAP CSS
plugin that J s never heard of that one
that I know of
jQuery Jace was jQuery that G SAP all
right
that makes sense animation G SAP let's
see yeah circle progress this is
probably where they make their SVG that
little circle that we saw before
all right so just like I said they use
tweens from G SAP they use scroll magic
and they use jQuery all right now if we
look here for the backend what is it
that they're using since that is a
Windows server right so this is actually
running Windows Server so usually if
it's a window server is gonna be using
asp.net alright so that's pretty much it
I mean it's a pretty simple website they
using Twitter bootstrap you know Google
Analytics of course most is in capsule
on ever heard of that one okay I'm
seeing caps you know what I was in
capsule a-- okay it's for CD ends
alright so this thing is like CloudFlare
that's cool oh so they're part of most
likely is being used by namecheap.com
okay mas using them girl all right
I guess they got a couple of clients but
yeah this stuff is super easy guys you
guys may be in the
your future I'll create like a low a
little tutorial about this stuff cuz I'm
really been saving this for the last
project which is the digital design app
that I've been telling you guys
basically it's like this what you do in
a digital agency so a lot of times you
use a lot of animations as VG's so all
that stuff I'm actually saving it for
that course but I could make a tutorial
for you guys here on YouTube to see what
you guys think about gzip and you know
animations in general right so yeah man
this that was it I mean this website was
so easy to find out man like you know
sometimes all you have to do is like
look in to inspect the elements and look
into the network and see exactly what
they're using you know most of the times
gonna be jQuery you know a lot of you
would be like oh man they gotta use
react angular this and that it's like
blah you know you're not gonna use
something that is heavy like that like a
full framework for something so simple
as this like this is literally just a
single page app like me personally I
would have built it with hyper app
because it's so simple right but yeah
and then they have like a signing page
which is using bootstrap okay so this is
interesting
so they actually the page where you'll
and it's not really where you log in
right so they have a whole different
server this is important because a lot
of times people don't notice this like
you're on a website and then I don't
know where the website kind of looks a
little bit different usually what
happens is you're on a whole different
server right and that's what it is like
right now we're in a whole completely
different server this is not this is
definitely not asp.net right and that's
like one of the things I always tell you
guys you know a lot of these companies
they use multiple stacks like this
certain parts like if you look at
macys.com some parts they use asp.net
then you go and log in and then they're
using nodejs
and then you log in somewhere else and
then you see that they use PHP for it
and then you're like wait what so you
know they have micro-services all right
so people what they do is they create
like let's say if I'm I'm a team that's
using asp.net and we're like okay we're
comfortable with asp.net and we want to
use asp.net for the home page a lot of
times they'll set up the home page on
our asp.net server and then somewhere in
the back end is connected to somewhere
else somewhere was more secure or they
might use a third party to actually use
the logging authentication like you see
like here like this is probably like a
third party company that they're using
here because of the way how everything
looks I don't think this this is part of
chick-fil-a itself I really think it's
like a third party maybe let me see if I
can figure it out let's see if we could
figure it out
all right so turn meta tags
let me see let me refresh this see what
we could get what information can we get
out of this page okay right enterprises
here so there's a whole different system
this is not the same system that's being
served in the homepage at all this is
completely different
yeah so most likely is like they're
using a third party for their
authentication and to keep things secure
you know like all these companies what
they care about having things secure the
worst thing that you could do is get
hacked you know there's a lot of bad
companies out there who don't pay
attention to those but those things but
you're supposed to take care of yourself
and in
I really did not let yourself get hacked
all right so a lot of times they use a
third party I've seen companies that
actually connected to a PayPal third
party or like they'll connect to high
colors like Apple pay on the Apple
website so there's a million ways to do
this right but yeah going back to the
original site man this is just like
super simple animations G SAP look it up
you could come here and say scroll Magic
G SAP all right so this is the animation
library that the year that they actually
using this is super easy I mean I'm not
gonna I'll be honest I'm not gonna say
it's easy this is not easy
Jesus Jesus app is not is not easy it's
something that you could get nice with
you know with time but it's definitely
not easy it's something that you
specialize in you know a lot of people
will be like oh man oh I love to the
back end I love doing this and down need
to be a full-stack but at the same time
you could literally just specialize with
you know animations and you know
building cool stuff on the web like
there's a group of people out there that
I get paid a lot of money when I mean a
lot I mean a lot of money for this stuff
man if you get really nice with gzip and
animations trust me guys you're going to
get hired by major design firms and you
know once you're in you're in you know
what I mean like I I know a friend who
who has worked in like Nike he has then
he did the adidas website he did like um
a whole bunch of stuff man like David
moved them to London like if you really
nice with it like you could really
become very very powerful with this
design very of gif this is company of
things
first iki kinki boy games let me see I'm
gonna see if I find this company let me
see maybe I'll figure it out later
this'll come this is Gameboy geek is it
this one
there's a company in England that that's
what they specialize let me see you give
away games Cartoon Network let me see if
I figure it out if I figure out I'll
give you the company so you guys could
take a look at what they do
Cartoon Network football man what's that
well the toon Cup yeah
what's the name of this company man I
can't I know it's a geeky boy or
something like that well yeah they
basically look this up some Cup football
games Cartoon Network they basically
created that and they are a huge company
in England don't they pretty much they
built a lot of companies like cool
little things like that like I don't
know if you guys remember when you go to
let's say you buy a by a cereal from
frosted flakes right when you know how
they say have like little codes in the
back where they be like oh go and play
this game on on the frosted flakes
website and this and that like those
guys they build those games all right
now there's a whole bunch of companies
like this all over the world
you know digital agencies that you know
big clients come in and tell them hey
can you build us a cool website with
nice animations and this this and that
and they get paid a lot of money usually
you'll be like something like a single
page job like that chick-fil-a website
this probably some digital agency
probably got like twenty thirty thousand
dollars for this all right now is this
website difficult no just this landing
page long it's probably gonna take I
don't know maybe two weeks all right so
after two weeks they create this thing
and they get paid $30,000 the owners of
the digital agency get paid the most but
the clients they understand they're like
okay we're getting top dollar stuff you
know it's not like we picking up this
guy from from elance.com or something
like this like legit companies alright
so anyways man if you have any other
website that you wish for me to look at
and tell you exactly what technologies
they're using or how they built it let
me know I'll help you out and I'll look
at it alright guys so I'll see you guys
later
this is coding phase comm make sure you
