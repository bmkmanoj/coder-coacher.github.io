back again man listen today we're gonna
start this little section where I'm just
gonna answer back to you no comments
comments that I like comments that I
respect from my subscribers so you know
maybe once or twice a week I'm gonna
listen where I just come in here read
one of the comments and just pretty much
just answer it right so hey coding face
do some Q&amp;amp;A vids I like to know how you
came about into the journey into this
journey I just stopped so I have yet to
check out your other videos thanks for
the info Adam which i think is Adam
that's probably what he meant which is
ATO em and it's also a min fun to
customize so all right Matt bhutto
listen this house started this is like
the honest truth right basically I
started when I was like 14 years old
creating videos you know videos
when I was a little kid right but then I
don't know something happen like a 14 I
started or watching dragonball z and I
got really into dragon ball z that was
back in 2000-2001 and I said you know
back then there was no YouTube so the
way to share videos you had to upload it
and then the videos will be like 700
megabytes and then from there you have
to upload it to your own server so what
I did was I started looking online i was
saying how did hell do you make a
website and i was like a little cabbage
I don't even have a computer that was
mines so the way I used to basically
check out websites was I used to go to
the library and basically from there I
would just go in and start searching
Dragon Ball Z and searching images i've
downloaded like probably like a million
dragon ball z images you know just to
save them back then I used to think like
oh my god gotta save them because I
don't know when the next episode is
gonna happen so at least I have the
images and then I could actually draw it
and I don't know that was like me
in a okay whatever but yeah so I
decided to start making websites and it
was pretty cool like you know I started
making sites it was like really
like I don't know if you guys remember
like this type of websites geo cities
people who's been around since like the
90s the 90s 2000 it would be like this
man like you would go into websites that
would look just like that like that's
how the internet used to look back then
you know like there was this website
called Planet Namek dot-com and it was
like look they still have a lot of stuff
here pretty much that was my inspiration
this website Planet Namek calm and I
used to go to that website you know I
actually used to steal their design so
what I used to do is I was used to go to
the website like let's say an example so
dragon let's say saying Island calm
right and then i will go view source and
what i would do is i will go and copy
this whole code without
understanding it and then just recreate
it in a text editor bagdana used to be
like I think it's no pad or it was it
it's no pep plus + or something like
that but yeah so that's what I used to
do that's how i started making websites
man like there's like no deep history on
this but I started making websites when
I was like 14 years old you know dragon
ball z websites which is
hilarious and you know that was pretty
cool man like I used to have a website
called majin buu dot net margin
dodgeball dot net right this
website is to have like five hundred
thousand unique user unique users right
back then what
that's like the internet wasn't even
that popular I mean it was popular but
not everybody in the world had a phone
and all this stuff but I used to have
 people come to my website if I
can you know watch dragonball z episodes
live and with me in it was pretty
 cool you know and then I got
shut down because you can't be
putting episodes for free on the
internet like that so they send me a
cease and desist am I oh if you don't
take it down we're gonna sue you so what
I was and then I left that alone you
know what I mean and then you know fast
forward to 10 years later 24 years old I
was already doing i.t work I went to
school to do I tea and then you know cuz
my mom oh I just want you to you know
work in the office and wear your shoe
and this and I so I say i'ma do I see
something that pays money and then I
hated that job and then I was like you
know what I'm gonna go back to my
passion so four years ago I decided to
switch back and start making websites
again and I kind of regret the
fact that I could have been making
website since 14 years old but I stopped
because one I didn't have no support for
my mom and two because I wasn't old
enough in the sense of my guy wasn't
making no money out of it and then I was
like I need to make money you know I
don't even think about Google accents
like when I add some since like 2,000
something you know what I mean while
people talking about YouTube I was in
YouTube in 2006 like I could if I wanted
to I could probably had a way bigger
channel but I didn't want to do it back
then I was into music and stuff like
dying like and just you know girls and
 and doing oh but but yeah
umm Danah sound I started making
websites man and that's the story of it
all right well what's the guy's name oh
my puter like pretty much that was my my
backstory you know what I mean so thanks
for the comment
imma keep on looking at other people's
comments and making videos about him
okay you ever notice it boy joke back at
it again bow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
