this page the whole content area so what
we're going to do is finish this table
alright so let's look at the image see
how it looks it's actually here at the
bottom dashboard dashboard where is it
okay here you go
alright so this is how we supposed to
make a look so let's do that now it's
gonna be pretty simple alright so the
first thing we're gonna do is we're
gonna come here and we're basically
going to say table and then we're gonna
say tea head and then we're going to say
th so we want to make the background the
color of grey dark background okay let
me see if that looks yeah that's fine we
want to make the table with 100% 100%
okay make that 100% all right now what
we're going to do here is we're gonna
say for this we're going to make it font
size 0.8 rims we're going to say padding
you're gonna say 20 pixels on top and 10
pixels on left or right we're going to
also make text transform uppercase
alright and I'll make the font weight a
little bit thicker
let me see a 500 that's good yeah that's
fine for now
alright now what else would want to do
benefactress make this 2:15 to make a
little bit smaller yeah that seems
perfect okay now what we want to do is
change the color you're gonna say color
we're gonna say gray dark font all right
now the next thing we want to do is we
want to come down here on the th head
we're gonna say T body and then we're
gonna say background white then the next
thing we were going to do is basically
say font size 0.8 rims now let's look at
the what we have here okay we also want
to give this a padding we want to say th
well not th and TD and we want to say
padding let's give it the same thing
that we have on the other one 15 pixels
on top and bottom and the 10 pixels are
left to right all right now the company
jobs in the application all right let me
see
they're both aligned to the left all
right so let's say on this one let's
make this text-align:left
alright ok cool now let's get water
radius generator okay
I hate typing this so I rather use a
generator so it's curved on the top but
no curve at the bottom so you're gonna
copy this and we're going to put it
let's see this put it here see if that
works ok let me see
localhost yes you got the little curve
on the top that's fine just look at that
I think we should make it a little bit
bigger
Missy full size point 9 no it's a little
bit too big leave it a point 8 and then
what we're going to do is we're going to
give it more padding so let's say 20
pixels padding the same thing for the
other word 20 pixels padding now for
this we're going to change the color of
the font so hey what was a great dark
font
okay now let's see this cop it is a
couple of times
take this TR and copy it
okay that's there let me see what else
we want to do to this wanna make the
circle tool right so let's do that now
okay let me go into content area and I
CSS let me put in inside of these see ok
logo oops they stay on all the first
ones so this so let's say LS are 8 j jo
z HH JJ
okay now a side of the T DS we're gonna
say logo display the line block let's
make this background green green neon
alright and then what we're gonna say is
give this some padding padding 20 pixels
now
border-radius let's give this 50% make a
perfect circle margin right let's say 20
pixels let's say color white alright so
there you go got the little circle now
we got to make a little bit smaller say
10 pixels say 15 pixels right let me see
something
okay I'm gay what's the size of this one
13 15 and then 15 15
so everything 15 so let's say let's give
it as our set width and set height so I
could be perfect perfect circle let's
say 45 35 all right now is the perfect
circle all right now one thing that we
can do is to basically use flexbox is to
Center this but we're not gonna go that
deep
because it's just a simple tutorial for
you guys to practice all right now as
you can see we put in circle or border
radius on the th it shouldn't be on the
th so cut it from here
put it on the T head alright on the t
hat
now should I use this no doesn't even
like that alright but let's clean up a
couple of things in here let's put in a
couple of rolls so right here we have
two the cards right beside of the cards
we go to put in the glass row okay
okay here we're gonna I'm the last one
we're gonna close it up that row all
right now for the grid one thing that I
think we maybe we forgot was adding to
the Rallis a row let's say margin-left
negative 15 pixels margin right negative
15 pixels there you go so now
everything's gonna be aligned all right
now let's go to the table here let's
create another div yes a div call em the
CarMD 12 okay let's close that up after
all so - let's close it up on it again
and then what we're gonna do is we're
gonna add a row right under the column D
12 we are saying class row because as
you can see when you put in the call MD
12.com MD 12 has a padding right so
automatically it's pushing things inside
but what we want to do is basically fix
it with the class row so we say class
row classroom has a margin of negative
15 pixels so automatically it's going to
go on the right place so you can see now
everything aligns all right we want to
do the same thing that we do here to
this section here so let's come up here
to this heading
all right let's put in live close it up
let's close it up here - okay might be
something missing hello this something
it closed out okay where's the cards
okay let me see some time I see if I can
comment this out figure out what's the
issue
oops
kid I got closed that are closed okay
now let me see cards
she didn't not be giving me no issue
right now but it's probably somewhere
not used to your mouth because what it's
doing is pushing it to the right you see
that can't see cards okay so we're
counting cards we gotta take off that
overflow:auto and the margin not just
overflow:auto so let's see cuz we put
down where we was like prototyping
things like we don't need overflow order
right now all right
another thing that we want to fix is the
way how things break down so we want
this to actually break down like on
large we want it to be by six Excel we
want it by six
no what we want to buy we want to buy
four on Excel we wanna buy let's say by
three on large we want it by six on
medium and by twelve or small so let us
copy this paste it here save that policy
all right
all right and there you go
yep that's exactly what we wanted now
I'm not gonna do this fully responsive
for you guys as far as like you know you
guys can go ahead and try to play around
with this this is just a quick tutorial
we basically build the dashboard how it
is on the image of course there's
definitely little things that can be
fixed but that's up to you guys this is
more like for practice I hope you guys
really enjoyed this tutorial this course
and yeah make sure you visit Kota crazy
Carmen yeah I'll see you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
