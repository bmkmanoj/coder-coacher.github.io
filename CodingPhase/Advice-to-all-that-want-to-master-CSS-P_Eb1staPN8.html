advice midway to the course right I want
you guys to take a deep breath
we're actually gotten this far we've
actually created a couple of little
things here and there you know just to
get your feet wet when it comes to HTML
CSS but I want to take this little
moment this little minute I'm going to
take away from the course and I want you
guys to think about this you know some
of you guys might be frustrated some of
you guys might be thinking ahead and man
this is hard
how am I gonna remember this I know
you're probably thinking that right I
know it because that happened to me when
I was learning what you got to think
about is basically breaking things down
you don't care about looking at this
whole page and say oh my god how am I
going to do all these things you know
what you care about is how are you going
to break this down into small little
pieces like you know this thing right
here it's a logo and like I said before
it could be a text it could be a picture
so you know how to put a picture right
and you know that this is inside of a
container so this could be a div this
could be a section this could be a
header tag it doesn't matter right and
you know that this are multiple links so
you know how to do a link right now some
of you guys might get stuck in the CSS
and think like wow this is difficult
there's so many different and you know
properties and you look at this list and
you say oh my god I'm ready to give up
I'm never going to learn this thing and
I'll be honest with you guys like I said
in previous videos you don't have to
learn every single property in CSS you
just got to know what exactly isn't that
you have to do right like if we look at
this image and we come here and we say
hey there is a blue background thinking
ahead I gotta change the background to
blue so how am I going to do that you're
going to come to Google if you can't
figure it out from the videos that we've
seen you gonna come to Google
and basically say change background
color CSS right this right here is going
to save your life basically going to
show you okay I've got to change the
background so light blue or whatever the
color it might be I'm actually going to
give you the colors of the page once we
get there but I want you guys to start
thinking for yourself start looking at
the design and this happens all the time
you got to start thinking about it like
this you have to break down things into
small pieces you gotta say hey this
thing is blue I gotta find out how to
make the background blue right you say
okay the font size is a little bit
bigger than why normally is so you start
trying it out you say okay I want to try
out all font size of 20-yard 2223 until
for your eyes and looks similar to the
design right also you're going to notice
that the color of the font are white if
you can't remember this how to change it
white look it up search font size to 20
and then you say hey how do you change
the color of the font and you just come
to Google how to change color off time
all right
w3c school you could change it to this
or CSS you can just come in and say you
know CSS text color blue color white
whatever you want to change it right so
the reason why I come in and you know
basically stop you from continue on the
course is I want to give you this small
little advices you know mid way so you
can understand what to do now sometimes
you think everything is overwhelming and
you're like man there's so much content
here how am I gonna remember all this
you don't have to remember everything
because even though some people might
tell you hey you can learn this in one
month you can learn this in two months
this is a process it is a process of
every time you repeat it it sticks in
your head it sticks on your brain you're
not going to remember this from watching
this video at this moment that's the
reality of things that's what I want to
be really mm be honest and tell you guys
hey you're not going to remember all of
this stuff in one shot
but luckily we're going to create
multiple projects where you're going to
remember all of this you know by the end
of this course you're going to remember
every single thing that you need to do
is CSS and if not you're going to know
exactly what's the question that you
need to ask and basically asking go
that's it like you know when you become
a web developer or program or software
engineer in general there's going to be
a million different situations that
you're just not going to know it doesn't
matter if you're 5 years and 10 years
and 20 years in what makes your
developer it's not just knowing the code
it's not panicking or quitting right
when you find yourself against a wall
you gotta find an answer I can teach you
the syntax but I can't teach you how to
look for things you have to use your
brain you have to also you know put in
from your part and not think like this
video is going to solve all your
problems you gotta think about it this
person can teach me how to face but I
have to actually go and find the
location where the fish is that think
about it like that
you know Stan mmm keep on watching the
course don't give up keep on going
you're going to be fine trust me believe
in me you're going to learn this by the
end of this course or is going to be
building this full page and you're going
to be surprised because everything that
I'm telling you is going to stick I'm
not here to tell you you're going to
learn this in one video because it can't
be done it can only be done by you
practicing and creating multiple
projects
alright and not giving up alright kids
I'll see you in a little bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
