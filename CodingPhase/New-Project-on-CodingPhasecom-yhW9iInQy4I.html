you already know Superboy joke back at
it again
coding face dot you should finish the
line for me man you should say dot-com
and I'll say dot yeah sitcom you know is
your boy Joe out here man oh you're just
having fun man is living life man you
know saying no to the Buster's you know
what I mean
so we out here man we we in East Coast
shelling with that West Coast rack you
know what I mean like that's what we do
out here
I'm sorry tight-ass shirt I'm just at
home I just finished knocking out a new
project for you guys you know this this
my stay at home stay at home dad sure
you know what I mean guys man we here we
live so yeah so the new project right
now being uploaded at this moment is
very second it's pretty much just how
you call this is like building your own
starter kit people have been asking for
this since the beginning of time they've
been I Joe you've been giving us the web
developer starter kit you know it's nice
that it saves us the time and we don't
have to think about it and all we have
to do it just start coding but I think
now we are ready to start coming in and
building our own and you know we want to
be able to understand what's going on so
basically that's what I did we went over
dope we went over wet pack basically
with it though the whole process of
building this starter kit from the
ground up I gave you guys all my tricks
all the things that I use so you guys
could definitely hit the ground running
okay so I'm gonna share my screen with
you guys is about an hour it's about a
good hour so he
stuff basically there's a website if you
come to coding phase comm you should get
here right you should see your boy out
here that's the latest episode what
program what projects can you use that's
what we saw today earlier basically we
have right here go p-- web developer
starter kit okay you can also see it
through here through courses the images
is being set up right now so by the time
you probably visit a web site it should
have a red image of Gope same images
this okay so you click in there takes
you right here okay you got the course
if you are a member of the website all
you literally have to do it just click
here subscribe for limited courses
you're already a member go to your all
courses or you say go to my courses you
already have access to all of this so as
you can see
gulp web developer starter kit there you
go you know you have all of these and
yeah you're pretty much you know logged
in users how the logged in user see it
you know you could just click on start
and this the whole this the whole
project so yeah this is for the people
that been asking for it man is people
haven't hit me up about this like man
when you're gonna start this when you're
gonna show us how to build our own
starter kit cuz even using parcel Jes
parcel Jes is not that great guys so be
honest because it's like so many
limitations to it that is like man I'd
rather just use something that I could
code from the ground up you know what I
mean you set it up exactly how you want
it so that's why the web developer
starter kits there and yeah just make
your life easier tomorrow we starting
the new project of building a
Craigslist clone with react we use a
react router we're also using no GS for
the back end so it's gonna be a very
simple website we're not doing nothing
crazy we're not doing user
authentication we're not doing nothing
we're just setting everything up we're
setting up react react router basically
setting up the views though some
interactivities showing you guys how to
properly use you know the state I'm
still iffy about if maybe I should add
some Redux to it I don't know yet
it depends on the project maybe I will
maybe I'm not so let's see how it goes
but that's the next project right so
this whole week we're gonna be working
on this Craigslist clone is basically
the whole website of Craigslist but we
rebuilding it with a way better design I
have it right here let me see where is
it so I could show it to you guys you
know sometimes you gotta get excited man
sometimes it's like hey man like I need
to see what the hell I'm building okay
so let me show it to you guys okay this
is the details okay let me open this up
so show you guys the home page alright
so this is the home page that we're
gonna be building okay all of these is
gonna be coming in from database we're
gonna do same thing that we have here
trending now you're gonna have an
account section you're gonna have a
listing page okay we're gonna have all
those filters we're gonna it's a lot of
work I'll be honest guys there's gonna
be a lot of work is not gonna be like a
very simple app is gonna be something
that you're gonna get really good with
react okay cuz everything that you need
it's here okay everything that you're
gonna need for any type of application
is gonna be indistinct
like that's just how it is man so yeah
so this is like the posting page this is
how it looks after you post a a
Craigslist ad so it's gonna be a lot of
cool stuff I don't know if I'm gonna do
this which is like setting up tags I
don't know if I'm gonna do that maybe
maybe not
it depends but a lot of features we're
gonna add to it we're gonna add location
adding you know creating you know a map
from Google Maps from the API so it's a
lot of cool stuff man guys if you really
want to learn how to become a developer
guys you gotta just go visit coding
phase comment everything that I do is
like real projects it's not me coming in
here like hey guys let's do a little
to-do app for no reason no like we
building real projects we building
projects that literally somebody's gonna
ask you to build that your job every
single thing that I put on my website is
stuff that you get to do at a job it's
not like I'm just doing it just to do it
you know what I mean when I tell you
guys hey let's go over PHP let's go over
your rails let's go over or react it's
because it's hot out there you know what
I mean like you're gonna get jobs with
that and at the same time I'm also
thinking about adding some extra stuff
to PHP like I was thinking about Adams
on WordPress because it's very important
out here man like to be honest with you
like there's gonna be so many different
opportunities and I don't want you guys
to be able to be like oh man like I
can't do this because I never went over
it you get what I'm saying like I want
you guys to be prepared for any type of
job that comes to you hey tomorrow they
tell you hey you're gonna work at
freakin Zillow calm as a front-end
developer cool you could do that you
know how to work with API so you know
how to work with react you're very
comfortable
you know I mean now let's say tomorrow
you come in and you say hey I got a
client he wants me to build him a simple
website with a simple back-end hey he
has a WordPress you could build that too
somebody tells you hey could you build
me a team hey you could do that too
somebody hits you up like hey can you
work on a plugin for me a slider for
Shopify for my customer you know my
custom or ecommerce store yeah you could
do that too
you gotta sound like everything that I'm
trying to give you guys it's just stuff
that you can actually put into place for
any type of project that people was
gonna throw at you you know what I mean
like this is not just like hey we
building on skills just to build it nah
man we we out here doing the things that
people are hiring for you get what I'm
saying like I think that's the best part
about this whole website and everything
that I'm doing here on YouTube with you
guys is the fact that we can actually
see the data and see what's going on see
what what type of projects people are
looking for for you know to be able to
hire new developers and then readjust
everything and say okay this is what's
hot right now this is what you need to
learn so by the time you go to your next
interview you're golden you get what I'm
saying so we're never outdated we never
old it's constantly changing up you get
what I'm saying so yeah we in here so
let me see who's in the chatroom man I
haven't haven't really seen nobody in
the chatroom in a minute and it really
sucks man it really sucks because I'm
about to start setting up like a time of
like 9 o'clock till 10 o'clock
Oh every I don't know what city today
Sunday so Sunday Sunday Tuesday and
Thursdays I'm thinking about doing a
nine o'clock a livestream because it
seems like Google is not helping me out
Google is not showing me no love so
what's happening is people are not
getting the notifications okay so
because they're not getting the
notifications
you know people don't know when I'm
gonna go live if I'm live or not so what
I'm gonna do is Sundays at 9:00 p.m.
Tuesdays are 9:00 p.m. and Thursday at
9:00 p.m.
those are the only three days that I'm
gonna go live to make sure we have a lot
of people here with us okay so yeah let
me see
Ramsey Jordan is like you know I'm
adding that to my portfolio I don't care
what nobody says um so let me see Ramsay
Jordan Julius are was is in here new
world websites JC Rodri Arian Chitra
was it airing shesh what stretch stretch
I don't know how to say your name man
Julie is our Genoa yeah man it really
does suck man cuz I know if we also get
the notifications that people will be
like yo you know those notifications I
bet you this will be lit right now we
will have like a hundred two hundred
people live right now but you know how
Google is now you know what I mean so
it's like they playin us right now but
it's okay man we we're not gonna cry a
body cuz we always we always good man so
let's go with you guys
anybody building any cool projects
working or anything interesting I mean
today my whole day has been doing this
this new starter kit for you guys
building it with you guys so that's what
I bring up to also to planning out my
you know the rest of the week I have a
couple of cool interesting videos coming
out pretty soon yeah got a couple of
more portfolios it seems a lot of you
guys want to see more portfolios so I'm
gonna be creating portfolios but not
creating creating video reviews about
the portfolios
so yeah that's what we at right now man
they mean Joseph I just happen to go to
the YouTube home pages so you live yeah
man it sucks man it sucks that you know
I wish the notifications will be there
man like I need you guys to click on the
little bell you know right next to my my
name which says subscribe make sure you
click the little notification right
there man cuz it sucks it sucks that
nowadays they're just like you know what
we're just not gonna give we're not
gonna give any any type of love let me
see if it shows up like the only way
people would know that I'm live is if
for whatever reason they decided to
search my name or for some reason it
shows up on their homepage
besides that like I don't even show up
no more you know what I mean
it's crazy building on a native app with
native script view
cool man that's what's up currently
doing the restaurant package oh I'm
liking it so far and I so so this is a
pretty cool application very simple but
it gets you comfortable with the idea of
using state with using components and
passing down properties to other
components so you know what I mean so I
guess some comfy guess you pretty good
collab says he got the notification on
my phone so at least some people are
getting it you know what I mean like I
haven't gotten no notifications I have
another YouTube account just to see if
if I actually show up on my thing but it
reacting up sometimes man
got the live chat in here word so what's
good man anything new any new news out
there like I haven't really looked at
anybody's channel haven't really paid
attention to anybody I've been like
straight focus on my work you know and
it's good because it's like I'm trying
to stay away from the drama the people
with the haters you know the back
comments the crazy stuff I haven't done
no SEO is crazy we've been growing like
crazy lately right but I haven't done
any any new how you call this like any
new video star like SEO friendly like
all my videos have been like me just I
don't care just basically answering
questions to you guys but I have a
really like focus on my SEO or anything
and I'm getting a lot of subscribers a
lot of new to subscribers which it's
pretty cool man
let me see let me check my analytics see
what's going on with analytics since I'm
getting right now we're getting like
2000 subscribers per month which is kind
of crazy I remember my first few months
I was only getting like 30 subscribers
the whole month which means I was
getting like 1 subscriber birthday you
know how crazy that sounds like yeah it
was bad man yeah so we've been getting
19 we got 19 hundred subscribers this
month of January or the past month of
January so let me see which videos right
now my top ten videos currently are
let's go into let's look into the
analytics
all right so how not to be broke
okay it makes sense right coding fees
interview with the Shang how to find a
web developer job in your area I think
that's one of my best videos because
it's like you could use that and really
get a lot of knowledge pre cocaine
versus coding boot camps
ask me anything let's talk about code
the most disappointing day since I
opened this channel yeah it was very
disappointing that they stopped looking
for junior developer programming jobs
it's true
let me see while I learn PHP in 2018
life is not perfect
life is not perfect you know I love that
title hang out with me while rebuild
coding phase com that was pretty cool
let me see by the views so why I learned
PHP in 2018 so you see like that's a a
video that will consider like an SEO
type video like I haven't done that like
this is actually old it's from October
if I'm sober xxx but for some reason now
is popular you know what I'm saying so
it's weird
let me see how it'll be an online store
with JavaScript
guess people want to see that this will
for some reason people love this video
you can't become a developer in three
months
in a three-month boot camp that video
between that video and the freako cam
video people hating people be like yo
man like cuz it's like people are up for
it they're like okay they want to say
that boot camps are good and then some
people want to say boot camps are bad
it's crazy
let's see my moles
yeah you can't become a developer
probably because all the boot camps are
promoting in that video that's my that's
my most the best one that guess I got
the most revenue out of it this is
hilarious yeah man
it's kind of crazy how Ridgeview
duration is five minutes so most of my
videos the majority people just watch
like five minutes of it which is
actually good so I was like sometimes I
make videos like 20 minutes long like I
definitely understand people be like yo
man I can't be here for that long it's
fine it's not for everybody I don't
think that everybody's gonna watch like
a full interview or like a full full
video but it's good it's good to know
that at least the majority of people
watch about like 5 minutes as an average
alright and like depending if the videos
like 20 minutes people watch about like
10 minutes so I was like half of the
video which is fine it's totally fine
that's what I'm trying to create videos
with more how can I say like more
information in the beginning so make
sure I cram in all the the small like
not the small dog that the things that
people are really there for cuz you know
even sometimes I'm explaining something
in a long video and like I'm just
answering multiple people's what I'm
trying to just talk about one topic for
10 minutes straight right and then from
there at the end just cut it you know so
let's see how it goes when it's 2018
we're trying to do something great out
here man you already know it's kumbaya
Joe out here so let me see who's in the
chatroom
see if anybody came up
you know I want you guys to come check
out this uh this this new girl call
aveline Rose I want you guys to come
through come show her some love i'ma
show you guys her channel real quick
I want you guys when you guys get a
chance come show her some love you know
she's new I like what she's saying a lot
of the stuff that she's talking about is
pretty interesting
I guess she went to a boot camp in is
pretty cool they learning Ruby and which
is interesting because people say all
the time
Ruby is dead the Ruby is dissing that
but it's like hey Ruby is like one of
the best languages out there to learn
right so here's a channel Avenue Rose
when you go to her channel be like yo
leave her comment be like yo freakin Joe
sent me here or just put like coding
free sent me here and just like show her
some love man subscribe
she just started she just got in the
game 227 subscribers you know it's
pretty interesting what she she has to
say like her her point of view of like
her becoming a developer so it's pretty
cool so definitely check out when you
get a chance aveline Rose that's her
name
I think so yeah you know me man I'm out
here I do the things that I wish people
would would have done for me when I
first started coming into here - you -
because it's like sometimes you have
like really cool content and nobody gets
to find you because the way how Google
works so it's like if I have a little
bit of our audience and I can help
somebody else out like whatnot you know
what I mean like most of these guys they
wouldn't do it for me you know what I
mean they would definitely would not do
it for you so it's like if if I don't
come in as I continue to grow and my
channel continues to grow if I don't
come in and change that type of that
world that we live in of like
everybody's out here like crabs and like
don't want to see other youtubers grow
besides them you know I feel like only I
could change that I'm the only person
that can do it because nobody else is I
feel like nobody else out here is really
comfortable with the idea of hey my
subscribers is gonna subscribe to
somebody else because they really think
that if they come to that other person
they're not gonna come back to their
channels like now like people watch me
they watch was the other girl rules
Barry they watch Eric they watch Krishan
they watch traversing media that watch
Chris Hawkes like it's cool when you
find like a lot of new you know a lot of
new channels so it's like if one of the
channels that you really like is
supporting a new channel it's like it
helps that person up to grow a little
bit faster you know but what do I know
you know what I mean I'm just kumbaya
Joe while here you know what I mean like
most people they don't think like me
most people is all about themselves man
yeah I was like thinking about it I was
like man I wish I could just be like a
snake if I could just be a snake man
like if I could just be like one of
those dudes man who just like just snake
everybody out like I wish I could be
like that
I just can't um it's not in my nature is
it's not who I am you know what I mean
but yeah man
definitely check how Evelyn Rose door so
Ruby so that's pretty cool I always
support people do a ruby for sure oh let
me see what else people are saying here
Julia and Julius are is working on a
porn streaming site with the red tube
API that's cool to be honest with you I
don't even know that they had a API
Rhett to patent a API
that's crazy let me see
yeah man you gotta click on the the bell
guys go to the bottom of the video you
see where it says subscribe make sure
you click on the little bell there's a
little bell there click on that man so
you can get the notifications man
because if not if we leave it to Google
Google is never gonna show us love man
so it's like we we have to do it
ourselves you know that means like we
gotta fight against the system it's like
you know channels like me people like me
we're never supposed to be in the game
right we was never supposed to be where
we at right now but we definitely fight
against the system and we just say hey
man Google don't want to show love
forget it we still gonna show up you
know what I mean well that's fine man
let me see
the names of those videos can you make
your e-commerce website Ruby on Rails of
course why go to a bootcamp when you can
get a computer science for the same
price in an in-state yeah exactly that's
kind of that's my thing that's like if I
really wanted to say hey if I'm gonna
pay twenty thousand dollars just to say
hey I'm gonna do this in three months
it's like now I learned that on my own
and I'm gonna get a computer science
degree from my local university that's
it
to rouse
like I already subbed to her before it
was cool word yeah man how well this
treehouse front end track prepare you
for a real job I think it gives you the
it gives you the tools to get you
started but then it's up to you how you
how deep you want to go you know what I
mean</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
