again man code offense calm I want to
welcome you guys to my PHP course all
right learn PHP 7mv not okay I want you
guys to get used to this because this
idea of 90 PHP in 2017 it seems like
some people will tell you don't learn it
some people tell you learn it well now
I'm gonna give you reasons to learn PHP
all right I want you to know that PHP is
the number one programming language when
it comes to the web right it's not the
fastest it's not the most popular
between developers well when it comes to
businesses and businesses are the ones
that hire you PHP is number one right
there's so many websites out there using
WordPress there's so many websites out
there there's an arrow there's so many
websites out there using code ignitor
ass lame there's so many different
frameworks that people use symfony like
that guys the list goes on and on and on
frameworks that people use for PHP now
I'm going to go over a couple of pages
here to show you why you should learn
PHP okay so first of all you now look at
this as you can see pretty much this are
a couple of the most popular websites
that are actually using PHP at this
moment all right
so either they're using it through
WordPress and a backend or using it
through using a framework like laravel
etc right they all using PHP and one of
the biggest guys ever
alright the biggest website in the world
was built and still being used with PHP
which is facebook.com you guys can look
it up Facebook has been built with PHP
is it's pretty popular even though by
now they they pretty much have modified
the language to work for them but is
pretty much PHP on the core all right
now let's go to the next page I'm gonna
give you guys this example because on
the internet on the web and the Internet
in their webs how people call it
nowadays they say hey man PHP is dying
in PHP is dead PHP is underground no
it's not what's happening is as you can
see this is a trend chart okay trends
trends okay so when they say trends is
usually websites start popping up but
what does that mean popping up well
those are new websites right so if I'm a
new company a new startup and I'm
looking on which programming language I
should use a developer a senior
developer a software engineer will say
hey let's use the latest things you know
we got no GES we've got lik Siri with
that Python showing up you know people's
gonna want to use what they like right
and one thing that you have to
understand PHP is not a pretty language
PHP is not the best language out there
PHP is not the fastest so as a developer
they're going to choose something that's
fast something that's fun something that
they're gonna enjoy using but that does
not discredit the fact that PHP is being
used in millions and millions of
websites right in businesses right
because you gotta send startups come and
go very rare to see a company that's a
start-up becomes successful but
businesses that are already established
they are using technologies that have
been proven to work so they use stuff
like PHP alright now I want you guys to
just keep that in mind whenever you hear
somebody tell you hey PHP is dead PHP is
underground
you know PHP is a zombie out here all
right it's funny is one of those things
that people love to say on the internet
but it's not the reality of those
especially for junior developers
you yourself probably isn't your
developer somebody who's brand-new who's
trying to get into the industry so if
you want to get into the industry you
should be using something that's gonna
give you the most chances to get a job
right a lot of people will say hey I
want to use something that's cool and
popular and it's in right now but the
reality of things is the jobs out there
the ones that you're gonna be able to
get they want people that are actually
you know established somebody who has
been doing this for a couple of years
your brand new developer so your
opportunities are really with PHP
because the other thing about like this
this guys who have been doing PHP for
10-15 years
right they're seeming level developers
right and they're like oh man I've been
doing PHP for so long or try side miles
I want to go to another company I'll go
work with nodejs so now they leave that
company but now that space is still open
who else is gonna get that job isn't
most likely is not gonna be another
senior developers a son a senior
developer isn't looking for the new
technologies he's looking to have fun
and enjoy his time at work but for you
you're a junior developer you're
somebody who's trying to get into the
industry you don't care what the job is
as long as you're doing what development
this is where you win this is where you
come in and say hey I know PHP let me
get that job alright so the company is
going to hire you because of that
because you're coming in hungry you want
to do the work you enjoy PHP you know
you've been around a few months so you
haven't been burnt that burnt down etc
right things that happens to developers
so let's move on to the next thing which
is showing you like the real numbers
behind the scenes of like a lot of
websites right so we have PHP lead in
the way of the top 10,000 sites meaning
the most popular web sites on the web
period 20% some almost throughout the
whole board it's always going to be 20%
from 18 to 20% constantly right in
Ephrata
speed on a Ruby on Rails lawn GES
Express Python Django larvae etc right
you start looking at the top 1000 it's
the same people all right start looking
at the top 1 million all right it's
pretty simple this almost the same thing
the entire web you start looking you're
like oh man
I pretty much PHP just runs the web when
it comes to web sites all right so I
would definitely sing for you guys to
learn PHP ok now we're gonna look into
this we're gonna come here and we're
gonna look at jobs right first of all
we're gonna look at Ruby right we got
Ruby in New York New York City you know
let's say let's say 50 mile radius from
New York City
alright fine that there's about 77 jobs
this month right now in Ohio which is a
third market you know pretty much a
smaller city you know the middle of
nowhere you got 17 jobs for Ruby no
rails right we do the same thing for
node I'm ENGLISH I know there's three
jobs in a third market which is
something that I tell people a lot of
times like unless you live on a major
city most companies are not using no GS
or the latest programming languages or
back in languages I don't they're using
more safe on languages ok so this will
fall for no js' right in Ohio
in New York City no GS there's about
fifty three jobs for this month ok now
let's look into PHP ok there's 128 for
PHP which means the double of No
in a very big city like New York City
especially a tech city like New York all
right
so you look at this is 128 so you got
twice the amount of jobs okay now just
do the same thing Ohio let's look and
you got 13 jobs in Ohio
that's not bad to be honest with you
look at this our smaller cities they're
now really how you call it and I really
like tech companies are usually locating
the cities but that doesn't mean that
there's not jobs because if you start
looking at places like you know like
Craigslist
indeed.com is only like a small part of
your search for jobs online right yeah
indeed.com you got Craigslist you got
dice comm this you got monster there's a
whole bunch of places that you can find
jobs right zipper cooler you know so
pretty much this a whole bunch of places
that you can find jobs for PHP but like
I said one thing that you wouldn't
notice is that the starting range for it
right is a 60,000 for PHP and $75,000 in
New York City now what this number tells
me is that there's definitely a lower
salary to start with PHP than other
languages like Ruby on Rails or nodejs
but you gotta always remember this when
a company is paying a lot of money
like I say 75 for let's say 80,000
90,000 hundred thousand they're looking
for top you know the top of the top
those developers right so in reality as
a junior developer who sells toy your
chances of getting those jobs in reality
is less all right so what you want to do
is you want to be able to build a resume
and say hey I've been working at this
company this company in this company to
get those higher paying jobs
right talking about 80,000 90,000
hundred thousand dollars so get those
jobs I would definitely advise it's in
our th feet
learning learn how to build websites
learn how to build web applications and
I have some work with databases like my
sequel model DVD etc right and they're
from there
give yourself a year apply for those
bigger jobs right a lot of people get
discouraged because they come in and
they say hey man I need to learn you
know the latest thing out there and then
they can't find a job and why is that
because you know think about it all the
top developers out there are also
learning that new technology that you
just learned so now you're competing
with guys who have been around 6 7 8 9
10 years in the industry and then you're
a social developer coming in and that
has no history of working on any company
so it's like why will this company trust
you to you know to hire you it's very
rare it happens you know but it's one of
those things that is just a little bit
of luck a lot of times people forget
about that they forget about that little
extra factor in life that's just like
okay you came and you smile the right
person you you talk to the right person
that they the person was in a really
good mood and say okay let me give it a
chance to this guy but that doesn't
happen for everybody right you have to
put yourself in situations where you
have control of things you just don't
leave it to luck right when you join
something like a community like for PHP
and you're trying to learn PHP learning
Maribelle etc whatever framework you
want to learn out there but you're using
PHP it gives you the opportunity to get
into the industry by you having your own
skills and just coming in and say okay I
got the skills I'm ready to work I have
a portfolio give me an opportunity I'm
here to work you're going to get that
alright when you try to learn the latest
and greatest languages out there you're
competing with the whole world
because everybody wants to learn those
things everybody wants to get those cool
jobs where is it oh yeah you're working
on Python you're working on Ruby or else
all you're working on on ODS yes but
what didn't you think that if everybody
else is trying to learn those things and
everybody else is trying to get those
jobs don't you think the competition is
gonna be a little bit more fuse right so
so be smarter you will say hey I'm gonna
come in join an ecommerce website join
up a digital agency bill a couple of
WordPress sites for a few months build
my resume build my portfolio let
companies know that hey I have the
skills give me a chance hire me now
because I have the skills now I mean so
I definitely tell people NAR PhD you
have to learn teaching is a mandatory
doesn't matter if rain now and 2017 you
start it right let's say you start in
September learning how to code in
December 2017 you got a job as a web
developer and they have a backing a PHP
you're going to use PHP thing it doesn't
matter if it's 2017 for 2021 at some
point you're going to have to use PHP
doesn't matter what company in is
doesn't matter you know what is it that
you're doing the front end of the back
end at some point you're going to bump
into that little elf of PHP now do you
want to say hey I want to learn PHP at
that moment I'll say hey I'm already
prepared for PHP it's an easy language
and it's gonna give me the opportunity
to get into the industry so I will
definitely tell you guys learn PHP and
that's what you did all right so I'll
see you guys in the next video Wow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
