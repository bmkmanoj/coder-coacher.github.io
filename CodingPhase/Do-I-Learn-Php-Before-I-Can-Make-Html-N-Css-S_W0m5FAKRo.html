good morning alright guys so I got this
question in one of the comments somebody
was asking me hey Joe do I learn PHP
even though I cannot turn a PSD to HTML
or you know HTML CSS I can't do it
I don't know basically this person
doesn't know the basics yet right so if
they can't if they can't turn out a PSD
design or image designer a sketch design
and turn it into a web page I'll be
honest guys don't learn PHP yet because
you don't know the basics of the web
right PHP is the backend server right
some some people they do this they they
learn a back-end language or they learn
programming right and usually it happens
to people who do like computer science
alright so like let's say you you go to
a college and they you go through you
know intro to computer science and then
you go to job line then you go to C++
and then from there they say hey let's
start going into more advanced topics
Python and then nobody comes and tells
you hey you have to learn the basics of
the web which is HTML and CSS like if
you know those things you can build any
page out of any design right but some
people dig they take a different route
right because when you're doing like
more programming and computer science
also it's like you take the route of the
programming languages but you have to
understand one thing if you want to get
into web development
you don't learn programming first you
learn HTML or CSS first that's what you
gotta do
because if you even if you right now you
get higher as a PHP developer right the
employer your manager or your client is
gonna expect for
you two actually know how to build the
page they're gonna give you a design and
I say hey we want to build this if you
can't build it then from there they got
to hire somebody else
they gotta hire a front-end developer
which makes no sense because it's like
if you working as a PHP developer you
should know how to build a page it's
that simple
so you know that's my that's my take on
it guys so you know unless you're you're
coming from a computer science
background like that's understandable
it's like hey man I learned programming
first and you know at first I wanted to
be a software engineer at first I wanted
to do game development right that's
understandable right and you're like you
know what man I need to get a job in web
development so that's it that's
understandable
but if you're basically uh somebody who
started from scratch starting from zero
and you don't know HTML CSS it's like
that's what you need to learn it's like
you skipping steps you know don't skip
steps guys you know it's like this other
kid to who
actually you know I'm actually doing
some research in my area there's not
anybody that that's doing web
development you know so there's like
5,000 businesses that I can actually
start serving them with WordPress
websites and I'm doing the web developer
bootcamp from coal but now I'm starting
to think about them like you know what
I'm gonna leave this alone and I'm gonna
go learn WordPress and what I told it
was like yo continue the what developer
who can't finish it because that's
what's going to teach you web
development in general everything from
the front end to the back end you know
especially javascript javascript is so
important right now that if even if you
start a business like you could start a
business of creating WordPress websites
and you don't start buying themes and
start selling it to businesses but the
problem is that that every business is
gonna come in and tell you hey can you
make this animation slower can you
change this this slider can you do this
this and that right if you don't know
how to do that then now you gotta hire
another Indian worker to help you out
with this
you know sometimes like that
happens all the time like you know
somebody's like oh and got a startup
business and I'm gonna start selling you
know WordPress websites then they hire
remote guys from India to come in and
just do simple things things that they
could have just learned you know just
from taking that web developer bootcamp
so it's like for you you actually
started learning it so it's like just
finish it you could literally finish it
this week I don't know if you're working
right now full-time or was your story I
think your name is Zach Zachary I don't
know Zach what I would say to you is man
just finish it
boss he asked this week if you want to
jump to WordPress that's fine but you
still need to know the basics of web
development
because it's like you're gonna skip a
lot of steps man trust me like the web
developer bootcamp the reason why I tell
people to take it because it's just like
the introduction to web development it
shows you everything people even
love what happens when you you know
because people's gonna want at least if
you want to actually learn something if
you actually want to be here as a web
developer then you got to know those
things now if you want to be just like a
project manager and you want to get you
know you just want to get clients that's
different because then you could just
you know you can start opening up a
business and I even have to touch the
code you can start hiring you know
Indian workers for like five dollars an
hour and you know you still make a
profit but if you really got to be a web
developer then you have to learn what
what the hell what development is you
can't just skip it and be like hey I'm
just gonna learn WordPress WordPress is
still web development but it's not like
the big picture because it happens to a
lot of people there's times that you
skip steps and you skip on certain
things and then later on you don't know
how to do it you're like oh man I gotta
go back into the beginning and learn
this you know how many people have had
to learn from you know JavaScript all
the way from the beginning like they had
to learn it twice because they didn't
find the right resources like that
should happen to me you know like when I
learned JavaScript I focus on jQuery and
I was like man I'm just gonna focus on
jQuery get this done and I could start
building websites right away but then
when I started to build like more
complex applications I was like man I
don't really know JavaScript and that's
when I got that other course which is
the weird parts of we're parts of
JavaScript so
that's all I'm saying you know kids just
learn just learn you guys know web
development and take that web developers
bootcamp all right now if you like my
style you like my my flow the way how I
do things
then you could go check out you know
coding face.com
I got my courses there man all of my
courses is gonna be there all my
tutorials all my free tutorials is gonna
be there too I'm putting everything
there man so it's up to you guys right
we ain't here man live live before going
to work I'm actually coming into work
super late man I'm so pissed off that I
come I gotta come in late because the
thing was that the baby did not let me
sleep and then the AC is not all night
so I woke up like a 5 in the morning
sweating my eyes hurt because I haven't
slept and then for whatever reason I you
know my mom was a teacher so now she's
she's in vacation time so she's a
vacation time and like that's you guys
may know she's staying in my house now
and she's over here you know watching
the bathroom but I have a bathroom right
next to my room I have two bathrooms in
my house all right so my mom wakes up
and she's washing the
bathroom making my nose I'm like yo I
can't sleep it's 7 o'clock in
the morning why are you washing
the bathroom like what the I try to
take a quick nap I'm like I'm just gonna
rest my eyes and next thing I know I'm
coming in 11 o'clock in the morning to
work which means I got to stay at work
which I did not want
what is
I thought the end of the song before the
end of the weekend forwarding
love working it's a big difference it's
like you know when you were a developer
like you caught it at your own time like
I wouldn't mind doing this work you know
like a 2 o'clock from 2 to I guess 10
o'clock at night but coding in
the morning it's like you're already
cranky you haven't got enough sleep
you're tired and now I got to
probably see people with attitudes like
oh I'm tired I haven't been able
to sleep in like three weeks
now that's not true when you look up
Larry
the
also
in the world Perry
bring everybody is actually switching up
so
especially if you're working on a new
project and you need to to build it you
got to work in I rebelled man now you
know there's a huge difference there's a
huge difference between you know working
in a company like let's say a huge
company like you know Google whatever
right of course they're not gonna use
laravel because IRL they don't need it
they just have so many developers like
they could build their own network their
own framework they could build
everything from scratch but when you
don't have that the huge infrastructure
you basically you learn laravel like you
use laravel for everything or you know a
few years ago everybody was using Ruby
on Rails for everything because it's
just a framework that makes your life
easier you get the prototype of website
you could build the website quicker like
you know my company is the website that
we have is humongous it's huge
it's like a lot of code if we will sue
code that from scratch it would have
taken twice as long to build a website
you know so that's the thing yeah if you
go if you I'm telling you right now if
you see anywhere where they talking
about coding knight or king PHP run from
there get out of there don't even apply
to that because that means those are
companies that you do not want to be in
those are companies that are very
outdated like they don't keep up with
the newest trends they don't keep up
with new code
so you're basically gonna be working on
legacy code from like 1990 something if
they're talking about
cakephp you're talking about like
1999-2000 you don't want to be working
in that type of environment
but it's up to you I mean everybody has
their depression me I like to work on
cool projects that's my thing if you're
gonna spend eight to ten hours working
on a project might as well be good right
okay kay so I'm gonna see you guys later
a little bit lunch breaks see you in the
lunch break all right bow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
