back at it again man : face calm listen
today's topic is a very good topic right
this is something that you guys can
actually learn from right so there's
this developer who created this this
blog where he explains all the things
that went wrong with him
after leaving Facebook you know
sometimes we work for a company and we
think oh man I could do this better than
them I could go in create my own project
I'm gonna you know what I'm going to
create my own startup I'm gonna quit
this job and I'm gonna do this on my own
but what they don't realize is creating
your own startup is creating your own
business to create your own business you
got to have a team it's not just one
person most of the time somebody can try
to do a small little business right by
themselves but if you want to really be
successful you gotta have the right team
around you the right people that can
help you achieve certain goals so this
developer he he wrote this whole blog
explaining how you know he left Facebook
thinking oh I'm gonna create this
product I'm I'm a great developer I
could create anything so you know why
why am i doing it for Facebook for when
I could just go and create my own
startup all right so what he didn't
count for was number one heeding half a
goal set you know a sales team he didn't
have a good sales team that's one he
didn't have connections he didn't have
no way to get venture capital money you
know so at the end of the day now the
whole blog is about him regretting the
fact that he left Facebook him if he
could do it again he would do it you
know he wouldn't do it the same way he
would basically just stay at Facebook
and be a regular developer sometimes you
know we we all think that we all come up
with ideas and we're like man you know
to make this you know this encryption
you know ten times faster than whatever
company right or come up with a product
were you like oh I can make this in such
an efficient way but reality sometimes
you're not building something for the
customers you're not building something
for clients you're building something
for you and your friends where you could
be like oh look at this smart code by
reality you're not solving nobody's
problems so that's what happened to that
guy he basically he created a startup
that wasn't solving nobody's problems
cuz you gotta do research before you
leave your job you gotta be smart you
can't just be like oh I'm a smart
engineer I'm gonna go create my own
startup know do some research man leg
straight up like do some research find
out exactly what people need find our
needs you know don't try to create a
company or a start-up that's gonna be
super broad try to find one that's a
neat you know like something like let's
say an example um I don't know let's say
cuz almost everything has been created
out there right almost every single
service that's out there has been
created but let's say you create an app
right where um you could serve like
mechanics or whatever right where you
did go take a picture of a certain tool
that they're missing or search online
search on your app when you'll be like
okay I'm gonna sell this to auto
mechanics or I'm gonna sell this tool
for all the dentists or I'm gonna sell
this tool for all the the doctors like
you gotta solve a problem you can't just
leave your job to just create some
 thing where you know oh yeah
maybe I could create a file uploader
maybe I could give competition to mega
calm or to Dropbox it's like those
services have already been there already
there they've already been solved like
right so now you got to create other
stuff right
so this is just like a great example for
you guys man if you're gonna leave your
job leave it for a good reason
either you going to a company is going
to pay you more or you're gonna leave
the company to create something that's
going to solve a problem
don't leave your company just because
you think like oh I'm so smart and I
could create why am i working for
 Mark Zuckerberg when I could
going create my own company and it's
like nobody you're not solving anybody's
problem like Mark Zuckerberg he created
this website because it solved the
problem the problem was when you're in
high school you're in college there was
no way to communicate with your other
classmates and be in contact with them
so then he said you know what I'm going
to make this even better because people
can't get in contact with their family
members and their best friends and and
seeing being able to see what happened
to them in the weekends and whatever
right so he created Facebook made it
even more bigger you know for a bigger
audience so when you're creating
something you got to make sure you do
your research man so make sure you just
do your research you know what I mean
about yeah um let me see I know a lot of
people on the chat so let me see what up
let me see was who's in here uh we got
cramps
we got fantastic we got Barbara
we got who else's thing here we've got
Debbie on David Lee let me see wells
roses in here TIA
alexis is in here who else is in here
I'm seen hmm a cache is in here
Clarence is in here one searching for
truth is in here
what up Dan what up me hermano the spine
yup my boyfriend Spain Dan is in here
Lorenzo's in here we got a squad man
yeah no I was just reading this blog and
I was like you know what man I gotta
talk about this cuz sometimes we get
that urge and we'd be like man why am i
working for this company man when I
could just create my own thing and
sometimes it's like you can't it's like
now I'm saying that you can't create
your company but just do your research
be smart it's like you don't leave your
your job until you have the next job so
if you're creating a company you don't
leave the company you're with at the
moment until you have something solid
you just don't take that risk you know
some people would be like oh you can't
be scared of failure and it's like yes
you should be scared of failure because
now you just become one of those
people who are just constantly failing
like you're not it's very rare for
people to just keep failing right and
then out of nowhere get something that
they become successfully you know like
this guy Gary Vee always says oh man
don't be scared about failure don't be
scared about this and that and as I
guess you should be scared because some
people don't have those safety nets you
know what I mean is like a person who
who works at a hospital right and
they're like you know what I'm a janitor
at the hospital or I'm a
receptionist at the hospital I'm not
gonna leave this job
for an adventure it's like hey I'm gonna
take an adventure around the world and
now when they come back all their bills
is up to the top they got
the house repossessed they got a whole
bunch of most people don't have the
option to do like that you know
what like you can't just be like oh I'm
just gonna take this adventure in like a
venture out and be like oh it you
only live once
yeah you only live once but what happens
after that after that event right you
say oh I'm gonna leave my job I'm going
to do this in that out of nowhere and
you don't have a plan B you don't have a
plan C what happens after that do you
come back and just be completely
up or if you're smart you say hey I have
this plan where it's like if I'm going
to take this adventure I know there's
something else on the side for me you
know because most of us are in love with
you guys like me right now if I go if I
quit my job and be like hey man I'm just
going to quit my job and be a full-time
youtuber where and YouTube I only make
20% of what I make on on my real job
right if I go out take that adventure
right now and then what if doesn't
plan out what if three months later
doesn't plan out and then I started
going into my savings and then six
months later goes I go and freakin spend
all my savings and then I'm broke
what do I do after that you know what I
mean like do I start from zero and now I
 just be a failure and then oh
yeah you know I wasn't scared to fail I
fail two three times it's like now I'm
the type of person I never fail because
I only do that is gonna be concrete
like I don't take adventures I don't do
 that I know that I'm not sure I'm
not gonna be successful you know what I
mean like that's the type of person I am
you know like people just gotta be smart
man out here
like if I'm working for Facebook you
think I'm gonna leave Facebook for an
adventure to just be like hey I'm just
gonna try something new I'm gonna quit
my job and go work at my own company
without no background in business no
idea of what the hell I'm actually
creating it's just like I'm smart and
I'm gonna be able to to make it like nah
man you gotta use your brain you know
you gotta exactly how Barbara said you
got to have realistic plans man and you
got a plan set out because yeah you only
live once
but at the same time it's like it's your
life man like when you fail and you
 up how you think there's a lot of
people that end up homeless
there's a lot of people that they have
businesses and then they fail right and
then they're working on
McDonald's or some like that's not
gonna be me
you know what I mean like I'm not trying
to do that is not concrete if I
don't know 100% I'm gonna make money on
that I don't do it that's the type of
person I am you know I do my research I
can't be out here taking chances
like you know like people do do a lot of
 is they back like bring it back to
like back in high school days right
when I was in high school people were
like yo Joe you got a jumper man you're
a nice man you can go to college and
play ball and this and that right I
wasn't trying to do that because
that wasn't to me sports was like
lottery like I knew that Sports is not
for everybody not everybody's gonna make
it like what if I go and try to
base my whole life around sports and be
like man I got a jumper just because I
got that jumper I could go and make it
to the NBA maybe now I'm not gonna make
it to the NBA and then now I will be
 right now I will be what a
a junior high school gym teacher
sort of like that earning $30,000 a
year like that's what happens to a lot
of people
a lake you gotta be smart
take risk just calculate the most people
fail because they don't put in the work
to execute the plan properly yes that
can be true - yes that's definitely can
be true - I just think people don't
don't plan things out man people don't
know what the hell they're doing in this
world like they're walking around
without planning out like me I
already have my five-year plan you know
it's like I already know exactly what I
want to do with my life you can't be out
here doing taking risks and doing
adventures if you don't know exactly
what you're going to do you could dream
you can have dreams but you can't be a
dreamer out here you hurt
that's right here see a little dreamer
so I'm a little baby out here we just
came out how was the baby but like the
