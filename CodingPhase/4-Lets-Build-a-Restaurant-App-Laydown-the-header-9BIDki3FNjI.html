to do this is I like to look at the
header and start building it from there
alright so I start going from the top to
bottom okay so the first thing that
we're gonna do is we're going to create
a component called header so we're going
to copy this cuz all of this is
basically portably right all other stuff
is something that we're going to be
doing constantly every time that we
create a new component so what we're
going to do is we're going to just
duplicate this alright and then from
there we're gonna call this header that
jes okay
we're going to change a couple of things
here we're going to name this header
alright and then that's pretty much it
as far as that right so here we're going
to come in and change this to header
okay now on the apogee yes we're
actually going to import that that
component so we're gonna say import
header from and then we say hey we're in
the same folder so I'm gonna say dot
Hatter dot Jes okay import that and now
up here we're going to say something
like header like that so now we actually
displaying what we have here like we're
gonna say header header file
I had a component right okay now let's
look into our basically our code that we
have here now let's see what we
half v-loc although your head up or
header from header let me debug this for
a second okay
can every properly state of no okay
so one thing that we have to do is we
want to pass down a couple of props
right so we're gonna say something like
this when I say state and then pass down
state and we're going to pass down
actions so every single component save
that okay so everything is working so
you can see it says how to comp which is
coming from here so this component is
already loading just fine we're going to
delete this stuff here okay we're going
to change a couple of things on the CSS
real quick I'm going to delete all of
this stuff here okay remove this
background remove the background colors
from it okay there you go so we got a
blank page now now we can come here and
start messing with it you know one cool
thing tool that if you guys haven't
tried this out this is there's are you
calling this package from Adam that's
pretty useful where you can right click
this and Adam preview is by this guy
called Sean Colts so now inside of Adam
inside of a pain you have a browser so
now you don't even really have to leave
Adam at all so we can say local holes
three thousand and there you go okay now
let me see something like this okay they
save that header comp all right now
let's look at this header so we got a
logo and then we have a menu and then we
have like a restoration button so let's
do that we're gonna say home pages let's
just create real stuff that our
restaurant website should have so I'm
gonna come back to the header this is
the head of component remember that okay
and it's out of here we're going to say
something like this we want to say live
class name or you can say class name
which is more like a react but you could
also just say class and say class let's
say logo okay put a logo here save that
when you save that this should
refresh let me see how to comp hold on
you got a press control-c here because
browser linked and i'll see this file
when the first loading so we gotta say
MPM run watch
all right no okay there you go
everything should be fine let me see
logos yeah
so now it's out of refreshing okay so
let me see div class logo and then let's
see what else we have here we have two
menu so we're gonna say you will or we
can say nav all right say nav and then
put in anchor links in here
hrf for now we're just gonna say hashtag
so you're gonna say link home alright
let's look at an example of TGIF what do
they have on their website okay let that
load
okay menu party prat menu party planners
location gift cards rewards so let's put
the same thing you're gonna come in
we're gonna say menu platters locations
let's say rewards and let's say
restoration reservations
okay that's fine oops
alright so a logo menu party platters
location rewards reservations
right and I think we had reservations
was was his own button by itself so let
me see we just leave it like that
we don't even have to separate it for
this section all right
like I said guys we're getting inspired
by this design but we're not doing every
single thing in the design right cuz the
type of restaurant that we're gonna
build it's not just gonna be how this
person built in like you know usually
when a designer comes in they create
like a prototype there's like an idea of
things that they will build but things
change in real life like you know
designer might come in and gives you
something that looks amazing it looks
beautiful but reality technically it
wouldn't work or it wouldn't serve his
purpose like you know for whatever
reason so that's what's gonna happen
with this we're gonna look at this
design but we're not building exactly
how the design is all right so let's see
what's the next thing that we want to do
okay so we're gonna do the header all
right then let's work on a CSS for a
little bit or maybe we should leave that
for the next video what do you guys
think alright I'll see you guys in the
next video we're gonna do the CSS I
usually like to do it like this where I
do HTML or just laying out whatever it
is that I need to build first and then
start messing with the CSS later on
