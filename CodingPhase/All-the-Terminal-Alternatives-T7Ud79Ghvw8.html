alternatives to the regular terminal
that's on your app dock right on your
launchpad and when you come here and you
click on terminal this is pretty much
the default terminal right there's the
default terminal that comes with Macs
and in Linux they also have a default
terminal usually like Ubuntu or Sint OS
they have a default terminal but what if
you're tired of using that same terminal
or you want extra features well this
other ones you know so we have one which
is called item two this one's pretty
cool I've actually used it a couple of
times a basically pretty similar to the
regular terminal it has like a few
little you know a few little features
like you know let's screen hotkeys let
me see what else you can do a search
autocomplete no mouse let's copy paste
history
instant replay which is just pretty much
going back on whatever you did basically
configure it also to change the colors
however you want it you know expose tab
there's a lot of cool things that it has
you know rerun command I mean this is
cool like this the new version of
version 3 have you even tried this one I
definitely gotta check it out but it
seems pretty legit so it's like you know
for you guys that are always looking for
the latest and greatest things out there
and you just want to try out whatever
it's new then check out I turn to now we
have hyper hyper is another terminal
which is made with JavaScript HTML CSS
it's made with electron this is pretty
cool because in reality is just think of
it it's like a page that's I look at it
you know because it's HTML CSS and
JavaScript so you can go in there and
customize it however you want you could
change the font change the cursors
there's so many little things that you
can go in there and just customize it
too high
you want it that it just makes it pretty
pretty cool for for developers to work
on you know and they have a very good
documentation in case you want to mess
around with the code behind the scenes
and even come you know compile your own
terminal all right so this is pretty
cool now of course there's a little bit
more events like if you just want to
download it for what it is for whatever
the programming comes with then that's
fine but always think about it like this
you have so many different options and
so many different things that you could
change on this all right so that's one
now
oh my Z asan z SH is pretty much it's
like in addition to your terminal right
it's in reality just is adding a few
extra features that you you didn't have
here on your terminal this is cool a lot
of people like using it you know you
have plugins you have a whole bunch of
stuff that you can use you know one of
the cool things about it that people
like this in the themes like I've seen a
lot of people do this
where they have you know it shows them
what branch they're in on the terminal
like people like this stuff and they
like to change the colors on their
terminals everybody's insulates and
these things guys so basically these are
like the top you know top three
alternatives to the regular terminal you
know me personally what I use is all my
zsh pretty much is just a regular
terminal and then on top of that you put
in the Omar's es aging just gives you a
little extra features like you see the
little icon right here the little arrow
that means I'm using it and you see here
since zsh you know you could tell our
views in it so ain't nothing too crazy
but it just it gives you a couple of
cool little features nothing out of this
world where you say oh my god I have to
get it personally if you feel like oh
you want to get something cool something
new I will say try I turn to or hyper
all my CSH is more like
upgrade to your regular turbine another
thing that I want to tell you guys is if
you are a Adam user make sure you
download this terminal for Adam
basically you go to preference all right
and then go to install and search for
Platt for meal terminal C this one
install it of course I already have
install so since on install by
installing and then pretty much on your
project you're going to have a terminal
so right inside of this project at the
bottom you see there's a little plus you
click there and it tells you hey you're
inside of this project and now you can
use the terminal you just say LS you can
say see the node modules you can come
back for a CD you can say clear it's
pretty much a full feature terminal but
inside of Adams so now you don't have to
be working on this here working like
let's say you working on your code and
then from there jumping into the
terminal of having the terminal here no
now you have everything here inside of
Adams so you never have to leave from
here and what's cool about it is you
know how let's say you wanted to find a
project usually it comes when you open a
terminal right it comes up as the home
folder right and then you will have to
say okay CD to code in there from there
come here but okay CD to node and then
like it takes you a long time to get to
the project that you're in right now
with this what happens is automatically
you land soon as you open up this
terminal you actually land on this
folder it's not going to the home folder
is not going anywhere the location that
is looking for is here right here on
this project so everything that you
wanted to do and let's say you wanted to
do npm run watch everything is there for
you already because you're already
inside of the prior
all right so it's pretty cool it's
pretty legit I definitely enjoy having a
terminal inside of Adam it just makes my
life easier you know like I use the
terminal as the last last option or last
resort because nothing to about this is
like let's say I could have here MP
everyone watch
so right here I'm running my gold watch
right and then here I could create
another terminal where I could come and
do whatever other commands I could go
and say NPM install that's not safe
react right I could do that here so I
could install things on this window and
then now I could switch between
different terminals here at the bottom
without having to leave my atom or my
project so this is pretty legit guys all
right
so I'll see you guys in the next video
where I will tell you guys how to change
your themes for your terminal and yeah
I'm just here to make your life easier
guys all right see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
