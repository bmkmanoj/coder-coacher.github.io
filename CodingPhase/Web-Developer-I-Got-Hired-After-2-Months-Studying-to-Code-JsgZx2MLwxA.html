viewers like you and people that support
our website coding phase comm go check
it out over 20 courses in there that's
gonna guide you to become a developer
from the beginning to becoming a pro
this is the event so yeah so what we
were saying before for those of you guys
that that miss thing a lot of most of
you guys didn't even get to hear
anything so yeah basically the dreaded
dev was telling me that he's from
Florida he basically came in he has
about a year in in this field how long
did it take you to become a developer um
say like I learned how to code and I
mean that loosely like when I say I
learned how to code I mean that loosely
two months and I would say by my third
month I had a job already so like I
literally applied everywhere on indeed
even the jobs that were like you need 10
years of experience like I took I don't
like 700 jobs in like two three days and
like even some of those jobs were
calling me back like the ones that like
you know you have five years of
experience I was like nope but like can
you interview me anyway so I can like
right now some notes for the next one so
I was bombing interviews on purpose for
the sake of having the experience to go
to the next one you know that I was
taking notes the whole time man and I
helped a lot yeah no that's fine that's
how people the time is like when you you
want a job you have to actually go in
there and and actually just say hey I'm
gonna apply to every single job that's
out there I'm not gonna be scared you
know is that you can't be scared you
cannot be over here like oh my god I'm
rebooting I'm just gonna apply to the
big companies it's like now you apply to
everything everything everything I was
like a small agency like I'm talking
about like you had a map you couldn't
even see him in it and I mean obviously
then what business right there weren't
anything big they were in business for
years before I even applied so yeah man
and you know what I took it man cuz you
know what sure I could have waited an
extra week or so to get like the job I
really wanted but man I like I said I
didn't have I was homeless I needed
money ASAP so I took that mother fucka
Jonathan we here bro
yeah man that that's why all the sudden
people tool is like
look my first job I was getting like 13
bucks an hour bro like and that was cuz
I I went in there I was like yo it was
even like no agency wasn't like no
wonder it was like straight up a company
that needed somebody that know a little
bit of HTML CSS to edit products that's
it right but nothing fancy but it was
just like hey is the first time going in
there I'm self-taught yeah I had a
little degree from you know
administrative systems and like
that but it wasn't programming it wasn't
like computer science that I have no
background in it right so they came in
they they basically took me in and
literally in three months I said peace
you know I was out bro you know
sometimes you you you take these jobs in
you think is like you're gonna be there
forever it's like nah man you a
developer man you a rockstar out here
you know what I mean like people want
you you got the skills and we want you
right now like I keep getting recruiter
from like other places and stuff and
like date the job I'm at now they found
me through LinkedIn so like they gate
they gave me a chance man so like it's
not it's one of those things where I
have loyalty to them bro but I have jobs
that are like a willing to pay like
relocation fees and all this I was
like oh man what do I do they're
offering like 10 15 thousand more a year
like yeah Nicholas but you know what ask
developers like I don't think I've known
any anybody that's been in a job for
like two three years we usually like
bounce around from job to job and I know
that sounds weird but it's a good thing
in our case you know what I mean because
we learn more and this is usually you
get more money it's good
yeah every time that you jump to a new
company you know companies want you
because the more that you know the less
that they gotta train you the less that
they gotta you know be on top of you
they just say okay we need an extra hand
and that extra hand is here he knows
what to do he knows what his job is
we give him a task and he can build it
when you have developer and you just
start at the beginning you can't really
ask for too much because you know them
well you need somebody to guide you you
need somebody to be the head of the you
know
the development team if you're not that
you can't go in there by yo everybody
give me 120,000 if now ain't working
here you can't go yet no you can't go on
this show where your balls like that
like so quickly walk away they're gonna
hire somebody else cheaper you - exactly
exactly somebody some dude is just like
it's like man listen it's a blessing to
be here so soon as that Duke comes in
your job is gone you know the world word
exactly man and it's crazy but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
