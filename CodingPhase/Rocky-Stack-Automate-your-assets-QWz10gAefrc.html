at it again man coding face calm listen
your boy is back I didn't did it again
alright guys we're gonna talk about the
front end right so this is a full stack
framework right this is a full stack
framework and you're going to have
everything that comes with the full
stack everything from the front end to
the back end to databases alright so
right now we're going to get into the
front end part so we're going to have
CSS sass and also some web pack already
set up for you so you could use es6 and
react and any other you know framework
that you might want to use alright
so pretty much you're going to make sure
you have the latest version so you're
going to go to rocky : v calm cool so
I'm gonna bring you directly to the
documentation here right now the current
version is 1.0 alright so what you're
going to do is you're going to click get
started you're gonna click here download
the project now I'm showing this because
some of you guys might have started this
project when it was 1.0 which is pretty
much the same thing everything is the
same I'm just teaching you guys how to
keep everything updated you know just
whenever you create a new project or you
do a new tutorial make sure you download
the latest version right please click
there download or you do get clone
alright ok guys so let's get back to it
cool so let's say in example you wanna
use some CSS right let's say you want to
use something like
a little bit smaller you want to make
the background ready you could go into
something like this
let's start the server you start the
server then you're going to come to that
other window of your terminal if you
haven't opened up another window you
click new tab
alright open up another terminal all
right
so outside of your rocky project you're
going to do something like this beyond
run what what this is going to do is
gonna open up a browser shake well oh
right so what this is going to do is
whenever you do a change what CSS sass
right or with JavaScript es6 whatever
whatever framework you want to use right
when all you do teams is going to show
up on a page so the same example I want
this page to go read see automatically
change to rest all right
now this I want to change over here I
want to change the component let's say I
want to make this one point seven now
this is going to compile once it's done
it refreshes the page you see one point
seven bounty you guys what the hell is
going on right basically what we're
doing is we have a go p-- file which is
down here go file right and basically go
p-- is just like this automation script
alright it's like it does certain tasks
that you give it so right now what I
have is my default task the default is
Styles webpack and processing okay now
we have here the task each task on the
gulp file is right here now we basically
say ok for styles we want to say any
file inside of the
sets slash sass any file inside any
folder inside of there that ends with a
dot s CSS we want to take those files
compress it put Auto prefixes and then
once it is done we want to actually put
it in the public folder for CSS all
right now for the JavaScript web pack
web pack is a whole different story
alright let's say you have multiple
components or you have multiple files
what you want to do is the first file
you put it here you say ok first
component or whatever whatever you want
to name it whatever is inside of your
assets folder you could put in in
whatever order that you want in any
location of any folder that you want to
put it in so long answers inside the the
jes folder right so I have two examples
here I have the first component which is
this page and then I have a regular
component which all it has is just a
console lot welcome to the rocky stack
right now let's say you want to import
you want to import both both files this
right here is the output all right so
this is what's going to come out as the
name for the file so when it gets output
is going to say ok regular Jes Jes
that's going to be the name of it and
then here is the importing file so this
is the location of the file that we are
actually imported so as you can see we
have an assets
jas regular Jes so that is basically
importing it runs through web pack web
pack does is magic and then it spits it
back out for you know here jelly on Jes
components and then here although the
files are here and then we also have
this which is a vendor so like I say an
example you want to use something like
Redux or
react and you do a import you say okay
import react or input component from
react or import react down from react
Dom ray we basically we could say hey
there's a vendor this is like a library
that we're using and multiple components
and multiple files might be able to use
it so let's say even jQuery right let's
say we imported jQuery right instead of
us having to import it in every
javascript file we basically say okay
let's just import it in the vendors so
now jQuery goes into the vendors so now
it doesn't get put inside of every file
that we actually output include web pad
so that's the simplest way to explain it
you know if you don't if you don't know
that much about web pack in es6 it's
fine guys look online you know there's a
course that I have there from Steven
grinder or look on YouTube and you know
figure it out right now I call it teach
you the framework so yeah you're going
to learn a lot from the whole tutorial
but I can teach you
es fix in one video you know it's going
to be too much but yeah okay now like I
said the files get you know exported to
either CSS or exported to component so
now as you can see here in the views
pages home page I'm actually importing
it and basically I always have to put
the vendor on top and then from there
all the other components or the
JavaScript files under it so basically
since we're depending on this file but
let's say we're depending on Redux or
react we have to put it on top and then
from there we put the JavaScript our
custom code under it right that's so
cool
but what's cool about this is even
though everything was already built for
you it's a brain now you guys to come
here download this and automatically you
know hit the ground running you don't
have to worry about setting all this
things up
you don't have to worry about you know
building a web pack a script or building
a gulp script it's like everything was
already set up for you all you have to
worry about is just to code and create
your website create your web application
and that's the idea behind this you know
it just to make life easier
now think of this like bootstrap you
know for you guys that love using
bootstrap and you know is they think of
it like bootstrap is already a whole
bunch of things are already built for
you even though you might not understand
everything right now as you continue to
code and you continue to make
applications you will understand every
single particle alright cool so yeah so
like I said you know any moment you can
come in here and say hey make this and
already automatically changes in the
background you know I'll make this
purple I don't know whatever you decide
to do you know and automatically is
going to be there now remember you must
you must do this first remember this
you must run the server right yarn run
service right and then after is running
definitely get a yard run watch and it's
got compile everything is going to open
up a new window for you know life
reloaded now of course sometimes you
don't care about life reload you don't
care about that you don't care about
having to compile every single file out
there you just want to do the CSS right
so you can just say okay yarn running
sad and then all its going to run just
that script on just a task for for sass
or you can say yard run js4 JavaScript
you know and then what pack is going to
run by itself that's it instead of doing
the whole task of you know the Styles
the JavaScript and then the life
reloading there is like sometimes you
want to do this real quick you like okay
as your application gets bigger this
compiling time takes
longer so sometimes you might say hey
all I want to do is just worried about
the CSS all the react components are
fine let's just worry about the CSS then
that's how I create a desperate for you
all right guys let me see what else do
we have in this man like let's go to the
package I'll show you guys our server I
show you bundle I'll show you
production I showed you what else what
I'll show you sass I'll show you
JavaScript test that's gonna come in
later on you don't have to worry about
that for now oh yeah man what do you
guys think let me know what you guys
actually think about this is it gonna be
helpful for you guys or not I mean I
think for me if I would have found this

sure you go through you know the Rocky
stat check this out if you like this
video you like what I'm doing with the
rocky stack come to github.com slash
coder face.com slash rocky or you know
you go through my rocky
coding phase calm you know come here
give it a star you know definitely show
some love man I'll do this for you guys
and yeah and by the way man if you're
looking to become a web developer and
you want to learn all the stuff and
there's things that you don't know like
es6 there's things that you don't know
about react guys I have on my
description the courses that made me
into a developer
the courses that got me to where I
needed to be the courses that got me
that moolah no so guys I do this for you
