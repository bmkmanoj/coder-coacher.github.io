with the first one so you don't know Jes
created this so let's go okay channel
list I like this this is nice is this
pretty simple pretty cool I like the
transition between the different table
rows it's nice and all of this is done
with CSS I'm surprised your boy you
don't know Jes is using pure CSS you
could use sass man you could definitely
use sass man go ahead now but it's cool
it shows that he knows his shit he knows
basically plain CSS and he could build
this on his own it's a nice transition I
like it
design challenge number 2 web developer

you don't know JSU did good man let's
see take the next one ok next one is

would have been nice that when you hover
on top of it the font turned to white

in here TD hover
okay see actually it's more readable
like that so it's goodness legit I like
it skeleton good job okay let's see what
Chris talk has okay Chris talk won the
last developer challenge so let's see if
he continues with it okay check it
almost everything behind this model is
made with HTML tables this was created
for the second coding phase web
development challenge fun fact back in
the days a cement tables were the only
thing that could be used for creating
layouts yeah it sucked
keep the challenges coming Joe and yes I
remember those days man I remember
having to build like columns you know
what we do now and we take for granted
like creating a menu on the side and
then putting the content here and
they're putting let's say like your ads
here back in the days you will have to
do this with HTML tables and you used to
do this with inline Styles too like it
was bad man go look at Angel Fire geo
cities websites man go ahead go check it
out you're gonna see a lot of stuff that
was me with just HTML tables ok so let's
click OK boy went all out so let me see

like that's hot man that's going out the
way you know what I mean less like a man
let me do a little sign let me show off
real quick let me see how nice I am
woody you know what I mean and one of
the reasons why I
want you guys to get used to this is
because HTML tables are really important
for HTML emails okay so if you're
thinking oh I just want to work as a
developer doing you know the cool stuff
at some point you're gonna have to start
doing HTML emails so if you're not
comfortable with tables then you're not
gonna be able to do it okay so this is
pretty legit like this is a full
dashboard may with just HTML tables okay
so I don't know man god damn it
Christopher talked freaking show just

Oh JavaScript may have another
JavaScript good old vanilla JavaScript
all right so it's pretty cool very
simple but cool at the same time all
right now who is the winner who do I
think Wednesdays okay this is hard
personally I will say it's between
Ashley Conti okay Ashley Conti and in
this one Christopher talk okay now so be
honest with you guys
if Christopher talk did not go so hard
and build like this is like really like
hey man I'm I'm gonna show off what I
know about HTML tables hold this down
you get what I'm saying if I was to
choose one it will have to be this one
cuz this is clearly the winner like he
really knows his HTML tables and it
really went hard and spend time like all
of this took time and this wasn't like
hey I'm gonna put a little HTML table
put a little blue background or a right
background and that's it this took time
so we gotta appreciate it for what it is
you know what I'm saying
and then I think if we choose between
this to you know this was the clear
winner because it shows all the skills
in HTML table this one if Christopher
talk didn't go so hard I
pick this one this one's the most
professional-looking
HTML tiwa that's in the hole that's been
submitted right that the whole project
right I really like everything that I'm
seeing here the color schemes the
typography everything is nice the icons
is in the right places looks good has a
little drop-down like it's pretty legit
you get what I'm saying like is is dope
so clear winner
it's Christopher talk runner-up it's
Ashley can see she she killed it right
