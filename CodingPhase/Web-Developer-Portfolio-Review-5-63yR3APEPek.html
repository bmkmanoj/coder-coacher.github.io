coding fees.com today's topic is another
what developers portfolio review that's
what we're doing
alright seem a little bit you guys this
video is brought to you by viewers like
you
and people that support our website
coding face.com
go check it out over 20 courses in there
that's gonna guide you to become a
developer from the beginning to becoming
a pro alright guys so let's get started
so let's see here our total figlio web
developer welcome to my page so this is
portfolio is a single page website
what is it built on it says net
interesting ok so let's see MongoDB
Express angular 2 no J yes JavaScript
react readouts html5 css3 Jake height on
three ok so he has some experience in a
lot of different tech so let's see
soccer music programming that's great
let's see what you got here welcome to
the Yelp camp this is from was it the
web developer boot camp so this is cool
okay this this is cool there's like a Oh
what is it like an online store
okay this one's a little bit better than
than the last tool because just a
designer it looks more cleaner and
typography looks a little bit better all
right
okay now let me see what else in here I
guess this is built with react
I mean it shows the space is using
production build of react okay so it
does half react let's see it has Redux
tool from what I could tell okay so
that's cool alright so Saleh bacon
cheese meat order now
continue continue and I guess you can
order a burger I mean this is cool this
is fine this is fine like all the stuff
that he has here are definitely projects
that you know he's done in different
courses and different training
you
this is from Steven gratis course which
is great because that means he knows
react you know if you already went
through this whole Steven gratis course
he could definitely tell that you know
this person already knows this things
maybe he hasn't mastered it yet because
it takes a few months but at least we
know you already do this this courses
which is great so he's hide the truth
okay now I'm gonna delete this from here
okay he got some angular all right
yes this was made with angular 2 yes so
angular 4.4 so the latest one is running
Express so that's cool all right now let
me go back to the website
okay Arturo phileo has a contact page
and yeah so this is what I'm gonna say
so Arturo and everybody who else is
watching I could tell that this guy has
really been working hard he's been
taking a lot of courses he's been
getting to know all the technologies
that he needs to know which is great now
what he needs to do is start building
real projects okay
like building just the stuff that you
have in courses and put it on your
portfolio that's not really gonna make
somebody hire you right and I'll be
honest you could get a job in a
situation where is like they need
somebody with just the projects you have
from the courses but if it's like a
serious company in a company that has
the time to find the best candidate
you're not going to get hired because
all of the stuff just shows like okay
he's been taking training but doesn't
show that he's already in the field you
get what I'm saying like it shows that
you have training but it doesn't show
that you're in the field you want to
show that you're already a player in the
game like you're already a developer
like you're already building serious
websites for you know small businesses
in your area and it's why I tell people
you know you have to build those five
projects that I always tell people to do
you know build your portfolio to the
restaurant to the real estate to a
digital agency to an e-commerce store
right but it has to look like an
e-commerce store like this order looks
like it but this looks like I'll be
honest this it looks like e-commerce
store from like a Chinese retailer like
not retail the whole seller like they
just trying to sell this I guess you
know as soon as possible as I hear
that's it and as I there's no
I don't know like there's no no feelings
away like I don't know how to explain it
it's like you go to let's say I don't
know let me see you find a girl retailer
let's say I always come to this website
because I I loved the site okay the real
real calm okay
all right so there's one of the websites
that I usually buy stuff for you know
whenever you want to buy like a little
you know some Gucci shoes but United to
move for pain
the retail price you can literally buy
it from the store where basically is a
hey they sell it here for let's say
three hundred dollars cheaper very good
quality person probably only were one
time you know what I'm saying so so yeah
so like this like a full ecommerce site
and just everything all the details if
you look at the design there's details
to it you know I was like you know
everything is flawless okay this was a
definitely beat up of course you got a
that's why they $200 those are beat up
those are like vintage
but they definitely have some legit once
a year especially like when you want to
buy some Yeezys and you're like y'all
you don't trust the person online is
like you rather buy for now a retailer
this website is pretty legit alright so
now get him back to the portfolio itself
like there's certain things that are off
like you see the space between here to
there that should be the same space down
here so what you should do is you should
have a padding inside of this element
itself the white element behind it in
the container of all of this elements
should have a padding on top that's the
same padding at the bottom so everything
could be exactly the same all right
like there's certain things that it just
makes your website better you got to
work on you know the typography putting
a hierarchy on this
I don't know fonts wait wait 900 or 700
but I don't even think this font even
have any of those weights so it's like
you gotta you gotta like polish this up
man
like sometimes if you're not a designer
and you don't have really design
background go to dribble calm and go to
dribble calm and pretty much just search
portfolio okay search portfolio get
ideas from there you know these are the
best designers in the world you're gonna
find pretty cool design in there that
you know you could take ideas from and
build something like that like simple
nice and clean there's something you
could definitely build you know it just
makes your website so much better and
you know it shows people like okay
there's guys in the game you got what
I'm saying like that's what you wanna do
that's what you want to make sure to do
as a developer because you want to show
people that you are already a developer
not that they gonna take a risk by
hiring you and say oh maybe he got he
took a little training will give him a
chance now you never want them to to
feel like that you want them to feel
like okay this person he's ready he's
been doing this for a while he's been
you know he's been working in the
industry for a few years you know or
even if you haven't been working in the
industry for a few years you want to
show them like oh wow this guy is
completely you know on top of his game
you know the best way to do that is
really to have to write designs and the
right projects you know when you go to a
web site
and I look at this am i okay cool yeah
all right he got training yeah he likes
soccer music programming okay cool and
I'm looking at the projects and although
this looks like you know it's like stuff
like schoolwork you know it doesn't look
like it's somebody who is a professional
he's like you know this is saying how is
it that they say here in the u.s. is
like fake it till you make it right
there's people that just fake it their
whole lives and then they make it and
then they continue and then you realize
that are all shoo you didn't have
nothing five years ago you know what I
sound like
but then it's like you look like you had
a lot five years ago but that's because
you faked it I'll tell you me you know
what I mean and that's just how it is
that's how all everything is in life you
got a portrayed you want to be able to
impress people and show them that you
are already a developer you're not a
developer to be you're not a wannabe
you're not a beginner you're not a
junior you are a developer all right so
that's what you want to show them all
right so yeah man this portfolio is
pretty good the the best thing that to
say out of this portfolio is the fact
that you have been learning all the
right things and that's definitely you
get kudos you've been learning Express
which shows you know you know some
back-end
I wish you had some PHP in here because
that will really open the doors for you
but I mean this is like the mistake that
everybody's making now just because it's
like oh I'm learning HTML CSS in
JavaScript and nodejs is already in
JavaScript let me just continue with no
Jay yes sometimes is good is good to
continue it but you want to show all the
skills all right I see you have Python
three but it could be just Python that
you're learning I don't see no Django so
if you don't have Django then I don't
know if you're really doing like what
development you might just be doing
programming
but yeah as far as like react Redux Ajax
jQuery gay html5 JavaScript MongoDB
Express angular tool like you have all
the right things all the right skills
that you've been training for now it's
about showing people that hey I know all
of these things in number two that you
are a professional you are no longer a
student you're no longer somebody who
wants to be something you're actually
there all right so I'll see you guys
later is your boy Joe back at it again
coding phase calm guys listen if you go
to my description there is a link there
you get 50% off from everything on my
website and yeah guys so I'll see you
guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
