coding freeze calm your boys back and I
done did it again listen today we have a
new product that I want to tell you guys
about table Plus hey guys this video is
brought to you by viewers like you and
people that support our website coding
face.com
go check it out over 20 courses in there
that's gonna guide you to become a
developer from the beginning to becoming
a pro this is actually a pretty legit
product um I have nothing to do with
this company this it's not a company
that's paying me or reaching out to me
to like hey promote my product I
actually found this online I think it
was like product contour one of those
websites that I freaking find stuff and
I tried it out I tried it for like a
good month and a half and to be honest
with you guys I'm actually switching
from sequel Pro to table Plus okay and
I'm gonna tell you why
number one you can come here and use
table Plus with any type of relational
database if I come here and show you the
program and I say hey I want to do a new
connection I could connect to Postgres
sequel my sequel microcell or sequel you
can connect to sequel light you can
connect to Redis so you pretty much have
access to every single one that's out
there it is very rare that one program
can actually do this because most most
of the times they usually target like
one specific niche like let's say if
they create a program for Postgres they
don't have my sequence and they
definitely do not have sequel like so
this is pretty legit especially for you
guys that are doing PHP my sequel or
doing Ruby on Rails my sequel with
Postgres or you know you might bump into
a company where they're using Redis like
guys this is the best one that I found
so far because it just gives you access
to all of them instead of you having to
connect to different programs like I
used to have the sequel Pro and I had
what else I had in here oh yeah piece
equal
which is like for Postgres and its
really annoying man you know cuz it's
like you gotta use one foot post grass
one for my sequel one for sequel light
it's like and for you guys that want to
do like dotnet and it's like hey man now
I gotta do it for Microsoft sequel
server like nah man just download one
program and you good okay
so I'm gonna show you this right now
this is right now currently I'm working
on the Ruby on Rails course right and
I'm gonna give you guys a little preview
let's say I wanted to come here and I
wanted to do something like this I'll
say rails generate scaffold write
generate scaffold and I say this
scaffold is going to have a title and a
description but the name of it is going
to be lets say articles okay articles
and I'm gonna say title it has a title
and there's going to be a string and
description which is going to be let's
say text okay
I'd let rails automatically generates
all the files for me okay now I can come
here say rake DB migrate and
automatically rails goals and runs the
migration for me and now I have access
to my article so I could just let it
literally just go to here and say local
host 3000 or let's say articles going
there and now I can come here put in the
title my first post description
this is where my long blog post goals
and we create the article so all of this
stuff is already done with Ruby on Rails
like the migration is done the pages as
you guys can see is done the forms is
already done everything is already done
okay that's why I love from your rails
like I could be super productive like
that okay so now I can come here to this
table plus and I'm gonna delete this
connection all right so I'm gonna
connect it to a sequel light database
and that's what comes with Ruby on Rails
automatically that's your default if you
don't put in anything like my sequel or
Postgres or Redis automatically is gonna
go to sequel like and sequel light is
just really like a file okay so you
pretty much are saving all of your data
inside of one single file instead of
doing it how my sequel does it okay so
this is great for whenever you're gonna
create something like you know a small
application you're like okay I want to
have everything inside of this this
server I don't want to have to go
outside and connect to another server or
anything or like I'm working something
in development and I don't want to set
up my my database everything is already
there for you it's just one single file
so that's what sequel Lite is good for
so we're gonna click on sequel like
literally I'm gonna change the color you
know me my favorite color is that purple
man okay oh let's see change the color
put in Ruby articles okay select
database and then now all I have to do
is just go to my projects go to first
app and this is my folder for the whole
Ruby on Rails project that we working on
and we go into a folder called DB which
is database inside of there you have a
development that sequel like three and
you double click that and now you
connect to it and that's it that's your
database okay all of your tables are
there the articles is there your schema
migration is there your sequel Lite
stuff is there if you want to come here
and run sequel statements you could do
it you want to come here and switch
between the databases you know you guys
develop man you got test
what else you know there's other plugins
that you can add later on if you want
that's like a whole bunch of stuff and
it was cool about this too is that I
believe in the next few weeks they're
coming out with a new update which is
gonna let you connect to an external arm
and external connection so I don't know
right now currently I'm pretty sure you
can't connect to outside like let's say
you want to connect to a URL or
something like that something out there
I haven't really try to get that part
but this is great for your local
environment ok I'm pretty sure they have
a whole bunch of different features that
I haven't even checked out I'm just
being honest with you guys
but so far like I'm loving it because
there's like so much yeah I guess you
can't connect to external servers and
let's say if you have something on AWS
or how you call this digital ocean you
can connect to it I haven't done it yet
but from what I'm seeing here you can't
alright so this is pretty cool you can
absolutely put in like different things
they'll show you you know different
icons if the person is writing with
emojis so this is pretty legit it's a
powerful sequel editor you could have
dark mode you could customize it however
you want now currently I believe is
working on Mac I don't know if this is
because I'm on Mac that doesn't let me
get in for the window side but for Mac's
everything runs perfectly I'm guessing
that they still working on the windows
you guys let me know you guys don't have
windows computer see if the link works
for you guys but if you have a Mac man
there's the way to go man especially if
you're gonna be working with my sequel
or any type of you know sequel database
out there any type of relational
database and it's pretty legit now it's
free so
upgrade right if you want to come in and
say hey I want to come in and they have
like you know a million different
connections then you're gonna have to
pay for the whole the whole happy plane
right but guys for you guys start
creating something on your own you're
creating you know I don't know a
database you connect into a database
like you don't need to have 30,000
connections like all you need is just
one connection to your my sequel and one
connection to your sequel light or
whatever it is right
whatever you decide Postgres or or Redis
whatever which one you want right you
don't need a million different things so
the free version is fine I have the free
version and I'm good you know what I
mean like am I gonna sign up for the
fifty dollar plan I don't know you know
what I mean like I gotta see what else
they're gonna add for me to be able to
pay $50 you know cuz I usually just use
it for like one or two connections I
don't need you know I'm not running like
a a business I'm not running a business
out of my laptop like straight up I
don't need to have you know connections
to million different databases because
if anything all I have to do is just
come here if I need to connect to
another database I'm like man I don't
have no more space to connect to another
database I just delete this one and
connect to it you know what I mean like
I don't mind doing I don't need to have
a safe to here you know what I mean so
that's fine you know so let me do this
right now I'll connect to it Ruby rails
and connect that's it is that simple
pretty easy I could come here add
different articles and you know you say
what up so I and let's see and that's
about it man and I was like there's so
many different things that you could do
to this man
like this pretty legit you click there
how many rules are affected click go and
I say he's already in ok so as you guys
can see just download it play around
with it if you have a Mac this is the
way to go guys
Windows I'm pretty sure they're gonna
release it pretty soon because hey

know they're gonna release a new version
