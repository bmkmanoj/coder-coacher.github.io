yo what up guys I'm here I'm driving
from Queens to Long Island right now I
know somebody's gonna be like you're not
supposed to be recording or talking to
your phone while driving
well sue me alright alright so I just
thought of this wait cuz I was like
thinking about the whole Meetup and
there was a moment where I was telling
Mike and Scott about hyperope and there
was like a key word that Mike said and
he said I was like telling him about
hyperope he was like oh hyper app is is
like a smaller version of react and I'm
like yeah and it is like but if you want
to use something for production
you know production-ready level or was a
production level you would just use
react and I was like thinking about that
you know that kind of simmer then and
you stayed in my mind till now and it
just came up and I'm like wait what
exactly is production level cold
what exactly is production that would
framework right what is a production
level framework right or production
ready
I was just thinking about that because
I'm like wait somebody like let's say an
example this is a very good example they
say if somebody comes in and it has a
website and he's built everything in
jQuery is that production ready is that
production level right using jQuery
right or let's say an example I come in
and I call something from scratch and I
could do everything that's on or react
by myself with JavaScript even create my
own virtual time all right I can do that
myself is that production ready you know
what I mean like maybe we have this
thing of the bigger the framework is cuz
yeah the bigger the framework is the
more production ready it is you know
what I mean like I hope you guys
understand where I'm going with this
right because sometimes we think that if
the framework has 30,000 features we
think like oh this has got to be the
best one because it just has every type
of situation is built for every type of
situation
but I'm like men you know 90% of the
time you don't use everything that a
framework has you know there's so many
things that react that people don't use
it don't use everything that's in it or
even angular I mean angular's is such a
huge framework like what if you just
wanted to do like a simple simple form
do you have to go in there and use the
full library of angular like that's one
of the things that used to happen with
angular 1 where now that I think about
them like you know I used to use angular
1 for the most simplest things and I'm
like wait this thing is so heavy every
time a user comes to the page they have
to download this you know 400 KB file
every single time almost a megabyte and
what if you're in India if your wife
here in Dominican Republic what if in
your Salvador like you're paying for the
bitrate you'd be paying for the data
that you're using through your phone
it's like a lot of this other countries
they don't have the luxuries that we
have here where we say hey man doesn't
matter if the page is eight megabytes
you know we got 4G they're gonna you
know they're gonna survive so it's alive
through it you know I mean like no
matter what hold on give me a second
reconnecting reconnecting yeah sorry
about that guys
so yeah man so I was just thinking about
that and I was just like thinking about
em like man are we being conditioned to
half of a full sized framework for every
situation you know like or are we
supposed to use frameworks for tools as
well as tools right use a framework as a
tool like sometimes we love react we
love project we love you we love angular
we love all this frameworks right but
sometimes we're using it for the most
simplest things you know I'm thinking in
my head like yo I will use to react for
something that's very you know very big
a big project I'm talking about
something like if I was gonna build
zillow.com I will use react right if I
was gonna use something like game ga da
mãe that website I will use react
because it's a huge single page app
but if you're just going to build let's
say a form and you want to show some
animations and you want like you know
the floor to switch screens every time
that you answer a question or something
like that see this in a quarter-mile
keep left to stay on i-495 East sorry
about that
GPS let me turn turned as the GPF off
yeah so people have to stay on i-495
East yeah I'm back alright so like I
would say like you know four simple
things we don't need to be using a full
framework like we don't have to you know
we love to use it and but I all you know
what FA I'm just gonna use angular FM
I'm just gonna use react but in reality
is like men you're forcing the user to
download a huge library for no reason
for the simple fact of like hey I like
this I like this framework I like using
this and that's it but there's really
nothing that the user is it's really
getting out of it
you know it's actually more of a con
than a pro you know so I was just
thinking about that you know thinking
about that you know because I'm like man
you know more people should start using
things as the tools and there was like
another situation too on the meetup
where somebody was saying like let's say
if they they have nested objects and
they wanted to basically keep everything
immutable and you know one of the guys
were saying hey I would just write my
own function to be able to change the
nested object and I'm thinking in my
head I'm like why would you do that I
mean yes you could do it because you
know how to do it but why will you do it
when there's so many much easier tools
that's gonna save you time you know but
that's my that's like my side of things
I like to build things as soon as
possible alright to build things as
light as possible
because I in production bringing back
the word production you want you want to
be able to be able to create new things
as soon as possible without having to
recreate the wheel number two because
you want a light so you could give the
users a better experience that when they
land on your page they load you know
something between 200 Kb and that's it
maximum so longer KB that should be the
whole homepage maximum anything above
that you're taking it to the extreme
you have to having too many images
you're not compressing your images
you're doing something wrong right so
that's that's how I look at things but I
don't know you know I was like I had
that in my mind and like I just thought
about it I'm driving and I'm thinking in
my head I'm like wait you know like a
lot of people think like this they're
like man I'm gonna if I'm gonna use
something for production where the
production ready means something like
you're gonna you know battle-tested and
you know and you're like okay man we're
gonna take this framework and it doesn't
matter what we throw at it is
everything's gonna work and sometimes
this it makes sense but sometimes it
don't because it's like are you gonna
use every feature that the react has you
know if it's just about reacting as the
database or the data changes then
hyperope Dustin in a super small way
but I don't know man I wonder what you
guys think
definitely wonder what you guys think
leave a comment I know a lot of people
are gonna be here on the chat room but
if you see the video later on leave a
comment I want to know what you guys
think what is production level as far as
I colder let's say you know when you
choose our framework
I definitely to me is it has to be in a
good version a stable version like you
know a physical alpha if there's some
beta that you know they're gonna
continue doing changes like that's why I
stopped learning crystal Lang and I kind
of left it alone because every time that
they do a new update the basically most
of my code break because it's still an
alpha they're still creating it they
still haven't created version 1.0 so by
the end of the year it should be at one
point no but you know they're doing a
lot of breaking changes to me that's not
production already but when it comes to
the frameworks and JavaScript itself I
just don't know
I don't know what is production-ready
because it's like somebody would come in
and I've seen this down with somebody
will they want to do like a for-loop a
for-loop of different elements on the
page right they want to look through
data and basically display on a page and
then I look at it I'm like wait you
could have done this in JavaScript you
wouldn't have to even use any framework
or anything but sometimes it's cool to
say hey I'm using react I'm using
angular music view you know as
developers I think we need to start
focusing on frameworks as tools you know
you can use you can't use a a
screwdriver to put in the nail you know
what I mean like you need a hammer for
it so it's like you just gotta find the
right tool for the right project you
know
say yeah
that's what we at right now man I was
just thinking about that I wanted to
share that with you guys and see what
you guys is actually up to right now
things get updated too soon now I think
we react react updates as soon as the
data changes so when the data changes
then they basically get that gets
updated you can also put a delay on that
you could also put animations to
basically make it a little bit slower
this is something that we had in in my
last company that I was working on they
had a situation where basically before
what they what they used to do is
connect to the database and put pull
back data and then after put them back
data that would show like a little
loading a loading bar saying like okay
we're loading loading loading and then
from there they will send it to send it
back to the server and then the server
will come back and then it will show
another loading bar so users when I came
in and I put react
I did it a whole different way I
basically I pulled the data ones and
then from there I felt out the data
accordingly throughout the whole
application depending on what the user
picked oh man
I'm over here in the HOV Lane
and I don't even have an extra person
with me I totally forgot about that
hopefully a cop don't see me
because then if they see me there's
gotta be mad points let me see if I
could get out of this lane as soon as
possible
there's map points on your license if
they catch
hey we good
learn man I wish there was like a way
that I could hear everybody does in the
chat room instead of me just like
talking to myself when having to look
down I wish I people could join in
they're like we could just all be live
right now
well yeah like I was saying that's a
production ready
production-ready enough what is it
production-ready level co2 production
that what sometimes that we confusing
myself wait a second words man it's a
production already is a production ready
so long as it's definitely a good stable
version of the software or framework and
then at the same time like I said
anything can be production ready as long
as it works
you could have something that you'd be
like oh we've built this in the Harry
Potter framework and it's the latest and
greatest thing but everything on it
doesn't work
but you're going back to the story of my
old job basically so yeah
I pulled the data and then after pulling
the data I filter everything with react
but everything happened so fast that
even the owners were like wait we gotta
put a loading on this I'm like you don't
need a loading no more because I already
did everything behind the scenes in the
front end you don't have to put a
loading message like oh loading like to
me that's so hilarious man like that was
one of those funny situations where I'm
like man you know it's like it's like
talking to the dinosaurs you know what I
mean like I'm trying to tell a dinosaur
like hey man like this how things are
done now like things are fast you know
if you're smart enough you you will load
the data first and then filter
everything through there you don't have
to do post requests and then do another
return a JSON back to the the browser to
get the data it's like you do it one
time and then filter the data in the
browser that's it
and this is something that people
brought up to and the meet up they're
like you know this is cool because now
the things that people used to do in the
backend you know people will come in and
have to do a post or a post request or
like I say you will submit let's say
there's a forum and you will say I chose
this selection right you will click Next
and the next button will take you to a
post request that will go to the server
and then the server will filter the data
back to you the user
and it will take like a good second to
to basically do the whole that whole
filter inning and loading the page all
over and doing everything but now you
don't have to do that you literally you
just go in do a post request one time
get all the data that you need and
filter everything inside of here react
app or JavaScript back if you guys check
out my website kobi5.com
shameless plug right now I have a react
course that I literally do that in there
like we pulled the data one time and
then from there we're good we just
manipulate the data according to
whatever we want to filter it right now
also we're using es6 or that filter we
use the top map and we use them Dabra
tools so it's pretty legit so pretty
pretty legit course man it's like
production ready you know this
production ready guys
I'm over here driving keeping a safe dog
I got my seatbelt I'm not really looking
that much down to the phone there's
nobody in the on the highway driving at
70 miles per hour that's not bad you
know I could be pressing the sports but
it and it'll be a wrap
I'll make this car go a hundred miles
per hour real quick but I'm now we keep
in a safe man we doing a little live
stream there's like the web developers
lunch breaks man I know you guys enjoyed
the web developers lunch breaks just
like I said you know what let me just
bring it back while I Drive back to
Milan man I also want to do a meet-up
and I want to do like a meetup with with
everybody here man I wonder how many
people are close to New York or located
in New York I'm gonna put that later on
on a video do like a Google Forms then I
go a little survey to see how many
people would show up to do a meet-up
out of the people that live close to New
York City
I mean can I use can I use this court to
do the livestream I don't know you gotta
teach me that Barbara
if we could do it we could do the
livestream on this cord they have
everybody being able to come in and you
know go in live and that would be cool
try to find out for me see if you can do
that
trying to see how we could do that for
me man because they know be good then
I'll be perfect is then we'll use
discord more and we'll get more people
in because sometimes people live in like
man I gotta get up
they wanna join the chat but they can't
have to link or sometimes they be like
oh I don't have a Google hangout on my
phone whatever whatever excuse they have
you know at least now with this Corey
will be like yellow you have no excuse
you can come in come speak what it's
live
it's kind of hot guys you know let me
open this up real quick
who feels good man I needed that little
breeze right there Oh feels good kids

you're probably pissed off
yeah
crazy
you
I mean this beautiful out here like
that's what I think that I love Apollo
riding it's like it's pretty nice
it all live in Suffolk County so it's
pretty legit
I don't know maybe tonight or maybe
we'll do a live video again you know
we're gonna do a coding face podcast I
don't know if tonight well I might just
leave it for Sunday night I don't know I
don't know yet
which day I'm gonna do it either tonight
at 9 o'clock or Sunday at 9 o'clock so I
mean just keep focus on your
notifications keep a lookout you'll get
notified if you're if you don't get
notifications guys go to youtube right
go to this video at the bottom where you
see subscribed there's a little bell
right there click on that bell so you
could get the notifications
so you don't miss anything
also I forgot to tell you guys about
this so I won a free course from the
Meetup
so they had like a raffle thing and
basically I put my name in it and what
happened was I won I won one of the
courses so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna give that that course back to you
guys because I have like so many courses
already I do to me like it wouldn't be
fair for me to just keep it to myself so
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna give it
to you guys I'm gonna raffle it here on
on YouTube and then it's basically you
know thanks to the guys from the Long
Island JavaScript group
it's pretty good chick those guys are
super cool man I can't wait until next
month it sucks
we gotta wait until next month for the
meeting I wish it was like a two-week
thing but it's okay I understand why it
can only be done once a month for me
it's hard to to dedicate yourself and be
like hey guys we're meeting up every
week or every two weeks because it's
like we all have lives we all have
personal things in our lives you know so
to tell somebody like hey dedicate one
day of your week so making sure
everybody comes down to the meetups and
there's an attic it's hard so I
definitely give those guys mine my props
Kota face suggest how to be updating web
development as a lone developer in a
smart way
yeah I'm gonna make a video about that
that should be a good one
why does it seem by JavaScript's cooler
than Python because I mean I don't know
technically Python is super cool
but there's not that many jobs in Python
and - it's easier to get set up and get
started with with JavaScript JavaScript
is in the browser you could literally do
JavaScript from the console block you
know like you don't have to set up a
special environment you don't have to
download some crazy executable file all
you have to do is just go on your
browser and that's it you got JavaScript
you know what I mean so it's so much
easier it's very easy for people to jump
on it now what's hard for people is
dealing with the Dom you know JavaScript
itself is easy it's just for people
understanding the DOM and understanding
that everything is an object but then
that's where they have problems there
well besides that it's pretty easy
but you know I want to get into Python
so but the problem with Python for me
it's like I said there's not that many
jobs in the jobs that they are you know
it's like people want like a freaking
master's degree and mathematics people
want you to be like you know freaking go
to MIT and I'm like bro like I just want
a program that's they like I'm not here
trying to become
I want to build websites with Python I
said you know what I mean
but there's people who are just that I
don't know it has to be what a degree
has to be this and that so it's like I'm
not gonna waste my time with it like
that
I know Python I know how to program in
Python but it's not my focus at all
right
did it again you pretty much get
everything you pretty much get
everything for $5 and it's like a whoop
he's gonna be the course this is gonna
be a 15-point there's gonna be at 2530
depending how big the courses so for you
guys I would say men join the website
right now take advantage really think
about there's the best price out there
period all right guys I love you guys
take care
send me emails guys any questions you
guys might have send me emails you know
anything that you need I'm here for you
guys
all right ass love you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
