build this page which is the index page
now we got to do this different than
this but sorta like this because it is
just like for inspiration
we're not exactly copying everything
less on this we just gotta take some of
the acids are here like the place invest
located and gonna get an idea out of it
all right so let's start this up so we
did the home page right now let's come
here let's copy this select this folder
and press paste and then rename this to
let's say task index.html all right now
well we want to doing this index pages
take it to the task in deck so we gotta
surround this with an AK attack can say
class no class for but H ref and we're
gonna say little task index
all tasks or that is key oh no it's
reloading we name this alright go back
to this let's click that all tasks or
okay come on to the index come back to
it your friends or tasks cool so now I'm
going to go here all tasks say that
right all right cool
now I don't know if you guys notice but
you see that this pace getting reload
and see you maybe the fix that real
quick so go watch watch on the page
we try this press control C on here
there on watch okay let's go back here
we'll see if this refreshes now yeah
a refreshes so what we need to do is
stop this server right here with control
C and then restart it again with Yan run
watch or NPN run watch okay so now we go
now we got live reload set up for the
other people's so every time that we add
a new page we need to do that right so
let's come here and actually delete this
here and what we're going to do is we're
going to move this up so I'm going to
say this is when you write closes we're
going to copy this up here all we had on
on we're going to paste it here I'm
going to take this right here this
welcome box and put it inside of the
home ID all right now this here I'm
going to put it all the way at the
bottom save that now okay so let's name
this podcast okay let's ask
name this all tasks okay now what we're
going to do is instead of height or
hungry when I say I'm going to remove
the high craft so no height from now on
or maybe just play around with it let's
say 300 pictures - that's not bad then
we come to the height so you're going to
do something else okay let's do
something about that that this one here
we're also going to put in Thank You
class they're only going to do for now
is we're going to say something like
this we're going to say let's see 12
past protest so far completed all right
I'm gonna stop the state here from
actually being centered because that's
not what we want also display flex and
let's say Heather Heather is the battle
RGBA
Daryl there
they're gone six all right
padding 30 pixels just want a little
them all on that 50 pixels I will say
Kentucky's all right we got that still
let's see what what the hell and remove
this the site which fix height and what
we want to do here is we're going to
actually take the colors that will bear
on this so it was like the purple the
purple color right so go back to color
Toby let's click on this you'll see it
says RGB that's what we got to take by
now so it's 58 71 147 and that right
that cool that's fine
so task tracking tool now let's see well
should we go here we should move that to
the right okay so to move that to the
right or we're going to do is listen
show me tonight oh yeah I know those
will flex taxes I know somebody's out
there probably screaming you can do this
with Xboxes and again but why should I
wear this is something so simple
sometimes
gotta keep things simple guys you know
what I mean so say okay now what else
want to hear you got that let's create
something here like a logo or something
so looks this is the same day of class
able to name this now let's go to Google
fast let's get a display font so this
place usually means they're fancy they
like stuff that you might use for a
title or something cool so let's see
anything that catches my attention let's
see how those notes don't look that bad
yes we are looking but doesn't look that
bad so let's copy this purple thing oops
wrong
Debray Lankaran Matt green flag green
man clean attention sensual Oh
all right so we got this here and we
want to put this here you will say only
happiness a little boy one slot left
okay you got this terrible vowel so
annoying when things start working girls
like mom and your Google we supposed to
have Eric commercial that unlimited
resources and telemovie Catholics plus
page all right cool so here in the lover
will say taskmaster and we're going to
make this let's keep it an order
clogs eyes so many pictures
yeah I should make a little bigger than
that cool technology right there
all right so we have that now this is a
sports fan right so pretty on Spain just
a class number okay now we have that
let's make sure we have to stay in power
cast total so we're going is we'll put
an inside of that so now we can just
control the whole box when I class
become dancing as so then we say cast
bank has to member and then here we're
gonna basically say fault sighs okay
so outrageous number this will holodeck
let's see if that work okay test total
test so okay tell us okay this one
respond so it's just number
all right cool and then there's just
something like this where and get to the
margin there on top and then say 20
pixels - right there on the white circle
to the left alright now let's bring this
down a little bit let's say
position:relative and then you say top
ten paces bring it up a little bit more
five pixels see now that's fine
well actually want us to be translate to
100 all right now the margins too much
surfaces alright cool now just look at
this colors here and let's see what want
to do to this so we can actually keep on
I don't know what we shouldn't do so I
change the color to something that goes
like color like purple
yeah it's a little bit better but kind
of want the numbers favorable still in
the numbers a little bit bigger system
sequences
and instead of us having it
like thatis a task display:inline-block
so just keep it in line block and what
else so remove this VR okay all right
let's see what else you can do with this
we can actually pull the top 20 pixels
okay let's to make you let's just fine
and now I'm going to bring this up a
little bit more so the task total
fiction relative every small the top-
exhaling pixels there you go
so I think that's fine for now okay cool
now nothing that I want to do is I want
to put like a little maybe a little plus
right here will circle with a plus so
let's see how we do that
okay so with the header and we missing
looks like a little plus I don't know I
should put it the top I should put at
the bottom
let's see what they got here see how
they did it well known honestly how
would I do this maybe a button here let
me sleep
we'll see how that looks alright so we
got the header great little task now
here s your name this section I usually
like to separate it by sexual trauma
some completely different session so now
when I come here for those resection and
make sense and then class content area
okay now let's see what else does should
be put here I need to find a way of
button here like a little circle so
let's think about that as you how we can
get a circle there and we're going to
name this cliff class ad so cool okay
then let's go to all the animals people
so awesome
confidence we want to put this in here
okay so now we should have access to
farm possums
amends and icons right we've been
promoting this thing for so long I'm
still waiting on it
why haven't they released this for an
awesome fly this is me awful giggle toy
doubts for no reason alright let me just
click this icon
okay so this here what we're going to do
here is I'm going to make that into a
song section its own little area so I
will see something a header it's outside
a cutter so it should be something like
a circle and then we gonna name this
into okay I said I'm going to say color
and a safe like a blue and you can click
fall size 36 pixels all right she being
bigger than that one say fifty sixty
pixels and then we're asleep
Patti exploring pixels of all sizes over
I know you think stretching out right
now but what we're going to do is when I
say position and us a position absolute
right and we're going to go right zero
okay and we're going to do is we'll say
background right back away border radius
to just move more this make the the
circle go around it so as a
little radius will say 50% so it could
be a perfect circle all right let's make
this pie pieces all right now let's make
the background let's sit back just let
me see it gets into all this Hansel will
say 50/50 pixels see but that's looking
all crazy Reina so this thing is 42 by
50 going to wife left okay so it's not a
person perfect square or perfect circle
it's nicely so all I do is employed so
like let's say
there you go all right now that's in
slide right okay so after it is what we
want to do is want to move this to the
right let's say 25 pixels and so we've
got that shot pixels and then let's
bring it down top 25 pixels okay so
let's say 200 pictures 50 pictures 1k
pixels and probably who's going to play
with it to get the results that you want
all right Justin Baby Bop that's what I
want now let me see if I can play with
this a little bit more yeah that looks
so like a little better sir

did kick all right so I'll see you guys
