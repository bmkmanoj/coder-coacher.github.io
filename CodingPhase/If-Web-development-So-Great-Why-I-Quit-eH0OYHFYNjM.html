again man coding face.com your boy is
backing out and did it again
yep today we basically going to answer
this comment that's here it says from
emil Nastase he says hey Joe if it's so
great to be a web developer why you
stopped doing it and my answer today is
is when did I stop doing it like I do
web development every single day every
single hour that I get extra free like
I'm doing web development so I don't
know where people will get this idea
that I stopped what development like I'm
teaching you guys web development I have
a website called coding phase comm where
I'm doing constantly web development I
have my own private clients that help
our our build websites for them I'm
still doing web development like just
because I don't decided that I don't
want to work for a company right now at
this moment doesn't mean that I'm not
gonna work for a company in the future
it might happen
it might not happen like etc right like
it doesn't really matter to me you know
what I mean like I've gone to that level
I've unlocked
imagine this I'm like super saying web
developer right now like I'm doing stuff
that about 90% of all developers wish
they could do which is get your freedom
you know work on stuff that you like to
do work on projects that you want to do
because in reality this let's talk about
you know like when you work for a
company you work for the company for the
you know for the money for the security
for the fact that you got benefits etc
right me personally I've already had
that like you know my motivation at one
point was to be like hey I wanna get to
make $50,000 a year I you know check
that off the bucket list I got 275 check
that off the bucket list got to a
hundred eighty nine hundred eighty two
eighty then got to 120 check that off
the bucket list this year probably gonna
make about like 140 150 maybe one
right depending on how it goes I mean we
still have time one month we and we in
October so we still got two three months
left so I might get to 160 this year
right now is that gonna make me happy to
be like hey guys I got to one hundred
sixty thousand this year or you know say
hey I got to two hundred thousand like
it's not gonna make me happy to say that
right what's gonna make me happy to say
yes hey I have helped about you know
over ten thousand students you know
8,000 9,000 people on YouTube you know
ten thousand on udemy I got stuck with
the stack commerce people buying courses
there from me like I got so many
different avenues right that in reality
I'm like you know when did I stop doing
web development you know what I mean
like I haven't this is all web
development right like I'm just not
working for somebody else I'm working
for myself you know this is something
that everybody wants I'm pretty sure you
want it yourself to like you know when
you come here and you're like man you
you start working for a company you're
like okay I'm gonna do this in the long
term I want out you know if you're smart
because there's people who are you know
they're born to be pawns like this this
this saying that says hey there's people
who are born to be hammers and these
people are born to be nails right I was
born to be a hammer all right I wasn't
born to be a nail meaning like I'm not
there just getting hit every single day
and that's a that's my job I'm the one
hitting right so you know and I've
always been like that you know from the
beginning like I when I used to do
designs basically I started like my own
little web design team when I used to do
music I opened up my own studio and you
know pay for everything in and set
everything up when I'll do something
I go to their max on my own right like a
company can't give me all those things
that I I'm getting right now right I
mean this is just the beginning guys
like literally like every time I drop a
video more people subscribe more people
get to find out about me and then not
only that
and I have other places that are helping
me promote I got the company from you to
me that's helping me out too to reach
out to more more students and get more
people to know me I'm trying to do
bigger collaborations and go to bigger
conferences I might be talking some
major conferences like you know it's
like sky's the limit for me right now
you know what I mean
you know it's like I was uh telling this
guy was this guy's name even you the
creator of you I told him on the video
that I made for him I was like bro like
I I don't hate you because you actually
accomplished something that most
developers want to do which is the
freedom to create things that you want
to do right so you know right now he
created view Jay yes he gets a hundred
ten thousand dollars a year all right no
more just from patreon people that
support him so he don't have to work for
Google no more you don't have to work
for meteor no more like he does
everything on his own time and he works
on projects that he wants to do so what
they're you know like for me did I did I
stop you know that I you know stop
creating stuff no I'm creating amazing
things like right now I'm looking at
this I'm creating this game that I have
here I also have you know there's a
class that I'm building with you guys
which is the restaurant right I have
that right now like go to projects hyper
restaurant okay click here click open
all right
like I'm building so many different
projects every single day like I haven't
stopped doing what development like I'm
doing this even more than I was when I
was working you know what a company like
I'm doing this almost 24/7 like
literally I would come in and creating
this and then this is like such a cool
project because like we gotta have you
know dummy data we're gonna come and
create a menu we're gonna
do reservations all of that stuff is
gonna be done through this course right
and I'm teaching people and at the same
time I'm building it myself right so
then not only am i building this project
which I can literally use it for my
portfolio like I come in I put in my
portfolio and then show it to people and
when I hate this is what I built at the
same time I taught it to people which
also helps me look even better because
it's like oh man if he built this and
then he taught it to people that means
he really knows his stuff you know what
I mean like so at any moment I could
literally blink and be like hey man I
want to start working in a company right
am I gonna do that right now no I'm
gonna take a few months and give this
time to myself and be like hey man you
know at some point I got to do it and
decided to do my own thing all right and
I don't have no regrets now if I go and
start working for a company and be like
man what would happen if I would have
just continued doing YouTube me creating
courses online
you know sky's the limit who knows where
I would have gone I don't want to be
saying that you know five 10 years from
now I want to be able to say hey I tried
it I did it
if it succeeds you know as I yeah great
you know if it fails it's still great
because with all the work that I'm doing
here my portfolio is gonna be so crazy
like literally like you guys have no
idea like you know what at me Plus this
is cool because I'm reinforcing all the
skills that I already know like I
already know JavaScript like but then at
the same time me being able to teach it
to you guys was helping me it's
basically now when I go to interviews I
could even explain it even better like
there's so many details that you know
sometimes you you go over things and
you're like oh yeah is like it's hard
for you to explain it but now I'm like
man like I know the stuff like the back
of my hand now you know what I mean like
I can build anything that I want you
know any company right now will tell me
hey could you build me this app can you
build
this this web app I'm like yeah I could
do it you know so that's what I'm saying
that you know I'd never stopped doing
what development guys it's not like I'd
be like oh I just you know if it's so
great if it's so great to be a web
developer why you stopped doing it I've
never stopped doing it I just found a
different road for myself you know
everybody's gonna have a road for their
own right like you might become a web
developer and work for a company right
that does animation you know a year from
now after well yeah after you get hired
then you realize that you like animation
and then now you focus more on the front
end of you know creating animations like
all those people that Bianco Penn or
whatever like you know what I mean
and I guess all depends on what role you
get into so like some people might go
into a company and be like oh man I I
really don't like the front end cause I
gotta be worried about multiple browsers
so now I just want to work on the back
end like that's a your road change you
know everybody's role is completely
different
everybody's gonna decide something on
their own like what exactly is it that
they want to do for me personally like I
just want to teach it to people I want
to create the projects that I want to
create you know without having to be
like hey you work for e-commerce
websites like I don't want to be doing
e-commerce my whole life that's not
something that I want to do like if I
was to work at a company like I don't
know it has to be something cool
something fun something that will show
I'm working on this stuff or like I'm
proud to say hey I'm working on this you
know what I mean like let's say
something like I don't know if like
Spotify hit me up right now or Apple hit
me up right now I'll be like cool I'll
go work at Apple all right but for me to
just take any job anymore
like it's not worth it because what like
right now I'm earning probably 85% of
what I was earning before on my own so
why would I go back to a company to earn
a little bit more than what I'm earning
now to just say hey I
freaking you know I work for a company
like I don't need it you know what I
mean like I could make my own world
create my own projects like there's so
many guys creating cool stuff man like I
don't know if I told you guys the story
about this digital agency that I was
working with it was this kid called
George man he he was like super smart
but he was a little bit for a hoe cuz he
was like so smart and he knows so much
that he thought like he was just like
the biggest and smartest thing in the
world and it's like nah bro you just
have more years over me right but
whatever
going to the story basically him and his
partner created a company that all they
do was sell ads online and let me see
something like Gap City something like
that I'm missing I'm gonna see if I if I
find it I can't fire they right but
basically they created this this
platform where they could sell ads right
and like let's say you have an article
and your article is about
I don't know fitness right you could go
and reach out to people like you know
Shaquille O'Neal or whatever girl that's
on Instagram that's really popular or
fitness they could go and reach out to
her and tell her hey if you post this on
Twitter
basically this post that somebody gave
us will pay you you know X amount of
dollars per you know per click alright
so be like 20 cents per click or
something like that right when they
click on those on those things the
people go to a page that's full of ads I
don't know if you ever seen like looper
lubricon you go to a page that's full of
ads and it looks something like this
like it's like that you have ads here
you keep scrolling you have ads here
when people come to this type of pages
they continue clicking and clicking and
clicking like you click here and then
now you get sent to Zurich
and they're from Zurich you get sent to
this and it's like a big network
those guys they make millions doing this
thing you know and he did on his own
he's a web developer and I was working
for him and I was like yeah how do I
help you guys built it he's like oh I
just built it with PHP in and my sequel
and HTML CSS that's it I built it
this guy's built like a whole empire
around this whole thing this whole look
lupard icon and Zegna and all this stuff
like they make millions of dollars right
so if somebody comes to him and be like
hey man you know why is what developers
what development so great if you left it
alone you don't do what development no
more it's like bro like I do what
development every single day it's just
I'm putting it to use in different
things like I don't have to say hey I
work for Facebook hey I work for Google
hey I work for XYZ hey you know I'm on
the new you know Harry Potter framework
like now you don't have to do that
that's why when I created that course
and then I've been telling people to
check out you know I know how to code
now why I basically give you guys an
exit plan at the end of the thing like
because they're the story of you being a
developer doesn't end when you get
higher that's the beginning right so
when you continue with your skills and
you start creating stuff and you start
getting experience from working in
businesses you're like man I could build
my own business I could start selling my
own stuff I could start doing XYZ right
that's when your story begins in and you
start really creating cool stuff working
for a company is just like a means to
end like you know what I mean like you
have to do it to get the experience and
and learn a lot of stuff that you want
to learn but it's not the final place
it's not like hey man I say I got hired
you know like those are the losers of
what development those are the people
that they end up just getting a job in
that's it there goes their life like you
know they'll stay there for 10 15 years
I've seen people like that guys that you
know they become soo
were unhappy like you know especially
people that stay in one company like one
company they always got to be doing the
same thing like most companies like
let's say an example you come in to a
company and you work on an example on
nodejs let's say an example right no js'
is hot right now
two three years from now we don't know
what's gonna be hot what's gonna get you
excited about web development right it's
not gonna be no GS you're not gonna be
stuck on nodejs
for three to five years and you think
that you're gonna be like oh this is
super exciting no you're gonna want to
jump into something else something more
challenging because after a while you're
gonna master nodejs and you know this is
kind of boring
this is repetitive I'm doing it the same
thing every single day alright so you're
gonna want to move on to something else
but if you stay in the same company
you're always going to be working on
nodejs
because that's how the companies are
once they set up a certain system it
costs so much money to go and try new
technologies and changing you new new
stuff like that like new frameworks and
like asking companies that still using
angular 1 because it's gonna cost them
so much money to just change it to
angular 2 or react like it's not worth
it so what do people do do they just
stay there working with angular 1 know
this a couple of people who are just
like you know sorry for using this word
like losers who just be like you know
they not secure about their skills they
feel like oh if I get this job I gotta
stay here because this is my only job
that I'm gonna get I'm not the type of
person I'm the type of person that if I
feel a certain way I'm like about
company or I'm getting tired then I'm
leaving
like goodbye like you know what I mean
like I don't need to be there like I
know what skills I have I have skills
that can build my own business if I
wanted to like I don't need to be stuck
in a company doing stuff that I don't
want to do you know what I mean so it's
up to you what type of person you wanna
be is up to you to become the type of
developer that you want to be become at
the end so that's what I'm saying you
know so when go
back to this question you know where is
hey Joe it feels so great to be a web
developer why you stopped doing it I
mean after this whole video I mean you
tell me do you think I stopped doing it
I mean it's like how the same man do I
look like I'm left off bad and bougie
I'm out
kids anyways man Cody face.com
see you boy Joe back at it again man
coding phase calm make sure you check
that out go to my website guys listen
for this the best deal I'm being honest
100% guys this is the best deal you're
gonna get
there's no other deal like this out
there I was looking at a couple of other
people this is guy who's pretty popular
on high call his own on udemy let me see
where is it and I was like thinking I
was like man he's doing sort of the same
thing that I'm doing like he's using
teachable he's he's doing almost all the
same things that I'm doing but literally
did imma show you guys how much he's
charging like like literally thirty four
bucks a month
guys like that's and a whole bunch of
pop-ups and a whole bunch of stuff
courses are you know three hundred
dollars you know ninety seven dollars
two hundred dollars like disc it was
like one you know one hour course for
$10 guys I'm giving you so much content
and like this is not a nod to him cuz he
has a you know a different audience he
has a way to pretty much persuade people
to pay this much but me I'm not trying
to hit you guys with something crazy
like this
I imagine me I'm like hey guys you wanna
get to learn HTML CSS $300 hey how about
I just bundle up all five projects that
you need and say hey it's $300 I'm not
gonna do that to you guys man for 10
bucks on my website man you get every
single course man like you
getting so much content guys like it's
not even funny there's a on some Netflix
Netflix you know what I mean like I'm
over here just giving you guys
everything man this is way more than
than what I'm supposed to be doing like
literally the people from you to me is
like yell I don't know why you're doing
this cuz you're undercutting your own
courses on udemy you could be making way
more money and I understand that but the
reason why I'm doing this is because
this is for my YouTube audience right
the people that find me from Google
define me from Chora they're farming for
Facebook define me from sin treehouse
for wherever they find me right like let
them pay you know what the real price is
which is $20 a month right now for you
guys because you know me from facebook
from my facebook but from YouTube
basically you getting a super discount
you get a 50% off that's a like you
knows like take advantage man like don't
let it go go over your head man and be
like I'll do this later on because you
never know I'll be honest guys you never
know how long I might have this you know
what I mean like I'm gonna always create
courses but you know you know how is it
does say supply and demand
like if the demand is higher then the
prices is gonna be way higher than that
you know what I mean so there's like
take advantage now cuz you're like part
of like the pilgrims the first people
that signed up to the website once this
website is like ten thousand you know
fifty thousand students like you know
sky's the limit man like I'm being
honest like those prices is definitely
gonna change you know what I mean but
take advantage now cuz if you sign up
now you basically lock in that price and
say hey this is what I'm gonna pay
forever you know what I mean so it's up
to you guys but yeah man I hope I answer
that question that comment and yeah I'll
see you guys later
