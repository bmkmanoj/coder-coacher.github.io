you're back at it again
Wow listen man already know is calling
face calm boy all right
I don't want some hype man into this
Saturday I woke up late
12 o'clock I got some sleep I'm feeling
good right now but listen let's talk
about this right so I was talking to my
boy the warrior scholar so he says you
know I'm trying to become a full-time
JavaScript developer who he is and so
much to learn and this is great you know
JavaScript right now I was like super
hot but there's a big but there's a
problem is that for junior developer
somebody who hasn't been working in the
industry let's say right now you guys
you guys are here for reasons I will
trying to learn you know how to become a
web developer how to get into the
industry javascript is really a bad
introduction to basically getting a job
and not only in javascript in the front
end I mean javascript in the back end
you know like learning nodejs
you know and becoming a full-stack
developer or you know it's know death
you know why because most companies they
looking for me to senior developer so
it's like let's say right now you're
trying to get a job and you're applying
everywhere you're like okay I want to
become a you know full stack developer
and I'm gonna do it all in JavaScript
right when you go to the interviews they
might call you in and thereby better hey
oh you know so you know this this this
and this and if you know it that's great
but then somebody else comes in and says
hey I've been working in the industry
for you know the past three years I
worked at this company I did this and
that automatically they're gonna pick
the other person right so don't feel bad
about it so what can you do about this
problem right I would say learn PHP why
learn PHP because you have to understand
it
99% of small businesses which are your
easy way into the industry they use in
PHP either word or with WordPress arm ty
the most element there's a couple of
CMS's that that people use the RM PHP or
you know they use on the framework
laravel or there's a whole bunch of
different small frameworks for PHP right
you guys could look it up but it's so
easy to get into the industry for one
reason
most companies what they used to do is
they will hire you know Indian workers
or Filipino workers you know remote
workers in Europe all over the world for
small small projects you know small
design you know website or whatever like
create my little restaurant business
freakin website type of thing right but
what happens when that company starts
getting bigger all right now they're
saying hey instead of us sending out
emails to somebody and telling them of
what to build for it how about we hire
somebody locally right and that's what
you guys come in right as when you come
in you shoot ping on that job and check
Nash that up you know why because
it's easy to get into the PHP or
industry pretty much most companies use
it and it's like so it's like a great
introduction to web design yeah you
could look online and everybody say Oh
PHP is PHP is this and that I was
actually one of those people too
I was just like you guys I was looking
on lining everywhere I saw was like you
were talking about Oh PHP is dead PHP is
such a bad language but the reality of
things is when you're a junior developer
all you need is to get into one company
once you get into a one company and
you're able to actually start working
there and have six months a year then
you can go ahead and you know switch
language and become a full
javascript developed it because it's
like if you don't have no experience how
can any company most companies are using
javascript
they either startups or already you know
big companies you know so they're not
gonna hire you a brand new developer who
has no experience and then they're gonna
hire you to train you you know what I
mean
now when you're a PHP developer it's
easy to get into the industry you don't
have to do all the run around love like
you know learning so much stuff like
people just want to see a website pretty
much and that's what you come in you
just get get your skills get your
practice and and you know and that's a
man oh my boy my boy Chris Shawn did a
video about this
well something similar to this world all
you need to become a journey web
developer today if you guys you know
want to check out his video go ahead he
has a really good video about it this is
called a lamp stack guys so you got
Linux Apache my sequel and PHP you know
so I will advise you guys nice on PHP
like as a junior developer that's your
easy way to get into the industry like
there's no no other easier way if you
know WordPress you good
there's a million jobs out
there right and you have to understand
you have to go to the jobs that
first give yourself six months of
working in a a digital design
agency right or a small company
you know the has WordPress that has
Joomla that has Drupal you know those
frameworks CMS's are pretty easy all you
have to do is you know we take one
fitori online you learn the the easy
things to do and how to edit you know a
theme and you're good make your life
easier guys like straight up make your
life easier
don't go for you know difficult
languages you know stuff like Python
don't go for
uh you know nodejs is good because if
you know no js' people's going to take
you serious but something like typed on
something like groovy something like was
the other one Java something like
c-sharp those languages are not that
easy to get into this is not you know
one of those those languages that you
could just go in and be like hey I'm a
junior developer I have no experience
hire me no it doesn't work like that
they're gonna you know give you a whole
bunch of cool you know questions
difficult questions see where you come
from what school you want to this and
that but let PHP it's different PHP they
pretty much hire anybody and that's all
you really need like this so much that
you're going to learn once you're
working on a company that you can't even
compare it to you know you work in or on
your own and trying to learn it online
so all you need just to get into the
industry just one time and then from
there you're golden
alright guys I'll see you made it make
sure you subscribe I'm sure you like
this video man leave me a comment tell
me what you think about this I want to
know exactly how you guys feel about PHP
cuz I know there's so many people online
of it like PHP is the worst don't learn
PHP don't do this and that and I was
just like that but the reality of things
is that you guys are junior developers
you guys are not you know or mid to
senior developers it's easy for somebody
to say oh PHP is when they already
have a job you know what I mean</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
