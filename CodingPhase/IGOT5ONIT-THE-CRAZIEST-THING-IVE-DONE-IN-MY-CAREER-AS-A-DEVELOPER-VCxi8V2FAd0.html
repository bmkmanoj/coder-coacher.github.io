right now I'm about to curse but I'm not
gonna curse cuz we're gonna keep it we
gotta keep it G but still keep it a
little bit clean for this rain so for
everybody that's been yes at the
beginning you know I'm giving you guys a
gift this a limited time only
there's the craziest thing I've done
ever in my career period right so as you
guys may know I started as just just
like you guys just somewhere gonna do
freakin coding in his house and then
somewhere down the line I was like man I
gotta go hard to see alright so on that
was in 2012 I said man I'm going to
start studying how to code online I'm
gonna teach myself and that's what I did
right and that was a big risk cuz I went
to school I graduated from school I
hated the job that I was doing and I was
like man I just don't switch my career
like three four times right like at one
point I was gonna be a teacher another
time I was gonna be an audio engineer
another time I was doing producing music
and then another time I was doing
communication design graduating right
and I was gonna become a web designer
and somehow ended up being an IT worker
and I hated my job I did it for like a
good year and a half and then I say you
know what man I gotta switch up I gotta
go back to the thing that I loved the
most which was coding creating websites
creating you know new cold creating new
applications like to me those things are
cool man to me those things I love doing
those things right and then you know now
this year five years later pretty much
five years later I was looking at my old
team treehouse account and trying to
find out what date did I start what was
the day that I actually became a
developer
I signed up 14 treehouse and that was
the first thing I did I signed up team
tree hunts for one month and then I was
like man I gotta find something else in
it luckily I found udemy courses and
because for me it's like I learned from
other people I can't learn from somebody
reading things to me like a robot I
learned from somebody who was like
talking to me as a friend and teaching
me something right it's like having uh a
partner in class and it's like when I
were you really bad at math and your
boys like oh he helps you out you
understand it better than when the
teachers actually tell you right so man
this is the scariest thing I've ever
done right so you know fast forward I'm
here I'm here
freaking in the future in the future
2017 fast forward through time and I'm
about to take a major risk I'm going to
the next level on this right so as you
guys may know I love teaching I love
talking about cold this is what I want
to do 24/7 right um I know a lot of
people right now the proudly partying
you know this fourth of July weekend and
I understand it I understand why you
know they might not be here or why they
might not just bump into YouTube and see
this video but listen guys there's a
long time one time thing guys it wasn't
a lifetime thing your boy Matt says
something that was really smart he said
you know what you're doing and you're
trying to you know teach classes online
courses yourself it doesn't make sense
right it doesn't make sense because
you're trying to sell them for $10 $25
but like what I told Matt it's not about
the money I'm not here trying to become
you know see from grinder who makes half
a million dollars a year I'm not trying
to become you know cold steel who makes
two million dollars right so I'm not
trying to become those guys right I'm
just trying to teach you guys you know
all the cool things that I've learned
over the past five years right you know
it's it's just like something that was
in me since the
Ginn right so to basically give you guys
a thank you for actually being here
since the beginning of time I'm doing
this thing where for this weekend only
so July 5th everything automatically is
50% right and when I say 50% off
I mean 50% off everything meaning the
subscription base that I have there
which I have a whole bunch of courses
which you guys you guys having guy in
the chancel take a look at this thing
man like right now we got learn HTML CSS
by building a cool social network right
pretty much a Facebook clone
future-proof JavaScript meaning I'm
gonna go from the beginning of
JavaScript to the advanced things right
definitely you got jQuery a beginners
best friend coding nodejs backup Pro
right laravel like a boss right in this
one this one's gonna come with PHP and
Maribelle so I'm going hard guys and I'm
taking my time I'm creating something
amazing for you guys and then on top of
that I'm also doing I know how to code
now what which is pretty much is gonna
be like what I do here on YouTube but
it's like exclusive content just for the
people who are actually enrolled in the
courses and this is pretty legit because
you're basically gonna get all of this
stuff right now it says original price
$150 not because I only have six courses
there right and that's nothing because
every single day I'm gonna be pumping
out videos and creating new courses
right so body it
my actually be like $500 $800 worth of
courses that you're going to get for
whatever the price is here so it's like
you know this is going to become fat
Alice you know this is for hours this is
45 hours this is 150 so if you come here
to the actual let's look at this on my
description I have this link here I have
this link right here you know this is
the live chat right now you know so
right here on this link you click that
automatically 50% off everything
automatically off the bat right now some
people's gonna be like why do I care
about this right why do I care about it
this courses are here who cares I could
go to you mean buy for $10 yes you could
do that for $10 right and that's great
but you're basically gonna get every
course that I'm gonna create for the
rest of my life and I'm being honest
guys and I'm doing this just for you
guys because I know nobody's watching
this right now and we're by the time
that they do watch it's gonna be too
late you know because it's basically
like 4th of July weekend everybody's out
nobody's looking at YouTube so pretty
much it's like a handful of people that
are going to sign up and the handful of
people are actually the number one
priority for me because I actually want
to give you guys I'll put something to
get this you know at the cheapest price
ever you know cuz this thing is gonna
it's gonna go up
I'm being honest like at one point is
going to go up you know this thing by
July 5th which i think is one state is
that's it is gone no more savings no
more nothing right so when everybody is
gonna be like paying 10 20 dollars per
month they might be paying $150 per year
they might be paying you know $600 you
know one-time purchase right for all the
courses forever
like a for everything right this is not
just like hey you know this is just for
this weekend and next weekend is gonna
be fought out of snow this is like the
only time that this is going to happen
and then you're gonna have that price
for ever right which is pretty amazing
to me like now that I'm thinking about
it like I'm probably gonna lose money if
for whatever reason this video becomes
viral or it somebody shared say or
somebody goes and share this cone and
you know I got five on it right if they
share that code on one of those coupon
websites I'm gonna lose money right but
that's fine because the idea is that
nobody's going to see this that's that's
how I feel about it nobody's going to
see this thing all right
know what is I know you guys not gonna
be you know assholes and share this - a
coupon code website please don't do it
um and basically you're gonna get
distinct for the rest of your life for
five hours a month while everybody else
is paying $20 you're gonna get this
thing for a one-time purchase for 150
everybody is gonna be paying $600 all
right so things like that happen and the
only reason why this is happening
right now is because I say you know what
I listen to Mac and I was like you know
what matters right
this thing doesn't make sense for me to
do it like this and that's right you
know like it doesn't make sense for me
to actually put it in and basically give
out this courses for so cheap
and the fact that it's forever like most
people do a limit I put put 2099 I don't
know if by 2099 anybody it's still gonna
be alive but I put 2099 that's when that
coupon code is gonna expire for you guys
so whoever actually finds this video
right it could be now could be tomorrow
saturday could be sunday could be Monday
could be Tuesday that's it but Tuesday
night that's a it's done finito that's a
no more right so this is like
once-in-a-lifetime I know I'm gonna lose
money on it and that's fine
I'm fine with it because there's like my
gift to you guys you know there's like
you get in the ship of basically free
and I'm talking about for the rest of my
life I'm not stopping this you know this
I got a big risk that I'm taking on this
thing but I know in the long term it's
gonna pay off
like I've been wanted to do this for a
long time you know I wanted to create my
own courses I've been wanting to go to
different high schools and teach I've
been wanted to go to you know let it
coding camps for little kids and
actually teach them so now I'm really
gonna do it
right I'm really about to be that be
that guy who was actually going to like
you know FA you see me on Instagram like
oh boy hey is your port here I'm
you know apples Developers Conference
like I will be that guy I've been
wanting to do this for a long time and
now I'm basically taking the biggest
risk wife is pissed off my mom is pissed
pissed off it's just like what the hell
are you doing you got a good job why are
you gonna quit why are you gonna leave a
job for this like you're risking
everything but at the same time I'm like
no I'm not I'm like I know what I'm
doing you know what I mean like
everybody was sending me the same thing
when I was about to you know quit my IT
job which was like $45,000 a year right
and people like oh that's a good job you
know how people be like they know they
never got out the hood they never really
like you really made money out there and
they're like my boys were like oh man oh
man
45,000 Mickey you make it money kid you
better not leave that I say you know
mommy I'm leaving you know it's gonna
take me a few months took me almost a
year but then I found that job and Here
I am man it's a full-time web developer
I know the front end I know the back end
I know design then god I went to college
for that cuz I you know that's the only
than the college was worth for you know
so yeah so it's like I know everything
like I'm not a genius but I know
everything that I need to know as a web
developer right and nobody believes in
me
nobody you know nobody really wanna mess
with the kid everybody was like oh man
you got a late $45,000 they got benefits
you should stay there and that's like
right now it's like well I'm making like
80 something it is if 85,000 like
full-time benefits a month for vacation
um I don't know to me that's great but I
feel like this more to life you know
what I mean so it's like you know my
sister passed away this past year in
December and that that showed me
something like we only here for a moment
you know what I mean so the only way
that I could leave an impact I can't be
I feel like I can't be Steve Jobs I
can't be my you know what's this guy
from Microsoft or Bill Gates like where
they have so much money I could give out
to people stuff for free like you know I
can't be Oprah right so if I were those
people are gonna be throwing money
everywhere you know putting up schools
creating programs stuff like that right
but okay I don't see myself getting to
that point right because my life wasn't
set up for that some people they're you
know they go to school they think little
kids will get trained through life that
I go kid you go to private school you go
to the best high school you go to the
best college now you made it to MIT now
you made it today next thing you know
you're Elon Musk like you know
what I mean
so that was not me
I came from the bottom I came from get
off that computer I came from you know
freaking people making fun of me because
I was like into computer like bad
damn people's like oh you're nerd you'll
be here you act like a nerd son like
come on man let's go to the park and
play book yeah I used to play ball too
but at the at the end of the day I was
like man I love being on the computer I
love creating new I love being you
know being able to show people new
things like I remember when Google came
out and and you know everybody was
talking about Adsense I was like 14
years old with an accent adsense acount
like you know back then early stages
you know what I mean so now I'm like you
know what man
you only live once the only way that I'm
gonna make an impact is by you know
dropping content people see me here on
YouTube people see me on different
conferences and then those people making
a contribution to other people's so what
I do I get to pass it down to somebody
else so when I create a course you guys
get some you know better your life you
get to actually learn something new so
that's the idea behind it you know the
idea like I told Matt Matt hello you
know but I gotta bring you up oh the
idea is not for me to make this
like a business I'm not trying to come
in here and be like hey man let's sell
this for $89 of course and let's
put a new to me for 25 like no I'm not
trying to make money like that like you
know what I mean I'm not tryna promote
the out of this course no I'm not
trying to do it I'm trying to just come
in make enough to be able to start
giving back to other people start giving
out free services you know enough profit
doing cool you know like me being
in front of a computer for any business
out there it's a waste of time because
I'm not helping you know a lot of people
I feel like I gotta help more people in
what I'm doing right now like right now
we will help with all of you guys here
and you to just keep motivating stay
motivating but I know I could do more
than that I can actually go out there
and just show to the young kids like you
know you in high school sometimes you
don't even have a role model sometimes
you have nobody that talks to you
sometimes like you just say trying to
get in this but you know I really like
you just don't have that you don't see
somebody that looks like you in a
certain you know position so you like
man I can't get in that you know so
that's why I'm here and like I told you
guys man check out the description I
have to course they're basically you
know this like a once in a lifetime
thing I'm not doing this ever in my life
it's just literally this week
because I know nobody's going to watch
this cuz everybody's out right so only
the people that get to see this aren't
going to get that coupon code 50% off
forever like I'm not doing that thing
ever again you might see a 25% off you
know I see a 45% off and then expires by
the end of the month or something like
that but forever like a set price
forever right like you're not gonna see
that ever again guys
plus the cool thing about is like I
can't wait for you guys to see all this
courses man I'm doing like legit work
man I'm surprised I got everything
organized I have like you know cool
animations I have good explanations for
for everything everything from HTML to
JavaScript I'm doing an amazing course
for you guys for laravel like full
application I'm talking about like
everything I've learned over five years
right
and then whatever languages or new
programming languages out there new
frameworks that come up you know me I'm
a geek I'm gonna try to learn all of
them pull come back to you guys and give
it to you guys anyways you know what I
mean so that's what I'm that's what I'm
doing kids like I'm excited right now
man like you boy them did it again man
like everybody look everybody pissed off
right now well so I even tell whitey
about this that I was about to quit
you know this right so I told her
today she pissed off right now she's
like yo she's pissed we just had a kid
I'm taking a big risk ah I just
bought a crazy car I was about to buy a
house and now I'm not buying the house
cuz I'm keeping that money for the same
insight we don't know how this thing
might go stay might be good as there
might be bad you know what I mean like
I'm moving to another state like I'm
doing this thing like the proper way I'm
doing a smart I'm moving to another
state which things are cheaper so if I
have a you know another year if this
thing takes a year two years three years
to take off I'm fine because I have
enough money for the next three to five
saved luckily I've been smart with it
but like I'm taking a big risk guys so
I'm doing this for you guys and
like this is gonna be so cool man I just
want people to actually see this thing
man like in the fact like I told you
guys I wanted to do tutorials for
YouTube but I wasn't getting that
feedback from YouTube because in YouTube
you can't even see where people are
getting stuck where people are actually
leaving what time do people not watch
tutorials or or whatever it is right so
with this this new account that I have
on coding phase com I can actually keep
track of whenever you guys have
questions whenever you leave a comment
you could say hey I don't understand
this part I'm gonna go in there and
answer it right away
like I get emails directly to my phone
phreaking you guys have a new suggestion
but I came in fix your mic or fix the
camera whatever it is it's gonna get
fixed at some moment right so yeah we
drop it so cool man
you know let me see what was going on in
the chat room I wanna see what you guys
are up to man listen go on the
description right now check it out

going to another stage now all I want to
do is teach that's what I want to do you
know teach hang out with my subscribers
hang out with the people that support me
I told people the other day man I got
like I started sending back you know
some of the nations that I got from some
people to PayPal
I started wrong sending them the money
back I said listen man
no more donation you don't have to
donate sign up for the courses let me
work for it right I don't want nothing
this is not a hangout you know it's not
a handout this is not a you know
some shame where you'd be like oh what a
hell I give this guy a donation no let
me work for it
right let me work for it I want to work
for you guys I'm gonna work for you guys
to get you guys to the next level
become better developer isn't you know
like I'm gonna give you guys the sauce
man like you guys let gotta look it up
man look up that video difference
between Jews and the sauce look of that
video after you watch my life eat right
what's the difference between Jews and
the sauce man right
it's a funny ass video I'm trying to
give you guys that sauce man yeah man yo
cam that's what I'm saying man I'm
trying to you're one of those cases man
that I will I'm gonna get you to the
next level man I'm gonna get you to the
next level camp for real man like that's
a shame to never make more than ten
thousand dollars a year like that's a
 shame somebody that smarter
somebody that's cool good person like
there's a lot of people in the same
situation where it's like why's life
then throwing all this at me
instead of like throwing good things you
know what I mean and you know right now
it's the time man is the time to really
take it to the next level guys you know
five dollars a month you can't go wrong
all right
fine doesn't work right now you can't go
wrong now if you don't like that you say
hey I'm just wanted for a year $45 right
you say nah man I wanna I want this
forever and I don't want to pay anything
more than that $150 right and right now
you probably think like oh man that's a
lot but guys trust me for all the
content that you're gonna get for the
next hopefully I surviving I'm alive for
the next 20 30 years right I'm not gonna
stop putting cars in here and
what's cool about this thing is that
even if I ever leave this this platform
teachable calm if I believe teaching
will calm I can take all my students
data so everybody that I already paid
for it I could take you guys information
wherever we go
so that information that says hey this
person paid for you know content forever
$450
you're you know your informations coming
with it you know so don't worry you like
you know yeah man like straight positive
vibe man this thing's gonna be just
amazing man
where's the promo code the promo code is
called I got five on it and I was like
the song man I can't say yeah guys
that's one of the reasons why I feel
like I'm gonna do such a great job for
you guys cuz like I said I've been
reviewing a lot of courses a lot like my
udemy account literally one account how
to get banned because I was buying a
whole bunch of courses and they're
refunding them by now refunded them cuz
if they're bad they're bad right you
know if I can't stand with people with
the little Indian boys
I love Indians but I can't I can listen
to the axle and it's really heavy I
can't listen to it I can't watch a
course like that when the professor or
whoever it is the instructor is teaching
you a course like s if it was a computer
science class where all they learned is
taking their their slides from their
classroom and showing it to you I don't
like that either
right I like people who take off a topic
and break it down and make it easy for
people that don't know anything about
web development or computer science to
understand it because most of us you
know we don't have computer science
degrees so if you come to us and starts
talking to us in a way where it's like
super technical way super complicated
most people's gonna get turned off it's
gonna lose in interest right so that's
one of the reasons why I'm like yo I
know my course is this legit because I
know what it takes to be a good
developer like you know and at the same
time I know what it takes to be a good
instructor because of all the reviews
that I've done
like I've literally last time I checked
I had 75 different udemy courses I don't
know you guys do the math you don't have
a how much is that and I used to be a
you to me before they started making
them $10 courses like I used to be there
when it was like 40 for our courses 50
for our courses I'm paying one time for
the what develop boots boot camp
I paid $120 for it Lake you guys are
 lucky that you guys paid $10 now
all right when I want so your hey check
out that course
yeah Payton Atlas right then what -
Phillip was boot camp cost me 120
dollars like look it up udemy they just
changed their system to be like that
with a set of courses for 10 15 20 they
just changed their system back then
there was it costs the money you know go
ahead and try to take a real estate
course oh go ahead take a business
course from like a private a private
instructor like - it costs a lot of
money you know so that's how they used
to have on udemy luckily and they
 started thinking they're like
you know we making people pay 120
dollars two hundred dollars for a course
it's better to get more people to learn
and come in and keep on buying $10
courses you know makes more sense if I
quit I'm going to I haven't quit yet
it's gonna happen so I'll let you guys
know I probably you know what I really
want to do I want to record it great I
want to record it for like you to win
but I hate this my last day as a web
developer like I don't know I'm not
gonna go crazy and start
slamming shame and go on top of the desk
no I love my job I love the people in my
job but it's gonna be probably emotional
for me because it took me so long to get
here to this point and then now that I'm
throwing it away but um it's like I'm
graduating you know what I mean it's
like it's five years man five years in
this industry
and I'm like moving on you know to
something that took me so long to get to
and it was a dream to actually become
what developer like I love this
like you guys see me yeah see me how
talk about this like I'm very passionate
I'm passionate about this thing like I
love Colin you know I'm always gonna
love calling so yeah like this is this
is crazy man let me see let me see what
everybody's talking about everybody's in
here man you're sagging today Elon
Musk's is in here Andrew housing here
bunny is in here
who else is in here FinTech your
boyfriend Tech always the assembler

love Indian the Indian people don't
think I'm against them I just don't like
I just don't like the you know certain
instructors on udemy you know sometimes
they ski me because that's the thing you
could create somebody to come in here
and they don't have the passion like
they just go and look at somebody else's
course and start copying it right and
every day this is what hTML is like this
is what a variable is it's like you know
they have no passion you know the
person's like he's done like 20,000
different courses of just like monotone
we say this is how you do a function
like he he don't put no energy to it
like you know me man I'm not gonna do
that to you guys man
it's not gonna be like that's another
thing guys it's not like it's not like
my YouTube a lot of people send me
messages like oh man so I'm gonna pay

now you live you live in India right
like what's a good a good salary for you
that you would like to get now you will
say hey I'm comfortable with this
expenses so it's you should be on what
you should be under here you you could
you could get so much money there cuz
look I'm not saying like this this these
rights of everybody who's in the
international game right now because
there's a big difference between when
you live here in the US right I got
family members who live in Dominican
Republic against exactly how it is in
India to with $200 $300 you good for a
month right you go for a month and you
live in a good life cuz some people here
they they look
oh man you know I was like in
India's Philippines they working for
almost nothing over there would ask then
over there they're living a good life
you know what that is like for us if
somebody comes to us I'm like he he is
$40 an hour you know like that's the
equivalent to them over there so is a
man it would be better for me and I
won't be asking money from them
yeah so exactly so it's like you you'll
be good now what I tell everybody is you
gotta go to the main website cdot oDesk
right you got a lens which I think
they're both the same now Oh which is I
think of work well oh yeah he Lance
merged into a pub work yeah but we came
up work right upwork.com and then you
have fiber comm so fiber is the biggest
scheme in the world so for you as a
college student that's the perfect place
for you because you could go in there
but I hate I'll fix your your JavaScript
for five dollars right I'll debug it
like most of the time a business owner
is gonna come to you is gonna tell you
hey can you change my menu I want to add
an extra item to my menu you've been
okay that's far out us and then you tell
them hey if you want a revision that's
gonna be another $4 if is something a
big change in the page you'd be like
it's $25 and then it keeps adding next
thing you know you charge in the person
$300 $400 just HTML CSS and JavaScript
now if you really want to take it to the
next level learn PHP because PHP
everybody needs a PHP developer you know
it could be for WordPress it could be
for laravel it could be a whole bunch of
different things so for you PHP is like
golden because all the companies that
I've worked for and they've done PHP
they always hire Indian workers
right so you could easily get this is
the base right what I'm getting I'm
getting close to like you know 55 you
know sometimes I might work for like 75
depends on the company or the client for
you you come in and you basically
undercut what somebody here will work
and you but I hate I'll charge $25 an
hour well your $25 an hour is the
equivalent to my $80 right here
so you over there living good you know
what I mean yeah but that's that's how
it is I mean you can't be mad at it you
know what I mean it's like it's like
people are gonna look at this video you
know a year two years from now they're
gonna be like people quote this for $5
and I'm paying 20 now like they're gonna
be pissed off you know but that's just
how it is
you can't arbitrage yeah you can't be
mad at it you know bunny let me ask you
let me ask your question quickly you say
you have a background in Java correct
so have you not looked into maybe going
into Android development as well and so
firstly I was more interested in
security kind of thing or web kind of
thing so I chose web development at a
first first part so after that I don't
know but like yeah that's the best way
go ahead you muted out Monocacy we can
see what you said yeah you got muted
oh yeah gave me now yeah yeah yeah all
right so yeah so what type of work would
you
like they give me we win chopped city
with your baby let me cut out the chat
you coming through now yeah you're good
so say you know yeah I'm what type of
work was you doing D like what you doing
like full like building full pages or
would you just like pick them bugs on
site like work Pacific like I started up
basically I had a client who was the I
was a she was perpetrating herself off
as the developer and she basically she
acquired clients who were going into
these various business ventures and I
was basically like the guy the unknown
guy doing
he was a software I don't even remember
what it was called I couldn't hardly
utilize it was within WordPress it was
called optimize press it was a little
software a little drag-and-drop software
within WordPress that was very hard for
me to manage I tried to put you know
individual unique HTML and CSS in there
it would reject the cold I had to use a
lot of weird code to try to get it to do
what I wanted to do it was it was not
good stuff it was it was me trying to
manipulate within WordPress and it was
just bad all around it was a bad
experience all around
I could sometimes I would write the code
within optimize press and I would
refresh it on the server and the code
would vanish I would save it it would
vanish weird man it was it was just all
around bad experience I would never like
now when I first started I was just like
give me a job so she was like you know
WordPress a little bit here download
my's press ok access to these clients
accounts so I would go into their
accounts and manipulate this software
and it's awful terrible so excuse me so
my experience was not
it was all over the place I couldn't
tell you really what I was doing I mean
it wasn't it wasn't WordPress
development because I wasn't developing
a theme it wasn't I mean it was a kind
of a variation of web development but it
was within this stupid app you know my
work I'm finished I never even finished
most of the projects which is really
weird I was getting the end I was being
paid when projects weren't finished it
was just so it was a strange strange
like I said I can't even hardly explain
it it was just weird though yeah it
here's the thing and I'm my mother this
is a secret so I got paid $60 for for
landing pages 60 plus 60 times four so I
got paid after after to afford it yeah
so after WordPress you know I mean up
work took their fees out is $48
so the four landing pages for you know
just under 250 bucks and he said it
wasn't it wasn't difficult I was just
running a couple lines of CSS here near
when it actually went when actual
software took to Monaco but um yeah it
was it was it was nothing I would do
again I've learned after you have the
name yet who you're going to be i
purchased a freelance of course that
basically kind of guide you on how you
need to present yourself to the
marketplace and if you don't know you
know who you're gonna be out there in
the marketplace the marketplace to tell
you who you're gonna be which means
you'll be yeah yeah angularjs
thank you but projects for 20 bucks your
boy freaking diving I love diving
already that's my boy he keeps dropping
them jams yeah in the chat yeah man now
you know one thing that I'm gonna tell
people man this happens all the
time guys like this one when I first
started this day
like I wasn't even working like a real
company I would I mean it was a real
company but it was more a wholesaler for
eBay right so they will sell products on
eBay and my job was just pretty much go
in there and upload on you know change
the CSS to like the item on eBay it was
like some real sketchy so when I
tell people like oh man some people say
oh you're gonna start my $100,000 and
this and that meant everybody's journey
is completely different
some people they know how to game the
system right they know how to game the
system where they'll go to some
 boot camp and they
somehow game the system but I graduated
from this this or they'll be they'll go
to a take a computer science class and
then they'll come back and and you act
like oh yeah I finished the computer
science class whatever what a degree
well they don't have a degree they
people know how to game the system right
so that's the point of the story now for
me I'm not those type of people I don't
know how to actually take advantage of
people like when I go to a negotiation
where with a company I always get the
one I'm always getting right I'm
always getting because I'm not
that type of person to fight for it you
know I'm not the type of person be like
I'll ask the most money like and almost
every company I've been to everybody
earns more than me because I'll never go
in there like oh like you know because
sometimes you feel like a certain way
you're like oh man should I ask for this
even though you know deep down inside
that's what most people is gonna ask for
even more but what your skills you feel
that way the escalator because it's the
type of person that I am there's people
who are who are like not like
secure but it's more like they know how
to game the system it's real
talk real talk like yo I listened to my
man Joe you put Joe Santos Garcia and
Google you see that
look at your work bro how could you feel
that way but I'm saying it's the same
thing like that I've always felt that
way I've always felt like it's not like
I'm when I go to a company or I go to
into the only thing that I ask for is
number one don't waste my time if I go
over there is because you want to hire
me I'm not going there because I'm
trying to get the job it's because you
want me there that's the only thing that
I have that I feel like it's good as far
as like interviews and what ideal where
recruiters is I already I tell them
ahead of time I said the company wants
me yes or no if they want me okay cool
if they want me to make sure Wolf's work
or give them at work all right
persuade them I'm not going I'm not
gonna waste my time cuz I
already put in my work but when it comes
to negotiations
I always feel a certain way where it's
like manic I don't want to ask for too
much I don't want to ask for too little
so it's always weird for me now when I
del where from clients my best clients
it's always people who just pay me cash
that's how I like it right I like cash I
don't like when somebody deals with me
where that Oh we're gonna give you a w-9
we're gonna give you a a
contract for this and that oh I hate
that because that's when you do
your contracts do you do like the thirds
33 up front 33 and at a certain
milestone the middle 33 at the end
percent 30 percent
I do like almost 100% up front because
there's but that's unless you know
people are committee yeah because
sometimes somebody come in like oh I
wanna builders whoop say about this this
and that so then now you you you
take this time from like I say somebody
wants you to build a website and they
tell you hey I'm trying to build this
website in the next month so now you
have you calculating that you're gonna
have this certain amount of money by
next month so you either spending or you
 like that's how I am I gotta
calm
what's gonna happen next month so
basically I like to get paid either a
girl like 80% just like 80% to like 65%
where it's a little bit more than half
so it so it could be like hey if you
don't follow through you're the one
getting fun not me
do you get a lot of resistance when you
when they hear you want you tell them
you want that much up front well first
of all the first thing I tell people is
I'm busy that's like the first thing mr.
power so yeah yeah it's like I'm already
busy it's like you're taking me for the
cool that I'm doing so it's like if
you're gonna take me away from this then
you're gonna have to pay for it like I'm
not gonna do it just to to do it
you know and I of course I say in a nice
way I'm like man I just be like this is
the thing I feel like as you guys are
probably know me from here on YouTube
I'm like super nice super cool whatever
but I'm like I'm so nice
sometimes that I myself up so I'll
be like oh yeah I could help you out
I'll try to help the client now or like
let's say something is 9/2 scope and i
still do it even though it's not in the
scope like you know there's people that
I know that they like that they were
charging extra they're like oh that's
gonna be $200 more or you know it's like
you wanted to add another page I got a
design it oh that's gonna cost you more
you know me yeah I just come along okay
you wanted to add an extra page is fine
don't worry other way it's only gonna
take me two hours while do it you know
how I mean so but that's a thing if
you're the type of person that could
control your situation more because me
like I said me is because I'm I'm
 too nice even when I'm getting a
job and so nice there's been
situations where I'm like man this
company I know I could charge even more
but then I'm like man like they're so
 nice they pay for my
hotel that people might say it's like
maybe I should give them like you know
give them a a small pricing where you
yeah
but that's I feel bad you know what I
mean but that's hot but that's me you
know what I mean there's it's different
situations you know as a it's like I
tell people it's like I'm not trying to
 be a mini lay out to you
know what I mean like if I like a
company I'd rather work at a company
that I'm getting paid less because I
like it now I could go to the city like
I live in New York right so and now
we're away from where I live right now I
live in the suburbs right so if I move
and now we're away back to the city I'm
 set I'm looking at $120 and easy
right where I'm at I'm getting like 85
and it's like I'm happy because I'm 10
minutes away from my job I'm
right there I got a month off
vacation I have a whole bunch of
perks and extra that I wouldn't get
in the city you know what I mean like in
the city you gotta find parking you
gotta take the train you gotta bump into
30,000 in them like it's
like a rat race you know here
it's chill like I just go into work
sometimes I might get there late I'll
stay late you know sometimes I'll get
their 11 o'clock sometimes like I'll get
there with my my lunch break is you know
what I mean like in a while workers
today can't talking about we got I work
in a warehouse and right now on a slope
here in the cutting hours and I keep
hearing you I keep hearing Christian I
keep hearing earring in beta talking
about you know I'm I'm late today
because I stay late you know you work an
hourly it's like yeah yeah that's like
one of the perks that's what some people
may like people need to be doing this
and not only just this this freaking
many other jobs like people think just
you have to be a corner to become part
of this tech industry you could do a
million things you could be a designer
it could be your product designer you
could be a UI UX design it could be a
software engineer it could be a back-end
developer could be a front-end developer
it could be full stack you could be a
project manager there's so many pieces
to this thing and like you know this
it's cool to see like you know people
like us getting into this because a lot
of people don't get to see that you know
in the sense of like you know you like
for me when I was trying to get into
this thing even on YouTube or trying to
look for somebody who's like me you know
what the fitty just swag little gap you
know you don't see that source right and
then for somebody you know 16 17 you're
okay he's gonna look at this thing but
like he's gonna get motivates like oh
man why am I gonna go work at a at a
company when I could be a developer and
have all these cool perks and have all
this cool
you know instead of like busting my ass
cuz like for me I'm just a regular
person I the same job that you
had a warehouse I did
that to fall know one time I had
this company so they call it me more yo
they say this store is gonna be so crazy
people love it when I give him my
backstories right so listen I was
working in this company it was like a
Jewish company a Jewish factory where it
was horrible it was just about
kosher food right so use stink
you smell like like nasty ass
hamburgers and like some less and mind
you I used to work over there and I used
to come out of this stink like it was
just disgusting I we used to work with
once the name not the high/low he know
it's like the that he you pushing
you pick up the pallets put it to the
side
[Laughter]
I used to be doing this yourself
whatever mind you one of my friends one
of my friend was like yo he just told me
he just told me that that a letter got
to him right my boy was so crazy my boys
do
like I was like 18 19 years old and my
boy was like 21 22 he he actually had
his girlfriend pregnant and she had the
baby and then he didn't show up to work
for a month
and came back to work and was like you
branded he goes he leaves right and I my
son like how you leave work and you say
I just had my kid so he comes back come
back to work a month later the guy the
the supervisor was like what you doing
here you don't work here
this kid will secure there's no
paternity leave
[Laughter]
Thank You working at this is the Moo
Mart bro
like there's no there's no
workout human is no paternity leave this
is final our benefits no benefits and
then on top of that and that was like
2007 around there before they even hired
the minimum wage bro I was
 making 725 an hour I was like
slaving man I was just like I was
 pissed but that's what some
people is like you know just because you
start somewhere doesn't mean that's what
you got and you just gotta keep going
sometimes the the thing that happens is
that sometimes in life certain
happens that hold you back
you know like let's say you might have a
kid early you might have a
really bad family or back home and you
have to leave so now you gotta work to
support yourself but doesn't mean that
you have to get stuck there you have to
push yourself to take it to the next
level because there's people who do it
and they get it done so it's like you
got to think about it like this it's
like what's the difference between you
and the other person man as a for me
like the last straw for me was like I'll
never forget this I was like a
 when I wasn't working as an IT
worker I was on Wall Street and the
 one of the lawyers was like oh
he's saying it was like an eleven fifty
something like I said I got a
meeting at twelve o'clock and you can
 fix it and fix the printer and
this isn't that and I'm like I was like
thinking in my head I'm like yo if this
 was in the heart I would have
slapped the shot this do but then you
gotta keep your composure you got your
little shoot on and you gotta act all
different in front of the air pockets so
you know you know god man whatever so
then I leave and I fix this I go
downstairs and I'm like yo I was so
 pissed off cause I killed I'm
bout to just go in there man and do some
 I don't know like some last day
or the post office I was like
really pissed I was like man why am I
gonna throw my life away
and for some dumb like this and
then I'm a Starbucks which is
funny and then I'm seeing all this
 the all this white kids
working on their computer with
the little glasses on and like I'm
totally similar yeah which and what
you're doing I always see ya here on
lunch break and the guy that I'm a web
developer it's like I'm like you don't
go to work oh no our work remote
I'm like how you do that he's at home
listen just look online google it and
then I say I was thinking in my head
after I left early I was like I'm going
back to the shame like this reason
there's really no reason for me to be
I'll be here struggling bust my ass for
40 hours a week while other people are
living good you know what I mean and
we're having good lives and it's
like working remote like there's people
who don't do you know I was like about
10k dollars and I was like I'm working
for just 45 and you were talking about
the hundred yeah this and that's like
the beginning because I think even look
look at my roommate right the guy based
in this house this house is not
my house this is my house so I used to
live here with my roommate and my
roommate know how er he basically he
came from Japan and he moved out here
and he didn't have a green card he
didn't have nothing he came here started
from from nothing from zero he started
studying in asp.net and then he learned
it from a book and basically started
working for a company so when you come
here from another country and you're
like a student v you got a student visa
or you like you know a visitor right you
got to find a company right away that's
kind of
sponsor you and give you that h-1b visa
right so he slaved for like ten years to
be able to buy this house and and just
work hard right but for a lot of people
are something like you don't even have
to do that because you can actually go
and live in another country and get jobs
here all you have to do is be able to
 speak English do a good job
write clean code you just do a little
effort and you should be good like it
doesn't take that much you know it's not
like that you know it yeah this thing is
not like that difficult trust me
guys people this is a group of people
that I'm being honest there's a group of
people that want to make this thing as
if it was the hardest job in the world
to get into this you gotta be the
smartest person you gotta go to
MIT Harvard not there's there's a group
of people that you know they don't like
when new developers are popping up there
oh there's the quality of the code and
this and that man that nobody you
know it's like you're here
there's a job this is not a a
lifestyle you know what I mean like
that's how I take it like this there's a
lot of developer styles wanna hang out
with like you know what I mean like
those are not the type of people when I
hang out with like this people that want
to hang out with but this dirtbags who
they they think it's like Cohn
is a religion and they'll be like oh man
this is you know you gotta be in
love with the code and do this and that
but I love the code but I also see this
as a job like there's a way to
 feed my family and for me to do
whatever the hell I want in this world
you know so you know that
don't let nobody tell you what you can't
do and what you can't do you know so you
know as far as like the group of
 people like them man like
just do you get your money coming to
this thing use it as a vehicle
to get your money and and basically do
something positive with it you know
don't be a douchebag
spend money as much as you can and don't
get yourself into that you know cuz
sometimes you start getting money and
then next thing you know you start
getting you Shane then they start giving
you credit cards and then now you like
all share a thirty thousand dollar
credit card what if I you maxi people we
were talking about this today how you
can end up you know making a hundred
thousand dollars and you know you be
broke because first of all we in the
United States of America if you make a
hundred thousand dollars about 45
thousand is gone in taxes already so if
you think because you're making a
hundred thousand dollars or your
salaries a hundred thousand dollars it's
not what you make
so if you see thousand dollars your ass
gonna be in bed by forty thousand
dollars yeah yeah yeah that's how it is
man I was looking today well today I got
paid today I give my gonna mind my check
and again on my man the New York
state tax this some
well they took the out of here cuz
I'm like you start looking at it I'm
like yo that's a lot of hours I
put in for that you just be taken
away
$150 matching everything you know to me
like so learn practice ridiculous
man like I'm actually not
and then there's if you work if you work
in the city the city tax tool so the
city got attacks the New York State got
attacks are little tax
so yeah you can they don't even lupus
the Georgia almost look about this what
about this ready pack New Jersey pack
what shirt if you work if you work in
Jersey and the city you get the bubbly
yeah yeah okay yeah they don't like they
don't you they don't even lube it up son
they just
that's so true son cuz but I remember
one of my co-worker I used to work in
his company called choice logistics was
 them they're a piece of but uh
some guy used to come from New Jersey
across across to Manhattan and this guy
used to get raped late his check was
like thirty five percent of what I was
making and we were spending almost the
same shape and it was just bad I was
like you know how the are you still
surviving he's like well sake this is
where the jobs are at because you know
it was like if you live in Jersey I
don't think there's that much
opportunity I think there's
opportunities in Jersey but I don't
think this down much like here New York
you know you know some some people they
want to come to the city like that's
their dream you know some people be like
oh I can't wait to move to New York I'm
like I can't wait to move out of New
York you still live in a city fund and I
was like yeah my uncle moved to the city
I thought it was struggling I'm like
 that man I've never after
everything I've heard in the media and
from people I know from New York talk
about the cost of living a box for
$1,300 a month yeah no I'm no this this
joint I'm living in right now this is
eight hundred sixty dollars a month well
I could take you on a tour at its
one-bedroom ever basis for that you good
but I was frequently looking online I
was like man I want to go to like other
Arizona Atlanta there's this town like
on the south of like a land about I
would love to move to this like a small
town but my - I can't remember in my
vehicle as I've seen it I've seen there
like one time on some TV show like a spy
can be your friend
is one of them because that's what they
built the new brave Stadium income so
Vinings is a booming area right now they
have a lot of nice luxury hat looks
luxury apartments nice condos like
$1,300 a month but you're getting a lot
for $1,300 a month yeah man I'm trying
to get out there man I'm trying to get
out of here ASAP give me a give me by
the end of the year man y'all gonna see
what I'm gonna do man
see what I have going I'm just trying to
grind it out man this I'm telling you
guys like right now I'm not gonna put my
job this same moment but it's gonna be
by the end of the year you know cuz I
just have to pay off some serious
before I quit
it's not like I'm gonna quit it's just
gonna be like okay guys I have no I
gotta do other things you know other
ventures and this and that and they
probably do like a a goodbye Joe I
probably record the whole it's
gonna be later I know how it is like in
place I mean I always hear like you know
you guys talk about your future plans I
guess I couldn't see myself I guess I
guess you're confident comfortable there
yo but like telling the world yeah you
know I'm gonna be out of here in like
six months
I mean no but nobody watches this no I
don't think nobody from my company knows
about this that's one number two
even though they diff find out it's fun
because I did all my work already so you
know it's like now I would basically be
getting paid to just maintain a website
not getting paid to create anything new
because everything's already created you
know me and my other boy from work we
created everything already the brand new
site so now we'll be just I'm gonna get
paid to maintain a website which to me
is boring you know I wanna try something
else you know so but the company that I
work for they pretty legit they're
pretty good people like when my
baby was born they said
a big-ass box full of gifts like you
know most companies they're not that
personal you know what I mean they just
okay your number 37,000 whatever so
you're working a company that you know
it's it's family oriented yeah it's a
slow this is my business I think there's
about 250 employees so so it's not that
bad it's not like you working for gold
you know you work for Google
nobody knows you you're you are
like a sector a sub sector of a database
of numbers yeah exactly nothing strings
long whatever you know exactly like
nobody knows you nobody know who you are
that's totally different you know that's
why I don't like working in those tech
companies I like working companies are
smaller because there's one there's less
pressure to people are nicer because
like when you I've been to like those
 big companies man and every time
I've been to one of those
projects it's like everybody thinks
they're geniuses they think like
they're like God's gift to the
earth and that's like man you just know
how to code so I was like leave
that you know there's like you're
nothing special
it's like myself I know how to code I'm
not special I just watching I
bust my ass just like anybody else if
somebody goes in and plays ball for 10
years he's gotta be nice you know what I
really like that's just how it is you
you put it in you get what you put in
you know so that's how that's how I look
at it and like those big companies is so
much pressure that always wants you to
work madly so meaning her you know they
 want you to come in early and
then you leave like an 8 9 o'clock at
night like I'm not so those type of
companies are cuz yeah I'm Mike had one
of my standards in life
I've done it before US doesn't have any
hours 80 hours a week I'm like I don't
want to go anywhere never in life have
to work a consistent 7075 violence
that's for hell you're saying
stay away from those larger car
because that will be it yeah it happens
I mean no I can't say every single
company but it does happen like where
they're like oh we're paying you
a hundred thousand so we're gonna get a
hundred thousand you know like they
that's what they look at it when you
work for a smaller business and it's
like this if they know that you could
that you who get like oh no let's say
like this if they know you could get way
more money somewhere else and you get
you're gonna pay less they're they'll
take care of because it means you're you
they you gave something up for them you
know what I mean
so expensive you know in smaller
companies is better because they'll
treat you better don't give you a bonus
I know companies that don't even give
bonuses on on Christmas or give bonuses
for your birthday like I'll get bonuses
Christmas and my birthday so it's like
December be late for me you know what I
mean
never got a bonus my life from a company
but yeah that's well you will do you
gonna say man is this about doing this
cone shape real quick joke cuz I don't
know I don't know Cam's background
I don't know kids background hmm I mean
you guys already you know familiar with
each other's background and whatnot well
go ahead cam let you boy yeah yeah yeah
kid go first okay yeah we're passing the
ball so like so I originally the one to
learn how to code the thing was like two
years ago whatever and at the time I was
doing a direct sales and you know oh you
know we're doing it you don't make a
decent money but I was still kind of you
know doing some college courses and you
know I got to about JavaScript and I
just gave up because I took some courses
or you know I was going doing what
everyone does and they learn how to code
taking a lot of you know
courses don't really understand what's
going on yeah I just gave up and then I
saw Chris Sean's on a video and then I
guess I was watching his videos I saw
your boy Joe I saw him comment on his
videos and almost take the guy out so
I'll check Joe out and I was like okay
I'm gonna start getting back into coding
and stuff because I'm trying to make a
good living because I came back from New
Orleans because my stepdad got real sick
so you know I stopped doing the sail job
and then I'm working at some retail job
making only $8 an hour
so oh yeah my junk is like like I did a
couple of businesses and none of them
got traction so I was like I did IT
before back in the back in the past I
like it let me just jump back on this
wave or whatever and actually I had the
choice of thing doing everything back at
IIT or going to work for Budweiser all
the fly
I mean Bo Hwa's would have paid good but
if I won't pay like twenty seven dollars
an hour to start nothin you got like
three all reason like six months from
those in that manufacturing plant
yeah like Bo balls like the big player
yeah they will
yeah yeah I was like yeah I wanna
be a three y'all overtime and
 yeah I was like let me jump one if
I teach it again I jumped on this
now like I remember why I quit in the
first place to go put your business so
like and I thought I start the cold like
last year but also he was a book
and I got nowhere like I think I had
that on HTML and John doesn't book John
duck here yeah yeah I tried that book
his books a beta sheet for beginner
though you get completely lost on cuz he
doesn't he introduced a CSS and you like
what the CSS and you see a CSS
it's like wait a minute that cold when I
first started yeah though this vest in
the stack right now in the first year
 be able go ahead continue the book
is kind of when you beginning but
like looking back at it now my
i-it's like a good reference book right
yeah yeah that's that's why I used it
for it's just like reference like I can
learn from books at all I feel like mom
it was so dry to me yeah my brain don't
work like that I remember like when I
was like 14 I got this book HTML for
dummies you know cuz you remember all
those yeah those dummy books like better
dates they were late you know like those
were like the books that people would
look for when you wanted to become
something you know let me find out how
this career isn't isn't that so I could
never learn from the book and me
the way how I like really really like
got into like HTML was like I was saying
this I was like Dragon Ball Z so then I
was like you know where I'm gonna build
the Dragon Ball Z website and then what
I used to do is I would go to websites
and look at the real source right and
then I will copy what they had there and
then I will have to HTML and number okay
this how you do manual decided to a
 a slider and then I found out
that like when I used to copy that the
HTML back then HTML they used to have
the styles on it the inline styling
right now people don't do that they put
a class like an ID
back then you could copy a page and take
the whole style of it you can i okay
cool you're good but then they started
changing it up and I was like man
I'm gonna have to figure out
what the hell CSS you sure you must have
hated around CSS to there yeah so I
learn CSS to like probably like today
when I started back again in 2012
because um I never really touched it
back then you could just copy the page
and be good from the inline styling but
I didn't understand CSS like you know
it's persist for the year I didn't
understand you know how you put
in a class to damp the space and then
another class that means that you're
talking about element that's inside of
that element out
understand on that I say so I basically
started from zero like the only good
thing that I got from sin treehouse was
the other CSS after that it was
 because also they're not
 teaching me how to build a
website it's like they teaching me one
part you know at a time and then on top
of that team treehouse they're
courses were so behind
they had course is about backbone when
angular came out and then when angular
came out they have nowhere react
came out they had courses on angular
there are some dudes my backbone six
years ago yeah I started like 2011 2012
man like that's when I started man
backbone sense either yeah the shaking
left you know so that's about the way
they teach web development actually on
I'm not gonna plug my I'm not gonna plug
my site here but on my site
this ain't no professional
shipping I hate you man I check it out
thank you
oh yeah dee McDonald online calm how is
it be EE McDonald online calm won't work

Dee McDonald online yeah
to some battle Chicago yeah so what
you're looking at on the first page that
I have that web development I actually
created the database on GoDaddy and that
is being pulled dynamically from the
database the whole website the whole
website is templated I made it with PHP
I'll PHP so the whole website is modular
using includes and whatnot mm-hmm it's
all PHP so this whole basically my whole
entire site is dynamic.php form the
contact form that's real is I created it
this whole joint this whole joint look
like it looks like um bootstrap I wrote
over the media queries myself it's about
there's about 900 lines of code in that
bitch that's what about to hack some I'm
still on 35 determinate power Wow
tomorrow you don't watch it episodes
gonna be looking live I'm waiting I'm
waiting for cheering the gray now I
haven't caught up man you gotta catch up
my man Joe right now I heard you say
portfolio site is either one or two
things
hmm it's even looks like oh it's
great yeah give me you take brother give
me your tape it looks good
I like everything is good nice facing
you you resize the browser to see how it
yeah you know me like literally like I
said I wrote all of that when you see
the jQuery when you resize it and the
how
you I wrote the media queries to make
just stuff disappeared it's not supposed
to be there as a different size yeah
that's a that took me like two weeks to
do my mind so uh yeah the web
development yeah I'm sitting a plugin my
bad brothers I miss any what I'm
supposed to be talking about what I was
the original theater there is no
conversational topic was there web
development all up Mike like he
was saying you go on team treehouse
you're going they teach you tags and
anything like it's like looking at a
schematic of putting together like an
engine and it's like hey other parts
here some screws
here's a wrench put that car together
that's almost time for web development
is talk
I'm hosted in yeah I've posted on
something you live videos before and
plenty of people agree if you look at
most of these courses on you to me
they're pulling their content straight
from w3schools calm that even the way
they teach it is how w3schools calm is
laid out mmm why you selling of course
that's teaching w3schools free content
yeah yeah it's a business now you know
teaching it as a business yeah
so you got a bunch of cats don't know
what the hell they're doing yeah yeah
cut you all tree house on like I got put
it like a good 30 hours tree house on
and I couldn't do it yeah you know
y'all bought the quiz house really about
the quiz land I just know then I felt
like yo Joe channel like Chris Sean and
then I go like Lully like who is like I
found this out that's me introduce like
the mentor program yeah about yo look at
all you know I'm a ride with did it this
 don't work from was just balancing
to probably go learn networking
yeah yeah that's about when I started
getting serious with it like I was I was
kind of pissed I didn't become one of
his mentor because I was still working
you know you know I'd have a set
schedule
I think I emailed you about the right
food you know that's that email that's
it and I don't have mad cuz everybody
else dropped out oh I know I saw you I
was about to send it to you but then by
the time you had got into it when I was
about to send it to you when the other
two girls had had dropped off I was like
man about some zeal and those this other
kid that I've seen there but they're
right there ken came in and he he
snatched that up he says it's that
give me this yeah man but you know I'm
thinking about bringing it back I'm
thinking about bringing it back I might
bring it back and doing even more proper
now like you know maybe do like episodes
and like record throughout the
throughout the week of like when I get
to talk to the mentees through emails or
to the phone and cuz I don't even do
nothing as on the last one it was
the first time I was like I was
experimenting and then like once again
like this is I gave me pissed off
YouTube man I want to get off I wanna
drop on YouTube but at the same
time I don't want it to be like my main
focus my main place and that's why I
want so many people to go to my website
itself I keep saying I've been saying
Conan face.com since before I even have
the website up because at the same time
number one people be copying the
 out of my content people
still watch it people don't even
give me no credit people don't wanna
 collab but then they have bigger
channels their mind well then they take
my ideas and then they do like a little
sneaky right and it's not like it's
not like I wanna be like spazzing out
it's just I'm the type of person that
this channel is not just about like code
it's more about me too
so it's like I come here if I'm
frustrated that they I share that too
you know like people somebody sent me a
message damn
man come on bro just you know man up and
don't worry about it if they copy the
copy I'm like yeah but the point is that
 you know people come in create
ideas come up with cool and then
somebody starts doing it and don't and
then that person don't even want to work
with you so it's like why you take my
shame you don't even wanna work you know
that's the dangers of exposing you know
exposing your ideas sort of to the
masses exactly so there's like no you
know if you're doing something fly other
people gonna wanna copy yeah yeah man I
think is good is good to a certain
degree but I just wish people be
like hey in this collaborate and it's
like if you take the idea cool run woody
well at the same time is like more like
okay let me benefit for it to show me to
your to your subscribers that people
don't find me because the that then how
YouTube work is sometimes like you guys
might I find my channel by surprise
right but for somebody else they might
see my channel on page five nobody know
what I mean so that's what I'm saying
and after the whole thing yesterday
[Laughter]
replay the game Sarka boy yeah
boy charge like five hundred already
know you yeah I was like man because
then from there after a my yesterday in
like today I'll really good
because there's days divert like I would
like not like down but be like man I
know I'm doing something that I know
people send me my emails and
people will send me like yo thank
you
if we love what you doing we appreciate
it
and I'm like I'm not seeing that being
shown I'm not getting that that same
love that some other people are getting
like you know as far as like viewers and
and views and then I'm realizing like
all these people after I do my research
because people come think just because I
come in here and be like yo yo yo judge
it they people think I'm a con
dumbass and that's like a
I'm smart guys like I know what the
I'm doing right so I come I do my
research
I searched some people's I find out
how they they get their number one
Facebook groups right they paid
for that paid for a whole bunch of
Facebook groups number two they
either painful ready for people
to start giving up votes on their
 videos already or two they have
another type of social media where they
might have like you know like a million
views or some like that on through
another thing it's like like right now
let's say I create a dumb question on
Stack Overflow right and it'll be
something so dumb that anybody
could find the answer might like
how do you add a class on a HTML tag
right or Stack Overflow everybody's
everybody at the beginning is gonna ask
that on Google right so they search
that and then that page shows up so
when that page shows up on Stack
Overflow I'll add my youtube video to it
I'm gonna hate check how to add this
 how to add a class to so
HTML tag
so now YouTube goes by the fact that a
lot of people are going to do it through
a social backlinks yes so the
backlink starts rolling right and so now
YouTube comes in and starts to showing
your videos to everybody even though
your content is but now
you're just getting you're
flooded you're like oh man
so then I was like you know what man at
one point I was feeling like man I'm
my ass now creating original content
constantly doing cool I was
giving out $600 a month of free courses
out of my own pocket I wasn't making no
 money and just giving it
out to people and I was like man I
haven't doing all this for nothing
and even like now I was doing all these
tutorials and nobody was seeing it
because YouTube when you search our
tutorials my tutorials never showed up
on all you to search results so
then I say you know what this
I'm not gonna create my own my
own or Cole school where people is gonna
come in you know I'm gonna create
courses but then I'm gonna be able to
keep track of when they doing the
courses if they quit it if they leave it
if they don't like it for
whatever reason so like that I could get
better and create better content for
them you know so at the same time also -
now I'm just gonna come in I got
money in the savings and I'm gonna
 pay for the promotion but now
I'm not doing it for YouTube I'm doing
it for my ocean you know so it's like I
don't pay for the promotion but not to
be popular on YouTube like why do I care
to be popular on YouTube I'm gonna be
 doing real like going to
 meetups going to
conventions going to you know
meetup groups go to high schools and and
give talks I got somebody that basically
in South Africa that wants to fly me to
South Africa to basically give a talking
and talk to kids out there
I got another person one of my father's
friend because my father's a college
professor and you go over there to the
ER if I can give a talk in college over
there and ER like I'm doing a lot of
 so it's like I'm trying to like be
a body and not talk about it you know
cuz there's no point of me being on
YouTube they're black hey guys make sure
you check out just my website
for no reason like now let's make it
[Laughter]
like let's make it for a reason you know
or you know want to be like nope now if
I yeah I don't want to be milking people
like you
yeah like I was looking at my like my
stats laughs like when you know people
click on sorry click on the links of
Lake udemy courses and like that
I was looking at the stats and it says
that people have bought 10,000 courses
from me and I'm only only have like
5,000 5,000 subscribers every it says
almost everybody buys two courses right
so that means when you say something
about the cold steel mm-hmm MySQL
bootcamp
I'd say about it you said you talked
about it like I was go was getting yeah
so everything at the link but I just
went by your pocket havin I bought
already don't have already yeah yes so
it's like you know I was like you know
what man I'd rather you know if I'm
gonna I'm still gonna tell people hey
check out this other courses from
 cold steel see from grinder
because those are the people
that make my right but the same
time is there's certain things that
they're missing that I've noticed over
this five years cuz I've been following
these guys for a long time like I know
all this guys for a long time I
know even John Samus I know John summers
for like five years he's a he's another
guy that has been around for a long time
you know so I follow all these guys and
I've studied the ways that they've done
it in this industry and how they've kind
like John some is really popular in
Pluralsight right um 50 plus courses
yeah Steve from Grider is super popular
fucking-a a udemy now he which there's
another thing he just opened up his own
website
I'm like bro like you got like the best
 courses and you just open the
website now like you should have been
doing that for five years already
you know
steal clothes filled that guy he don't
play he's getting two million dollars a
year like he don't play no games like he
knows what the hell he's doing you know
what I mean plus whatever they pay him
on other fracking on boot camps cuz he
also teaches boot camps live so San
Francisco in San Francisco so he's like
 legit you know he's like one of
those guys that he don't talk about it
he just be a body's all right that's
what I do
you know so for me is that guy I always
wanted to teach like my first
thing that I was gonna become right
after high school is gonna be a teacher
my mom was a teacher my father's a
college professor so you know it's only
natural for me to want to teach somebody
else something that I learned you know
so let's see how it goes I mean he's
doing good right now so let's see how it
is taking Martin man you not an
internetwork yeah exactly
that's what I'm saying like I know how
this thing works and it's like I know I
just gotta keep working hard keep
promoting my website because that's
another thing so I don't want to when it
comes to YouTube I'm not gonna be like
hey guys come check out my
courses cuz I don't want to be doing it
YouTube is for me to like hang
out with people share
new review other people's courses
review other things that like libraries
and frameworks that's what YouTube is
for but then now I'm gonna take out of
my own money that I have saved and I'm
gonna pay for advertising in other
websites and other so sent to my
website you know like the same that
I have on YouTube it's still gonna be
the same thing I'm not going like
 fake or are they you know
no you know what I mean like
become this other person just
like promoting his own courses
like that's not what I want to do for
you
that what you say over bunny saying that
if you're doing good stuff you should be
doing the promotion's also because it's
gonna reach more people and you know I'm
I'm definitely gonna do the promotion
definitely gonna do more promotion I
just don't wanna I don't wanna do it
through like blessing if I do the
promotion I don't want to send a
promotion to my YouTube I wanna send it
to my website because when you do it
through YouTube I've noticed a lot of
times people follow you like I say they
have a hundred thousand subscribers but
then they only get one thousand views
whenever they drop the video I got five
thousand subscribers like six thousand
subscribers and when I drop a video I
get one thousand views which means I'm
getting 20% of views out of whatever
subscribers I got yeah while they they
getting you know 1% which means out of
that hundred thousand that they got only
1000 percent of the subscribers are like
lawyer subscribers for me is 20%
you know so I rather just NAB flood it
with like fake subscribers and people
that are not really in the community and
just in a good way ya know that's one
like I just want to do it I want to do
is more I wanna keep YouTube is like my
core you know core place where I could
be myself in you know do what I gotta do
I hang out with the cool peoples here
but then my website is gonna be my
website website is gonna be where I
create you know very good content
content that takes me hours to make it's
not just like how was doing tutorials
here on YouTube where I was doing
tutorials you know YouTube I'll be like
Oh today I want to create an Instagram
post and it's like I go in and just
right away with what our no planning
with making mistakes and a whole bunch
of you know but this new one that I
I do it right now this Facebook one this
 is not there's no mistake sorry you
know what I mean like everything is
legit the JavaScript course everything
is legit this jQuery course is
legit the laravel course is legit like
that oh oh no I was other thing like
yeah I think you should do it like that
like separate the channels cuz like like
if you look at like like the man right
now like Gary Vee fun that's all he does
like he just put out Mac I think he
didn't want the book called he drop a
little slice button and then he's the
best oh he's a new account best song on
the show you're not even pushing it all
the time yeah rolls book is it just the
content daddy talked about things I'm
cool yeah that's exactly that's exactly
what I want to do is just like this is
just content for me to hang out with my
peoples here and motivate people to
continue and like even if they're not
taking any of my courses or to the my
subscription or you know if they
see me on you to me because this
questions are gonna go in you to me too
you know so when they seem to do to me
that when I ocean so Joe was
serious about his change you know I was
like there's gonna be some people's
that's gonna be tight they're gonna be
like man I could have caught that
four finalists that day you know but
that's just how it is man you know you
you snooze you lose gotta do that right
here man so which you guys is up to
right now like as far as like cold like
what you guys are working on
I'm going to be in second year okay all
right no you smart that's how you gotta
do it you gotta you gotta go hard
especially JavaScript man mmm it's like
this HTML CSS is the view but you need
JavaScript to actually learn programming
like if you don't you already know
because you was doing Java but for most
people they don't know programming
language in JavaScript is usually their
first programming language they get
introduced to and people think that
JavaScript is easy but it's not because
JavaScript the language itself is easy
but then when you're working on a page
it could get difficult because now
you're dealing with the Dom tree
which is different so for a lot of
people that can become difficult now
what are the things that are different
from Java right now I think for you you
good cuz you already know programming
now all you have to do is just get
really good with the Dom like the best
way for you to understand the Dom is get
really good with with CSS as far as like
you know finding out how to change
something like let's say how to change
em right the e/m tag inside of a div
that has another div with an idea of car
with a class of I don't know a
 menu and then inside of that
there's another paragraph and then
inside of that paragraph that's a M so
if you know how to basically go into
that throw CSS and like figure it out
then you understand the dog
is that whether I should go for the
jQuery because right now I have
JavaScript that if conditioning and all
variables have done a bit arrays I have
done and the functions I should go for
jQuery or I should dig deeper into the
JavaScript yeah I think it depends if
you want a job quick just do it with
jQuery now if you want to become an
expert in JavaScript then get go go
deeper into JavaScript you know but it
all depends like for you what you want
to get into is freelancing so you could
do that with just jQuery right away and
so the best experience is gonna be from
clients and best experience is gonna be
from a job so you like messing brain now
you you start marketing yourself a fiber
or Craig Siddhas or whatever company up
work right and then you get a client and
the client tells you hey I want you to
create a slider that comes from
the sky and does a 360 on the
screen right you don't know how to do
that right now but you're gonna find out
because the client told you to do it so
now you basically now you you have a
timeline you're like okay I got a
delicious about Friday I gotta send it
out I gotta test it out so you're gonna
 learn more than when you're
actually looking at videos on YouTube or
looking at videos on oh you don't
because you don't means teaching you the
same that everybody teaches a
 to-do app or oh here's how to
 remove an object or how to add
an object to JSON or do this and they're
like those those little things anybody
could do that the problems will
come when a client comes in and tells
you to build something that nobody has
ever built
those are the situations that they are
you know they could get stressful or
they could get really go for you because
then you learn you learn how to do it
yeah you definitely gotta do the work
that's what I tell everybody just as
soon as you know how to make a
page if you can make a design you can
make a page out of a design then you're
ready to get a job because the job is
there for you right so all you have to
do is just start applying and then let
them hire you and then at first
you don't have to go in and get a lot of
money for it all you need is that first
job to get the experience you know I
tell people if you don't have no kids
and you don't have no like you know big
 expenses you know it's okay take
a pay cut for two or three months you
know it's fine you know
because then after that that after
you leave that job your next job is
gonna be exponentially bigger like
you're gonna make so much money like
that's what happened to me I went in I
was making $14 an hour my first job and
then after I my was at 32 so as I
got double my money in two
months after I quit that first jobs but
yeah Kim you too man I want you to
 get your out here man I
want to see some of your pages man cuz
you know I know you you working hard man
I want to see you if I can succeed in
this both of you yeah both of ya
you know for care like I want to
see exactly now I want to see you do
some pages man like you got anything
online that we can see not yet I've been
working on some stuff but I haven't put
it on my gaiter yet I do that this week
done
the how about you okay
let me see what you got you got anything
new I just don't know oh boy funny
it's on you kid I'm talking to you kid
oh yeah I just been playing along my
sequel and I like planet like I like my
peoples I think it's fun for ya it's
like most of the jobs like you need a
bachelor's degree nah man stop listening
to that man that's I say used
to piss me off every time I look online
it's like I don't have a degree I don't
know what I'm gonna do man trust me
nobody gives a about that I'm
being honest people care about your work
in your portfolio if you have an amazing
portfolio if you go to a www a RDS and
you have a website of that caliber of
that quality you're gonna get hired into
any company right and that's for your
portfolio
you wanna have a portfolio that people's
gonna look at it and be like damn this
guy works for major agencies but in
reality you just work for yourself you
work in your house you know it's like
you have websites for you for you you
know you haven't you haven't had any
clients that are big or anything like
that
but you wanna have a website that looks
like your you've been working with major
companies you know even if you did like
let's say a website for coca-cola but on
your own for your own portfolio you want
something like major companies and be
like a new movie came out make a website
for ammo for a movie a new jzi
will came out for 40 40 whatever for 44
I still got it
listen I make a website
fresher you know look at our YouTube
recreate YouTube with your own way your
own styles and you know recreate it like
when I was like in my first year first
second year I recreated a YouTube design
I did a YouTube design right which was a
redesign of YouTube right and there was
this company that they wanted to hire me
of that because they they liked what I
did with it and I didn't work
for YouTube or Google but they liked
what I did they liked the way how things
came out so you guys can do the same
 you know you don't you don't need
to have a client for you to start making
cool cool projects you don't have to
wait for it because if you wait for it
then this might just take you a
whole year to get a job you want to get
a job as soon as possible you know yeah
that's what I've been like I've been
telling her like that's the market right
like I got the - like I got the mouth
Romar the fight for not all mental
hmm I've been using knows who and said
that I'll see if I can get like any
response which you think that's a bad
idea you think that's like relation to
million the first mentorship side you
said oh yeah yeah you know you feel like
I got them on Heroku like so so I just
been like and I bought a domain not just
doing a morning see if I can probably
get some run like I don't know you think
that's a good idea or not you got a
 create websites man it doesn't
matter what type is it if it's for
business or real business or if it's for
one of my projects start building build
your portfolio and then start putting in
the websites that you build because the
the thing is that people's gonna search
for you right you co-signed uh you can
start sending out resumes and people are
gonna hire you depending on what they
they find on the internet you know
depending of what type of work or what
type of design and is your portfolio
legit you know cuz nobody cares about if
you have a bachelor's degree because
there's almost jobs right
and nobody to Philly that they like we
just need somebody to do this
 like can he do it okay cool
higher that's it you know what I mean
like your first job you're not gonna get
paid top dollar because they're gonna be
like oh we taking a risk on this person
we don't know if this person's good so
that's fine you're gonna go in there do
your job and then if they don't
 give you a decent amount in two
months two three months I mean I okay
thank you thank you for that opportunity
and that's it apply somewhere else I'm
gonna go I have three months of
experience I have in this company and
then I have seven months of coding in
your house right and then you say hey I
have four clients I created
websites for you know even though that
could be but you have two
websites there to show for you know what
I mean oh that brings looks like I was
watching on simple program a channel
yeah some dude on there they said like
it's the little hack like I don't know
I'm trying to get your opinion on this
they say like this is what you should do
you should go register LLC and make up
some like names like agency and
just put that on your resume like our
work there for like three months six
months and let's just make up like yeah
like use like the fights you use as
projects or whatever is your reference
so it makes it look like you had a job
all the time
not it's just looking at you how what
you think about that I mean I mean if
somebody was if somebody wants to take
that much time to create some like
he could find a job like by that
time this was like look the best thing
to do is just create websites right if
you if you really want to have a real
business look around your neighborhood
search online go on Google Maps and see
who was around your neighborhood that
doesn't have a website and be like hey
man I will build your website it's a we
can work something out
here's my design so that's the thing you
gotta have other websites
those businesses to trust you like
nobody's gonna come in and be like even
if they don't have a website even if
they don't care about our website right
but if you come to them with a
legit website with multiple projects
you're like oh look I have this website
for this pics area I have this website
for this restaurant I have this website
for a Pet dropper or a
pet walker type of business whatever it
is right and you come to them and be
like hey I did this three businesses
even though if they're not real
businesses those are websites that you
built but they look good dabbe real
business is gonna say okay cool build it
for us like they could work you could
work something out with them or if they
if they don't want to you've been like
listen I'm gonna build it for
you for free if you want it you want it
if you don't it's fine I'm gonna build
it for you that's it you put it under
the pressure of like hey man you guys
don't have a website it's 2017 I'm
googling your website on online I can't
find you I see that you guys are on
Google Maps but don't have a website let
me help you out let me build the website
for me yeah that's why we're doing like
I smoke like I've already made like a
list like I seen like a bunch of fights
in my day that's I got like some weii
motherf are hitting them up like yo I
don't think it'd be me yeah yeah yeah
hit on Instagram to the d-ends on there
- yeah and just him I'm walking I'm like
what the email am I good I'm going like
yeah cuz like they could diffic nor the
email they're going yeah you could go
you could go to the place and be like
listen man I'm a web developer I live
here locally this all the desires that
I've worked well that I've built just
talk to them and ask them like directly
then I hate can I can I talk to the
manager or the person that makes
decisions here for this business and
just be honest is you know first you're
gonna be nervous but then you're like
what the do I care is a
piece of shop or
like that you know what I mean like is a
realist a so real
estate we're like two old ass white
people like who cares like just go in
there just you know hey man okay
I'm here to build your website
what you wanna do nothing like that what
you're trying to do that like that for
real but sometimes you just gotta be
direct with people not to the extreme
but just be like yo man I'll build it

you came out and you did the website for
the person and you guy let's say
$300 for $400 you use that experience in
that as you know packaging that you're
gonna have their extra you know buy
yourself some cakes or take wife into
the movies whatever you know whatever
