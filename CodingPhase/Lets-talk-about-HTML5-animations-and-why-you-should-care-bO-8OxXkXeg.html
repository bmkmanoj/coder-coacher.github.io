it again man coding face.com your boys
back and I don't did it again we in here
we still here man
we right here man listen today we got a
special show a special live show with
you guys we're gonna talk about you know
css3 animations we're gonna talk about
JavaScript animations we're gonna talk
about who uses them why you should care
about them why you should try to learn
these things because it's just gonna
open the doors for you guys to you know
have more opportunities than other
developers and that's just being honest
all right so let's get started okay I'm
gonna share my screen with you guys so
you guys could see a couple of you know
the jobs that's out there for developers
who know animation okay cuz that's why
we here for man this whole channel is
all about jobs and this whole channel is
all about making money I'm not gonna
talk to you guys about you know
raspberry pies and we now making no
money with raspberry pies all right so
we're gonna come over here we're gonna
talk about that glop okay so let me
share the screen all right so I mean
there's a whole bunch of jobs if you
search JavaScript animations you're
gonna find a whole bunch of different
type of jobs you're gonna find different
agencies you're gonna find you know
major companies like Linode they
basically need somebody who who knows
you know SVG's who knows gee sap who
knows you know css3 animations like all
those things that they definitely need
it let's see what else there's a whole
bunch of jobs out here html5 elearning
developer which means it's like you're
going to be creating websites for you
know for the school system or it could
be like teaching students um a certain
topic and they need animations then
somebody who's who's comfortable with it
you know twenty-five to forty dollars an
hour starting which means that pretty
much if you're a junior developer you
could get in there if you start seeing
those type of numbers that means as a
junior developer you could get in there
okay
of course then you're gonna see that the
big ones where you start seeing you know
eighty two to a hundred thousand even
the Lindo that thing was like over a
hundred thousand dollars you got Shopify
developer with animation you have
experienced UI designer which in reality
is like even though they put designer is
really because not every developer out
there understands animations right you
have to understand this thing a lot of
developers they think like hey me
creating the you know the the latest
algorithm or something that's super fast
and super small like that's where it's
at and it realities like this a whole
different world out there okay I'm gonna
give you guys this good example you know
those guys out there who are trying to
find work they're trying to find you
know jobs but all they could do is just
create a page that's it and all they
could do is just connect to a database
and connect to the back end that's all
they can do right so they're their jobs
that they could get the jobs that they
could get it's very small right because
they don't have a whole bunch of
different skills right when you have a
whole bunch of different skills that's
like you're more valuable you're
basically you're the go-to guy to
basically almost everything like hey man
we need some animations can you make
this you're good as I guess I could do
that
hey yo could you create something to
react you'd be like yes I could do that
you need something with you know could
you come in and edit some files that we
had on jQuery from a long time ago you'd
be like yes I could do that you know the
more that you can say yes to the more
valuable you are okay
there's guys that only have like three
four skills right when you have only
three four skills
you're at the bottom with everybody else
the people that that rise to the top
are the people that can do either a lot
of different things which makes them
very valuable or they have master like
one specific thing in web development or
programming right like let's say
somebody who who's just like they've
learned everything about JavaScript they
create their own libraries they create
their own open-source projects that are
very popular has like 10,000 stars on
github you know those guys they have
their own niche right so company hire
them a lot of companies hire them
because they already like you know
there's a name to them so it's like that
that guy was his name on Dan Abramov I
think the creator of Redux right when
Facebook hired him is like not only were
they buying him but also Redux because
in reality now they just gave me the
high call is like the street cred to
Facebook like okay this guy is like
legit everybody respects him and now
he's part of the Facebook team okay now
in you know for other people you know
for other developers if you're not just
like one of those guys that are just
like a master of one single thing then
what you could do is just be a master of
all the things that are useful although
all of the things that people are going
to come to you and be like hey can you
create this for me and if you say yeah I
could do it I've done it before then
people are always gonna say oh man that
guy is valuable we can't let that guy go
we gotta give that guy that race you
know what I mean so let's get back to
their animations because you know
sometimes you need to see the things in
in perspective to understand it so I
mean this is website called cold drops
it's pretty legit all of the developers
here that that release um different
examples
they've been here for a long time and
like this super popular but as you can
see they have a whole bunch of different
animations they basically the whole
website is all about
displaying the type of animations that
you can create or CSS and sometimes G
SAP you know and what's cool about this
is like it just gives the user a better
experience like if you see something
that's flawless you see the animation
running at 60 frames per second you'll
be like okay like these people know what
they doing this is not like some
beginner guys you know trying to get in
the game like they've been doing this
for a while you know I mean I mean they
have a lot of different uh UI things
that can be very useful like you see
like this animation here that's like a
search let's see another one as you can
see the search like that pop like that
come and click there as you see the
multiple pages and it just makes your
website different it makes your website
not the bootstrap a little websites that
you see out here like if you ever want
to be able to win an award for you know
website for like a website that you
create like you have to be able to
create animations and and do all the
cool stuff that everybody else is doing
you know now one thing that I'm going to
say tool about this is animations is not
for every company right animations
doesn't work for every single company
most of the times that you're gonna see
like a lot of animations and a lot of
cool stuff is gonna be in digital
agencies alright so like let's say Nike
comes in and Nike says hey man we need a
website automatically they're gonna
reach out to an agency that specializes
in this because most of the time they
don't even have developers that know how
to do this on their company right now
every developer knows this stuff like I
like I told you like a lot of developers
they focus so much and the technical
thing stuff like hey man we want to
figure out this algorithm we want to do
this in that and that's cool if that's
what you're into but after a while it
gets really
boring you know cuz it's like every
single website does the same thing like
there's no website out there that you
can say oh this is completely different
you know what I mean like unless you're
doing animations and unless you're doing
like cool projects for different brands
then that's when you're building cool
stuff that you could be like oh man I'm
building a whole different type of
website because there's like let's say
you work for e-commerce right every
e-commerce looks the same it has the the
categories it has the products it has
like a car it has a you know checkout
page it has all of those things right
all that can get very boring and very
stagnant after a while because you're
like building the same thing over and
over and over again but when you're
working in a digital agency you're
constantly getting new projects new
things that people are working on that
you could be like oh wow like you know
what I mean like this is cool like look
with scrolling it looks like a wave and
the wave changes changes the background
and the video I think everything else
animates like there's so many cool
examples like you could definitely check
out this website a Awards com
so is a WWE RDS comm check it out it's
pretty legit it's like you'll see here
the best of the best this is not this is
not like you know so some guys trying to
do it no these are the guys that are
doing it in the world
right and this is a worldwide thing like
there's a whole bunch of different
digital agencies out there creating
websites for different brands now
there's this company called creative
circle which is why I've worked in so
many big companies because of them their
website is creative circle com if you
live in New York or even in oh maybe I
wrote it wrong
creative circle
if you live in New York or you live in
the United States or even outside of the
United States you guys should definitely
reach out to these people like they have
like major you know major major of
people like it's not just like oh yeah
it's like Johnny's little ecommerce
website no this is a legit websites like
you get MTV you get a Viacom say well
how did it you get um you know
Kellogg's like they have all the big
brands man like as you can see who come
here check from different states for me
is New York come in and be like hey see
where is they development
see what they got junior full stack
developer they always have jobs they are
you know WordPress a wordpress developer
mid-level front-end developer and what's
cool about this which I like a lot of
these jobs are like attempt to contract
work so like let's say you could come in
and say hey I want to work six months
out of the year
alright you could come in and make
$70,000 that year in those six months
right and then from there you could do
other stuff you could work on your own
projects you could do whatever the hell
you want like I did this for like a year
and a half of like work with them and
work with a whole bunch of companies all
those big companies that I have my you
know my LinkedIn and on my website have
been thanks to them it hasn't been like
through a recruiter or anything even
though they like sort of like a
recruited company you know they
basically they come in and and they hook
you up you know what I mean so it's
pretty legit all right let me see what
else I want to show you guys yeah so
like I said you got this website called
drops they always have cool examples
that you can see cool animations that it
just makes the website legit and this
are the type of skills that you're gonna
need if you're planning on taking the
route of working inside of a digital
agency okay because you're gonna be
working on mold
or different you know different clients
so it's not just gonna be like one
person who is like you know one single
website it doesn't work like that when
you work in a digital agency you're
gonna work with a whole bunch of
different type of companies okay so it's
pretty legit see like this one has that
animation like that you can put it from
any side and it was cool tool although
the code that you see here you guys can
take this code and reuse it on your
websites
so they've done like a lot of cool stuff
man
I say doing move so it's pretty early
jamming like I said you know they have a
whole bunch of different examples now
the top leading libraries that I know of
right now it's definitely G SAP when it
comes to JavaScript okay yes you could
use css3 yes you could use you know just
transitions that it comes with
Gyan you know css3 but gee sap is so
much better because you have tween light
you had three max you have timeline
timeline max so pretty much these are
part of the library all right where they
give you a whole bunch of
functionalities where you could actually
come in and set up things as if it was
like a movie that's the easiest way of
explaining have you ever used something
like Adobe After Effects or have you
ever used something like iMovie you know
it's like you have a timeline you set it
up to see how far the animation goes you
get to have control of every single
element on your page it's pretty legit
jisub is the best okay you have peaks
ejs which is an html5 creation engine a
lot of people use this as you can see if
you start scrolling here you see Adobe
BBC HBO Disney Red Bull YouTube Lego
Cartoon Network Ubisoft hmm Spotify
yes kids Marvel you know all of these
companies use this lucasfilm's you know
fox like all of these companies have
used pick CGS in some type of way okay
you have animations you have a whole
bunch of cool stuff that you can build
let's say even Google uses pixie Jes and
I've seen them a lot of times every time
that you see like an animation on
google.com 99.9% they're using pixie Jes
okay now the people who are working on
this it's not the regular developers who
are working on this it's guys that have
made it into a career to say hey I'm
gonna get into animations and make this
thing like meet you know what I mean
not all of you guys are meant to be in
front of a desk working for an
e-commerce website now all of you guys
are there you know gonna be there in
front of a computer working on a product
excuse me I'm a little bit sick but not
all of you guys are meant for that you
know what I mean some of you guys are
more creative than others
and some of you guys just don't even
know that you guys are creative okay
like there's people that I don't even
know how to draw like this is not about
drawing or did not borrow animations
like you could look into it but reality
there's a designer there's somebody
who's an artist who's drawing all of
these things for you you as the
developer you make it happen but you're
not dealing with the assets itself
alright you also have Barbara Jas which
is basically it's just exactly how to
say create badass fluid and smooth
transitions between your website pages
okay just like how we see over here or
was a page reveal same way how you see
this where you say this animation goes
from one side to the other side what
happens there you could come in and use
the same animation with Barbara Jas and
basically change the
so let's say you have your website you
want your website to just look fluid it
doesn't look like when you click a
button and or click a menu takes you to
the next page in its loading forever
like you want to have an animation like
it's like pre loading like you use
Barbara Jes for all of that okay so you
got that one then you have scroll magic
scroll magic is cool for whenever you're
scrolling you wanna enemy different
elements on the page let me see if I
could show you guys a little bit more
they have a couple example let's see see
appliance LT so as you scroll the pace
changes and you as you can see you're
scrolling and then what what this is
doing its move this element to the left
so you're controlling the whole flow of
the page as you scroll so all of that
stuff is done with you know scroll magic
I mean I've seen people do it with
vanilla JavaScript but it's like it's
better to use a library then you trying
to do it yourself because it just it
doesn't come out the same way like this
guys have tried this out if they've
mastered this you know you building it
yourself with another JavaScript it's
not gonna be the best optimized way okay
so as you can see whole bunch of
animations as you scroll so pretty much
the scroll magic you have control of all
of the elements on your page with your
scroll on your mouse or on your laptop
all right now I wanted to show you guys
a little something because sometimes
people also think they'd be like oh man
you know games is not for for the
developers and like games are boring you
know it's like I don't want to become a
game developer or this this and that you
know I want to focus on programming and
you know doing the best I don't know
doing the the nerdiest thing in the
world like this guy's out there like
that
it's not me joking around but
this guy's out there who'd be like oh
man I just want to do like you know the
best algorithm that's out there it's
like okay bro like you could keep that
keep that title for yourself you know
what I mean like I want to be building
cool stuff that I could be proud of you
know what I mean
but this is an example a few years ago
when I used to work for create a circle
date they let me know that they wanted
somebody to come in and and create a
game for for Kellogg's now this game out
there not created but this is me by the
same team that I was pretty much gonna
work with them at the end of the day I
decided to take another job because they
were paying me more which now if I if I
was to think about it now I will take it
back as the money wasn't worth it in
this thing would've bring so much cooler
okay so I'm seeing clear he returns time
to before break let me see what it says
okay for some reason it has like some
type of cookie look this ain't time for
a break so I love this thing on for a
reason okay so here we go so there's the
game basically they did it with G SAP
and and a little bit of how you call
this goo it's a it's another library I
forgot I gotta get it for you guys but
yeah there's the game very simple
it's not crazy I mean when you gave your
body even like oh it's so simple
it is alright I mean this project alone
this project alone was like I believe it
was like a eighty thousand dollar job to
do it and they were basically doing it
in like three months
so we had three months to build this
thing and I mean I didn't take it
because I that point I was gonna get a
hundred thousand in my head I said oh
I'm gonna get a hundred thousand dollars
this year if I would have freaking
thought about it I'm like wait there's a
three month job where you're gonna get
eighty I don't know I don't know what
the hell I was thinking this is one of
those things where I regret it I'm not
taking this job coz who knows what how I
would have been doing right now you know
what I mean I could have been creating
freakin a whole bunch of games for like
Kellogg's or even though the you know
smaller companies like Cartoon Network
has a whole bunch of other games like to
let me see and one of those things are
related to like what I told you guys
like all this stuff is related to
animations G SAP understanding I mean
this was me with with flash there's
other ones that Missy where is it that's
one that they had which was where is it
card store ok card to know where soccer
man
I mean if you look into this see what
libraries they're using this or jQuery
so continue so they took it down I guess
they took it down say yes I think they
took it down but they have a whole bunch
of different things and like I said man
this literally like a bunch of companies
out there looking for people who are who
are into animation who can actually come
in and create cool things and it's
really not that hard at all like if you
know CSS and you know JavaScript like
you're good to go
this is not like we recreating the wheel
we're recreating something that's
totally different this is just about
freaking building you know building a
neighbor building just moving elements
that's it you know all of the stuff is
done with the the canvas so you could
come in and just create that it's not
that hard at all
see like canvas with 970 high 66 or 600
so it's like there's so many different
things that you guys could fall into you
know there's another good example of an
animation and I'm pretty sure the people
that got paid for this they probably
made like a hundred two hundred thousand
dollars you know just to build this and
this thing only takes mostly probably
like two months to three months to build
you know what I mean to perfect it you
have a designer you have like maybe two
people on the team working on the
animation sometimes you might have just
one person doing everything because in
reality this is just scroll scrolling
and seeing animations so you could
literally be just one developer to get
one project but okay hey you're working
on the mall mcwhopper for mcdonalds
project okay so you and and Johnny the
designer yeah you guys need to come up
with basically
the website you know and then from there
you do meetings and do a whole bunch of
BS you know office stuff you know no
matter what if it's a digital agency you
still gotta go through like doing
meetings so you can't run away from that
but at the end of the day it's way
better to work with this type of
companies then to actually work in an
e-commerce website or working a single
product company like is it's so much
better because every single month or
every single two weeks you come in and
you get a new project something new
something cool that you could be like oh
cool I'm working on this project
something that you could be like hey I
work for this company I worked on this
campaign I worked on this other thing
right so there's a whole bunch of stuff
that you guys can definitely learn and
just look into it
just look into it I'm not saying man hey
you gotta become the the best CSS 3d
animator the best G SAP JavaScript
developer like you don't have to be the
best it's up to you if you want to go in
and say hey I'm gonna master this this
technology I'm gonna master this this
framework this library is up to you all
right
so yeah man and one of the reasons what
I'm doing is I'm talking about this is
because I'm basically gonna start this
week this new course on it on animations
and all this stuff this is things that
I've learned over the past five years
every company that I've been to I've
either work with animations or I've
worked with the canvas css3 is like I
don't know I don't even know how to how
to explain it to people like css3 to me
is like it's like so easy like I could
live with my eyes closed
jiseop is also pretty easy any of you
guys can definitely jump into that you
know
so definitely anyways man let me see
what's good with everybody so we got
people in the chat room let me know what
you guys think
interesting animations or you know
getting into this niche part of what
development is up to you but definitely
I think a lot of you guys should learn
at least the basics because it just
makes you a more mmm how can I say like
a more attractive developer out there
you know I'll make you stand down from
everybody else cuz you gotta think about
it like a lot of those people they don't
look into these things like this is more
like more advanced this is things that
we will consider more advanced web
topics because not everybody is gonna
jump on this at all now everybody's
gonna do this because number one they
don't have the patience number two they
don't understand it number three people
feel like some people think like oh that
this is easy
so it's dumb you know I've heard so many
stories from people like and dumb
comments they blend all many animations
and you know that's boring you know
every animation that you see from a
Google advertising somebody built that
right so every single company needs
somebody who knows those things and when
they don't have developers that know
those things they have to go out and
hire a digital agency the digital agency
pretty much rapes every single company
out there and just makes them spend a
whole bunch of money like let's say if
there's a developer that works in a
company and he could do it and he's
getting paid let's say eight to ten
thousand dollars a month right he would
come in and get the job done but a
digital agency would be like oh yeah how
big is your company your company is you
know you guys make twenty million
dollars a year cool you guys gotta pay
your seventy thousand dollars for that
month right so something that's gonna
take one person to do which could be you
at that company your company is gonna
have to hire a big you know agency to
basically create this animations for
them which is gonna cause on like 50 to
100 thousand dollars so you know what I
mean so it just makes you
wanna track this one recruiter a a
company's CEO they're gonna look at you
but even the CTO is gonna look at Jim be
like oh this person has skills on this
so now we pretty much we're gonna save
money on that because now he could do it
for us okay so yeah man and all the big
companies you know everything from
Facebook to LinkedIn to Netflix all of
those companies have people that
specialize on animation because they
need it you know I mean so it's up to
you if you really want to jump on it or
not alright so let me see who's in here
we got Freddy Martinez we got to Eve
we got Aaron and beta Aaron and beta
says what's up Joe from South Africa
word your boys in South Africa word I
need to go out there and we got Joseph
Torres man Joseph man keep your head up
man
I know Windows is killing you right now
you know but I definitely know Windows
is killing you and you haven't been able
to to work on everything that you want
to work on because of your computer but
man try to install that Linux try to get
node in there man I don't know what to
tell you man I feel bad
I'll be honest but that's why I tell
people man when you're a developer you a
junior developer you don't have the the
you know the background in like dealing
with a whole bunch of issues with
Windows like and you just want to focus
on the code you don't want to focus on
unit testing or debugging your computer
like man max is just the way to go is
like like this man like you hit the
ground running so who else we got in
here got Kelvin Davis what up we got
Burke I'd tumor we got Phillippe of
Atlantic Gomez let me see Philippe is
like yo there you go a beginner friendly
tutorial you can do why don't you show
us a page transition effects with
Barbara Jas there are any tutorials on
it and Mac companies use Barbara Jas yep
yeah man I'm adding all of that to the
website Man Thing is like look guys
let's let's take a quick look let's take
a quick look look like and we go to my
channel right now coding phase calm Hey
not cold face not count coding free with
a youtube.com slash coding phase all
right I basically put up a very good
tutorial on how to build your portfolio
and doing everything and out of
everybody barely anybody watched it out
of all the people who are who are
actually doing the portfolio maybe a
hundred 200 people watched it I no
longer want to be putting any tutorials
on YouTube it just is not worth it right
so I rather just put it up on you to me
I'll put it up on on my website where
people are gonna appreciate it because
look how many hours I put into that
tutorial you know what I mean like how
long do we really freaking build a whole
website
I couldn't literally no lie I could've
literally went on Craigslist found a
client and built that for them and
freaking what a freaking make some money
out of that but nobody wants to in
YouTube so it's like it's discouraging
to me when I'm like man nobody watches
it on YouTube that sucks you know what I
mean like I need to talk to traversing
media so he could give me the hook-up so
I can understand how come you tube
doesn't show none of my tutorials to
people and it's like this is tutorials
that people are really watching and
people really wanna they should be
watching but somehow tutorials my
tutorials don't show up on YouTube so I
just don't want to put it up here but
like I said man on my website I'm
putting everything I rather teach it to
the people that really care about it and
the people that get to see it you know I
mean like putting it on YouTube
it's literally like a waste like the
things that people
like to see me do here in YouTube and
the things that YouTube actually shows
to people is when I talk about topics I
review something I do a top ten
programming languages or stuff like that
those are the things that YouTube
supports for my channel so then it's
like me putting tutorials on YouTube
makes no sense and I've seen that
happens to so many people too I've seen
people with amazing tutorials and then
you'll be like wait how come this person
only has like three hundred views on a
tutorial that's like super useful and
it's like oh yeah YouTube don't show it
to nobody so you know what I mean so
it's like who wants to come in and spend
hours and hours on creating a tutorial
and nobody watches it so it's like at
least if I put it on my website
I know thousands of people are gonna
watch it there so that's why but anyway
incoming html5 code by the way digit JIT
you already know
let me see web components animations
make websites look more like a app yeah
I get stuff we create a circle all the
time in Phoenix Arizona yeah they got a
big office over there too or Phoenix cuz
I remember when I wanted to move to to
Phoenix I was doing research and they
told me years like we got offices in
Phoenix and they got offices in Dallas
and they got offices in San Francisco so
if you're in those cities
check out creative circle they're pretty
legit let me see who else is in here who
else is in here who is seeing here we
got busy rent
we got Ramsay Jordan we got Matthew
Smith we got Iran who else Baja Dean
Helene let's see Sicarius leaf we got
you don't know J s coding forever : fire
axe did I create this game no I did not
create this game I was supposed to be
part of it um and I I did some idiot I
did some like grilled dumb they
like you know how in the beginning
because look when there was a point in
my life when I was like learning to code
and all this stuff and I was building
websites and I was already in the
industry but I was like stuck at at a
crossroad of like hate the most I could
get was like 70,000 right so my whole
goal was to be like hey I want to touch
a hundred thousand even if I don't stay
in the company the whole year I want to
have that like that stamp of like yeah
that's how much I was earning right so
then when creator circle they told me
about the Kellogg's job I was like I
could do this this is easy but at the
same time I don't know why but I was
like they wasn't giving they wasn't
giving like benefits or anything like
that so I had this other company asked
me that or that they were offering
benefits that we're offering way more
money I was gonna make like a hundred
thousand dollars plus benefits and you
know 401 K and all that stuff which in
the end doesn't mean anything because
it's like who cares you know what I mean
so it was done and this job was like
three months for three months on there
you know it was gonna be like a
three-month contract and I was like man
I want to go into you know do like a
full-time whatever and so I chose to go
to as me that org
instead of choosing to do that
little-ass project like that project is
so dumb like it's so easy that I'll be
kicking myself in the head all the time
when I think about it this guy said if
you're not using Dreamweaver you're not
a real developer stop trolling man
nobody uses Dreamweaver man burkay says
good thing you didn't take the job maybe
this this channel would have been a game
development channel word that's true
let me see it wells
see what else people are saying man I'm
open to everything Kevin Davis says I'm
open to everything let me the
screen cuz I know a lot of you guys
wanna you want to get your shine - you
know what I mean like you know dudes
want to shine out here you know what I
mean like that's all we see dudes want
to get their shine on they want to get
the name out there like hey man I was in
the livestream show me up there Joe show
some love all right so I got you let me
show you some love right now show some
love right now man all right so we got
we got your boy Burke a tamer Burke a
timber I don't know that's hot that's
what you say your name I don't know let
me see who else is in here looking at
older things that people say massive the
mash is like 80 K to make that yes
eighty k to make that I mean I don't
think it was exactly 80 K I think it was
like 77 so it's like 77 like 77 64 or
something like that
right because it's like they do it by
the hour right so let's say 77-64 and
then divided by three so you make
$25,000 per yeah $25,000 per month and
then from their creative circle takes
takes a couple of percentages so let's
say an example you make $18,000 right
now - - michaelis - taxes so let's say
you're making about let's say 12,000
five hundred per month that's how much I
would have been making and it wasn't
that bad it's just at that moment I was
like man I want I want to get that stamp
that $100,000 of stamp you know what I
mean if I would have thought about it
now
plus it's like you're gonna make this
money in three months and then what
happens if you don't if you don't get a
job in my head I was like used to be
worried I'd be like yeah but what
happens if I don't get a job and after
the third month you know what I mean
it's like I'm so stupid because I've
never been able to last like more than
two weeks without finding a job like
jobs are everywhere so if I would have
known all the things that I know now I
would have been like yeah just take it
you're freaking gonna make freaking you
know twelve thousand dollars after taxes
every freaking month like for three
months straight like you could just
literally chill I know people that they
make $50,000 a year and I said they
don't work no more for the whole rate
the whole year cuz they pay the rent
they pay the car off and that's it they
just live in chill you know what I mean
so yeah man let me see what I was what I
was what else
Brandon came Brandon King I heard you
need to attend a math to do game
development you don't need a ton of math
you need just the basics I mean if you
went to high school
thank you good I mean if you didn't go
to high school then you know then that
could be a problem but I'm pretty sure
all of you guys were went to high school
working with Photoshop hell with this
kind of skill yeah it could definitely
help you know Photoshop is always gonna
be good because you know you have
Photoshop here right and at any moment
you could come and create something cool
I don't even know why this thing is all
the way at the top but yeah like any
moment you could come in and create
something you know uh I don't know maybe
after I do the the CSS and the G SAP
course that I'm planning on building
this week
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do like a
beginner game development course or
something just like a very basic and
maybe I probably just make a free so
just because it's gonna be very basic
but yeah let me see Andre says joking
okay I'm receiving my alerts that you
live late why is that YouTube man
YouTube man we are here we we to ratchet
for YouTube man they're like y'all we
can't be having ratchet developers in
here man it's ask Kat D I feel like you
got the skills job but you need to get
paid dude don't get paid let me see Joe
is the best
yes plead add please add an amazing
stories I'm guessing you you use
illustrator for the graphics yeah you
could use illustrator for graphics if
you're gonna do something like with
SVG's I don't think I'm gonna go that
deep you know to create stuff for f
SVG's maybe later on this is gonna be
more the technical things I don't want
to teach people to create their own
assets because they're for me you gotta
teach them you know color theory then
you gotta teach them how to use the
software like illustrator because you
can't just be like hey guys this is
SVG's and then you don't understand
anything about SVG so you don't
understand how to make a SVG it doesn't
make sense but I want to teach them the
technical size because if everybody here
who wants to become a developer and want
to get higher at some point they're
gonna have to do at least a Google
advertising so like let's say something
like this I say New York Times I'm gonna
see if they show some advertising
this guy he's interesting that guy's
interesting I I've seen him before
let me see Virge
maybe the verge has some some cool
advertising I mean advertising like this
I mean this is stuff I'm thankful but
this cool advertising that you see like
the animation like a full animation show
up sorry guys
got a coffee doubt trying to find like
something good like some good animations
that I could show you guys see html5 add
animation add batters
okay so this is like a tool to create
your okay let me see can I see this new
Apple watch right so you see this
animation it's pretty easy nothing crazy
but you could definitely get hired for
at least $30,000 to $40 an hour you know
to come in and create that little BS of
a freaking animation like you know how
easy that is like you could do that with
your eyes closed you see a man so those
are some of the things that that people
make with you know css3 eg SAP so let me
see who else is in the chatroom let's
see what up hey coda face will
appreciate appreciate you you tell us
how it is Matthew Smith Kevin Davis says
other than watching you too I pay for
the content goddamn it I pay for my
content I wanted it all at once word but
you know that's the thing - Kevin like I
told people that the freaking whole
video the whole course is free like you
literally go to to the website and you
come in let's open it up in incognito
I'm already logged into my website so
you come in and you say hey I'm here and
you click here as you can see it says
free people still don't understand that
it's free I think yeah because these on
my website I have a whole bunch of stuff
that's free like literally you could
come here go to categories click free
you start seeing all the free courses
you know and I'm still gonna add a whole
bunch of more free courses because this
are a whole bunch of stuff that I want
to show you guys that I think everybody
should know all right
the things that I have to go deeper and
takes me forever those are things that
have they have to be paid because
there's no way that I'm gonna come in
and spend freakin you know 30 hours to
create something and I'll be able to get
something back you know what I mean
unfortunately if I was like getting like
I don't know maybe 200,000 subscribers a
month or 300,000 subscribers a month or
something like that
naming a month but a year on YouTube
then I will be able to do it completely
for free which is why I want but it's
like come on man I got I got a family I
got a brand-new baby like I gotta feed
something this people you know what I
mean yeah exactly fire by says I watch
them on YouTube but you're but YouTube
is now for those who want to learn you
can learn on YouTube but most people
come here for entertainment 100% row
Satori's belong on the website talk
about overall stuff of topics and
YouTube YouTube is just a platform now
it's not based on content anymore yeah
man that sucks keywords and outwards
yeah a lot of sugars laws on the fly a
lot of gets lost in the flood of
stuff counting on YouTube the flood of
 how you Crystal Langley practice
going
crystal is amazing i still use pearl
crystal to automate a lot of stuff in my
computer that's nothing to I haven't
talked about like automating things on
your computer yeah I haven't really gone
that deep into like programming which
I'm dying to get into more advanced
stuff like you know I'm glad that I got
like at least 70% of all the beginner
courses and now we could finally start
jumping into more advanced stuff like
intermediate stuff like you know cuz if
you're beginning then you have all the
beginner courses already they're
creative for you but I know a lot of you
guys even like Philippe Philippe has
been waiting for almost a goddamn year
he's like where's the advanced stuff and
it's like bro I have to take care of the
begin
first is my studio already and no it's
not not yet
and to be honest with you guys I had the
spot and I had the spot let me put my my
screen share the screen with you guys
you know there's like conversation time
this is what we call conversation time
convo time
combo time all right
so pretty much yeah so I was about to
get the studio I was about to get some
nice spot and that's before I decided to
move out of New York remember what I
told you guys all the way in the
beginning I've been wanting to downsize
I mean downsize from living the big
house and doing all this other stuff
that I've been doing and downsized my
life so I could focus more on creating
content creating stuff for you guys
because it's like one of the main
reasons why I have to work so hard is to
maintain all of this stuff like all this
stuff it's like you know it's like
$8,000 a month
you know I mean like even though he got
the ghetto curtain we got to get her
curtain out here man we still at the end
of the month it's like $8,000 cash that
all of this between the cars tour you
know maintaining the house buying food
buying all this stuff so what I've been
doing I said you know what I'm not gonna
move back to the city because the city's
gonna put a bigger I don't know a bigger
weight on my shoulders of like hey
instead of the 8,000 I'm spending here I
was gonna have to spend like 10,000 over
there plus that's not even including the
rent for the studio which the studio was
gonna be $1,200 a month and then from
there we got a pre compete or utilities
so it's like you know it's like I'm
looking at like twelve thousand thirteen
thousand dollars a month I'm not trying
to work that hard in this world you got
what I'm saying you know cuz if it was
like hey that's it that would be twelve
thousand or ten thousand you know before
taxes or something like that like then
it would be nice you know what I mean
but after you freakin pay taxes like hey
now
gotta come up with like freakin $12,000
a month to do all of the stuff that you
want to do so what I decided to do was
we basically moving to Connecticut I got
this pretty nice house pretty big pretty
soft solid spot I have a high cold is
like a mother daughter's situation thing
where it's like you know you got the
house upstairs downstairs like a hole
it's like a whole apartment so what I'm
doing is I'm cutting out the hole first
the whole first floor and then I'm gonna
build my studio there I'm not gonna go
in and rent out another separate office
to do all all of the stuff so on
Saturday that's why I'm recording a lot
of videos today and and tomorrow so you
guys have content for the next week two
weeks I'm still gonna do my live videos
but for the next week two weeks I'm
gonna be setting my whole set up you
know what I mean I gotta get the right
lighting I'm getting you know a nice
background for us painting the walls do
everything something legit something
that you'll be like okay I see your boy
Joe you know I mean like we got the
cameras we got the mics we got
everything now it's just about setting
up the spot okay so that's where we're
at right now you know so you know once I
i'm already moved in and a half
everything set up and that's another
thing in the next but i don't even have
no no incident okay well yes set up so
till the cable comes in i'm have no
internet i have nothing
so I'm disconnected okay most likely
what I'm gonna be doing is I'm a record
all my videos in the house once I set up
everything and until like Verizon or
optimum I don't even know what they use
over there in Connecticut comes in and
stole all the services and whatever I'm
gonna record all my videos in there from
there I'm gonna go to like Starbucks or
I don't know Dunkin Donuts and saying
like steal off the freakin Wi-Fi to
upload videos for you guys yeah so the
next week two weeks is gonna be like
kind of kind of hectic just because
gonna be me recording stuff fixing
everything building everything
downstairs before I could look like J
look nice a nice little setup the way
how I wanna do things is I want to be
able to to record like me having a desk
in front of me and then having yeah me
having a desk in front of me and and
basically having the camera in front of
me so now we'll be like I'll be sitting
in front of my desk with my laptop in in
my my desktop and just having like
something legit I still don't know
exactly how I'm gonna set it up but you
know I'm gonna keep you guys updated on
how everything goes you know but yeah
man like I was like I'm not gonna
freakin do this thing to myself because
right now I'm still not big you know
what I mean like we we doing big things
but I'm still not big you got what I'm
saying like I'm not I'm not freakin a
freakin how you called a simple
programmer I'm not traversing media I'm
not all these guys that they make you
know they make their money from YouTube
you get what I'm saying like they make
the money from YouTube if the money that
I make on the side plus if I was making
that type of money like you know hey we
had a hundred thousand subscribers then
it'll be totally different you know what
I mean like right now I'll be like you
know I'll get a crazy spot but then at
the same time I'm like you know I don't
want to be having to work so hard you
get what I'm saying like I wanna if I
left my job which I was getting good
money to have for easier life and be
able to create my content better I'm not
gonna put myself in like in a situation
where every month I gotta be like oh man
you know if like you know freaking 300
people unsubscribe from my website how
am I gonna pay for all of this you know
plus the office and plus all of this
like I don't want to deal with that you
know what I mean so I'm downsizing it
I'm making a simple I'm making it easy
until we get probably by the end of the
year or maybe like on a summer 20
19 a sign like that someone 2019 we
could come in and get like a crazy spot
cuz I was gonna do it I was gonna go all
out but then I was like man sometimes
you gotta just be realistic in a sense I
was like you never should try to put
yourself in a situation where you gonna
you know like right now I'm comfortable
like everything that I pay for whatever
and like my my life I'm comfortable like
I'm not worried I'm not stressed about
money I'm not stressed about right I'm
not stressed about paying anything my
stress about you know paying on my bills
I'm comfortable like oh they're like I
make way more than what all of those
things cost but if I go in and I start
getting a whole bunch of equipment like
I was gonna go super hard I was like
okay cool you know they sent me they
send me a message another message on a
mail from I think it's like sweet water
sweet water is again man we got 36
months of you know finance whatever you
want you got 27 thousand dollars of
credit you could buy whatever you want I
was about to just go all out I was about
to get a recording studio get a freaking
filming studio and get it all fits do a
whole bunch of stuff and then I'm like
wait like I gotta slow down I gotta
start thinking about things and now you
know what I mean because if I go all out
and I get myself in debt or go all out
and just like spend more money than when
I'm making then that means I in like six
seven months from now I'm gonna be like
oh man I'm gonna have to freakin work
harder now and this isn't that like I
really just have my life chill you know
what I mean so like I said I got the
whole freakin first floor I'm gutting
that whole out I'm basically
building everything there and it's cool
cuz it's like now I got a new crib for
the baby new crib for the wifey in it's
just gonna be comfortable you know what
I mean without killing myself in and and
moving back to to New York City I'm
doing you guys know me I did not want to
move back to New York City that was like
a last resort and what's cool about New
York City's like this always something
popping you know and you
make more money in New York City than
living anywhere else because you have so
much opportunities and some where so
many people that you know the him you
know there's a made up here he there's
this and that I got a client for you for
this but at the same time it's like man
if I could downsize everything I could
pretty much tell like like literally I
was like telling white girls like yo
like freaking January I may be in enough
between my other website that I have and
this music website that I have I made
enough to for the whole year like to pay
my rent for a whole year
in one month like I'm chilling I was
like you know what I'm not gonna I'm not
gonna mess that up and and you know just
because you making some money doesn't
mean that you have to start taking so
much you know get yourself in debt or
get yourself in a position where you're
like you're spending more than what you
need so that's what happened with the
whole thing so the studio is still
poppin off right now currently
everything is getting you know rebuilt
like I said I'm getting out the whole
first floor of the new house and I'm
doing a whole bunch of stuff so it's
just gonna be there the only difference
is I'm not gonna be able to have it hot
you know I really wanted it which it was
like I was gonna have people come over
like you know I wanna you guys to be
able to come over to the office and
income chill but all those things is
gonna come with time man I don't need to
rush every day man you know what I mean
I was a little bit upset about that
because that's why I really wanted to do
but starting you know 2018 I was like
man like I'm chilling right now like why
am I gonna put myself in a situation
like I should let myself grow first I
should start you know before I wouldn't
jump so hard to you know have like such
a big venture because it's not only once
you rental office doesn't mean that
that's it like you got your office now
now you got a built or all the freaking
rooms you gotta build the studio you
gotta build a whole bunch of stuff so
that's like a good twenty to thirty
thousand dollars that you got to spend
so I was like you know why man let me
use that money to get a house for
and then we just you know we branch out
later when the channels even bigger than
what it is right now like right now we
just got past 10,000 subscribers you
know what I mean like we're doing better
than a lot of people but at the same
time there's like yo they give yourself
some time to grow Joe like calm down I
know you want to do all this stuff but
calm down sign so I had to sit down with
myself you know what I mean oh yeah man
let me see who else is in here man
we got Marko coke Cola Shevek
interesting answer what you don't know
ask what the universe Joe please talk
about web scraping from other websites
yes we could talk about that I mean even
do that with a ruby you do that with
freaking JavaScript you can do that with
Python there's like a million people
doing that reason why I haven't thought
about scraping websites and all of that
stuff is because everybody talks about
that you know what I mean I want to come
in and talk to you guys about other
stuff it smells like something's burning
sorry guys something smell like it was
burning I don't know I had to make sure
you know I ain't trying to burn up in
this bitch hey let me see so yeah man
there's certain topics that I don't talk
about because even though they are
interesting I don't talk about it
because everybody talks about it let me
see
Hey Joe we do more tutorials project to
do for subscribers which I can put in my
future portfolio yes listen
go take the ruby course right go take
the ruby course on the website and then
from there I'm gonna start doing the
Ruby on Rails course which it's gonna
have like three projects that you can
put on your portfolio or even the PHP
course has a project at the end that you
can put at your at your portfolio
there's a whole bunch of stuff man I'm
saying making tutorial for animation
website yes sir how long did it take me
to find a job my first job was like an
ecommerce company they were like a whole
sellers on eBay so technically that's my
first job which opened the doors for me
because that's the damn look there was a
subscriber who sent me an email and told
me oh I have this ecommerce website that
they want to hire me but you know I'm
not gonna be doing a lot of development
and I told him man take the freaking job
look so he was selling he makes $13 an
hour right this new company that's gonna
give him a chance to hire him it's gonna
pay him I think up to $19 an hour so
it's like if they're gonna pay you $19
that's four hours more than what you
in your job right no other company is
hiring you and the reason why they're
not hiring you is because number one you
might not have all the skills that you
that you need right
you don't know all your JavaScript you
don't know all those things so if this
company is hiring you to help them out
edit products attic CSS and a couple of
HTML files go to that company go to that
company and just go and work there you
get what I'm saying
so go to that company go work there and
every game you know just just go hard
you know what I mean like get higher it
might seem you know for a lot of people
who are not realistic this is the
problem with with people who are not
realistic in this world you know when
they come in they look at things and be
like oh there's jobs out there for
$100,000 freaking developers and it's
like yes but those developers have been
in in the industry for Wow and they had
they know a lot of skills that you don't
have you know what I'm saying so if you
can't find a job that's paying you 70 80
thousand a year it's time to start
looking at lower number jobs like you
know a 40 $50,000 a year or even lower
30 you know 30 to $40,000 a year you go
to that job you get hired you work there
for three to six months and you leave
the problem is that people want to get
the big bucks and don't want to put in
the work when I first came in and I
first got my first job I was making $13
an hour just posting our products on
ebay posting products on their website
editing little little things here and
there
now people did not want to freaking you
know a lot of you guys will be like oh
I'm not gonna work for $13 an hour then
that means you do not want it that bad
because the problem is most companies
don't want to be the
first person to hire you that's the
truth they need developers you might
have the skills but they don't want to
take the risk of being the first person
to hire you because what that means is
they're gonna have to train you they're
gonna have to give you you know show you
the ropes show you a whole bunch of
stuff companies don't want to deal with
that when they post something online is
because they need help it's not that
they need somebody to come in in six
months from now they're gonna be ready
to start work you know they need help
for now you get what I'm saying
sometimes if you in your area you know
you live in an area with this not that
many jobs there's jobs but not that many
jobs and then you come in and you get
the opportunity to work in an e-commerce
store or e-commerce website or web
content creating a web content editor or
whatever one of those titles right and
they giving you the opportunity take it
because what they're doing is they're
giving you that the opportunity to work
there and then your next job you'll be
like oh I worked at this company you
know
editing their pages doing this and that
and it's a real company all right so the
next company that is gonna look at you
okay he already worked so we'll take the
gamble you know to hire him now well
he's a brand-new developer he has no
experience no work no clients no nothing
to show for just a bunch of algorithms
from freako camp you're not getting
hired it's that simple like somewhere
like San Francisco New York there's so
many jobs that they're you know they'll
take the chance to hire you quick right
there's more opportunities for a junior
developer with with no experience at all
to get hired in a bigger city if you
don't live in a big city you have to
understand you have to work yourself
into the industry this is not something
that you're gonna come in and be like
hey I work in in freakin FedEx and from
FedEx you're gonna go work at ebates.com
or you gotta go work at Amazon or you're
gonna go work at every King nike.com
it's not gonna happen
it's very rare that's like you
one of those situations where people be
like oh yeah he's lucky yes he's lucky
you get what I'm saying like those are
situations like that so it's like if you
get hired at a company where you're
doing some type of web development
doesn't matter if you're the front-end
developer back-end developer or you just
the guy setting up databases if you're
just a guy
changing the products once you get that
and that title they are hired okay
definitely you take that time while you
work in there to improve your skills
improve your portfolio and you'll start
applying after three months being there
start applying for bigger companies and
then you will be hired to those bigger
companies you gotta play the game you're
self-taught developer yourself to a
developer you are somebody who's out
here grinding you can't come in and be
like oh man if it's less than 80,000 I'm
not working they're like bro you got it
twist it like this is not the place for
it you know what I mean but yeah man you
know something like we started from the
bottom now we're here man let me see let
me see what else Matthew Smith says the
Ruby course is great yeah man movies is
legit man it's pretty easy is freakin
damn easy man
i'ma say I'm reading everybody's
messages let me share the screen let me
share the screen for you guys so yeah I
know I'm reading let me see it was in
here Alejandro Roman is like Joe damn
you on this tube site every day sound do
you even work this is my job okay this
is my work man I have this site I have
my website coding face calm I have other
websites which I'm not gonna name in
here yeah it's like that's how I make my
money man everything that I do is for a
reason also tools like I get clients
this time start out going here I
remember like the other day when I told
you guys I made like 3000 from a client
let me see about sites let's say let's
say for California right come to
California check over here see what they
got los angeles sometimes I come in here
and search for let's say gigs say gigs
coming here search HTML and as you can
see say ongoing seeking experience HTML
developer ongoing projects
what developer I want a jQuery UI html5
you know get a whole bunch of different
small jobs like that like if I want to
like if I feel like okay I'm bored this
week you know come in make a quick
several hundred dollars a hundred
dollars he in there like and then that's
it you know looking for develop or to
convert html5 game to app there's a
whole bunch of stuff that you could do
man like you know email account manager
let's see what else
WordPress web design converter - PST
file 350 like there's a whole bunch of
stuff like I can come in and do a whole
bunch of things like if I want to but
like I said man this is my full-time and
full time job right now you know I work
from home everything that I do is about
20% is YouTube 30% is coding phase calm
and then the other 50% is everything
else that I do on the side I'm also
thinking about starting a brand new how
you call this a brand new dropshipping
store which I've been getting into I
used to do this a long time ago I used
to do it for eBay and Amazon but now I'm
gonna do it with Shopify and it seems
pretty easy
like literally pretty easy which stack
of bringing about another 10,000 to my
income per month so it's like I don't
know guys I don't know how explain to
you guys but like how do I make my money
like my money is on the web man
everything that I do is on the web you
know and then the day that I decided to
be like oh I want to work for myself
then yeah I could just go in and you
know create my own design firm or my own
digital agency I got a whole bunch of
designers who all dying to work with me
I could just come in and do that like I
don't know it's like I told you guys
every five years I changed my direction
in my life of things that I'm doing you
know I think for the next five years
what I want to focus on is all the
things that I'm doing here with you guys
in coding face and then from there I
wanna I probably want to do something
else you know what I mean like I'm still
gonna focus on coding phase comm like
but in five years from now I probably
add other things to coding phase comm
not just the web
so let's see how it goes you never know
man but I'll definitely always create
courses here so yeah man so there's like
thousands of questions like man Joe's
always here what the hell
how does he survive how does he eat
listen man a whole bunch of different
ways man shout out to the girder shout
out to the ghetto curtain yeah man
I am just reading reading reading
reading reading reading says born to
gamble 1 2 3 Joe your job ready when you
can copy any site from PSD to HTML but
how about how many hours so you'll be
able to complete it can you give a
general idea I mean it depends this
websites that might take you four hours
and then there's websites that might
take you longer cuz the things star in
the UI is you know you got animations
you got a whole bunch of stuff then yeah
it will take you a longer you know what
I mean like even this website this
portfolio website that that we did on my
on my site and I was putting here in
YouTube for free like I don't even know
was gonna take that long to be honest
with you guys and it took forever at the
end because making it responsive
especially with that type of layout was
really annoying you know so it took a
while it took like I don't know it took
like two days when you think about it if
it was like a if I was in a job right if
I worked at a digital agency and for the
amount of hours that it took it would
have been like two days of work two to
three days of work so yeah
let me see let me see who's in here
Matthew Smith like damn pixels oh god
Joe what do you think affiliate
marketing
I think affiliate marketing is great if
you could really use affiliate marketing
if it brings value to the person that
you're trying to show them a fit or like
links or affiliate marketing links
whatever right it has to give them value
you can't come in and add something but
I hey man here's a freaking here's a
store to buy sneakers and like the
audience or the people that follow you
or your channel or your website don't
even care about sneakers you got what
I'm saying like you can't just come in
you know it's like sometimes like
there's been companies that hit me up
sponsorships you know you know I've had
a freaking sponsors to hit me up like
hey man we're distance in there with
this bootcamp and I'm like bro have you
ever seen my my bootcamp video like I do
not want to tell people to go to a boot
camp when they can learn this on their
own and they're like oh okay thank you
later look like I don't care how much
you pay me I'm not gonna be telling
people about a boot camp if I I don't
believe in it especially if I've never
been to it you know what I say like why
would I I don't know it's just retarded
so it's like you gotta be careful with
that
you know affiliate marketing and all
that stuff let me say so the John says
so I made a restaurant for restaurant
website for a local company I sent over
the PNG up and now in the owners is
saying he needs to refurbish before I
can put the site up what does that mean
refurbish
I'm lost like what what does he mean by
that
let me see what else
let me see let me see let me see
Kiko loco Kel okay yep exactly Kiko
local says the value of getting your
foot in the door in the industry is more
valuable than hourly rate you'll also
increase your coding skills by at least
two times you know agree 100%
it will be good for juniors hell yeah
it's super good for junior developers I
think Ruby if I want what I have gone
through Ruby I would have probably
thought that JavaScript and PHP was
harder than what it is it just will be
so easy it's like English so it's like
you understand the concepts there's
people that don't understand how for
loops work they don't understand those
things and that's because it could be
hard if you don't know you have no
background into this and you're trying
to get into the stuff and understand how
to logically write code it can get hard
you know especially with the syntax but
when you have something like Ruby where
the syntax is like writing in English
you know you say ten dot times and then
for each number print my name and then
right there automatically that prints
your name ten times somebody who's never
done coding can understand that
perfectly you going on saying so Ruby's
great man your videos is my daily
inspiration bless up word man
you know dropshipping could definitely
make you a lot of money it depends on
the high college i'll finding the niche
and finding the the right audience for
the type of website that you're building
and the type of websites that you're
gonna sell so I mean those are one of
those things that I want to get into
because I always liked ecommerce when I
was doing it like I used to be selling
stuff on eBay like sneakers or I still
go to like trip stores and and buy like
all Super Nintendo games and then sell
it online for like $45 each so doing it
online and from everything that I know
plus the fact that I'm a developer and I
could build like a legit website and
give people like good features and I've
worked in e-commerce sites since I don't
know when since like since I started my
career so it's like it only makes sense
that I will also try to build my own
business like that so plus I told you
guys I follow the people that I follow
that I really look up to you got si
Johnny
FD like one of the people that I follow
is this guy Johnny FT if you guys don't
know about him he's like he's a dude
that had nothing like he he came from
you know from like selling all his stuff
and just moving to Thailand and
basically like that was a point he had
no money and he was like fighting over
there and freaking Thailand like on some
USC type like cuz he had no more
money he was doing free game doing tour
guides and stuff like that but what he
did was like as you can see he's like my
new $200 a month apartment like he
downsized like that's exactly what I'm
trying to do I'm trying to downsize like
completely so everything that I make is
profit because the problem is that when
you live in a bed
city like New York City even though you
make like $100,000 plus you how much you
really spending in rent how much you
spending on tickets how many you know
every time we cross a bridge you gotta
spend my money you know what I mean like
this guy he lived here for - for like
six months for $200 a month like you
know how much is that man like literally
you could wear a thousand to two hundred
you freakin live entirely for you know
half a year so that half of you you
could just focus on your products and
you know everything that you want to do
it's the same thing as levels that I oh
I always bring him up
he's another guy that I look up to you
know like this guy's they made it happen
you know what I mean they create a
couple of applications that that are
successful you know like I consider all
the websites that I've built have been
very successful because they make
between you know a thousand to three
thousand dollars a month you know it's
the same thing as coding phase comm
coding phase comm generates its own
amount of money that also I could
consider it it's a success right so I
want to have at least from five to ten
different websites that are generating
like seven to ten thousand dollars a
month you know what I mean like once we
get to that point then we're good
you know this guys are good they they
come in they create a whole bunch of
content they create a whole bunch of
stuff that you know it's like is it
legit you know what I'm saying so those
are the people that I look up to you
know I was like you know when a few
months ago people were like oh man Joe
is like thinking about other people
other youtubers like other web developer
youtubers I'm like bro I don't even
think about this people like these
people in our competition these people
do not do what I do you know the people
that I look up to the people that I'm
focus on are like Johnny and
the levels that I oh those are my
competition those are the guys that I
want to get to you know what I mean so
yeah yeah Jones you could put that
website online like stop worrying just
rename it to something else you don't
have to put it for that that prick your
restaurant if the guy don't want to put
the images use other people's images
another websites images like that's it
well you move abroad yes I mean I'm
planning somewhere next year I want to
buy a apartment in Dominican Republic
which is like my my home country so I
was like I'm going to show you guys and
those particle mangos let me see if I
show you guys a couple of stuff so
there's like apartments that they have
in the medical republic you know and
they cheap I was like seventy thousand
dollars for an apartment like legit
apartment see like this was 95 thousand
like it's not that bad I mean compared
to here in New York or compared to
anywhere
the United States like you try to buy
anything here present nothing that
people don't know when you buy something
in Dominican Republic like you bought it
like here in the United States you buy
something and for the rest of your life
you still got to pay property tax like I
could come in and buy a house I could
come in and say oh man I worked so hard
my whole life and I'm gonna buy myself a
half a million dollar house you know and
then you gotta pay eight percent every
freaking month of taxes so
five hundred thousand let's do the math
because I love doing the math times
point zero eight you know every year you
gotta pay forty thousand dollars if you
have a five hundred thousand dollar
house like that's ridiculous that means
that for the rest of your life you
always gonna have to work to maintain
that house right in the minikin republic
that doesn't exist like in the american
republic you bought a house that's it
you bought it you bought an apartment
that's it you bought it you're not
paying property tax that's yours
so that's the difference between
dominican republic and here in the US so
yeah man so there's a whole bunch of
stuff man like you know that i want to
do so those are the goals the things
that I want to do in the next you know
the next year give me like a little
something like that little something
comfortable you know plus it's cheap in
the arm man and they give you like you
could go over there every can buy by
yourself like a nice spot
like a block away from the beach dirt
cheap man so that's what I'm up to and
that's what that's what are your boys
goals is that you know it's so Sula it's
not bad there's like a little bit
ratchet though like I want to move to
where the the Taurus is that you know
like I loved ER but I'm not moving to
like the hood I home into like where's
the Taurus at you know what I mean see
this is kind of ridiculous half a
million dollars for this apartment
sometimes the real Dean they'll be like
charging for crazy amount of numbers I
mean probably the thing is that yeah
that's why you right in front of the
beach and they probably they have it's
like you have your hotel you all part of
the hotel so that's different
what yeah man
that's what you boys up to right now
main.c you can sell create a website I
know about these nomads great people
thanks for sharing Joe you're always
inspired me to become a decent developer
yeah man property tax is 8.8 thousand
dollars on a seven hundred thousand
dollar house yo so your property taxes
it's dirt cheap because if you go into
like Zillow let's say by let's say here
let's say big sales New York like this
whole area the property tax is from
eight eight percent to 12 percent the
property tax like that's a little bit
high you know what I'm saying and it's
like and this house is not even like
millionaire houses or anything that's
like they're decent houses but they're
not that crazy and you know what I mean
like property tax history is up so it's
up 100 they sold it for four hundred
seventy thousand dollars now they now
they're selling it for nine hundred
ninety five thousand dollars okay so
this tax assessment so it's like
actually went down but this this things
don't even calculate the real numbers of
the freakin taxes they give you like a
estimate you see like
back in 2007 when it was probably like
half let's say probably like half a
million or like 600,000 it was like
$16,000 like you okay my math was a
little bit off but that's still a lot
$17,000 or $18,000 that's kind of
ridiculous a year you go on saying so
see that the taxes is not that bad over
there they're over here it's kind of
crazy bro like this New York okay
taxes is crazy but yeah guys I actually
got a gold man i'ma share my my camera
