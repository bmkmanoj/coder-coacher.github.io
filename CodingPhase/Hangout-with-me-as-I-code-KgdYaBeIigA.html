I was like he's gonna go down a little
bit more I'm waiting for that 4,000 and
then go all out
I hope Bitcoin right it never went to

Google Chrome this one either
all right cool man things is crazy right
now
matter of fact but should I do a window
capture or the hall yeah maybe I just do
it like this I think let me try to open
up the chat cuz I wanna see what people
aren't are talking about while I chat I
mean say how can I get this happening
here
so wait to get a pop-up there you go
pop-up chat there you go
close this okay I just finished adding
this tool to you to me guys those of you
guys that want to learn PHP wanna learn
mom freaking laravel go ahead go check
it out you know probably by tomorrow the
day after search on udemy
or you could just buy it from my website
it's actually cheaper or sign up for the
subscription it's actually even weight
cheaper because you get all of my
courses for 10 bucks 20 bucks a month
right depending if you click on the the
links below you pretty much get all of
my courses alright so basically imma do
what I was doing last night for those
those of you guys that was here with me
so I'm basically coding right now the
design for the project that we're going
to build with laravel because I actually
don't want to have people coding this I
don't wanna have people calling this an
HTML and CSS
I guess I'm knowing so I was like if you
dare to learn laravel then learn Larry
you know what I mean like you don't have
to go in there and have to code this
from scratch
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna give
people these files this whole design
that I'm building for the course and
they don't have to actually do it
themselves and they could just focus on
larva instead of focusing on the HTML
side all right sounds good kids all
right now let me close this here all
right now let me see
okay placeholder okay this is which one
is the input all right there's the box
now inside of the box we want to have a
div a sake should I put a clasp I don't
know I don't know
no clasp but I still need to put in the
style okay so for this is let me see let
me see if everything works
all right cool
okay something like that seems good
okay obviously I really do not feel like
calling this thing right now all right
so let's see background I already did
this before so I don't want to do it
again see this up this high speed up my
workflow guys you guys gotta see we do
this a million times
like there's certain things that I just
don't like to freakin code because
there's a lot of stuff that you have to
code into it so what I do is I just copy
and paste the other front another thing
that I did before or I just google it
I'm not in the mood to copy it to
actually write it down all right so let
me see find the image web design
why is the antenna so slow my god I hate
that I mean I know I'm streaming in
it's like downloading uploading at the
same time but oh my god I saw annoying
okay let me see now the background
shouldn't be for this okay let's go sit
close this cause this should be on this
one
errors good ole errors and that's
because of the frequent collation okay
and p.m. run watch okay let's see errors
again yay yay more errors okay yeah I
because in pug you can't have spaces you
can't have like God not spaces spaces
you could have but you can't have like
the breakpoints you can't have like a
freaking can't press enter on things you
gotta be like a long string all right
cool refresh this all right there you go
okay now this design is dumb so
Missy
all right take this image see that looks
a little bit better now let me see
no-repeat Center remove the fixed okay
there you go all right now let's go to
the main on the boxes and remove the
height okay there you go so that should
be good
okay so this the results page and now
what I want to do is like have a button
here to select it so
how can we do it all right let me see
results okay we got this inside of this
we're actually gonna make this
position:relative okay now inside of
this we're gonna create a diff but now
this diff we're gonna say div class add
a PT in okay so close the grid now here
we're gonna say I had a BTN damn okay I
- BTN what else we want to do to this
okay so let's say with 50 pixels height
50 pixels possession absolute all right
let's say 20 pixels top 20 pixels okay
let's see background
white okay cool
that's exactly what we want it now
I actually want this to be opacity zero
and then I put this here so I want this
to be opacity zero and then when I hover
on top of it
then I want it to show up so this I'm
gonna say opacity one
okay here we're gonna say transition all
let's say for five seconds
ease in and out all right and that
didn't work okay
that's why because it's not supposed to
be on down were supposed to be on this
on the parent on the box so when we
hover on box add button should become
opacity one okay now it should work
there you go okay now we also want this
to be top twenty pixels let's say top
twenty pixels but this we want it to be
let's say 80 pixels so could basically
as a comes in goes up all right cool
and then if I click on it I want to see
there's gonna be like a check all right
cool
all right now also too we want this to
be lets say cursor oops
pointer
it's cursor i got a backwards
cursor:pointer okay so now when we hover
on top of it
got the little hand good old hand yay
all right now technically this is not
smooth like 60 frames per second but
that's fine
this thing doesn't need to be perfect
yeah man so let's go with you guys
what's going on with child how you guys
doing
oh sure what do we get
Obi yes what was it somebody Millie ROC
real quick hey who was that was a new
subscriber or somebody donated what was
it I don't even know
according while you're coding for him
listening I'm over here with my English
accent I'm out here fum I'm out here
from getting my gamma family thumbs
alright so so this how the things
supposed to be basically click here
click there how should I do this because
the whole idea is see maybe you guys
give me ideas on how I should make the
design for this so technically the
person comes in they do a search and say
hey ecommerce or let's say you want to
build a restaurant restaurant app right
after this click there the search
results come to here and basically the
developer get to choose which design he
wants to use for how you call this for
his inspiration like you know pick is
like basically picking five projects to
get inspired to build a a window hello
to build I'm reading the stupid thing to
build a window now to build their
website which I start with automate
random stuff on other people's work I
don't know
yeah we're out here we out here man let
me see who's in here we got Julius we
got Phillipe we got coding commanders we
got Dini red we got Julian
we got cam we got Francisco Julius Camp
Perry Dini red Julian Johnson Julian
Johnson Jillian Johnson same people's
Handy's Peter Navarro Tyler Kelvin Davis
Dean Karsten got the kid oh sure I don't
even notice this one create a nuisance
I want you here with a tag this how you
know like your boy don't even know I
just buying clothes that we forgetting I
still have the tag on him okay so let me
see kid the cake it let me see Barbara's
in here it's 3:45 a.m. fun I guess
that's how it is man
Tom Tran what up man
you know without without without what
Jim what up what are we working on today
well today I'm just building this this
design for one of my projects for
laravel basically I'm building the back
end for this so you know how I always
tell you guys hey guys fine fine
inspiration on on dribble find
inspiration on on be hands on any
website right from really good designers
so what I'm building is a project that
you're gonna be able to search through
here you're gonna say okay it's like
brainstorming that's why I call it
design storm you're gonna be able to
choose a couple of projects right you're
gonna start naming a couple of projects
you're gonna be able to search and say
okay I wanna get let's say restaurant
right you search that and then all the
results is gonna show up right here and
then from there you're gonna choose
which ones you like you know and say you
want to add at like five different
designs that you say okay I want to get
inspired by this five projects so then
from there you have it in a section on
you on this web application where it
says okay this is my project for
e-commerce site and then you have all
five different designs that you get
inspiration from in the same place I
mean there's something simple
I don't know how applicable it could be
you know how many people use it but at
the same time there's a good way to
teach you guys how to use api's with PHP
how to deal with database and user
authentication that's it that's what I'm
building today kids let me see what else
so this thing supposed to have a little
a little thing there so I missing Google
now Google Fonts
font awesome sometimes it's hard to talk
and code at the same time cuz it's like
I gotta think about stuff of how to
build this okay check okay so it is I
okay save that let me go to my main see
you font awesome CDN
okay
get it from here all right let's go to
our main layout let me see
wanna make sure I do this right with
style sheet H ref okay okay there you go
this too little
hello check now the check is only
supposed to show up if yeah the check is
supposed to show off
only if it's active so
all right let me see where is it okay so
if this is active this check is supposed
to show off
okay so close this ok cursor:pointer box
okay
let me see so if it's active splay block
okay so I'll let me see FA check
how long supposed to be showing it
okay
some see ID BTN okay so on this one
there you go alright now let's say
text-align:center
or we could use the same thing that we
use before flexbox
okay if I check I see this works yeah
exactly what we want do we want it here
let me see yeah there you go
now let me see hold on
it's not complicated it's just annoying
okay add VTN I read the end
yeah this is fine box-shadow
okay
okay so if it's active if it has to
class active I see what your opt-in if
it has the class active wait but it
shouldn't have this that class active
should it be on this one
oh yeah no matter of fact it should have
it so if it has the background it has
active it should be that background okay
now if it doesn't have that background
it should be let me see
she'd definitely be white okay okay so
now let me remove the active to see how
it looks okay now
all right so should be an active and
hover so shut up like to both of them
okay so somebody wants to click on that
alright so if it's not active is just
gonna see a white but if it's active no
if you hover on top of it is going to be
like that and then when you click on it
it's going to leave it there alright now
if it's active if it's active right we
also want it to be missy opacity:1 so at
all times
so we'll see top 20 pixels no matter
what now let me add active to see how it
looks okay there you go
so if it's active is gonna have that
little checkbox but normally it'll be
like this and then when people come
hover on top of it if they'd like to
design they'll click on it and then
they'll click on that and become active
alright my freaking back hurts
alright let me see the whole thing here
alright now let me keep one check for
what you guys
have I learned Ruby of course I that's
one of our first languages come on guys
you guys should know that
KMT and my boy
is getting some cam had to squeeze one
up oh god alright so that is page is
done cuz this page is gonna be super
simple super easy alright alright so
what's next
um I believe sure half like a a login
page I definitely need a header I don't
even have a hi there so let's do the
header right now okay so layouts
includes header let me put a header
change this to header dot pug okay let
me go to the main here we're gonna add
this is going to be include I don't know
if it was like this include header
includes all I gotta look at the pages
what we got well we got a a a word man
yeah we we gained a lot of subscribers
guys man like we going up every single
day man like now we we're really poppin
now you know for those of those people
that you know they doubted us like we
here kids you know what I mean like
we're doing good life is good okay I got
an error this is why you
gotta have the documentation kids come
to the ankles how's the way to do the
proper include okay include and then the
file okay so let's see
still error word another error
let me see what the hell's the error
includes oh that's why duh duh duh duh I
should notice yeah cuz it's the location
it's like I'm trying to say includes
header right I want to see what we got
in here another subscriber are we hot
tonight we hot right now kids we hot
right now man but yeah so we got
includes header that pug
well it's inside of the layout so I have
to go outside and then inside of the
includes folder so that that like that
rookie mistake
rookie Oh or not it doesn't want to work
no it works there you go
okay so we here now let me come here
where's a header so here I'm gonna put
what a header tag and Dan inside of this
header tag we're going to put in let's
say a div class logo design storm okay
inside of this we're gonna say class
container because we want to have a
container okay and now what else you
know I'm gonna take this off too
I don't know what you guys think this is
annoying me this is annoying me okay
from my starter cam I'll take this off
you see how I do it change okay it says
connected to browser sync
that's annoying me because every time I
do a change I don't want this to show up
like what happens I'm working on this
top menu here so let's take that off
right now let's look at the browser sync
notify
okay so notify is false okay let's go to
gulp let's come down here where is it
browsersync now let's put in these
options don't freakin notify me you're
annoying me
I'm about to stop what do you guys think
should I stop this opening a new browser
like another window like that's getting
me annoyed too like every time that I
run npm run watch it opens up a new
window like I wish it would just stay in
the same window instead of opening up
you know a different window what do you
guys think should I take that off
what's going on Chicago what's going on
out there nothing's happening over there
all right huh let's see let me see stop
reload each browser you starts that's
fine
so I'm trying to figure out how to stop
opening on your window
instead of just open just one
reading through documentation is and
github issues okay let's see okay I
guess I'm gonna use this
so I'm gonna add this to my starter kit
Kota face.com cuz I don't know that's
that's annoying okay
okay so new changes to the starter kit
kids you got to change this to true if
you want the browser to open
automatically okay there you go so let's
start this up let's see if everything
goes good okay there you go
now it's not gonna open up a new browser
every single freaking time like that's
annoying especially when you're coding I
don't know maybe you guys like it but I
mean I like the one I first got it but
then now it's like annoying me
so what happened in Chicago my god why
people keep saying - Congo - Congo
Chicago Chicago anything happened
there's nothing important happening in
Chicago no Serena
I can't concentrate so only vehicle hits
car after fleeing stop Douglas man
charged with killing message with
WikiLeaks during after campaign okay
there's nothing stop talking about
Chicago yeah knowing me there's nothing
happening over there all right I got
things to do guys okay
they have class design storm all right
now for this we're gonna sing nav and
then here we're going to put in each RAF
so this we're gonna say register ok
register what else
login what else
all right log in register login I don't
know what else should we add to this me
for now let's just leave that cuz I
don't know what other pages I'm gonna
put okay now and the SAS we're gonna
come here come to the top go like this
header and this header we're going to do
what
when I say logo color white then nav
we're going to say laughs is going to be
put this here
what should wait to set a nav
display:inline-block okay
this color white texture creation none
let's say text pants for upper case
let's say padding 10 pixels left or
right all right
and let's see hover for now cuz I don't
even know what color I'm gonna put it
we're gonna see hover color red it
alright that's fine
matter of fact we could change the
header what I was the logo instead of
that what you see is a link okay H ref
all right keep it simple keep it easy
nothing so crazy I probably go to sleep
early today all right so we got this
okay cool now let's create like a
register page ok header this is fine
leave this for now okay pages results
let me duplicate this say register that
pug
okay this whole
okay I'm gonna call it off for
authentication
dev class each vowel dev if all right
okay some start this over
NPM run watch
ok let's say you register HTML
okay deaf glass boxes study all of the
stuff so here we got deaf off and then
we're gonna say login container go all
the way to the bottom I mean actually
separate this and put into multiple
pages but for now let's keep it simple
we could just do it in one page so this
is off okay login container
or just even we could just call this box
say box and then copy what we already
have here from this
see for now swag now
see login container wasn't that enough I
just put in box okay
now let's put in some classes we're
gonna say div class call em d8
let me see grid okay so I do have two
offsets for this one
all right Wow freaking shoulder hurts my
back hurts I don't know why it's
annoying me okay so this is where we're
gonna come in and put in the
registration so let's say input might
affect label started with a label and
then inside of this lis what we're gonna
put in the input so and then here let me
see okay yes that's what I want
okay should I do like that I don't know
should I do it like that sorry
it's hard choosing these things man
especially when you don't have a design
you're just coming up with it icy cold
it's
it could get annoying okay so okay where
is that so we got main box and then we
say label text transform uppercase that
looks horrible okay
display block okay
now input
I say wave on do beset Oh what's going
on here is because of this thing okay
input I say with 100%
huh let's see what should be like a good
performs
get my inspiration on
all right that's the input select
obviously ample select that's fine
oh yeah text area say border one pixel
solid let's get some colors
okay that can get annoying cuz we I
guess we popular now kids yeah now we
good
is he using c9 nope I'm using gÃ¶del
Adam that's sexy
all right there let me take this
placeholder okay I'm not placeholder
where is it focus yeah focus
outline:none let me copy this all right
now go to the bottom we're gonna make
this like a global global styles okay
take this from inside here so this could
actually go for every single one we got
to put it outside
damnit okay there you go
put in some comments Forbes
okay now you're gonna say here Pat in 20
pixels now that's a little bit too much
time pixels say 15 pixels that's nice
alright
okay
okay so for this we're going to put in
ICU for this box and into putting some
padding on this box it's a little bit so
much sound pixels so that's fine border
remove the border make it nice and
smooth
okay label margin bottom margin bottom
let's say 10 pixels okay we got to
remove this from here all right there
you go so this we're gonna say
email all right what else you wanna go
to this my copy it is okay name email
okay label email input type text' name
email um let's see type should i what
else should I put I got the name on the
label we should put for okay for email
let me see if that give me ever know
this guy okay now what's the next thing
what a copy it is
okay now what's cool about this is that
as you can see I don't have to go in
there and close the tags like it does it
for me I don't know to me that's cool
we're gonna see this is text type text
this type password password
all right now what else you want to give
us some space in here so below this
we're gonna say margin bottom one rent
yeah there you go okay
okay why is this comma here I don't even
know all right so we got this
and I get this box on some more padding
was that 15 pixels as good
okay now the next thing that we're gonna
do create that button and that button
okay so button type submit' class submit
well I say main buying baby TN okay okay
so let's see
button you're gonna see
where the hell is the
background like this border one pixel
solid color white let's see color white
font size to rim basket mungus that
looks hideous 1.2 a ramp padding 10
pixels border radius 5 pixels say 30
pixels that's a little better
alright fonts wait let's say 300 let's
say 200 there is no longer than say 100
loud thing 305
now we see margin:0 auto freaking
backwards okay so they're not on the
center that's because there's not a set
with let's say minimal wave say 100
pixels say 200 pixels
float right now see this
all right
I still look hideous
it's a little bit better it's not
perfect but something a little bit
better
all right don't dun da da dun dun da
dong all right but is it perfect no but
it's fine for now now let me see how
long this road thing has a freaking
margin also still gotta put it put this
thing inside of a form form
let's see action leave it empty method
post
why is this having a padding Oh
sedessa I run the grid the zero topple
left
all right that's something I gotta fix
on my my github
there you go all right kids let's see
yeah let's company be fine
email password call firm
let me see so let's go with you guys
with you guys is up to right now Missy
is anybody still online
it's now bootstrap I'm using the same
classes name the class names of
bootstrap because is actually easier for
people to remember that plus there's
like thousands and thousands upon
thousands of developers who have used
bootstrap before so you know I created
like my own framework you know I know
everybody creates a framework but I
created this fearing a framework for
myself and for whoever wants to use it
it's just basically it's like a starter
kit for CSS grids if you guys are
interested I named the Johnny a UI for
my sister who passed away last year on
December 27 so I named after her I'm
planning on doing like full like a full
framework on it like I'm just adding as
I continue to build stuff I keep adding
things to this framework I mean for you
guys if you guys want to check it out or
see the process of what it is to make a
CSS framework you guys can definitely
check it out but it's up to you if you
want to use it it's just pretty much
very slimmed-down
framework of just CSS classes that's it
nothing too crazy you know what I mean
wifey sending messages man can you fork
it yes you could fork it
go ahead go check it out it's on my
github coding phase com
that's my get up get up count slash
coding phase calm like writing it out
dot-com and then is you come here you're
gonna see it I got my starter kit for
all the things that I build I use my
starter kit then I have this one which
is just CSS I have my rocky stack I
haven't updated this in a while I've
actually left it alone but we still got
a lot of stars there's the community
stuff from from glitter well get her for
those of you guys that want to get my
settings for Adam they're right here and
if you want to get my Michael is my font
the one that I use is right here this
font don't tell nobody that I have it
here and please don't report me this
font is like $700 it costs a lot of
money if you look it up operator mono it
costs a lot of money to have you know
I'm bootlegging it I'm putting it up
there but I'm not supposed so I mean you
guys look it's $200 minimum to get this
font it's pretty expensive I don't even
know if I should be telling you guys
this because then they my opera about to
take it off cuz I don't want nobody you
know who knows report me or something

you gotta play some music is gonna amps
campus up yeah but I can't do I go to
the package.json for the operator mono
font no you just you download the font
you double-click on everything right you
double-click on every single font file
and then after that you just basically
you take the settings that I have on the
machine on the repository where is it
you take this atom settings right and
then you go to styles that less you copy
everything that I have here matter of
fact I gotta update it because I did
some changes to mines so anyways you
gotta go to preferences I should do a
tutorial on this should definitely do it
to Tory about this by MC install no no
no it's on editor it's the editor o
themes yeah you go to themes you go to
your stylesheet copy everything that I
have here and then let me paste this in
here man there's my latest ones that I
have okay so you go in there you copy
everything that's in here alright and
then you go to your settings you go to
settings and then you go to themes and
then you go to your style sheet you go
in there and they use select or and
paste and that's it and save the file
command s and then you should get all
the things that I have
I mean I've been wanting to change the
theme for this I had a pretty cool theme
but it's like if I start going I could
go deep into this man and start
searching for themes like let me see
that was one that I liked Hydra
like this one this one's not bad
okay and we'll see what house settings
themes Hydra
yeah like this is not bad Jessica get a
little colorful but it's actually not
that bad
some reason like the color is bothering
me bothered my eyes for some reason I
don't know but see Adam deems
Adam themes see what what's popping
right now it was popular on Adam things
die Oh
I feel like the material syntax is not
bad either
like
this was nice too this Chester Adam was
the Chester
see I don't like this one there's annoys
me write this thing annoys me
probably if like having colorful
syntaxes that then you can't really
focus on what you're coding it's like
you're focusing on what what color it is
like it starts getting annoying
programmer
that
do all talk Alex I
it is not bad I like this
Oh like this this is actually nice I
just don't know if this actually goes
with this team
the team is nice to you I don't know
this was another little tool I like you
guys know I love purple that's my color
so that's always gonna be on hand you
know what I mean
see like this is nice this is something
I can mess with you know what I mean
like simple dual tone that's it
all right so let me get back to work
getting distracted and stuff see how you
do this yes I use it all the time I use
immutable Jas
yes operating mana looks so clean is
that's why I call so much money I paid
$200 for that like you know what I mean
like it costs money kids
this also another another font I like
free rah font I don't know if you guys
seen this thing is fira no it's not this
one coal fans with ligatures fear are
cold
this is cold slaw guys basically it
gives you like little icons for certain
thing like let's say if you wanted to
say double equals it shows you like that
if is not equal it shows you like that
if it's triple equals it shows it like
that like there's a cool font but I
can't use it because for the people that
are watching my tutorials they don't
have this fun a lot of people don't even
know what double equals is you know so
if I tell somebody hey it's double
equals and it looks like you know it
looks like this they're gonna write oh
it's equal you know what I mean
if I say not equal and I show them this
on the tutorials they're gonna be like
what the hell is this like they don't
know what the hell that is so I have to
keep like a clear font you know
see I also like Dracula Dracula syntex
themes install Dracula
all right put it to one dark Oh God
pretty tired continue doing this right
now should I continue doing it
should I not any tips to improve
encoding interviews problem-solving I
don't know man
I haven't had those issues in a long
time so I wouldn't even be able to tell
you I mean just there's why I tell
people do projects those stuff that look
like you're already in the game you know
like when I go to interviews they don't
ask me like crazy questions they don't
ask me to do no you know algorithms or
anything it's just I have the skills
it's like you if you want me I'll show
you my projects that's it if somebody
tells me right now I'll be honest
somebody I go to interview tomorrow
somebody tells me all do i algorithm I'm
gonna look at them like they're crazy to
be honest with you
like I haven't practiced them in God
knows when and I'll probably be like hey
man I haven't practiced this in a long
time so my portfolio speaks for itself
my references are there if you need
anything let me know but yeah guys I'm
about to start heading out I'm gonna see
you guys later all right
