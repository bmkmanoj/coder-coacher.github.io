screen it's here there you go all right
so if you refresh the page or later on
you come in and you see this man pretty
much we've got two posts going on this
is gonna be one poll for who should get
cut for next week so from the people
that survived so far right we got a few
people that survived and then from there
we have another poll which is you guys
get to vote out of everybody that's out
here right who gets to come back in and
also at the same time it could be a new
challenger all right it can actually be
a new challenger to take the spot for
next week so it's crazy right it's like
you know got the little spin on it so
pretty much repeating it again this week
you're gonna vote
one time is gonna be for the people that
has been here since the beginning part
of the show and then you're gonna choose
who's gonna get cut this week now who's
the best who's gonna get cut who you
think should get cut this week out of
the people that's here all right
that's still left from the original show
and then the new challengers you get to
vote for who you think should come in
for next week right so there's only
gonna be two people next week right one
person that's gonna be whoever's left
whoever has the least votes from being
cut and then the next one is the new
challenger pretty easy pretty easy to
understand right so let's get started
kids let's talk about this all right so
today we're not really bringing in
nobody to show today it's more about
going over the projects together you
know as a community and also to talking
about what happened this week so first
of all I'm gonna give you guys the
results of the last week's challenge
right so let me see I'm gonna give you
guys the results and then I'm gonna tell
you who's still in the game okay so
let's start it off like this this is
actually the results of it okay so who
you think should get cut this week this
was the poll from last week right 52% of
the people voted for Robinson to get cut
nine people say Casey to get cut then
let me see
and then who was the third one third one
was Erin last one was cam he was the
last one to with the least
volts so people want at camp to stay
people want an arrant estate people want
a cases to stay
people thought that Robinson should go
now
let's go into this cuz this is what
happens man this this is crazy
there is one crazy things start
happening let me share my screen let me
go back to my camera my camera view
basically what happened was Aaron hit me
up the arrows I kill I can't make it
I've been I've been studying I've been
doing this and that and I understand him
but you know what like the people voted
they wanted him to stay so things happen
like this since Aaron couldn't make it
in I don't know he had a lot of stuff on
his plate what happened now is Robinson
stays okay people wanted Robinson to get
cut this week but since Aaron cut
himself out then Robinson stays alright
so that's what we do in there so we got
three people that stayed there are still
in the game and then we have another
four people who are the new challengers
crazy man it's definitely crazy you guys
are gonna be like oh man this show us
has become something else alright I'm
about to start showing you guys the
projects and we're gonna go over them
and you guys gonna tell me what you guys
think so okay I'm just putting things in
corner all right
so the very first person that we gonna
put is gonna be Casey so I'll show you
guys Casey's project Casey decided to go
all out he decided to make gay you know
we react he wanted to add the slider he
wanted to pretty much clean up the work
that he had last week so let's share my
screen okay and want you guys to tell me
what you guys think to make sure you
leave a comment and leave a comment so
we could see it all right so this is
Casey's project okay we're gonna start
from the beginning first of all I will
say as you can see the circles are a
little bit off but a header is pretty
good besides that the circle should be
actually centered between the the words
so it's actually above the words is
supposed to be centered supposed to be
like a little bit lower but what's cool
about this is as you can see animations
you know he actually went in he went Oh
Lao he did you know the positioning of
the images he did everything with
regular Java JavaScript too but all of
this stuff is done with HTML CSS you
know as you can see he did exactly how
the design was see it has animations you
know you got the project down here came
out pretty dope man I like what I'm
seeing he also have a slider here that
he hand coding which is pretty dope man
it has a nice animation and it's smooth
it definitely has infinite scrolling oh
wait one mistake and it happens when you
go to the right there's a little circle
here goes to the left that's normal it's
okay things happen you know but besides
that everything is fine it supposed to
be the opposite way so
so if you go to the right this little
decibels to go to the right all right
now let me see what else here Jordan's
he got everything right this looks good
the images he looks good he actually did
exactly how I told him he made it
perfect exactly like the design is it's
pretty legit
let me see also too he went all out and
actually add an extra piece to this so
this is like the front page but now you
go to the products page you click here
and there now you're in the products
page I think this is pretty cool cuz he
went the extra mile he definitely did
his thing you know what I mean alright
so Casey only thing I will say is this
is cool what do they all say for me it's
just polishing it up a little bit maybe
here making a little bit of padding you
know make this there's a the sneakers a
little bit smaller
let me see and yeah also too this
thing's supposed to be a link that takes
you back to the homepage and it's just a
regular text but besides that everything
is fine and there's little things right
here at the bottom all you gotta fix
that that's it this is pretty good I
like the fact that you added all the
different logos which it made it better
it's also responsive obviously even the
slightest responsive but as you can see
it could definitely need a little extra
a little extra help but that's fine you
know what I mean like it's not supposed
to be perfect I mean we want it to be
perfect but if it's not perfect also you
know you just might need some extra time
to work on it that's about it but it's a
pretty solid project I like the fact
that you push yourself and you went all
out you know try to use your skills as a
JavaScript develop
so this is great now the next one okay
guys keep keep your notes there man keep
your notes tell me who you want to keep
man cause there's other three people
that you're gonna decide which one is
gonna stay which one goes so you're
gonna have to basically vote on who you
think out of the three of them who you
think should definitely go alright so
let's go into Robinson
okay so Robinson decided to create a new
project and his new project was about
his barber okay so this is pretty cool
he is like his own design his own work
and it's pretty simple pretty easy
you see it's is responsive tools
definitely a couple of things that I
will say I will work on like the menu
like you see this you gotta work on that
on mobile also too as far as the design
I don't like this black line here I
don't know why that line will be there
they don't really make sense let me see
I mean it's fine it's not bad but it's
not great but at the same time we gotta
understand too Robinson is a beginner
right he's starting you know so this is
like I to me personally at the level
that he's at and for the amount of time
that he's been working on this like he's
doing really good you know everybody
else is actually working on other stuff
you know what I mean like they've been
doing this for a while so it's pretty
cool give me a second
you
alright guys so now coming back to over
here man let's check the other one so to
me Robinson's page is very simple but
it's definitely something that you know
he's he's learning he's getting there
you know we just need to give us some
time all right let me see so we already
did Casey let's go to camp so this what
camp came up with you know it looks
pretty good looks fancy you know I like
it I like what I'm seeing here as far as
the designs it's pretty nice I like the
colors that he has here for some reason
I feel like the padding of this is off
like you get you see what I'm saying
like this is this padding on top is
bigger than this you wanna have this
area here to be centered so if this is
20 pixels on top it supposed to be 20
pixels at the bottom because they like
it throws me off like I can literally
look at it and be like okay there's
something wrong here so that's fine this
is cool right here also to here I will
add a padding I don't know why there's
no pad in there so if you have a pattern
here of let's say a hundred pixels or 80
pixels down here needs to be 80 pixels -
all right the typography of it is
beautiful I really like the typography
the website itself it looks very clean
you know I'm seeing the same thing the
same issues right here where the padding
of this is smaller than the pattern of
this at the bottom this throws it off
you want to have this thing centered
instead of like it's higher here and
we're like sure here then higher here
like it just throws it off maybe there's
something like a div or something that's
throwing everything off or maybe let me
see if it's a sizing thing
okay so it's not responsive that's fine
it wasn't supposed to be responsive but
those are the only things that I will
say about this let me see this links
alright I mean it's very simple
I like the colors I like how it looks it
just needs a little bit more polishing
and I don't know if I don't know if the
spacing on this is right you see that
like this is this supposed to be like
right Chloe I don't know but it looks
good but I just don't know if that's how
it's supposed to be but yeah all right
so that's camp so those are the top
three guys okay now you guys gotta make
your vote
you guys gotta make your vote you guys
decide who you think should stay who you
think should go you got camp you got
your boy Robinson you got Casey I mean
you guys decide that right you guys are
the ones that decide who stays who goes
for this week you know only one of them
got a stay only one of them is gonna
stay only one of them is gonna get
picked for next week which is the final
the final finale the final project and
that's a do what I'm saying now let's
look at the new challengers new
challengers please all right so to the
show today we have somebody named Kai I
think that's his name is Kai his app let
me see how long his app is about I'm
gonna share my screen
his app is about a gym local gym that he
has in his neighborhood and I'll be
honest this website looks pretty legit
looks pretty clean just some nice
animations I like this here it's a
little thinking god that's cool if you
click planet fat
it says bad choice planet fit good
decision
that's cool you know it's a nice page
scrollable you click on the menu it has
a little nicer animation it's pretty
clean I like it so this is sky guys this
when you guys see this on the pole his
name is Kai or maybe that's his initials
I don't know I couldn't read it from his
email or anything so it's just his name
is Kai and there's this project all
right now what do I think of it what
would I do
let me see only thing that don't like
it's probably this thing here the way
how they go you see like I don't know to
me I don't like it sounds bad but that's
it everything else is good
I mean it's a pretty simple page but
this right here is cool this is nice
like you know you always have like a
little something to spice it up and just
make it fun okay
now let's move on to the next one
so Tom Tran got this one this is project
this is Tom Tran okay I like this this
is pretty nice pretty simple pretty
clean let me make sure that you guys are
seeing this on the screen
boss burger so it's like okay satisfied
cravings I like the typography am I
still that am I still that typography
satisfied satisfy I gotta look that up I
don't know if that's a Google Fonts but
looks like alright oh I even noticed
that okay so the background changes as
he gets different locations so here this
one says our specialties and shows a
burger okay then we got I got a bunch of
I guess the top burger sections this is
pretty cool I will see menu there's the
menu for it
there's pretty nice yeah so this project
is pretty legit
pretty nice all the thing I will say out
of this whole project this fonts are too
big that's a that's the only thing that
I will say yeah everything seems pretty
legit obviously I'll be honest is like
the most solid one that I've seen so far
today it's pretty clean everything that
I'm looking at everything looks nice the
spacing is good
like nothing throws me off like I'm
looking at it
and I'm trying to find a mistake and I'm
just not seeing it you know what I mean
like all the padding is perfect
typography is good the only thing that
you know that throws me off is when I'm
come up here and I'm like wait why is
this menu so big that's the only thing
but besides that everything is good
so that's your boy Tom Tran guys Tom
train so when you guys vote you guys
decide who you guys think should state
his name is Tom Tran now let's talk
about Emma
eating my eating I got a nice website
tool margaritas so I guess this is a
restaurant - oh my god you know like a
quick little taco spot this is pretty
cool pretty nice this is cool like the
the colors on it the background is
pretty legit spacing on this pretty good
padding is pretty good menu list okay
all right I'll see you in LA you'll be
here the filtering eye I'll see you a
little JavaScript I wonder what she's
using let me see container menu section
jQuery good old jQuery that is pretty
cool I wish it would have been done in
and you know react but is good jQuery
you could never go wrong way from jQuery
all right let me see what else Greenwood
and innopolis for the adult margaritas
Mexican restaurant it's nice nice colors
everything was good
pretty legit only they will say this
right here like this
this farm color is like is blending in
too much with the background you either
gotta make the background a little bit
darker or make this pop out more by
putting a shadow or making it white all
right that's about it let's go to the
next one Wayne cook okay head on with
the sauce worried man I like that
refreshed and with the sauce man
you dig got the piece of lasagna
spaghetti I like this this is actually
pretty legit and what's cool about this
is he actually sent me the original
website so let me see Casa Bianca
let me see Casa Bianca bak ha go into
the original website of the company and
to be honest with you guys if I was him
I will try to reach out to them and show
them the new that a design that he
created because it looks so much better
than this like this is like for sure
made in like 2002 2003 like this website
so oh like look at it like this
background is on repeat like Italia
Italia but I'll repeat like you know
this website is an upgrade for them it
looks good it looks nice I like it
pretty simple but you know it straight
to the point now what I will say is
cleaning it up with typography have like
a nicer typography different weights
because I feel like a lot of this
weights are like super heavy but there's
nothing light like there's nothing
that's like I
like 100 200 300 font size or far away
so you wanna if you wanted to keep the
same the same font only thing I will say
is just play around with the weights
because it's like it seems like they go
from like 300 to 700 but there's nothing
in between them or nothing below it all
right so yeah let me see what else do we
have anyone else oh we got Wayne cook oh
yeah
sighs it's the same guy sorry sorry
Wayne so yeah we got going back to the
sites remember this man we got KY which
is platinum fitness this is pretty legit
tool we have Tom Tran with boss burger

margaritas taco spot and then we have

here and I'm reading emails
yo Robinson don't worry your body man
don't worry about it
it doesn't matter this is not about this
is not about a competition like who's
the best this is just like to
acknowledge for you know people's hard
work you know what I mean like you
already basically you've done so much
hard working your projects are really
good trust me compared to a lot of
people that I see you're doing really
good you got to understand you just
starting right Casey and and cam they
have a couple of months on top of you
they're supposed to their work is
supposed to look better but the same
time you have a lot of determination
you've been doing this you know for a
short amount of time and it looks good
it looks good I think for the amount of
time that you have you're doing good
don't worry about it you know you said
that was it it's to demotivating don't
worry a
about that man it's not this is not to
be like oh I'm doing the best I'm doing
I got the best design I got the best
thing no it's to everybody that's here's
a winner all right everybody's a winner
this is like a game you know what I mean
like this is just a game this is not
something for you to take it serious and
feel like oh my work is not as good as
their work they've been here for months
that's gonna happen that's always gonna
be the case even to this day even myself
there's people out there that's way
better than me but they've been here for
so much much you know longer than me
like I just started I'm a baby compared
to a lot of people you know I went to
this Meetup the other day where
everybody that was there they've been
coding for about like 20 to 30 years and
I'm like I'm there when I owe ya five
years you know what I mean like
everybody looking at me like all this
kid is a baby like he don't know nothing
you know it's like right now you're the
baby here you just started that's fine
but look at you you you're one of the
very few people that made it to the end
you know what I'm saying we let the
people vote this is just this isn't like
you know like people deciding who stays
who goes you know people get to decide
but at the same time it doesn't mean
that your work is not good because look
at oldest people right a lot of people
that are sending us their projects all
right the new challenges all of them are
good right but only one of them is gonna
come coming for next week and it's the
same thing like right now all three of
you guys are good but only one of you
guys is gonna make it for next week you
got what I'm saying
so let's see how it goes and even right
now all three of them you know it's like
cam came in and Casey they both good but
we don't know
next week the winner might be the new
challenger you get what I'm saying like
everybody hears good you know I mean
like trust me I'm not gonna put you out
there be like oh there's gonna be a
loser who gets the most votes like who's
the loser now this is more of like hey
man this is motivating people to work
hard you know what I mean so don't worry
about it everybody here's a one
everybody's winning and it's just like
it's a show man think about it like this
man is like you know it's like you go to
the bachelors you know the batch of this
show right everybody gets to make out
with the girl right well only one guy
gets to go go home well right at the end
of the show and the bachelors right like
it was it wasn't the bachelor
bachelorette or some like that
right it's like everybody makes out with
the girl all the guys is there they
there to get game love with one girl
and then out of all those guys only one
guy gets to go home with the girl but a
whole bunch of guys get to kiss her too
you know what I mean like throughout the
whole show so this is how you got to
think about it like this show is like
that
everybody's winning where do you vote
where do you vote you vote right here on
the dock your arm on the frickin
description at the bottom of my page of
this video look right here you get to
vote so so now we're gonna find out and
actually we don't even get to find out
because to be honest with you guys
we don't know who's gonna get to win at
the end of the day you know what I mean
like this thing is from now to next week
till Friday you know what I'm saying -
next Friday so even though we might see
a higher percentage of Robinson and
Casey getting cut this week but at the
same time we don't know this could
change because there's 10,000 you know
there's 10,000 people that are watching
this and then on top of that there's
gonna I'm gonna send out an email to all
of my subscribers on on you to me all of
my subscribers on my website to make
sure to get them to vote sorry guys
gotta take this
you
yo yo yo yo yo yo yeah man so right now
don't worry about it guys we here we got
we're getting a lot of votes man I got
people hitting me up right now that day
like yo we watching the show right now
this is late you know what I mean like
they voting they voting for people right
now so let me see hold on let me check
let me check what the Volt's is that
right now all right so we got we got a
45 for Robinson we got 24 for Casey we
got four for cam now let's see how it is
man they see how it goes you know those
are the top two man there's the top two
that's so far if it doesn't change in a
week of different votes these are the
top tools that are getting cut you guys
got to look at the the projects man you
guys got to definitely look at the
projects look at the projects pay
attention this is cams project right
it's a restaurant you know pretty simple
there's this project okay now once again
there's a look at Robinson the
Robinson's project is uh you know it's
for the barber shop it's pretty legit
mean we in here keep in mind Robinson
just started like a few few weeks ago
like he's he's just getting in this
alright now we have Casey Casey went all
out this is he decided to stay working
on the first project and actually
perfected adding you know a slider
adding some animations I believe you can
also change your vote if you decide to
change your vote you could change your
vote because sometimes people vote for
you know people that they like people
that they wish they could stay you know
this isn't a friend thing this isn't
like a friendship thing I will say guys
vote for whoever has the best project
okay only vote for the person that you
think that should get cut this week you
know so let me look at this this thing
right here let me look at the settings
let me see if you guys can change it
limits war response presentation quizzes
all right I'm gonna actually I'm gonna
I'm gonna delete the response man I feel
like deleting the response and letting
you guys vote again decide what you guys
really want who you guys really want
because I feel like people might have
voted twice
the people vote twice was the game
rigged was the game rigged yeah exactly
like he just started man coding phase at
gmail.com and Blake you didn't send me
nothing Bank I don't know I need you to
send me the thing man that's on you you
telling me you can't put your email here
Blake you can't go like this coding fees
at gmail.com you can't delet so I could
search if you actually sent me anything
like I can't do it for you well you have
to send me the thing so I can add you
but I'm not saying something the project
sent me your your freaking email where
you sent me from before
what's your email like I need your email
so I could search you on my inbox if you
sent it to me I need to find it you know
what I mean because I searched hear what
your name is Blake there's nothing Blake
hear this from copán and this is from
Skillshare so that's when you broke
there's a portfolio though there's not
what we want right now Philippe is like
yeah I was doing that counter with
counted the votes why now gore and Bush
started started going at each other back
in 2001 it's not I don't like the votes
I'm just saying like I'm seeing how many
people have been in here and then we're
getting we're getting actually more
votes than people that I've seen on the
channel right now so that tells me that
people voted twice you got what I'm
saying so I think I think to be fair to
really be fair there needs to be a
recount because there's 76 responses
that should be they should be a bit
about like 50 or something so that tells
me that people vote it twice you get
what I'm saying
ChIP chip chip wiing here kids we in
here LLB I got wife ving here say what
up to wifey out here
scheming looking at the livestream
making sure I'm good
making sure no biddies is talking to me
say what up to LV everybody say LV
without my I want everybody to put down
the chat put down the chat right now
oh you what up MA you know we're do now
I just want to be be honest man oh you
would have my word you know we got LV in
the building today man it's a special
show we're guys man
this is crazy man I don't know what do
you guys think should we do a recount
should we do a recount for who's getting
cut this week what do you guys think
let me know yeah let me know what you
guys think I should do should we do a
recount or should we keep it like that I
personally feel people probably fold it
twice
why because I'm looking at the stats and
also - I made a mistake that put it out
quick right so since I put it out quick
what happened was I couldn't click on
the on the settings where it says limit
to one response which means that people
vote it twice you get what I'm saying
let me see I'm about to start it up
let me see can I do it I'm about to
start it up kids
i motherly orders the response what you
guys think should I do it do the recount
I'm telling you because I know how
people are somebody people started
voting twice that's not fair you know
what I mean that's not fair to cam
that's not fair so KC does not fair to
Robinson you get what I'm saying so we
have to just make your fair man all
right so I'm gonna delete it again I'm
on the leader

we got KY Tom
Irma and Wayne who do you think should

Irma's that was Wayne this is Casey's
this robinsons Wang okay Wayne Irma KY

I'm gonna take my vote who who I think
should stay who should who I should go
I'm gonna do my vote in like a few
seconds go vote for who you think should
stay this is this is actually Tom's this
is pretty cool I think he did an amazing
job Tom definitely did good I think cam
and cam and Casey did great Robinson
he's still getting there I think he did
great too you know there's a lot of
stuff that you know you gotta do but it
takes time you know I think out of
everybody I think Robinson is definitely
one of the biggest one is here because
number one is like he's still getting in
the game like
you know I mean like he came in showed
up every single day of the you know the
week that we needed him he do his work
so go ahead go vote guys go vote so far
right now seems like Thomas winning
Thomas winning for the new challenger
let's see who is winning on who should
get cut seems like it's pretty much the
same thing as before so Robinson seems
like the people want to cut Robinson and
they want to cut Casey and then people
want to leave cam so that's between
Casey and Robinson both of these are
getting cut and it seems like cam is
gonna stay for the long run only two
people can make it to next week so go
ahead and vote right now guys go ahead
and vote guys is write down the
description check the description go
check it out
it's right there man it seems like
man seems like it's gonna be a kam
versus Tom
know what I mean we in here kids go
ahead if you vote it already you have to
vote again because we started it all
over if you have your vote go vote right
it doesn't matter even if you vote it
already go vote again because basically
we started from scratch before people
were voting twice now you can't do that
you can only vote once so there you go
kids who should get cut cam Robinson or
Casey who's gonna be the new challenger
for next week one of the challenges
could actually take it you know it's
like one of those moments man where were
you were were freaking there was the
winner of the mentorship show like where
was you there's like nine eleven kids
you know the people get to vote man
people get to vote man people decide who
stays who goes man personally I'll say
the ones that I'm not gonna vote but
I'll see who I will vote for who I think
you know and don't take it personal who
I think will stay I think personally I
would like Casey to stay cam they're
great but I think
Casey went all out but you know the
people decide and people get to vote
let me see from the new contenders new
challengers I think Tom for me
that's horrible now you guys get to
decide who who you guys want come on
guys everybody is 37 people guys I need
you guys to come to the description and
come and vote right now guys let's keep
this fear let's keep this nice and fair
I need you guys to vote somebody needs
to get cut somebody needs to get this
buck-fifty Rayna there's only 14 volts
in come on guys
there's 30-something people here you
guys got to go in on the description go
vote right now somebody's getting this
buck 50 Ryker style
come on guys you guys got a vote guys
got a vote we'll get cut for next week
that's the link vote for the new
challengers and whose sugar cut for next
week you guys decide man you guys decide
let the people decide is 36 people come
on guys go get your votes in I want to
see a good amount of people voting today
you see see what I was saying before
people were voting like two or three
times because there was like 77 votes
and look look at the difference right
now 17 volts in and it's a big
difference new challengers new
challenges who's in Marina damn tom is
holding it down 50%
Irma people like Emma - everybody needs
boat kids go vote we need your votes
my vote is up for sale the QA developers
really harp on the pattern like that
hell yeah of course
trust me it's even worse there's people
out there there's like sometimes there's
people that are like complete losers and
like they really go out there be like oh
you're off by three pixels you're off by
two pixels like no but that's how it is
because like sometimes you look at the
design and it doesn't look the same yeah
that's what I was saying I'm jarem
prints like yellow people were voting
like two three times now all of them
Michael Banks says can we get the links
to the websites that they put up the
problem is that not all of them put it
up on like github pages or LinkedIn on
Wellington Heroku or any of those free
hosting companies and nobody freaking
only like maybe two people did that you
know what I mean everybody else just
they send me the files themselves so the
Holland
to get excited on for a client and with
all the QA well it depends if you work
at an agency like let's say you work at
an agency a local agency you get paid by
the hour right but at the same time you
can pay about an hour but a lot of times
people want to get those websites as
soon as possible so that's why people
use a lot of times things like WordPress
and little bs like that but when you
work for a major company there's usually
a time frame where you say okay we're
gonna build a brand new website and
that's like six seven months later on or
even a year it takes a year to get it
done
I'm just reading the messages guys
anyways guys man come on 36 people make
sure you vote man make sure you vote
all right misty any questions you guys
my half
make sure you before any questions make
sure you go vote I want people to to
decide today like give us a good amount
of people a good amount of votes in
there so right now we have Tom at the
lead for the new challengers earn our
second place let me see who else who
should get cut who's getting cut this
week let's see let's see
seems like Robinson and can't no
Robinson and Casey getting cut this week
Robinson and Casey unfortunately you
guys got a buck-fifty so far I mean we
got away until somewhere down this week
see which one stays all right so let me
ask them some questions now guys now we
get to hang out now we get to hang out
and this is what we chilled is where we
hang out and we answer questions okay
all right so Bessie
Kris kissing says what do you think
about free cocaine my friend my friend
got a job a $50,000 job this week after
the frontend bit now what I say to
people is they you know they Creek Oh
Kim get him that job or was it that he
went all out
you know cuz some people they dig
attribute things to certain websites
right like I can come in and say hey my
first job was html/css
I want to give thanks to free so dream
team treehouse right like thanks to them
I got that first job we could say that
but was it them or was this someone
someone else or just the guys
determination you know I mean like free
coke camera is really good for giving
you all the basics but I don't think
that to have all the skills that you
need that's like the place to go that's
like solo learn I don't know if you guys
heard a solo learn solo learn is is a a
website is a phone application where you
practice HTML CSS JavaScript but in the
long term when you look at it you like
wait this is just like teaching me stuff
that was in the documentation like I'm
not building web sites you know what I
mean
sometimes people are lucky you know you
can never say hey somebody even somebody
could come in and be like hey I got a
job from freako camp and now I'm making
$100,000 I mean but what are the factors
behind it right what are the factors
that he got that job was it that he
built a solid portfolio was it that he
already had other degrees cuz people
don't talk about this you know you could
go in and have like I was saying that
girl who went to a boot camp right she
went to a boot camp got a job I forgot
what company on the New York Times right
she got a job on the New York Times but
when you look at her her work on paper
she's legit she
went to a four-year college when I
before you college or four-year
university I believe of Pennsylvania
from there she was working at IBM as a
project manager and then she went to a
boot camp and then she switched up to
become a developer now did the boot camp
get her that job or was it her whole
background how whole rest of me you get
what I'm saying like I don't know
sometimes people don't don't really add
those extra things right it's like I
could go to a job interview right and I
could go in there for golang right for
example and somebody else could go in
for the same job maybe I'll get the job
right this person has a degree this
person has everything that they need but
how come I got the job was it my skills
was it the fact that I've worked for
other companies five six years was it
the fact that you know I cracked a joke
with the person and he felt comfortable
he's not oh you know what I don't mind
having this kid on my team right would
it be that or would it be I will say hey
I got hired because I took the free
cocaine thing you know what I mean like
I don't think you can put something like
behind him but okay I got hired because
it is you know when I get hired at a
company I know is because of all the
time that I put into learning how to
code and all the courses I took in you
to me like I have a lot of knowledge
like you literally put me on any
programming language I'd build you
something whatever you want to build it
for you but everything goes back to you
to me for me because everything that
I've learned from you know Ruby PHP
laravel react what else
angular 5 which I'm taking a course now
just to you know going to see what they
have on the angular 5 it's the same
thing as angular for just a few little
things that are changing but it's pretty
much the same thing I'm taking another
course on it right so then now I would
say hey all of this stuff comes from
udemy you get what I'm saying now a
frico camp they teach you the basics of
HTML CSS and JavaScript and some
algorithms that's it
but is that enough to get you hired I
don't know about that he gotta have a
good portfolio he's gotta have something
that people believe in he gotta have a
degree
he gotta have some type of history like
people don't want to talk about those
things all right they don't want to add
those extra things cuz it's like right
now for example I always bring this up
like cuz this is just like a regular job
Johnny the the truck driver right and
then Cynthia the college graduate who
went to IBM all right they both went to
the sink the same frickin coke amp right
they went to the same Co camp they go to
the same things they do the same
projects when they go to the same
interview who you think is gonna get the
job Johnny the truck driver who has a
portfolio that's decent or Cynthia who
went to Penn State who freakin already
worked at IBM for like five years as a
project manager who already is been in
the industry like people forget
sometimes like you're already in the
industry if you work in the tech
industry were you working in a corporate
America right technically you already
are in the industry you're not doing
development work but you're already in
corporate America and a resume that
looks good you know so it's like 50/50
you know what I mean like or you know
you know a girl might come in you know
she might look you know she might look
like cute guys these guys out here I'll
be honest like that things happen like
that so you know people hostess don't
talk about this like the positives and
the negatives it's like but people want
to talk about the negatives more than
the positives so let's say your girl
looks good she comes in she's smart she
has a great portfolio she's been doing
this for a while
and then it's another girl who is like a
little nerdy a little tomboyish who you
think is gonna get hired if they both go
in who you think that recruiter or that
person that's interviewing both of them
who eat is gonna get hired a lot of
times gonna be like oh let's pick the
person with the most most talent but you
forget that little factor the factor of
human beings as a human being you're
gonna choose the one that you rather
have in the office that's just how it is
you know what I'm saying like it just it
happens like that you know what I mean
like now if your face was something that
is specifically you like oh man we need
somebody who's super talented who could
hit the ground running you're gonna
choose the person with the better
experience but there's always that
little thing that people might call luck
or just a random variable you know for
who gets hired that's just that's just
how life is
you can't walk away from life you know
what I mean let me see what this kid say
he said AJ say when your courses are you
coming out with or are you working on
I'm still doing the PHP course I'm still
doing the PHP course I actually I
started a project and then I'm they
leaving the project because I started
with lumen all right so looming is want
to share my screen with you guys looming
is a a micro service for PHP
but I think that's an error of mine to
started with lumen because if you start
with laravel instead of teaching looming
then you could skip a lot of steps once
you start learning looming because
looming is the same thing as laravel the
only difference is it's - a whole bunch
of stuff for the web right so it's
easier to start somebody off teaching
them laravel and then teach them lumen
after so I started with lumen before it
and I say you know what I'm gonna put it
on hold so I'm gonna show you right now
and the project that I'm doing is I got
two projects for PHP number one the
project that we're gonna do with laravel
is gonna be about connecting to the API
of Behance
alright so Behance is this website right
so we're connecting to this this website
and you know how I always tell you guys
like hey you go go to dribble go to
Behance calm find a design that you guys
like get inspired and then create your
own website well that's exactly what
we're doing we're creating a tool for
that for developers so pretty much we're
gonna have API call to to this website
that we're gonna be able to do searches
so let's say for ecommerce right let's
say your developer wanted to have
ecommerce he's gonna be able to do a
search to this website find a websites
that he liked add it to a list and then
after he adds it to the list he has like
a dashboard where he has like let's say
five images five this images I'll say
hey I like five of this websites there's
designs that I have here and then I'm
gonna add that to a project so now from
there as a developer I have something to
guy myself with and we're doing that
with laravel hopefully that makes sense
and then the second project that I want
to do what a micro service is going to
be to do
API for what is it Angry Birds
so basically doing a rest API for Angry
Birds and saving the data basically
creating a back-end for video games and
yeah those are the two projects that I'm
working on right now actually you're
supposed to be finished by it but it's
just it's hard it's it's hard cuz I want
to plan it out good I don't want it to
be like oh I'm still doing the project
and figuring out how how the database
should be how you know I want to
actually have it planned out for you
guys so it could be a very smooth
project okay so let me see what else any
other questions let me see what you guys
are talking about another question
question how many products do we need to
do to apply for a job as a junior
developer I would say try to do four or
five projects that's it
just so you could have a diversity you
want to show people that you could do
anything I mean you can look at other
website templates but you shouldn't copy
it you shouldn't go in there but okay
I'm just gonna copy and paste this into
my own code know what you should do is
look at what the person did like let's
say an example you go to a website like
I could go to a Awards com right and I
could come here let's say for this like
this website and I could come in and
look at their their HTML you know look
at the HTML see how they using it how
they making their animations I do this
all the time you know like what what are
they using like this is using
calculation see like they're using calc
so calculate one hundred percent of the
width minus 32 pixels so little things
like that little tricks like that is
fine to look at other people's code and
understand it you get what I'm saying
like look like right now we're doing
animations right like it's fine to look
at this and check over here see how they
make those animations and see how they
did it is completely fine
I gotta do this all the time every time
that I want to like look at other
people's games or other people's
websites I like to see how they build me
you know what I mean
so that's completely fine you could
definitely do it the problem that comes
in is when you you come and you copy
somebody's code and then you paste it
into yours and you're like wait you
didn't even understand what happened you
just copied it
yeah you could definitely start working
on projects man okay Cory man says hey
Joe what's up new to coding I'm really
enjoying your videos at minimum how many
hours of practice do you recommend a
daily basis as much as you can cuz it's
not like force practicing you know what
I mean like for me like right now I love
doing this cuz this is fun I'm
constantly coding I probably called for
about seven eight hours a day on my own
time even when I was working full-time I
will come home and we'll call it another
five hours in my house and you know even
all the stuff that I do here with you
guys like hang out what'd you guys talk
about code
I consider this part of coding too
because we're talking about code we're
talking about web development
we're also um you know finding solutions
so all of the stuff is part of it yeah
it's like you definitely need to still
do research and stuff like that but you
know what I mean
you
yo should we focus on building or focus
on understanding things like Java
scripting algorithms let's start
building things man I'm being honest
like this there's two different type of
developers guys I always tell you this
there's probably even more than just two
types of developers right there's the
guys that are you know the guys that
work for companies right there's the
guys that work for companies guys who
are freelancers guys who are working for
themselves they got their own clients
etc right when you are a developer and
you build web applications right you
build websites you build a REST API is
you build front-end landing pages all
those stuff right you're a developer
right you're somebody who works as a
developer and you build websites right
then there's other people right there's
other developers who are into the
technical side right if you're a
developer that loves to find out like
man how fast is you know doing a map
versus doing if you know a for loop or
doing something like you know filtering
with doing filtering with es6 or doing a
filtering you know basically by hand by
doing for loops and doing your own
algorithm to filter something which one
is faster if you're one of those person
one of those people then you're in a
different league right you're in a
different league you're one of those
people that they want to see how things
take and they want to create faster
things in you know you want to create
libraries you want to create frameworks
you want to you're one of those people
right me personally I don't consider
myself one of those people like I could
care less I'm being honest I could care
less which one is faster which one is
smaller which one is more compressed I
don't give up fill in the blanks you
know what I mean I'm all about building
stuff right building things and seeing
how P
to interact with them I'm not one of
those people who is worried about you
know what's the most technical thing
like I compare myself you know a big
contrast right between myself and
somebody like fun fun function right
that's somebody who's really into all
the details right that's like somebody
who is really into the details right so
when you like you asked me here this
question is you say Joe should we focus
on building projects or understanding
things like Java scripting algorithms
you have to ask yourself that right as a
junior developer somebody who's starting
into this right what do you want to do
because you could fall into a loophole
of like a freaking infinite loop of
learning I was like you're never going
to be ready right you could say oh my
god so many people are smart at me so
many people don't know all this stuff
you could fall into that trap right or
you could say hey how can I build
websites start showing that I have
skills and get a job and then learn
things as I need to learn right if you
go in if I hire you let's say I have a
company I hire you to come in we need an
extra hand with somebody to help us out
on the projects most of the time is
gonna be regular stuff like either in
the back end dealing with databases
setting up new pages setting up new
filtering for for users whatever it is
or you is gonna be something in the
front end like or creating HTML emails
or creating landing pages creating you
know new web applications with react or
angular or view whatever right those are
the things that people need an extra
hand as a junior developer you want to
get those jobs you want to go in and get
hired but you could fall into this trap
of what a lot of people beyond on like
let's say Stack Overflow or a lot of
people beyond ready or
even here on YouTube that people be like
oh you know it's like you're not a real
developer you're not a real engineer you
know this isn't that because they're
here for something completely different
from what I'm on I'm here because this
is something to bring in money for my
family take care of them and do my job
build websites build applications
they're there for their own purposes
they want to be the smartest person in
the world they want to be you know a
famous developer to have a million stars
on github they want to create the latest
algorithm like me I could care less so
it's like you have to ask yourself which
type of person you are
are you here to get money and get hired
and continue doing other cool things in
your life or you want to become some
Albert ice you know Albert Einstein of
programming you get what I'm saying like
I hope you understand so it's like you
could fall into the trap of like hey I
just want to keep on learning I gotta
learn every algorithm out there yeah you
could do that but if you're not that
type of person
you're just wasting your time you know
what I mean it's like for myself why I
don't focus so much of algorithms
because I don't care about working at
Google I don't care about working at
Facebook I don't care about working on
none of this big companies I could care
less I make the same money that other
developers that are there I probably
make more money than some of them then
the junior developers that go in there I
make more money than them and they work
at Google the only thing that's like
that's cool about it it's to say oh I
work at Google I work at Facebook that's
it besides that I could care less that's
what I me myself I tell people the
people that follow me as I'm hey don't
focus on on freaking algorithms because
if you're not going for that way if
you're not like let's say you you're
gonna work at a Dropbox right a Dropbox
right at Dropbox they might need
somebody who's
really good at math who's really good
with algorithms who's gonna come up with
the fastest way to compress files to
have him more efficient and this this
and that
if you're not looking for that job and
you could care less about that why are
you wasting atomic algorithms right
that's what I tell people but you know
then some people look at me crazy you
know I tell people just focus on
building projects you gotta find
yourself you gotta realize what is it
that you want to do now they are gonna
be companies who are gonna ask you for
algorithms let's let's be clear there's
gotta be companies that's gonna ask you
for algorithms right but there's the
thing where is stupid for a company like
let's say you're gonna be building
websites what is the point of you coming
in wasting two three hours going over
algorithms going over a bunch of
technical questions when all you're
doing is building websites I understand
if you're building an Android
application understand if you're
building a software I understand if
you're building a whole bunch of stuff
right JavaScript doesn't need algorithms
at all to be like to create anything you
don't need it like people are you know
they making something that's easy into
more complicated even with all the
frameworks and all the things that they
building every single day they want to
make something that's simple and easy to
do more complicated than what it is even
right now like I love react but there's
like a a barrier that's why I created
the the freaking starter kit for you you
guys so you guys don't have to go
through that whole process of installing
everything figuring how to do everything
like it takes a long time to set up
everything
and like to understand it so it's like
if you want to just start building the
websites you use a starter kit right you
don't have time to be wasting and
freaking and learn how to build this
engineer freaking back freaking how you
call this bill tool like all you want to
do is build a website you know what I'm
saying like that's the beauty of jQuery
jQuery you don't even need anything all
you need to do is just you put jQuery in
and then you start using dollar sign on
your JavaScript you're good you know it
makes your life easier but I think
people people try to make something
that's easy into more complicated than
what it needs to be Nina now every
company listen unless you I'm telling
you right now unless you're going to
like you know a very very competitive
company don't worry about stupid
algorithms you're wasting your time I'm
being honest like plus experience
Trump's algorithms and and even
education there's people that come in
with you know four-year schools and
schools that are very prestigious and
then my experience Trump's them because
somebody will say hey we still gotta
train this person while this other
person that doesn't come from this
amazing for your school he's already
been doing this for years and that's why
I tell people all the time you gotta
figure it out
it's up to you you know it's like it's
up to you you decide what you want to do
what type of developer you are me I'm
here for the money I'm here because I
love building websites I love building
things
I love seeing users interact with things
that I built me I don't care about
building the fastest thing in the world
and and you know I was like hey man I
created an algorithm that turns a string
to lowercase in less than a hundred
milliseconds it's like good for you you
know what I mean like I got other things
that I have to do you know what I mean
that's how I look at it like I can't I
can't spend time worrying about creating
a a dump algorithm and just like just to
get you know because in reality when
even from high college even from
managers and and people nobody cares
about that the user doesn't give a given
F about that the user doesn't care about
that at all I have six years I haven't
had to use a algorithm neither once you
know my first year I was like oh I'm
working hard man I gotta learn this
thing I even took a course on udemy with
like over 20 different algorithms how to
do it in every language I learned how to
do it in Python I learned how to do our
Ruby learn how to do it on PHP
JavaScript and it's like now that I look
back it was like six years I've been
doing this I haven't had to use the
algorithm to build a page till this day
am I crazy about that or am I the only
one in the world that has gone through
this like I haven't had to use an
algorithm not even once on six years and
people get feels like algorithms like
between like you know sorting you know
sorting certain things like sorting
certain arrays like this certain certain
times that I have to use things that
will be considered as algorithms when it
comes to react and you have to deal with
Redux and you have to deal with
like you know different things like that
but it's not like I'm creating like the
fastest way to to sort through an array
it's like it's doing the same job it's
loading in less than freaking 100
milliseconds like nobody cares you know
what I mean it's like even like right
now you know like with whole view Jes
when people were like oh you jes is fast
and this isn't that and I'm like nobody
cares like they just say like oh this
thing renders a you know four times
better than react and it's like I'm
looking at the same app and they both
load at the same time but for some
people they put it through the test and
they're like oh it's like twenty ten
percent off it's a little bit faster
than reactive because on this view and
this and that is like nobody cares the
user doesn't care nobody cares besides
all this developers who are into making
things faster than what it what is
already there but it's like it's like
this is like you create something that
is faster than the speed of light all
right like let's say you create
something that's faster than speed of
light or faster than you could blink
right what's the point nobody could see
what happens between that time when you
blink like who cares you know what I
mean like that's just me I'm just giving
you you know I'm just giving you like a
true true thing you know what I mean but
as a thing another thing to like
fake-face friend success Joe I need to
get on Dan every mom's level then every
most he creates like stuff that's useful
this is the thing that's why I like him
he he's one of the people that I like he
create useful things there's people out
there creating things that's not useful
like they they're creating stuff that oh
just to say I have to
sustained out there you know the he
somebody was they did like a interview
with all the creators between like you
know Dan Abramov even you the guys I
create an ember they did like I'll go a
Google hangout and Dan Abramoff was like
they were saying oh yeah viewers you
know it's a little faster than reacting
and then every most face was like like
you know like like I could care less
like who cares you know what I mean like
I'm building things we react I'm
basically got cool stuff out there like
nobody cares you know what I mean yep
PHP could be good at PHP could be boring
sometimes but what's cool about PHP is
building things once you start building
things thank you good man
exactly exactly
hey I business why would you focus on
optimizing random algorithm and web
development what kind of Pro when that
kind of programming will be more
practical in computer science type of
roles exactly like me I don't see myself
like I've I've actually tried doing like
development with like I didn't like it
it was boring I try to create you know
applications when I was in in college
and my first two years it was boring
like really boring you know it's
freaking boring it's not me for me you
know it's like I don't see myself
creating iOS apps because it's boring
like isn't it's not for everybody you
know what I mean so why would I spend my
time trying to learn algorithms right
like I already did that my first year
cuz on your first year before you get a
good job you always gonna be like you
know stressed about like oh am I ready
am I
be able to get a job and it's like once
you got a job you like I'm in this
already like I could care less what's
going on in the world like I'm already
in this I know I could still get a job
somewhere else I could still work
another company I could leave a company
get another job the next week
like I'm not fazed by anything you know
what I mean exactly yeah I think coding
training tool is another one that his
his website does the thing I think he's
not his website is his channel is more
about you know going and creating stuff
that's difficult but it's not stuff that
you could put into real practice like
this like very rare situations where
people's gonna hire you for that there's
more jobs for the things that we're
building here on this website there's
more jobs every single day created for
those things that we're doing here like
there's a little projects that we did
for the mentorship show this jobs for
that all right for the things that he
creates there's like it's a cool little
project it's like little things that
they're doing in coding boot camps is
like oh here's a alway had to you know
connect to this and then from there we
connect to a freakin Raspberry Pi that
connects to her freaking out Arduino
that does a 360 find me a job where's
the raspberry where's the Raspberry Pi
job you know what I mean like I'm about
real stuff man like you know stuff that
I could see you know what I mean stuff
that I see with my own eyes like you
know they talk about like I was a
Udacity you that's it he got a course on
or was a car automation was a machine
learning and self-driving cars and it's
like okay this is cool
but we are the jobs for that right
you're gonna take that course online
when
his guys on MIT you know and even the
guys who are taking those courses on
self-driving cars on on Udacity a lot of
those guys got really good the grease
that come with them
right and it's like hey here's myself
I'm here and I'm just gonna waste my
time as if I don't have nothing else to
do like I don't have a family I don't
have my friends I don't have a freakin
life to go out how am I gonna go in but
hey I'm just gonna learn machine
learning to learn it on my own time to
be in my own house I find that thing to
be ridiculous and stupid for people to
be doing that you know what I mean like
if that's not the route that you're
doing then that's different you know I
mean like you're just wasting your time
ya know but he has I think coding
trained has a great channel I like a lot
of stuff I looked at some stuff that he
did with WebSocket with creating video
games and multiplayer games I think
they're definitely cool but you know
like my channel you guys know what my
channel is about my channel is about
getting people hired getting people to
get that money man there's no really no
no reason for us to be here unless we
we're here for this like look I love the
fact like I have right here there's like
a hundred and seven dollars right this
thing has been here on my desk for about
four weeks I haven't had the need to
pick it up in four weeks and I'm not
worried about it
you know there was a point where every
single money that I had I had to have it
in my pocket I needed to to know I said
oh yeah I got money I got this and that
I've gotten to the point where the
things that I've done for the past five
six years have put me in a position
where I'm not worried about money I'm
not worried about where my next check is
gonna come from I'm not worried about
you know how I'm gonna
survive in this world like this this is
to me is a piece of paper before it used
to be life used to be like oh I can't go
out I can't go out to the movies with my
girlfriend cuz I don't have this I can't
go to you know to the studio where I
used to love to record music because
every studio time was $45 haircutting a
40 now it's just paper and that's the
thing that I I try to teach people here
and just to get them to the same level
that I am I'm not a millionaire I'm not
rich I'm comfortable I'm like
comfortable you know what I mean like
I'm not worried about things like I know
I know I like where my money comes from
I know where I'm gonna get money I know
if I want to really take it to the next
level next yet I'm gonna freakin double
or triple the money that I'm getting and
then the more that you get the less
importance that has become right I don't
like people wasting their time I like
people being able to say hey I did this
I spent you know eight hours on Joe's
website for a reason
I don't want people to come to my
website do it and but I oh great
I know how to sort a binary tree and
it's like okay cool but now when you go
to your job interviews and and you know
you you have a store close to you or
ecommerce store whatever or any type of
website out there and then I hate we
want you to come in and come to the
interview you have no projects all you
have is like hey I hire for you know a
frico camp certificate and it's like you
know what I mean like it's like we need
to freaking you know what I mean like I
want everybody to just look at this is
like some stupid piece of paper alright
this is the level that you need to get
to right and I I look at myself I'm like
yo what if I was to take it to the next
level like right now I'm doing a couple
of business moves I'll tell you guys
like
web development programming is my
passion as my love is the thing that
I've been doing for the five six years
but now I'm also branching off to other
venues and other things that I'm doing
so I'm doing a couple adventures with my
friend with his studio that's gonna be
another income a pretty cool you know
two thousand three thousand dollars from
their different day I got other stuff
that I'm doing you know I'm trying to
look into investing into I cos like this
a lot of stuff that I'm doing out here
you know it sucks this weekend freakin
stupid as Bitcoin messed me up this
weekend but whatever we're gonna get
that money back become we mess me up
this week oh for sure
yeah now I'm just trying to you know I'm
trying to help people out just get to
the next level man it's like my friend
look my friend my boy who I was telling
you who you guys saw yesterday on my
live stream my boy Blackie black this
case super talented this guy he had a
show where he interview a whole bunch of
like famous rappers and famous artists
out there and he stopped doing it and I
told him you know what bro you gotta
continue doing this and you got to get
back to it so now I'm helping him and
I'm also being partners with him to
create this new channel that he's gonna
have because you gotta understand the
things that I do here this channel has
grown a lot but this is such a small
niche that like I'm comfortable where
I'm at with 10,000 subscribers now
imagine me with him him doing all the
videos and me helping him got him
through the right ways and how to market
things and how to get his his channel on
you know the top searching keywords and
getting the right interviews going to
the right concerts and doing other
things that he needs to do his channel
could go like a few million views per
month right once we get to that level is
a wrap you know what I mean like if I'm
doing good with 10,000 subscribers
imagine how I'm gonna do with half a
million subscribers all right that's the
goal you know it's like you just got a
freakin work hard man and find your
passion and you gotta use this you gotta
use this career as a as a tool to
basically go to everywhere you want to
go to in life I use this because I love
this I love programming I love creating
websites I love dinner with HTML CSS
JavaScript you know the backend I love
doing it well the same
now I'm doing other stuff like I want to
build a new software as a service that
I'm thinking about for youtubers because
- buddy sucks I was an IQ video sucks
socialblade is okay is good for stats
but it doesn't give the user somebody
who also our YouTube channel the right
thing so I'm building to myself now you
know what I mean so you gotta as a
developer - like once you guys know all
this stuff you know somebody sent me a
message the other day I think like the
day before yesterday he said hey Joe I
know HTML CSS and JavaScript should I do
the backend yes that shouldn't even be a
