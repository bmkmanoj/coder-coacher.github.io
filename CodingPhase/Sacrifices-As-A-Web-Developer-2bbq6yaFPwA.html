when I went up coming up of work madly
the only ones that came into work for
you know Memorial Day the developers
right how convenient
guys listen I just want to say sometimes
you got to do kind of doing and freaking
make sacrifices you know sometimes you
just you gotta bust your ass even after
you get the job
like right now you got some sacrificing
a lot you guys are you know taking time
off to learn how to code take courses
when you to me take courses on whatever
team treehouse take courses on coke atom
II watch my videos watch other youtubers
like it takes a lot to become a web
developer or software engineer or
whatever a program or a coder whatever
you want to call yourself right it takes
a lot but I just want to the guys know
to you know like this shit is gonna pay
off at the end you know like what wasn't
like a few years ago I wasn't even you
know I didn't have no money on Mia I was
broke like you know now I'm good I'm
living good I'm living the life you know
like I'm good
I don't have to go to a specifics but
I'm good guys like I really good now I
know people who are even better than me
but that's because they're freaking
they've been in this industry for like
almost ten years you know I know people
who are working in retail who have 10 12
almost 15 years and you know they
fucking they don't have nothing
they don't have a pot to piss in like
and it's not their fault it's just the
industry that they're in you know so and
they make sacrifices and shit just
doesn't pay off like here this this
opportunity that I got you know to
become a web developer like I don't take
it for granted I'll be here being on
training like even right now I'm super
tired I'm the only one that came into
work me and my boy Joe came into work we
have to finish this website before it
was supposed to be released by Monday we
decided to push it another two days so
it's going to be released tomorrow night
pretty much like you know we we bust our
ass but we get paid very well you know
it's not just like we're doing this shit
for fun you know it's funny what you're
learning but once you're working and
working for a company you got those
extra hours work
what OH
I'm just glad
I'm program or web developer whatever
you want to call me and I'm very
grateful if now who knows what I would
be Reyna right now I swear like I see a
couple of my friends like living in
brooms like they still living with
roommates or they fucking you know they
live in a very shitty apartment in an
area where you walk around you'll know
if you're gonna get shot you don't know
if you're gonna get robbed like I live
like in a super nice neighborhood
super chill you know I Drive something
good you know like it's not like I'm out
here looking like a bum you know what I
mean and all this shit is just because
of web development and I think for you
guys like this message is for for those
that wanna get Exodus and they're like
man I don't see the payoff because I'm
busting my ass every day trying to learn
this thing and then they don't see a
payoff at the end they don't see
something at the end of the tunnel then
I go man I'm doing so much work I'm
doing you know color was a coke Adam II
you to me whatever it is that you you're
doing out here you know so I just want
to give you a little motivation today
you know cuz right now I just came out
of work I'm dead tired but I just
thought about it I was like man I'm
actually just be grateful like I'm
grateful that that you know I got this
job I'm good like how many guys are
coming out of the fucking job and they'd
be like oh man I only earn fuckin after
taxes $50 $70 after taxes a lot of
people leave out of work like that
and you know to me I already told you I
think per hour every human being should
get $500 an hour
that's automatically but it's not
realistic nobody's going to pay you that
unless you like you're a superstar or
whatever you know you're you own your
own business right but I just think like
you know like I should just be grateful
and you know because I am you know I'm
fucking I'm good I just did mad hours I
came into work on a day where nobody
works literally nobody works the roads
aren't empty nobody is outside there's
like two or three people and right now
look at that so much space between cars
you're gonna see a car right now another
car you see there's not that many people
usually this right here is pack this
highway right here is definitely packed
you know what I mean so that means
everybody's chilling hanging out with
their families doing barbecues doing you
know chilling me what am i doing I'm
coding I'm working I'm releasing a
fucking website but all that shit pays
off because in the long term
like people's got a seat and they're
gonna be like you know what this kid he
came into work you know even on the days
that he shouldn't have and he knocked
shit out here's a little bonus it's a
little ten thousand you know a little
ten thousand dollar bonus which it's not
it's not weird to you know for a lot of
people as people who just get five
thousand ten thousand dollar bonus I
want that this year I want a little ten
thousand bonus you know what I mean so
it's just extra hours extra work and
it's the same thing for you guys you
know at first led to you not to you know
get you amped up get you height for no
reason like
that you get a new job or every time
that you get something like a loan a
little step up like your step up sing
and web development are high like
there's barely any industry that you can
say every time that I got a raise is
$10,000 raise or $15,000 raise not
everybody can say that you know most
people get a 3% raise so that means if
you're earning like fucking $40.00 in a
year you might get $500 you might if the
the owners is happy with you or he wants
to be nice to you sometimes it takes you
two years to get a raise for me every
year has been raising 15 15 15 and it
keeps going the sky's the limit for me
you know what I mean so I want you guys
to to take that in and when you're doing
those little coding challenges that I
tell you you like man why am i doing
this shit for you - why am I doing this
little coding challenge is why am I
doing this tutorials online because
there's a payoff man and you know for
order all of you guys who are young who
are like 18 17 from 17 to 23 all of you
guys right yeah super young right now
right think about it like this the time
that you put into video games the time
that you put into hanging out with your
friends time that you put into just
having fun with like you know what your
friends whatever a family shit like no -
it pays off
I'll be honest like it's like right now
all my friends from high school I don't
see them
I don't hang out with them if I had
somebody yo can somebody lend me $50
nobody's gonna come and give it to me so
what does that tell you that tells you
that that time that you're spending with
people you could doing something
productive you know a lot of people say
all the time like yellow you always talk
about money but unfortunately without
money you're nobody
you don't have you can live your life
you can't live your life to the maximum
being broke you can't like it sucks
being worried about how you're gonna pay
your bills it sucks being worried about
how you're gonna survive you guys are
young right now you guys don't know
about that like right now I'm 29 I feel
like I'm still young no I'm just 29 but
at the same time it's like I thank God
that I woke up at some point you know
like I didn't wake up until I was 24 25
years old I could have been doing this
in 17 since 16 that's what I'm saying
for you guys late you guys got a step up
your game take this shit serious learn
how to code create cool shit and like I
said even anything in technology any
type of Korean technology you're gonna
be fine you know this is the future this
is where everything is going to be at so
that hanging out with your friends
playing video games
good money man hanging out with your
friends all the time it's not going to
pay off at all those people you will
never see again the girlfriends that you
have right now most likely you don't
need to have that girl around you
anyways cause she adopt you know what I
mean like now penguin now but um I'm
just saying though like if if you got a
girlfriend man use 18 19 years old 20
years old you don't need to be worrying
about that stop trying to give that girl
mad time give that girl's 20 minutes out
of the day do what you got to do send
her home go back to coding you know what
I mean like that's how I look at it you
know what I mean so start coding get
your money you know live good man
that's all I'm saying you gotta live
good so all this shit that you're doing
right now is just sacrifices you know
everybody gotta do it how you think all
those guys that that are rich that came
from the bottom those guys did not get
there by themselves then guys they got
there by just doing sacrifices you know
you gotta bust your ass work hard and
then it pays off because you got to
think about it like this how many people
would love to be just chillin and
hanging out and just chill in the house
without doing up everybody wants to do
it everybody just wants to chill and
hang out but how many people want to
work not that many right so the people
that want to work are the ones that
become successful that's it's that
simple guys no
you do your work and paste off now of
course you got to do your work in
something that that matters you know
it's like right now if you want to
become a a fucking where is it
anthropologist wasn't high college a
fucking guy looking for dinosaurs and
shit that shit does not piss off at all
oh hi collection entre policies what's
the neighborhood that shit I forgot man
I'm fuckin tired but if you want to be
out here looking for dinosaurs like man
you wasting your time that shit on paint
look it up online you want to be
associated talking to people and finding
out share by society that shit don't pay
either you know you want to be a fucking
gym teacher that shit don't pay either
you know you want to become a witch what
else you want to become you want to
become some shit I don't know you wanna
fucking and I already said gym teacher I
don't know what was another shit that
I've heard people tell me man I'm trying
to remember to shake that people told me
before and then I'm like that's why you
fucking broke that's why you don't got
no money cuz you want to become that
shit you want to become a cop
go ahead be fucking broke cops are broke
those fucking people they're broke
do something with your life something
that matters you know somebody told me
the other day met you know I might I
might just you know apply to the the
fucking City and try to get out I was
like a garbage man job in you know
fucking they get great benefits you know
twenty years they're retired and it's
like why the fuck would I want to become
a garbageman like what status do you get
in society out of that shit like and not
to bring it down it's just like if
you're gonna fucking bust your ass for
twenty years you're gonna fuck up your
back you're gonna wake up every single
day at five o'clock in the morning it
better be for something that you could
say I'm proud of I'm not gonna go and
tell somebody oh yeah I work for the
city I'm a garbage man now you ain't
gonna see me saying this shit you know
what I mean if I'm gonna do something
imma bust my ass I'm of like yo I'm a
doctor I'm an engineer I'm a lawyer I'm
something that is great you know you're
not gonna just choose anything just
because like oh yeah man when I was a
little kid I just wanted to become a
fucking you know whatever I don't know
whatever you fucking think it is like
Bossier ass but bus you asks for
something that's worth it you know guys
I want to become basketball players
football players man that's like a
lottery
you're putting your your faith into a
lottery system that's why I was told all
my friends who play ball I'm like bro
you got to do something with your life
you can't be out here just playing ball
and you think you're gonna go to the
majors what do all those fucking guys do
then I'll do learn I know one that is
like an assisting to like office he's
basically a secretary doesn't make no
money
fucking always fucking talking about oh
man I came and got a job right now I can
get a car I'm trying to get a car and
this and that I'm like
you've been saying you're trying to get
a car in almost ten years if I'm if it
takes me 10 years to fucking buy myself
a car what your car you could go on
Craigslist and buy yourself a decent car
for twenty five hundred dollars if you
cannot get twenty five hundred dollars
together that means you're doing
something wrong period
you know Lamesa
I'm just saying guys the sacrifices man
I'll do sacrifices all day you know what
I want to be doing right now I'm going
to be doing YouTube I want to be hanging
out with you guys but what am i doing
gonna work busting my ass you know
that's how I look at it you know what I
mean so for you guys to sacrifices to it
instead of hanging out instead of a
channel all the time instead of just
watching my videos because yeah watch my
videos but watch my videos and then also
to code also to create projects also do
tutorials which it passes me off that
people don't do the tutorials here or
even follow the videos or if you don't
want to follow my videos cool but at
least buy one of the courses that I tell
you if not going YouTube and find
another youtuber who has good tutorials
the way that you like it right but all I
want you to do is code I don't care what
you do it from team tree house coke atom
II you to me Coursera Pluralsight
wherever it is that you're going but I
want you to learn how to code I want you
to bust you ass and just get it done
guys it's not that hard
like I'm telling you just do you do what
you got to do and that's sane
yeah man I see you guys man um I see you
Freddie quell okay today we know what's
got kick greatness always in here
without without max Opie climbing
climbing what up love what up Orlando
Kyle okay Reynoso leave me away Dom
scoops what the hell time schools okay
that's a weird name
let me see who else is in here Stefan
Europe what up all my people in Europe
I'm going out there pretty soon
climb man who else your boy can of
course that's good to see you in here
can man I'm glad you're surviving right
now right
hopefully you you're doing the projects
and hopefully you over here you know
taking some type of courses to learn how
to code and continue you know continue
coding man and start applying for jobs
don't just stay home you know thinking
that jobs is going to come to you you
better be busting your ass and start
applying apply for jobs man angel
without digital jazz what up
let me see who else is in here we got a
lot of people in here man Big Coal what
up are you flying home big coat oh I I
see you I see you boy
you are here doing fake kids Joe my
daughter Cal okay
yo li'l a idea delay is a dominicano
delay I can tell okay and moneyto L
monotone your king or you'll you dick
sad truth money isn't everything but
it's very important yes that's what
that's what sucks you know what I mean
like I keep telling people that you know
every time that I talk about money it's
not about the fact like oh my god you
gotta get a million dollars to become
rich and this and that no it's because
money makes your life a little bit more
comfortable money's not going to make
you happy
money's gonna make your life a little
bit more comfortable life is already
hard by itself that's all I'm saying
so you working at a job that's not gonna
get you anywhere that's not gonna help
you out it's not gonna help you or your
family or not do anything for you you
know what I mean like I'm just saying if
you're gonna bust your ass bust your ass
for something good you know something is
gonna pay off and as you can see
programming helped me it has helped many
people plenty of people I have so many
people that I hear the stories online
you know and they tell me oh man I'm
doing good I'm doing this and I just got
my first job I've never made this much
in my first job like people were excited
you know people are getting their lives
together and that's because they learn
how to code you know especially for for
a lot of people who who don't have a
college degree who are just like you
know for whatever reason these people
who don't have the luxury to go to a
college they had a kid early they had on
you know they had to take care of their
family whatever it was right sometimes
you don't have that option you don't
have that option to say hey you know
Little John got to go to MIT Little John
got to go to you know however sometimes
a lot of us
don't get those chances I don't so all
I'm saying is for you guys is bust your
ass learn how to code which is a great
industry plus they actually like they
actually let you get in without a degree
you're this close to making as much as a
doctor right without a degree
Vicco thank you bro you always hold on
your boy down and I really appreciate it
but yeah man so that's what I'm saying
man um by the way big coat man we need
to get in contact as I want you to come
in for the the podcast I'm bringing the
podcast back so I need you to be on it
all right you gotta send me through
Instagram what time's your available and
I'll set something up because now I'm
actually doing podcasts which are you
know one at a time one person at a time
so be like a 20 minute interview with
just one person I'm not doing that with
three more people or four people I used
to do it because now I want to focus on
just one person share the story of that
person to everybody here and like you
know talk about your journey as a
developer you know but yeah man like I
was saying like you guys gotta bust your
ass man you're this close to earning as
much as a doctor right a doctor got to
go to school for almost ten years right
some doctors even longer than that right
now you have the opportunity to get into
the ends in this industry without no
degree because all they care about is
that you can actually code can you code
can you build a website and I'm not
talking about all fuckin Google Facebook
forget those like let's be honest those
companies a lot of times think I don't
need somebody with a degree right but
what Trump's a degree what goes over a
degree is experience
right if you have to experience you say
hey I have two years working in major
companies I have a whole bunch of
projects and I can you know display my
skills the proper way so this you know
our recruiter for Google Facebook
whatever company you fill in the name of
the company right if you have to
experience you'll get hired you don't
need a degree so you you know what I
mean like you went from you know having
whatever 40 50 thousand dollars a year
to having twice or almost three times as
much as you or you earn before 120 150
grand
all right out of nowhere and then you're
almost right there Kludd this close from
the doctor who has to spend ten years of
his life to become a doctor I'm just
saying now of course like I would say to
people that's not the limit you know
like once you become a senior developer
that's not the limit that's not the the
last part of the ceiling right you know
you can just become so many other parts
of of the industry like you you could
become a architect you become like a
somebody who are does project management
like this woman so many avenues like you
could still grow after you become a
software that senior software developer
or senior web developer there's so many
avenues after that that you could
navigate and say okay I want to become a
project manager that I want to become a
lead a UI designer and lead UI developer
or fucking was it wasn't in my way the
fuck I forgot but it's like a million
fucking different jobs after that after
becoming a senior developer so sky's the
limit and then from that if you're smart
and you're like you have something in
your brain because you got understand
this
if you have a low something on your
brain back there of creativity you can
create your own project your own product
that you can sell to other people
you could create a plugin you could
create a phone app you can create your
own store you can create so many other
things that brings in other income aside
from your own job so now you're talking
about
if you earning 120k you can make another
50k from shit on the side or you can
make even another 100k because now you
have another business that you're making
money off or you know other things that
you're doing in your life so all of that
is coming in because of your sacrifices
that you did in the beginning you know
your big Cola see you later man stay in
contact I see you but yeah so all of
that is done because of your sacrifices
you know all of this shit is not gonna
come to you sitting in front of my TV
and watching you know whatever fucking
Netflix you know even though Netflix and
chill is always good you know what I
mean so that's what I'm saying
but I'm just saying though you know
Netflix and chill is always good you can
never go wrong with that but so much of
Netflix and chill you know you got to do
something else to him and that she's not
bringing in no money in your pocket you
know hello from Morocco without what up
I mean enough flicks t-shape
yeah man Ilan I'm glad that you you know
you you enjoying you know you busting
ass you doing eight to ten hours a day
that's what I was doing when I first
started when I say you know what man
i'ma quit my job and like my girlfriend
could show you guys like she was there
through the whole ride when I say y'all
you know what imma fuckin become a
developer I started studying every
single day in my house and then I got a
little bullshit web developer job it
wasn't even what developer it was like
web developer related like I wasn't even
know what developer there it was what
development related right so I'm just
saying like you guys can bust your ass
and just getting get this shit and trust
me you know I wish you guys the best and
like I always tell you guys like I'm
here for you guys for whenever today I'm
gonna record a couple of videos the rest
of the videos for the week I'm probably
gonna release another video today umm
reason why I'm doing this video is
because I didn't get to do my web
developers lunch break videos that I do
because I was at work today I didn't
have lunch break today that's what I
said you know what man I gotta create a
video about sacrifices like I fucking
did some sacrifice this is dang I didn't
even eat you know ya got me out here
like an Ethiopian right now I even get
to eat you know so and I don't want
nobody hating on me sorry for everybody
who's from Ethiopia because you say
anything about anybody even if it's a
joke they get pissed off they be like oh
man why are you talking shit about
Ethiopia we eat all the time here I'm
like okay man that was his junk man
where people's messed up here damn you
working during Memorial Day I'll email
you some barbecue report crazy but yeah
man I will see you guys later man
stay up watch the the video tonight I
don't know if I should release another
tutorial or I should release another
advice or answer into somebody's
questions so I don't know it might be
random alright guys I'll see you guys
later
