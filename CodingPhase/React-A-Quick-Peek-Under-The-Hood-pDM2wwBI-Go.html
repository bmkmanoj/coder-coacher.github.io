the hood there's the section where we're
going to talk about how is react working
how is react showing up on our page
alright so first of all we gott
understand the project folder alright so
what we have here is a folder that's
already built for you guys to pretty
much hit the ground running rain now you
have everything from sass to react -
gulp - wet pack so es6 basically
everything that you need to start
working as far as you know the new
modern JavaScript and the new modern web
flow of a developer alright right now
and you don't have to worry about this
in the sense of you you don't have to
build it from scratch right at some
point later on I will show you how to
build it from scratch so like that you
can understand how to basically change
your your build system to however you
want it alright so the first thing that
we're gonna start with is basically
talking about the folders okay so we
have assets folder the assets folder
holds the JavaScript folder this is
where your components are going to be
right and then inside of this JavaScript
folder for every component like let's
say if I'm working on an application I
will create a folder for that component
alright and then inside of it I will
name the component exactly what the
folder is alright so that's like the
index of the component right the home of
the component okay now then we have sass
of course assets just pretty much CSS
which has a little extra features to
make our lives easier okay
then from there we have no modules this
is where all the packages that we
downloaded remember when we ran NPM
install all those packages pretty much
is like a bunch of libraries put
together for us to
on everything that we're running right
now all right so all those files are are
hold are being hold right here being
held being held right here no modules
right now basically then we have a
public folder the public folder is what
the people see the public folder is what
the user sees all this stuff is behind
the scenes everything that's here is
behind the scenes when you go to a
website google.com you see the homepage
of Google but you don't see all the
files that are behind the scenes so
think about it like that
all right so public is where we hold our
images public is where we hold our
compiled CSS our compiled JavaScript and
of course our index page pretty simple
okay now let's talk about how is you
know JavaScript being compiled how is
es6 being compiled all right so we have
gulp right so gulp is a task manager
this is what we have as different tasks
ok this is where we come in we say ok
hey gulp or run watch or what what we
did in the beginning which was NPM run
watch what is actually doing is just
saying go watch that's it it's nothing
too crazy so it's watching every file
here and then doing the action depending
on when it changes so like let's say if
we save a file if we come here and we
say first component right let's come
here to localhost 3000 let's say we come
here we say 2019 ok save that you're
gonna see that this changes and you can
see here on the terminal
what's going on if we come in and change
it to 20 and we click command S or ctrl
s if your are windows automatically its
okay starting webpack is saving and
basically it reloads the page okay all
right so that's what's going on with
gulp now as far as web pack what pack is
basically a module module loader
basically what it does is it loads the
modules for you
so basically and you get to have
different options to compile it alright
and we're using babel something called
Babel which compiles our JavaScript from
the es6 which is the new version of
javascript to the older version that the
browser can read all right so I'm gonna
take this I'm a copy all of this code
and I'm going to go to be able jes okay
so let's say right here we're gonna
paste this here as you can see what's
happening is basically we say okay
import react import component import
from react right now we say import react
on from react Dom right now think about
it like this basically all of the stuff
is es6 right and this stuff from here to
here is called GS x which is JavaScript
which is like HTML inside of JavaScript
alright so think about it like that it's
pretty simple when we use babel babel
compiles this code that we have here
into regular javascript as you can see
we're basically using a return to say
something like this like okay react to
default create element div right that's
regular JavaScript right create element
div and then we pass in a class name of
home and then inside of it we're saying
hey we're creating another div right
what a class of a liner
and as you can see that's exactly what's
going on here all right now all of this
stuff it can get a little bit
complicated but in reality you don't
have to understand everything just know
that pretty much you have es6
which is the new JavaScript and it's
being compiled
thanks to Babel so basically the old
version of JavaScript okay vanilla
JavaScript for now that's all you need
to know all right
later on we will continue and we won't
come back to this right now this is just
like a quick overview of what's going on
under the hood a quick little overview
all right
so think about it like that we're taking
our old well the new JavaScript into the
old JavaScript and that's what's being
compiled now when we come here to public
javascript and then we come to
components you will see a component that
says first cup this is the same
JavaScript us here but in vanilla
JavaScript if we open this up you can
see it's all the vanilla JavaScript here
all right
okay guys so now what I want you guys to
focus on is I'll react itself everything
else is secondary because you gotta get
into the framework and there from there
learn as you go the other tools that you
need for the froward all right I'll see
you guys in the next video and yeah
let's get started back at it again man
conan face.com listen this whole course
right here that you are watching here on
YouTube is part of a larger course man
as part of the the big picture guys is
part of the five projects that's gonna
get you hired now you guys have seen the
video that I created basically going
over every single project that you need
to build guys
if you do this and react pretty much
you're you're set right now I'm actually
going to take my time I'm going to build
all of those five projects for you guys
so you guys can build this with me and
you can use this for your portfolios
guys major websites this is major heat
guys all right just go to Conan freeze
calm register guys subscribe if you guys
don't want to wait for this course to
somehow be released on YouTube come to
the website you can watch it right now
you don't have to wait I'll see you guys
later
