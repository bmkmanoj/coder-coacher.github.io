want our rival Pokemon
whoever's our you know enemies Pokemon
to be something different than what we
have
so if we have Charmander we don't want
to battle charm and again and we want to
batter one of this two guys all right so
what we're going to do is we're going to
do a do-while loop so let me say
something like this like - right and
then we're going to take this code which
is the code that chooses which is the
rival Pokemon Rihanna cut that and paste
it inside of it right and then we're
going to say down here do while and then
we can say game state that user Pokemon
equals two rival Pokemon all right so we
have a game stick that riser poker that
were useful for all right so what this
is going to do is it's going to run
through this code and it's going to
repeat it every single time that
basically the users Pokemon and the
rival pokemons names are the same so if
I choose Charmander is going to do it
one more time because we already made
the Charmander a equals to the same
thing so then I'm gonna say okay so I'm
gonna run this code again one more time
until I get something different than
Charmander
so what we're going to do is we're going
to cancel out this so we can actually
see that in action so let's say we'll
see looping all right
sorry put some some quotes around this
looping and then you're gonna say game
states that ride will Pokemon so let's
see what it looks like
alright so it's new pen squirtle so once
I got to squirtle let's say it said ok
it's fine let's do it one more time
see Lubin Charmander 2 times so it means
a game of Charmander 2 times and
basically it kept going around say ok
one time Charmander ok it equals the
same thing as to use its Pokemon so
let's do it one more time
looped again and said Charmander again
and then I say let's do it one more time
and then once it equals something
different like squirtle then I stopped
looping and then from there the code can
continue on remember that we did this in
the innate this is what we use game
state that CPU pick so when we click on
one of these icons to choosing Pokemon
right we click on that we choose a
Pokemon then from there we have two
users pokemons name and then we get to
choose the CPU pick so it's going to be
stuck here it's going to keep on looping
until it finds a different Pokemon you
know that doesn't equal to the user
Pokemon so soul is about that then it
continues on to the rest of the code
that's down here right so yeah man
that's one way to do this in I'll see
you guys in the next video this was just
a pretty quick video just to get it up
and going and make sure that we don't
get the same Pokemon and now we just
continue battling and then yeah hey guys
it's simple jump back at it again guys
this is video that you saw is actually
part of my course future-proof
javascript listen guys you're gonna
learn
javascript the right way the money wait
the easy way the way that you're going
to understand it I know you tried to
treehouse I know you try you know you
try you too
it's fine but you guys know me
ya know how to basically nobody is going
to explain JavaScript the way that I do
and I'm making it easy for anybody who
wants to get better with JavaScript or
people who are just starting from
scratch right so you have to cause here
man check it out and now only go from
Conan face calm but you will go directly
from the link that's on my description
which will give you a 50% off
automatically for the personal original
price okay and if you're really really
smart with it you will actually do the
all-access pass right for ten dollars
right that's what I would do it for $10
get access to all the courses you can't
go wrong guys all right so I'll see you
guys around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
