tired me how long it takes me from here
to my house well from here to my house
I'm here to work alright okay question
of the day is is Ruby on Rails dead and
I will say know why because Ruby on
Rails lives on through every application
out there any application that's being
built through a framework either laravel
either mean stack either django either
whatever any any framework that's out
there even the rocky stack is almost 100
percent influenced by Rovio rails in one
way or another right that's one reason
why I will say Ruby on Rails is not that
another one
Ruby on Rails has the best documentation
of like all the frameworks so doesn't
matter what framework you're using if
you wouldn't know about stuff like
relationships you know how to set up
your database how to have a really good
or o RM then you have to look at the
documentation of Ruby on Rails right now
are there jobs for Ruby on Rails
developer yes they are there's a lot of
jobs for Ruby and rails developers but
you have to be like almost senior level
you can't just show up you know and be
like hey guys I want to do Ruby and no
it doesn't work like that
not any more because pretty much a lot
of new companies are using other
technologies like no J yes go so those
are that's where pretty much the new
company and new startups are showing
that bad right but when it comes down to
Ruby on Rails there's not that many new
companies popping up anymore you know
and it's a shame because it's not that
Ruby on Rails is bad it's just that
people they think they're gonna get to
the level of having like Twitter
problems you know get into the levels of
having you know like a Facebook problem
but the reality is that most companies
won't get to that level so you don't
need anything else besides Ruby on Rails
but you know everybody wants to aim high
and that's fine
but when you think about it how many
companies out here are on the level of
Facebook on the level of Google
of Twitter and Twitter is really like a
little quarter not even a quarter is
maybe like 10% of what Facebook has no
matter of fact 30% because they got
thing 300 million users on Twitter and
Facebook got nothing like a billion
something right so when you think about
it and you really really think about it
what company do you think is gonna make
it to that level there's not that many
that's gonna make it there right so if
you have an e-commerce website you want
to sell whatever sneaker so you want to
sell whatever or you have a real-estate
most of the time you're not gonna have
the same traffic as those big websites
coming in so having a website built on
Ruby and rails is fine
it's actually gonna make you more
productive than you know then using any
other technology because any other
technology you have to basically build
different scratch when you're using
something like Java there's a couple of
frameworks for most of the time you have
to build everything from scratch
Rovio rail has almost everything you
could do scaffolding you could set up
the database in a way where it's easier
for you to code you could put
relationships you know so for me Ruby on
Rails I know it's not that because it
lives on through every other application
that's out there where Ruby on Rails
came out and everybody was jumping on it
everybody was okay that's it there's a
new cool kid on the block we have to
learn it and then on top of that if you
guys have a mess around with Ruby or now
that you guys are gonna mess around with
Crystal Lang with me
you're gonna see how easy it is to
basically program and grow me your
crystal right it's super easy because
it's like speaking English you know it's
not like let's say you want to look
through something you can just say hey X
times five whatever right so now give
you no loop something five times
in other languages you have to make the
loop yourself you have to say hey for I
equals zero and then I is less than 11
and then I plus plus and then from there
your loop was kind of run all right so
basically better invitations is cleaner
code it makes more sense
plus it's object-oriented so everything
is an object and yeah it's pretty legit
now like I said before some people say
hey that Ruby on Rails is is dead but
it's not guys at all it's not that if
you're a ruby developer and you know
your you're gonna find a good job
most of the jobs of Ruby developers are
a hundred thousand plus automatic
because people who use Ruby on Rails
know what the hell they doing when it
comes to web development
they know everything from the you know
the full-stack
so definitely it's not that now for
brand new developers it might not be
good because you gotta think about it
there's not that many companies that are
gonna take the risk of hiring somebody
who doesn't know anything who was like a
brand new developer and say oh yeah this
person only has six months in his house
making websites and we're gonna hire him
for be a real developer it's not going
to be that easy
you know but it is definitely out there
guys so I would say no it's not daddies
it's one of the best languages out there
one of the best frameworks that's out
there it's just now with how technology
is growing and the new trends of you
know concurrency and everybody wants to
say hey I have to the fastest language
out here everybody wants to say hey I
could do 1,000 users in one shot I could
do 10,000 50,000 users in one shot but
the reality of things is most companies
are not gonna get to that level most
companies don't get to that level to
have 50,000 users at the same time
it just doesn't happen
and also the oldest is absolutel
developer it's like I said every
programming language every framework is
just a tool so create a project create a
website create a web application how big
your your project is going to be you
decide to use whatever tool is
appropriate
you know some but it's definitely not
that if you look online there's like a
whole bunch of jobs it's just not that
easy to get the jobs because most of the
people that they know Ruby on Rails
they're very qualified and people know
that so they pay them very good so for
brand new developers if it's not that
great all right all right so let me sit
here you haven't heard that in a long
time yeah
whatever everybody
and I rarely see Ruby unrealistic I mean
it is listed out there plus one thing
that you have to understand if you know
Ruby over else everything else is easy
because everything every other framework
every other language somehow they copy
what Ruby on Rails hand if you know Ruby
or else you basically know that if
you're not Ruby on Rails you basically
know yourselves Jas it's like it's the
same
they all copy Ruby on Rails they just
happened to be in a different
programming language but besides that
they pretty much copied everything but
yeah we're missing
what service up Chicago
so sad
bang-bang
every time I do a pooja cameraman and
you know I don't know chief keef
for some reason
let me see let me see - Japan what I
went out when I went up
how is it Ohio's Thomas I think it's oh
hi osama's whatever konnichiwa
konnichiwa he got oh hey do you know
what the Japanese real quick
yah my roommate he was from Japan my boy
you know how yeah super cool kid
my son is his name is gonna be Kenji I
love the Japanese culture
I feel like I'm very influenced by
Japanese yeah Milo Kenji underway kin G

there and London's gonna be like hey boy
and with the chapter Cheerios you know I
love English people man they super
called British
yeah man whatever without without
without met
I wonder one wolf I wonder which will
come first
kenji your coding phrase doc Oh God
I've been trying to finish it man Oh God
you know it's like I'm putting myself on
us then I work on coding phase calm I'm
supposed to do the podcast I haven't
done the podcast in like a week or two
but it's because I've been trying to
just do so much stuff that I'm gonna
leave the podcast after I finished the
whole thing of mentorship right once I
finished that then I'm gonna come back
to the podcast but for now that's gonna
be on hold podcasters on hold coding
phase calm I'm working on it I just I
gotta do it two days out of the week I
can't do it every single day because
then I wouldn't be able to do you two
you know what I mean yeah but a lot of
people keep hitting me up like oh man
like you know you should freaking you
gotta do this Koni face calm and we want
to register we want to register man I
want to set you guys up I really do I
just got a duel everything else so at
the same time somehow I wish you know I
really wish man if I had like a hundred
thousand subscribers man
I will freaking literally I will quit my
job and just to list full time like 100%
full time because I love doing this and
I want to help more people I want to do
more tutorials I want to do focus on
coding phase calm I want to get to help
more people you know I'll be cool to do
like meetups all over the country like
if I was to to do this like full-time I
will go to meetups all over the country
cuz I keep getting killed you know
invites of people telling me oh we gotta
meet up here in LA you gotta meet up in
Louisiana we gotta meet up in Florida we
gotta meet up in in Texas so what I
would do is I would do like you know
code the country man is freaky and today
yeah I'm doing too much at the same time
I'm gonna I'm gonna try to cut down like
dust for real
i'ma just focus on : face car and
YouTube that's it the mentorship program
for the experiment that I'm doing is
just it's just like something giving
back to the peoples you know
but yeah man I got my little fruits for
the morning good morning you gotta have
your breakfast kids
all right got Miami in here what up
Keith
Oh word we don't made it to South Korea
boys whoo
okay what the hell are you doing in
South Korea probably over here teaching
English blowing back South Jersey Jersey
without wood up
my boy my boy keeps swinging out there
you touchdown man touchdown in South
Korea you're a superstar out there and
then I've been wanting to go over there
I need to touch down for real man so bad
I'm like married now I should have
touched down when I was single man
man learn the Python and JavaScript now
it's not that guys it's dead in
promotion that's one thing for sure
people are not trying to promote it at
all but it's because there's so many
other cool things you gotta understand
every year is gonna be something cool
like right now I'm talking about crystal
Ling I'm actually ahead of my time and
this is why I'm doing it because nobody
else is doing it yet I'm literally the
first one with a flag of crystal lang
you know everybody else there right now
they're still on nodejs they're still on
gold they're still on your lick sir
right but 2018 2019 is gonna be like
crystal lang all over I guarantee you
guys that right and that's because
that's how things work like like I think
elixir came out in 2011 or something
like that right and it started getting
popular in 2015 now we're in 2017 it's
like super popular everybody is talking
about it but people have already been
making websites with it crystal Lang is
at the same stage that elixir was in
2011 well 28:13 around that 2013 where
it's like it's about to blow up but it's
still not there yet
so whoever's are whoever other people
that get there first
those are the guys that get to to get
the the winnings at the end you know
those are the guys that get the gold at
the end of the rainbow that's what I'm
telling you guys learn crystal language
me I guarantee you is gonna pay off
you're gonna be ahead of the curve when
this thing hits big by the end of the
year beginning of next year you're gonna
basically half a year ahead of everybody
else right plus like I told you guys
when you know one programming language
you know all of them
because every other programming language
is just syntax it might have a little
something else that's different
but everything else you already know it
you already know what a variable is here
and you know what a loop is you already
know what a switch teaming is you know
what an effing else statement like once
you know all those things you know every
other language you know so that's one of
the reasons why you know Christian name
because there's no point there's not
really no point of me trying to teach
you guys no Jes when there's a million
other people teaching no GS right
there's no point of me there's no point
of me teaching you elixir because
there's so many other people teaching an
elixir so I have to teach you something
that's gonna make me totally separate
separate myself from everybody else
makes me different and at the same time
it's gonna help me out because I love
the language and it's one of the best
thing about teaching other people is
that you get to learn something really
really well
sorry guys I'm even got them great and
you know how grapes got seeds and
man I miss you
Thunder the second project today it was
struggling for like an hour with the
icons now it turns out I had to use a
float yeah
hipsters I move away from Ruby - no
actually hipsters are moving from so
elixir what's happening is more people
are talking about node in the blogs and
on YouTube videos but that's not that's
not what really happens in the industry
that's another thing too that I always
tell people guys what happens on YouTube
what happened some blogs what happens on
websites like cycling calm or hash no
calm that already that's not really
what's going on in the industry that's
more of like people that want to come
here and share their opinions but that's
not really what's going on in the
industry now when you think about it
it's like this how many of you guys will
want to be in front of camera like me
right now talking about these things a
lot of you guys wouldn't you know what I
want to be putting your face out here or
be here talking all the time right so
it's the same thing as in the industry
it's like only a very very few percent
of people are actually putting
themselves out there of making blocks
making videos so you cannot count that
as being the industry because it's not
you know when you see everybody talking
about nodejs da da da da no js' is cool
when it comes to like you know blogs and
everybody's talking about it
because it is a cool technology I love
JavaScript but is it how the industry is
going not really you know it's still
dominated by PHP c-sharp like no matter
what you do it's still dominated by it
you know there's too many companies
already with their websites building in
older technologies so you just go ahead
and switch
do I need to learn JavaScript to learn
crystal Ling know crystal is just a
regular programming language you know
that's one of the reason why I created
the Nawrocki stacking the tutorials that
I'm making on them because I'm gonna
teach you guys how you can learn one
language and that applies to everything
else you know all you need is one
language understand the counting the
concepts and then from there you're good
you don't need to learn everything else
let me see
let me see I know a guy who got a real
job by starting that's now the city of
the style he's making hi-hi cities yeah
of course if if you could do Ruby or
else you're gonna get paid very very
well but it's one of those industry that
they just don't want you know regular
developers if you're just like a regular
developer somebody who knows how to code
Ruby on Rails is not for you because
there's guys in there who are really
really talented who called Ruby on Rails
well Ruby every single day and they know
the language from front to back so it's
like you're competing now with like the
best of the best you know so for you as
a brand new developer to just get in
there it's hard
that's why I always tell people jump
into PHP because the level of developers
on PHP is so low guys that literally all
you need to know is how to make a loop
and you could become a PHP developer
that's how low it is where do I go to
learn Krystal lang well I'm making a
tutorials here man if you look at my go
on my channel or search crystal language
you're gonna see the videos that are
making
now you can use bootstrap a few walls
you can use whatever you were
he wanted you to go ahead to YouTube
let me know when you open up your
channel oh you know I'll help you
promote it help you get a couple of
views get you started you know unlike a
lot of people what when I first started
here I knew my channel was gonna be
great
I know what I could offer to the
community and nobody wanted to support
me nobody wanted to come show me love
and I was like okay cool I'm gonna do it
myself
you know and I'm still doing it by
myself you know sometimes I'll do a
little collaboration Chris Sean your boy
milk stars but at the same time I've
reached out to other people and like
they don't want to work so it's like
 you know what I mean I still
make more money than them which is funny
is like I don't have 50,000 subscribers
I don't have 100,000 subscribers and I
know that I make more money than them
because of how my business is and how
much you know I'm making my job and then
plus all other that I do on the
side so it's like I'm thinking about I'm
like these guys are idiots
if they don't want to collaborate cool
like my channels gotta grow no matter
what they're idiots you know so if you
open up your channel let me know man
Christel anus is a general-purpose
languages like you could do applications
on you could do CLI applications you
could do web application it's like a
real programming language it's not just
for the web it's like a pretty legit
language
once you know just the basics of
JavaScript you're ready to move on to
jQuery and everything else
ya know I tried I try to work with other
other youtubers but the reality of
things is like a lot of people here
they're not here for the community like
me I'm here for YouTube community I'm
here for the people that want to learn
how to code I'm here for the community
I'm not here as a business like most of
these guys that come here to make their
videos and then they they promote their
books they promote their that they
want to sell they promote their their
you know their mentorship they're like
oh $500 for our mentorship and it's like
what it's like it's kind of ridiculous
right charging people you know making a
whole bunch of money they don't make a
lot of money some of them don't make a
lot of money just from you know milking
people but me I come here as a youtuber
you know I don't come here and edit
things like you know if I stutter or
something I leave it if I the
words come out wrong or mispronounce it
I leave it I'm not here trying to make
myself seem like a professional you know
I'm not trying to make myself like a
professional trying to sell myself where
people is like oh he's a professional I
gotta buy a course for her like no and
even when I tell you guys about the
udemy courses those human courses are
not mines those unique courses are
courses that I took and the only reason
why I'm putting them out there is
because those courses are the courses
that I took that made me into a
developer you know what I mean and it's
like other people that that tell me that
I own I don't know there's other people
there's other youtubers I already heard
like two three youtubers that they want
to start promoting udemy courses because
you could make some money from promoting
udemy courses but the problem with that
for me is number one people are not
coming to you for you to meet courses
people are coming to you for selling you
or selling them a course you know people
are coming to you because that's what
you does that you know that's what made
you into a developer
like me when I play at the end of the
video and I hate check out the the
courses on the description of what made
me into a developer is because people
keep asking me Joe what course
is that what did you take to become a
developer what did you do what courses
do you take do you get a degree that you
do this and that I don't want to keep
answering the same you know what I
mean so that's why I put it at the end
of the video was like hey there's the
courses that I took
you either could believe me or not those
are the ones that I took and
then if you want to become a developer
this is what you got to do that's it I'm
not selling the course is like oh this
is my courses and when you buy the
courses you're supporting me to buy no
I'm just telling you like hey
take the courses because that's what
made me into a developer you know so
when I told all you know youtubers sue
is like hey man just
if you're gonna say you know if you're
gonna promote something or you gonna
tell people about it make sure that you
use it don't promote a bootcamp
if you've never been to a bootcamp
because that's the problem we're half of
where a lot of people is that the check
is nice it's good to get five hundred
dollars extra but then now you just
becoming a you know like a
cheque whore like you're here whoring
yourself for a check and it's like
people don't like that you know
people could read through that people
can read through you try to promote your
own book or people could read through
you trying to promote or your
course all the time like even if I make
a course I'm not even gonna
promote my course I'm gonna say one time
imma be like okay guys I created this
course whoever wants to buy the course
go ahead buy and that's a I'm not gonna
promote that course and every
 video because then now you're
just promoting your all the
time and people hate that I hate it
I hate when I go to a youtuber and it'll
be like I love the whole video and then
they're like promoting a
bootcamp which I know they never
been to the bootcamp you know it's like
you've never been there
why are you promoting it why are you
promoting a book that you never read why
are you promoting a course or are web
that you never took you know people are
come to my channel they know everything
I tell them is real it's not me
bullshitting yeah no it's definitely not
it's not wrong about making money money
is always good what's wrong is when you
make things your focus if you make
things your focus if if my name is
Johnny dang right my name is Johnny dang
and people know me from I guess playing
basketball right and they know me from
playing basketball why am I gonna start
promoting playing soccer when people
know that I've never played soccer in my
life you know it's like now you look
crazy it is not gonna work for you
because they know that's not what made
you into a basketball player you know so
it's the same thing and that's why I
tell people like you have to you have to
pay attention on what you're doing and
just be genuine as long as you're real
and you're not fake out here people's
gonna like you know
yeah I think you could promote this to
you guys I think you could promote your
courses yeah maybe promote a free
courses right if you got free courses
and then you're promoting the courses
that are actually how you call this now
are paid you could do that but you can't
you can't you can't make it your
whole business like I don't know that's
the difference that doesn't thing if
you're if your business is to make
courses like what's this guy's name
traversing media that's his business
that's what he does
this guy's not here for the community
he's not here to talk to people he's not
here to chat with people you don't know
nothing personal about him you don't
know if he got a family you don't know
where he lives he's just like a robot
that does tutorials and then he sells to
courses online on udemy or his own
website then yes that's fine because
that's what he does he's just here for
that but if you are youtuber and you
consider yourself a youtuber then it's
different you know cause it's like you
can't be mad at Nike Nike that has a
youtube channel and they promote
sneakers you know what I mean
but I will be mad at African Josh lone
who who's not a corporation
who's not a business and then all he
does is just promote promote promote
promote is a bro like what the man
you know
but yeah man I'll see you guys later man
cuz I gotta go to work
alright they're seeing you guys man we
got a good qua qua ting here sorry I
can't talk in the morning but yeah
peace I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
