back at it again coding fees.com your
boy is backing out and did it again guys
today's topic is Joe I can't find a job
in my area what am I doing wrong
ok so we're gonna talk about that right
now you guys this video is brought to
you by viewers like you and people that
support our website coding phase comm go
check it out over 20 courses in there
that's gonna guide you to become a
developer from the beginning to becoming
a pro alright guys so this is actually
part of my course where I go in and I
talk about life after learning to code
ok because it's easy for somebody come
in and tell you hey man here's the
courses here's what you gotta do and you
know it's like here you go
fly you know I was like you're a little
bird out here and you're trying to learn
how to flap your wings and it's like hey
here's a udemy course he is a course on
Jill's website years or whatever our
freakin website to learn to code but
here you go somehow survive in the world
guys that's why I created this course so
we're gonna go into it and I explain
exactly how to find a job in your area
no matter what okay
so the very first website you want to
start with is indeed.com
okay and D definitely has the most jobs
but there's a whole bunch of other
websites that have jobs that indeed
don't have because if you guys don't
know an employer has to pay a lot of
money to post inside of indeed.com okay
so let's come here
basically the whole comment that I got
offering a subscriber is thanks man I
watch all your videos I live in Tampa
I'm having hello well I guess it meant
I'm going through hell finding work do
you think I should move before you start
thinking about moving let's do the
research okay first of all is search for
Tampa Tampa Florida find jobs cool
differently we come here we put in HTML
okay now
one thing they I want you guys to
understand when you search HTML
automatically that means is a web
development job all right
so web developer position and that's
where you really want to start all from
okay now if you're looking for something
more specific like hey I want to become
a wordpress developer or hey I want to
find something like let's say you want
to be a web designer or you want to do
front-end development or you want to do
react then the other way instead of
doing it just like this through the
regular search what you want to do is
you want to come to advanced and let's
search for example we're gonna do this
we're gonna say set of HTML we're gonna
search for at least one of his words
words in the title so we're gonna say
react let's say specifically you're
looking for a react position okay
you're gonna put it here and you're
gonna click find jobs okay
automatically is you gonna see you guys
gonna start seeing different positions
for react in Tampa Florida right now
that's if you're looking specifically
for a react position if you're looking
for WordPress you will do this you see
WordPress okay and then you see which
ones are the WordPress positions that
you have in your area okay now let's say
if you want to be more general waiting
okay you gonna search something like
front-end okay you search stat and then
as you can see you're gonna start seeing
a whole bunch of jobs first of all you
want to start finding jobs above $35,000
okay you start seeing 30,000 twenty-five
dollars for $15,000 that means those are
not the jobs for web development that
could be something else that I picked up
by the keywords like you know front-end
desk or you know fernand desk developer
or something like that I picked it up so
you want to start looking where you
might see something like 35,000 up some
cities might start a hire you
I say hey I want to start at 50,000 at
60,000 so now you start you know
basically making things smaller you know
you just start putting things in order
okay now from here you start looking at
senior web developer forty-seven
thousand fifty five thousand dollars and
one thing that you're gonna notice is
guys just because you might see that hey
in San Francisco New York and freaking
Austin Texas
you know Colorado they paint $100,000
$120,000 over there that doesn't mean in
your area they're gonna pay you 120
thousand dollars your cost of living is
way cheaper than somebody who lives in
San Francisco or New York now like I
said you also have to start looking into
other things like is this your very
first job as a developer right if this
is the very first job you have to
actually come in and start thinking
about putting in the work and what do I
mean about that a lot of times companies
is not gonna trust you even if you might
have the skills you might have a pretty
decent portfolio unless your portfolio
is like wow like this guy knows
everything right unless you in that
situation a lot of times companies do
not want to hire you first okay so you
have to go out of your way to try to get
a certain position even if it's for
three months even if it's just for six
months okay take a lower pay it's fine
you know a lot of people come in and
tell your man you gotta get $100 an hour
you got a gay $80 an hour $60 an hour
like bro like when you are a junior
developer the reason why a lot of people
have such a hard time to find a job is
because they have such a higher
expectation they're like man as soon as
I finish this boot camp I'm gonna get
$100,000 when they don't get it then
they get upset when they finish the
course and are like I could get $80,000
and as a bro you just took a udemy
course you just took a course on a
website you have to prove yourself so
you have to actually come in
from the bottom yes some people come in
and you know they hit the ground running
they're like okay they they are lucky
they you know they had the right a place
that went to the right timing of things
and is like got higher and their first
job more power to them right I don't
plan on luck I make my own luck what
does that mean I work hard I come in and
say hey man if I'm not getting hired
anywhere what I'm going to do is I'm
gonna take a lower pay work there for
three to six months then from there
start applying to bigger jobs and bigger
companies and then from there now you
have that step in your resume that says
hey I was a developer in another company
right or you might come in and you say
hey I was a let's say product manager
right I see this all the time or let's
say for marketing and you was doing HTML
emails and that's all you was doing
right yeah it doesn't say developer but
you was working with websites and
working with HTML CSS and JavaScript on
that company you get what I'm saying
so don't let those things stop you you
know what I mean so we gotta continue
with this and looking for for other
places where to find jobs but I just
want to be honest with you guys a lot of
people have a lot of high expectations
and then they lose out on opportunities
you know what I mean like this isn't a
place where they just handing out
$100,000 jobs like candy it's like you
gotta have the skills you gotta prove
yourself and you gotta show it okay now
this of course like I said this is
indeed calm and are nothing to just
because they might say $80,000 $100,000
doesn't mean that you cannot apply to
the jobs apply to it no matter what
you're looking for a job one of these
jobs are going to hire you right one of
those companies is gonna come in and say
hey come for an interview apply for
every single job that says HTML CSS
JavaScript I applied to every single one
it doesn't matter if it doesn't say
front-end developer doesn't matter if it
doesn't say
back in developer it doesn't matter what
it is if it says html/css it's your
first job just get in there start
working you know six months from now you
could come in and be like hey now I work
at Google or wherever the hell you have
envisioned for yourself right but
remember this you are a self-taught
developer a company needs to trust you
and say hey we're gonna hire this person
before a bigger company even gives you
the chance or even gives you the look
okay so let's continue with the next one
Craigslist Craigslist is a great website
because this is where you're gonna find
you know job star desperate I'll be
honest when you see a company on
Craigslist that means they looking to
hire that same day when you see
companies on in decomp most of the times
are bigger companies who are saying like
you know we're gonna look for the best
of developer out there but what does
that mean that means that they could be
there for two weeks two months waiting
to find the right candidate if you don't
have that time and you're looking for a
job now you got Craigslist okay so you
could come here to the web info design
and right here you see in office HTML
CSS I didn't data entry
jack-of-all-trades okay for somebody
that might come in and be like hey man
this is not the place for me I'm not
looking for a job I need to be getting
paid $100,000 guys like I you said
sometimes you gotta take that first job
if you can't find a job in your area and
you say hey man I just can't find it no
there's jobs it's just that you don't
want to take it there's a big difference
take a job like this right come in work
for your you know for the next three
months start applying to other places
okay let's see another one you got here
got web developer okay there's another
one what they're looking for html5 PHP
most likely WordPress let's see what
else they have in here
part-time entry-level position let's see
I mean technically all you have to do is
keep on looking
see WordPress implementer slash
front-end developer seems pretty easy
you know fifteen to twenty dollars an
hour that's a pretty good start man it's
your first job you know what I'm saying
now let's say you are already more
advanced right and you already been
working out here for a while or you have
a very good portfolio like hey I got
amazing portfolio I can get higher
anywhere I know everything I could ace
the interviews cool check out dice
com.com has a lot of companies in here
man so here you could come here and say
put tempo put in HTML and that will
break it down to web development jobs
okay of course you got a sort sort
through it you know find the right
position that works for you and like I
said if it says HTML even though the
title might say something different just
apply to it okay this is a very good
example programmer analyst okay this is
not front end there's not back in
programmer analyst okay somebody might
come in and look at this and say oh you
gotta be proficient on this this and
then you gotta be super smart you are I
can't get this job you start looking at
the the stuff that's in there man and
what this is saying this is very basic
stuff you know proficient in a PC so
what does you you hear something like
that you know it's like a entry level
because for major like let's say senior
roles you're not gonna find something
with like a pro fishing in a PC alright
they're not gonna ask you that like they
already expecting you to know that so
they're not gonna put that there farm
was it foundational knowledge in HTML
guys for the jobs that I apply to I've
never seen that foundational knowledge
in HTML that means this is like super
entry level look CSS knowledge of you
know some knowledge of
c-sharp they're not looking for the
person who is like that expert in
c-sharp they're looking for somebody
that knows it you literally come in go
to this interview say hey man I know PHP
I know JavaScript I know Ruby on Rails
whatever right and say hey I could come
in and learn c-sharp
in a weekend if you guys need me to go
to the interview trust me you will get
hired okay as you guys can see
proficient in JavaScript a good
understanding programming languages like
they're not gonna ask you for nothing
too crazy and this is a 24 to $28 per
hour position okay so as you guys can
see don't go by the title don't be like
oh it has to be front-end developer it
has to be back in developer know do your
research start going through them and
this are the websites that work okay
then you have monster.com okay you come
here and say tampa okay click there and
let's say like I told you guys search
for HTML you know you got front-end
developer you got what designer you got
let's see what else the guy here
dinette developer lead you definitely
don't unless you are somebody very
proficient with it you don't want to be
in there let's say Clearwater Florida
which is close to Tampa you got PHP
junior developer so that means there's a
lot of jobs out there like you know
WordPress WordPress developer let's see
PHP developer with MVC if you know
laravel then you understand MVC so
there's a lot of stuff that you could go
in here and find okay now let's look at
another one you got glassdoor.com
glassdoor.com is great because not only
can you get information about the
company you can actually get details in
data from other employees that work for
that company so like let's say I'm a
developer there and I say hey man they
pay me $70,000 and then another
developer fills out or you know the the
form from glass store and says hey I'm
gonna pay $85,000
so now you have that information where
you could say hey they're paying
everybody from 70 to 80 thousand dollars
in basically I could come in there and
say hey you know what I want to get a 75
or you can say hey I want to get 80 and
then if they want you and they'd be like
hey can we take a little bit lower cool
that's fine you lower the tool 75 or you
lower it to 70 but never below of what
everybody else is already getting paid
okay so this is great you can find you
know you come here put an HTML here you
could come here and put Tampa Florida
right there search for jobs you know
come through let's see right here
all right you got friend and developer
24 days ago even though sometimes you
might see 24 days ago or 30 days ago
still apply because what happens is if
they haven't taken it down it means that
they're still looking if it's still up
online that means they're still looking
because you got to understand this when
you see any type of listing for jobs the
companies have to pay all of these
websites to actually post a job position
there all right that's not free is this
is not like Google search when you're
going here and you add something to any
of the website Glassdoor indeed calm all
those things cost money it could be $200
it could be $600 per posting so if it's
still online
that means they still paying for it okay
which means they still a job for you
okay so as you can see a lot of the jobs
that you see on Glassdoor
and not the same jobs that you're gonna
find a monster on dice or indeed like
they're completely different sometimes
you might see jobs are in dice comm that
they're matching within beat but most of
the time you're gonna find like they're
very different you know different type
of jobs different companies you know
some companies get a cheaper you know a
bigger discount with nice calm then they
get with indeed.com
okay so they might just post on dice
calm and that's it okay now if you're
one of the people that you're like man I
want to get into a you know a startup
check out angels list okay for Tampa for
whatever reason there's really no jobs
there's really I guess the the startup
scene for Tampa is really really small
okay so I could come in here do this
like this search Tampa
okay there's 37 different jobs so
was it 37 and let's say HTML there's
only really three jobs okay
so full stack JavaScript developer
senior co-signor front-end engineer
front-end developer so there's like
three jobs you know for as far as like
startups in in Tampa you know it's not a
huge city where startups are showing up
everybody knows that but it's fine like
there's companies as you guys can see we
went through indeed we went through dice
who went through
monster.com we went through glass store
that's definitely a lot of companies
there without hiring okay
you come here to LinkedIn if you have a
LinkedIn you come in create your profile
it's a great way to people to find you
see your resume see what companies you
work for come here do the same thing
that I just told you to or come in here
and put the keyword be like hey HTML or
sort by posting okay try to get the ones
that just got added today you know what
I mean so look just today just one gotti
mastic digital for Tampa Florida okay
let's see what else you know they got
some middle level ones and like I said
before in one of my videos on YouTube
you have to go in and don't be scared
about the titles if it says mid-level or
if it says senior level apply to it
you'll be surprised you gotta understand
a lot of times companies want a senior
level developer right they want a
mid-level instead of a developer but
sometimes it's just not how many
developers in in that area so you might
go in and for the skills that you
already know they might just take the
chance and hire you you get what I'm
saying like don't worry about the title
don't worry about what it says just go
in apply if they want you in and they
need you they're gonna have you come in
for interview okay so let's continue
with this so this is LinkedIn
all right so this is another website
that's pretty good it's called Simply
Hired comm Simply Hired comm is really
good for the employer because they get a
bigger and a better bang for their buck
okay so pretty much when they post here
they could post for very cheap it's not
like indeed it's not like a dice calm
it's not like Glassdoor where they're
gonna charge in two hundred dollars four
hundred dollars this is very cheap this
is like something like forty dollars per
listing so a company might list here
because they are a smaller company
they're not you know they're not I am
then now Macy's calm they're not you
know nike.com this is just small
businesses but they still need
developers okay and for you your goal
might be hey I want to work at Google I
want to work at whatever company you
might think of right but you have to
start somewhere you are a self-taught
developer so you got to understand what
that means that means that your road is
a little bit harder than most but if you
are comfortable with that and you say
hey man what I'm here for is to get a
job and to get paid and you're fine with
that
then hey man applied to the smaller
businesses it doesn't have the prestige
of google.com but you're gonna make the
same amount or just a little bit less
than somebody who's working in one of
those big companies when you work for a
smaller company okay plus you gotta
think about it it's just the beginning
you know I was like look at this like
front-end developer two years of
bootstrap like as soon as you see
something like this two years of
bootstrap it's like you already know
like they're not looking for the most
expert like you don't need to be put in
that anywhere so as you see that two
years of bootstrap you know that this is
not like a company that they're looking
hey we're looking for the next and
Abramov now they're looking for somebody
to come in to work and give an extra
hand so there's a perfect place for you
guys who are a beginner you know
beginner developers in here okay so like
I said you know you got Python
rails development you know they probably
looking for no Jes experience and
there's nothing to wear I always tell
you guys
whenever you see somewhere that they put
no Jes a lot of times what they care
about is do you even know what MPM is do
you even know what webpack is do you
even know what gulp is because I've seen
so many times you know recruiters
putting nodejs but your whole job is
gonna be nothing to do with nodejs
besides doing npm install ok and that's
the truth
ok so now as you guys can see look
junior web developer slash customer
support and you know medical education
sings was at Saint Petersburg okay so
they want somebody that knows this stuff
and at the same time might be able to
provide some telephone and email
technical support which is fine you know
you might think like hey man I'm gonna
I'm gonna develop per day I'm not
supposed to do this guy's
do this for three months going get your
job get hired move on apply it to a
bigger company
you know you sitting at home crying I
can't find a job in my area and this is
not enough shot so it's the subscriber
who sent me the message but there's
people out there like that they'd be
like I just want to a boot camp
I just spent 40 hours you know learning
all this stuff and now I can't find a
job
nothing's gonna help you if you stay
home just crying that's not gonna do
nothing for you was gonna do something
for you it's actually working and
earning money okay so like I said
there's a lot of different jobs in here
that you could get look a lot of entry
stuff so entry level web developer
junior software developers nice
programmer you know restful api like
there's so many things that you could
get in there and get higher so quick
it's not even funny
okay so what's the next one
then we got us jobs us dye jobs is is
the official website by the national
labor exchange wait national labor
exchange what does that mean that means
this is where the big boys coming okay
this is what you're gonna find jobs from
Amazon from Google Microsoft all the
major big companies you know and even
though you might say hey you know you
might see stuff like coca-cola you might
see Nike you might see Macy's you might
see American Apparel like you might see
HP you might see your Philips you might
see what else there's a whole bunch of
companies that you you're going to find
here
you got Facebook alright why do they
show up here on this website well most
of these companies get kudos they get
you know brownie points for actually
listening they're their jobs here
because this is actually part of the
government you know what I mean so what
they do is they put this into I don't
know if you guys haven't seen that or
have heard this under the news when they
be like Oh today job unemployment is 4%
or 200,000 jobs were created today like
this is where those jobs show up at okay
if you have certain skills and you want
to find out what jobs just got created
you know for major companies you gonna
find them here alright so I really hope
that this is useful for you guys and
I'll see you guys in the next video hope
you guys enjoy I know how to code now
what life after learning to code alright
see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
