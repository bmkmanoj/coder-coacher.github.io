simple Joe back at it again coding
fees.com your boy is back and I done did
it again somehow yeah man so today we're
just gonna hang out man
you know we're gonna hang out man as
what we doing tonight you know wanted to
chat with you guys for a little bit what
I you know rebuild coding fees.com from
the ground up you know so yeah man I'm
just gonna be live here you know one of
those days it's one of those days with
Joe right we just live now let me see
what's the chatroom
I'm gonna bring up the chat room real
quick to chit chit chat
word win so let's go with you guys man
what you guys is up to right now man let
your boy know it's the internet dying
now that seems pretty good since says
stream status is good
720p stream it's not that EP but 720 is
good no we can't we can't complain so
much kids now people love to complain
but it's like come on now what Jerome
says Joe hot how to deal with coming up
with the right approach logics when
programming I'm lost your room you gotta
rephrase that let me see listen
computer science - computer science you
know going to school is fun and going to
college is fun no matter what no matter
what you study it's it's fun once you're
not going to school and you realize like
oh man I'm an adult then you're gonna be
like oh man I miss going to school but
hey if you have the opportunity to go to
school go to school man is it worth it
it depends what you're trying to do if
you're gonna do web development it's not
really worth it if you're going to
become you know a software developer or
a software engineer data scientist then
it makes sense but for what development
it doesn't make sense you know I said I
wasn't gonna show you guys anything man
but you know what was here is here man
so this is the page that I'm working on
right now currently so this how the
pages kind of look for each course and
it's gonna be you know future proof
JavaScript has a description who is the
target audience what will you learn the
requirements it's gonna have a section
was gonna take you to like a trailer you
click there brings you to the trailer of
the course you know shows you the price
shows you how much you could do it just
get every course unlimited if you
subscribe for the for the website and of
course like I always put the discounts
whatever you see here here it's always
gonna be 50% to the people from YouTube
all you have to do is click on the link
below and you should be good no matter
what but for everybody else that you
know we gotta pay the bills guys so I
can't I can't do much but yeah so this
is the new website right now working on
this I'm setting all this things up so
depending on the URL here on the program
start coming in through here basically
the whole page rearranges itself
according to it hey I still gotta do the
courses page a home page I'm also gonna
do this thing like I said yesterday
we're gonna have like this new
scholarship program which is gonna be
for the top 50 poorest countries in the
world and for our kids below 18 who want
to get into programming we're gonna
basically like give them free access you
know it's like my way to give back you
know what I mean so that's what we're
doing you know what I mean kids but yeah
man that's what I'm working on right now
knocking things out website is gonna be
legit yeah man I'm lost
Jerome like you is like you asking the
questions that I can't answer because I
don't understand what you're saying yeah
men are born to gamble thank you bro
like don't worry go do your course man
this is not for everybody this is just
me hanging out you know you guys don't
have to be here if you guys are studying
you guys are doing something go ahead I
mean for those of you guys that like
react and want to see how I work with
react and react router and like how I
build a site there's like the behind the
scenes of the behind the scenes you know
all of the stuff this stream will be
deleted it will now be kept on the
Internet
so go get your cassette tapes and your
VHS kids and record this now everything
that's here is is gonna be just live you
know I'm not I'm not saving it but yeah
so it's just gonna be me building this
application now I don't use I don't use
no no agile I find it to be boring and
annoying every company that I've been on
like that they use agile is like then
they waste so much time and most people
don't even code so I was like you know
example
you decide to go with an array or object
data structure okay are you talking
about maybe this example might work for
you maybe I think this is what you're
trying to ask like when do you use
certain things so I'm gonna share my
screen with you general see you maybe
this makes sense for you
okay Google hangout all right
some here basically I'm working on this
currently I don't have no back-end for
this this website I'm running a very
small nodejs server just to basically
you know just to serve all the files
right so as a very simple nodejs server
right now what I'm doing here is I have
this fake data this is like me mocking
the data that I'm going to input into
the backend once I build it so currently
like let's say for example have this
page which is future-proof JavaScript
all right so what I have here is inter
ray okay and then inside of the array I
have the object okay the array is good
to hold things like a list if you have a
list of of different let's say courses
right I have a list of 25 courses right
I'm gonna put those lists inside of an
array because later on if I want to loop
over them or I want to be able to filter
them is going to be way easier for me
than to say if I was to put everything
inside of an object right it wouldn't
make sense so for me because I know it's
different courses I'm basically using
the array as a way to structure
everything inside of my website okay
like let's say here okay there's the
object and then inside of the object I
have different properties so I have
title okay so there's the title now have
category now and here in this category
I'm using an array because later on I
might decide hey I want to have
JavaScript I wanna have HTML I wanna
have CSS so I'll go have multiple
categories so I'm using an array right
here okay here because it's just one
single thing there's only one slug
there's only you know one string here
okay now in this section because I want
to be able to add different properties
to this to this object which is gonna be
called images like let's say I wanna
have a top image right and I wanna have
another image down here that's going to
be called thumbnail okay and then if I
want to create another one I will say
this one is let's say extra then now
order it so now I basically structured
it like this by saying hey this image is
property has an object inside of it okay
in the reason why I'm choosing that is
because later on if I want to go in
there and find which one I want I can do
something like this like let's say data
that images got let's say from Nia hey
now I could target like that if I was
gonna use something like an array then I
will have to use an index
which for me it would really suck like I
hate using you know a race where I have
to be like oh I want to use you know the
second I want is the third item inside
of disarray
I hate doing this so I just said about
my data in this way okay I hope that
makes sense I think that's what she was
asking so I don't even know if that was
exactly what she was asking but it seems
like which it was asking
so yeah I'm reading I'm new to
programming and trying to pick between
Python Java or PHP to learn
I have no hang-ups I'm I am just looking
for a well-paying job which one um I
don't know man you got to do research
exactly you got to try all of them all
right
you got to try all of them in the south
which way is it that you want to go if
you want to go to web development I will
say focus on PHP right
that's your first language if you want
to focus on software development or like
more like an engineering side then I
will say try between Java and Python
those two it all depends it's like I
think that's like one of the biggest
problems of hearing YouTube you know a
lot of channels mix everything together
and it's like they shouldn't you know
what I mean cuz if I'm creating if I'm
right now let's say I'm a brand new
developer and I go like oh man the the
best part of the best programming
languages right now the top three are
Python JavaScript and let's say C sharp
right for example an hour C down on the
YouTube channel I'm like oh man I want
to become an iOS developer but damn I
gotta learn this to the other languages
it's like no no you don't because if you
want to become an iOS developer you're
gonna learn Swift you got what I'm
saying like a lot of channels here they
mix everything together to try to get
the SEO from everybody you know and what
I do here is just web development right
later on I might jump into other stuff
but this whole first section and this
whole first level of coding face is just
what development so you know I would
definitely say if you were looking to
become a web developer and look into PHP
you know so yeah yeah let me see yeah
that's good so also search area man
how much time would you recommend daily
for studying and working on projects
I mean don't do it like I do it I abuse
it I'll be doing a lot of hours doesn't
do it like I do don't do it like I do it
for sure
but I don't know try to do three hours a
day three hours a day you're gonna be
good to 3 hours a day and you're gonna
be really good so that's my advice you
know in many moments - did I Allen
Casillas as the equate job yet yeah when
I quit my job in September man we we've
been free since September I don't know
like September 12 or something like that
like I've been free man you know I make
my own money I got my own websites I got
my own clients like I don't need to work
for a company like you know me being at
a company it's like it's a blessing for
them it's not a blessing for me so it's
like I'd rather be doing all the cool
stuff that I'm doing here with you guys
on YouTube doing the cool stuff that I
do on my own on the side you know this
may not this week when it's the eighth
the eighth next week next week I'm going
to a meet-up here in New Haven
Connecticut um so it's like I'm already
you know like I just moved to
Connecticut but I'm already on my way to
like start knowing like what the tech
scene is like over here and in
Connecticut like seeing what companies
is out here I know a lot of companies is
out here too so let's see how it goes
man I don't think I want to work with it
you know work for anybody right now
especially when I have so many cool
projects going on you know what I mean
yeah men love from Massachusetts without
man yo I wanna do like a you know a me
meet up with everybody from
Massachusetts New York Connecticut if
you guys can meet up man send me an
email so we could see how we link this
up in all right let me start working
with this gonna share my screen I'm
going live working on coding face.com
yeah man you got a
es 6 main without es 6 you you're not
gonna understand a lot of stuff that's
happening in the world nowadays it's
like right now it's like look at this
like we're using ES X here we're using
es6 here
like if you don't know es6 you wouldn't
understand what the hell is going on and
you will miss out on so many cool things
ok so let me see cool man got the
homepage you gotta create this button
and for those of you guys that love CSS
grades if you know CSS grids and flex
boxes literally this whole website is
like built around CSS grids and and flex
boxes like I'm not using no framework
I'm not using nothing everything is just
straight-up
HTML CSS no framework no bootstrap no
nothing so if you want to know exactly
what are the best cases in the best ways
so you CSS grids is this perfect guys
hey so let me see here i BTN
it's a creative variable for this cuz
I've been using this thing for a while
also just because you see this grit here
I'm not using it I just have it there I
need to actually delete it but now since
I already started it's fine pink okay
now let me see where is it
hold the SCSS item H item G okay so it's
here i BTN
okay so let's fix that up get courses as
a whole
flex erection people like that flex I
Russian kala
vega and you will see me look at
documentation guys i'm constantly having
either was a CSS reference that IL or i
will have what's the other website or
even the react time documentation open
usually on another tab most of the time
cuz there's like there's so many things
that you forget like you know the
concepts but it's like you forget the
syntax so if i forget the syntax i
usually just have to button the thing
there so isn't this background turning
pink okay
that's why oh we gotta change class name
okay so let's see radius 5 pixels adding
color 8
phonce wait they say so hungry Arjun
bottom or M okay
and they go what else should I put on
this from peach
yeah I might come back
change a little bit of the coloring here
I bring it back to the pink and white it
all depends you know it all depends how
I feel like let me see we got very old
home we got what is it the main de SES s
side menu oops
just wipe keep a sip
with the white you might be right stead
of the green just keep it with the white
all right let me see what else we gotta
do this section here but I don't know I
might do that later on cuz I actually
got to do the course in speech and then
I got to do the timeline so there's the
courses page what's going on here why is
there nothing showing up okay no errors
so if there's no errors there might be a
problem with the router so let's go to
the app that GES let's see do we have a
route for it no no we don't
okay okay do I have it load it courses
yes we do like you know suppose I took
bullshit about JavaScript guys but I
love JavaScript this thing started good
this things aren't bad about JavaScript
but I still have fun with it you know
like I love react like this is like the
best thing things since bread you know
what I mean like God bless the creators
of react like this is amazing like this
is the best framework like I was looking
at this framework called stencil Jes I
was looking at a couple of frameworks
are popping up now and I'm like oh my
god like why would anybody use those
things especially well react us around
and it's like sorry to bring it up but
huge yes so it's like why would anybody
use that when you have react like people
are so like so crazy like they're
fighting the future like JSX
JavaScript having HTML inside of the
JavaScript it's like that's the way to
go in the future
having a JavaScript file in an HTML file
for every single component is ridiculous
you know what I mean like I don't know
all right so what's the idea that I have
for this the courses page is gonna have
all of the courses okay
so currently on the website when you go
to all courses looks like this and this
is horrible
okay this is pretty horrible it looks
shitty you know people ask me all the
time Joe could you fix your website code
isn't that guys this is not my website
like this is a template that comes with
teachable calm which is my provider my
host for all my videos all right but if
this was my website guys you know my
website look will look a million times
better than this you know what I mean
like what you guys are saying in the
chat room I haven't mentioned crystal
lang
yeah I haven't mentioned crystalline in
a while because I've been busy and also
tools like they kind of let me down like
you know they were supposed to release
version 1.0 and they've been slacking I
mean honest thing everybody's busy and
everybody got other things to do and you
know people gotta feed their family but
at the same time it's like why will you
tell people hey by the end of 2017 we're
gonna finish crystal lang you know cuz
right now it's like in beta you know
what I mean like like a soup
no it's a beautiful language it's
amazing super fast it's faster than
golang but the reason why people haven't
put it up there like that is because
it's still in beta which means at any
moment everything can change so like
let's say you could build an application
like I was gonna build coding freeze
comm with crystal 9 but then I'm like yo
every single week on new update comes up
and they change everything around it so
it's like you could come in and use I
don't know version point 23 or something
and look you see point 23 point twenty
four and I mean they do a couple of
updates this and that on the language
itself but you see other breaking
changes like what this is saying is hey
if you build an application on this hey
buddy
everything's gonna break by next week
when we release a new word you know so
that's my biggest problem this new
framework whole amber is pretty legit I
tried it it seems pretty fun they still
getting up to date with a lot of things
but it's a pretty cool framework I mean
there's a lot of a lot of cool stuff in
the future for for Crystal Lang it's
just I wish like somebody would give
them more money you know what I mean
like it's obvious that that they can do
all of this stuff but I feel like they
don't have the motivation you know like
when somebody like Goulding right the
guys that created goaling they got
funded by Google right if Google or any
other the big companies came in and
actually gave some money to these guys
cuz right now the top sponsors is like I
don't even know how much they make like
they doing all this stuff like open
source and like not even open source but
it's like
the community is funding it but they're
only making $1,900 a month for a team of
like I think like five six guys in
Argentina so it's like I understand why
they don't have that much motivation but
at the same time is like don't say
you're gonna do something and then
you're not gonna do it you got what I'm
saying
so that's my my biggest problem and
maybe I'm gonna make a video buddy maybe
I'll make a video body and you know call
them out on it like you know I love the
community of crystal and they're super
helpful the people that are building the
framework called amber it's pretty legit
and like they're nice like you live you
leave her a issue on github and they
answer your your questions right away
but I just don't like that I don't like
if if you say you're gonna do something
you gotta do it how do you learn this
framework so fast
very simple you gotta understand the web
is very repetitive doesn't matter what
language you're talking about if you're
working on the web you're doing the same
thing you're working with HTTP you doing
a get request you doing a post request
you doing a route you are getting the
params from here you're getting the
params like this you know ID 23 and page
equals 34 like you get into params like
all of the stuff is being done
repetitive repetitively it doesn't
matter what language it is
so that's the thing about it so it's
like I could go in and look at any
framework that anybody came up with and
I could learn it in like a day because
they're all doing the same thing now if
you tell me hey Joe go into I don't know
freaking machine learning is gonna take
me a little while because I just don't
have that experience I will be at the
same level as you on it
you got what I'm saying like me and you
will be at the same level like if me and
you were like hey man we gotta look into
machine learning or I don't know
something complicated you know something
complicated like I don't know whatever
you fill in the blank me and you will be
at the same level but this assembly
right me and you will be at the exact
same level because I just don't have
experience but all of the stuff that's
being done on the web I already learned
it five years ago and I've been doing it
professionally for five years now so
it's like nothing impresses me nothing
surprises me like only thing that
surprised me was like when they release
react like this is something new like
compared to although the frameworks is
totally different and it works and it
makes sense all right so okay so this
page here is supposed to have all the
courses okay
so all this the courses are supposed to
be here so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna do a CSS grade okay
and we're gonna do columns cool so since
I already did this here I'm just gonna
copy and paste because there's no point
of me wasting timing redoing it again
alright so let's see we are on the
courses there's a single course let me
create a new SES I'm gonna say what the
hell things is course well okay
of course of course is that s CSS let me
import this let me say import and say
courses and put a little semicolon save
that we stop this ctrl C yarn run watch
okay serve in the files okay hurry up
hurry up
okay cool so what's the next thing for
me let's go to
was that pages regular courses okay
courses okay so there's the courses that
J yes okay now here what I'm going to do
is I'm gonna say last name content area
believe that's the name that I'm using
make sure that's what I'm using
yes constant area and then I'm putting a
class of what exactly I'm doing okay so
of course is content area or voices
sorry so now next thing that we're gonna
do here is we're gonna go to the course
is that s CSS we're gonna say content
area that courses and then we're gonna
say display grid at refresh this oh they
don't
alright cool
son yeah
okay so that's the grade I want to
follow the same thing that I did here ah
where is it
single course that CSS how was it that I
did it here so I can't say I'm saying of
course yes all right so we're actually
gonna take this from here so courses
that CSS all right all right this way
change this school fr fr what we want to
do is we're gonna have three column
great and there you go we have our three
columns now there's a little bit too big
so what I'm going to do is I'm gonna
break this down now so I'm gonna close
the stuff close to home close that open
courses put this at the front okay
single courses I don't need this no more
variables I don't need in a more home I
don't need it
being I don't need it app I don't need
it index I don't need it all right let's
see yeah the whole
font awesome man it's like I already pay
for it but the reason why I paid for it
was like okay we supporting this and you
know everybody's gonna be able to have
access to this thing so when we're
paying for it we you know everybody's
paying a million dollars to this thing
is that all cool we gotta pay for this
and from here on everybody has access to
font awesome but no what they did say
hey man we could actually make a lot of
money so now let's charge $60 a month
now a month a year for being able to put
on CSS icons like I'd rather just pay
somebody else freakin custom icons you
know what I mean
you go on what's the name of this
website on fiverr.com and you could get
legit icons for like $5 so you get like
10 10 icons for like $5 like you know
what I mean
application that was victim so sequin
Jackson worst day of my life hope you
have you ever had any crazy shit like
that happened yeah man like I don't want
to go too deep into it well let's just
say I bring in a company that they
didn't have no or like no um no privacy
for the users no nothing like there
wasn't encrypting the passwords it
wasn't you know like I don't want to go
into details but just because I know
those people be freaking listening and
watching my channel so I don't want them
to be like oh you're not supposed to be
talking about this isn't that so I don't
want to say it but yes a lot of
companies out here go through that
yeah CSS frameworks
man you could use whatever you want man
you could use bootstrap bhumata yo you
could use skeleton CSS you know whatever
you want how will you go avoiding such
attacks use a framework the problem a
lot of times is that everybody thinks
they're smart right everybody thinks
they're smarter than everybody all right
so it's like I could say hey I'm gonna
do this by myself I'm gonna build this
from scratch right there was an article
which that we're talking about this
about no GS so many people are jumping
on no js' and don't even know how to
deal with sequel injection how to deal
with you know security for the website
so when you go in there and something
like Express write express is just a
little JavaScript file that serves up
freaking a server real quick and
everybody's oh this is great but if you
don't have the right security and you
don't have everything properly done you
could get effed up so the best advice
will be use something like laravel use
something like Ruby on Rails because
what what happens is that those
frameworks have been built from the
ground up by people who have made those
mistakes so they come back and they fix
it in laravel they fix it in rails they
fix it you know and all the major
frameworks so when you use a framework
like that it's like you know it has that
security you know what I mean like
they're already you know I got vetti
they already done all that stuff like
I'm not an expert on security I'll be
honest I'm not that's why I use for
something like a framework because it
just makes sense it's like it's a
easiest way to just like really watch
you know wash your hands off it
you know I was like the best thing about
using a framework is that all you have
to worry about is your application and
building your application like the
security stuff has already been set up
for you and you know as you get bigger
then you you hire somebody who's the
expert on that you get what I'm saying
but if you're like you're trying to
tackle everything I wants it's like you
can't do everything you can't be the AWS
guy you can't be the front-end developer
you can't be the back-end developer you
can't do or you know machine learning
you can't do everything by yourself
you have to have a team you know so once
your website starts getting popular you
know the hackers is gonna try to get in
there so at that point you you need to
start hiring you know professionals
people that you know all they know is
security all they know is how to make
your website secure okay so yeah man
alright let's save this and I'm gonna
put this in here I'm gonna say voice is
great here one thing guys that I do and
you're gonna notice am i cold all I do
is copy and paste me I try not to write
as much as I can man I if I don't need
to write I'm not writing you know how I
am right hey so let's see
okay so let's see I don't see how it
looked
why are you
typically using react for the website
because react is amazing I know it
sounds crazy to say but it's an amazing
framework it makes sense it's easy to
use and especially if you're gonna be
using a lot of data to like control your
whole website then the best thing to do
is use react okay so it's the column
column right this is fine
so let me see what else I'm gonna do
here when I far enough our Cape
background ready we're gonna remove that
background ready no second so here I'm
gonna say
all right one second we're gonna copy
and paste like this is the best man like
I love doing this because it's like once
you you know like once you get
comfortable guys you're gonna be like
all the things that you used to think
that all this is so hard it's like now
your body does it automatically that's
like it's as if you're doing all of this
stuff like you know I'm a pilot
all right so from here a thumb right
here okay let me copy this from here are
we gonna do it in here we're gonna say
now you're probably asking so Joe why
are you using inline styling here and
then on your CSS you put in this here
well kids if you're going to be using
you know using images right if you're
going to be using images and it's gonna
come from your data you can't put this
into your CSS here it's just not gonna
work so the only way to do is through
inline it okay so there you go
alright so let me see where the hell is
this image okay let me just search for
Cody face calm all right let's say this
one right inspect all right where's the
image on this inspect okay here you go
this is just from
the later we actually bring it in
dynamically but uh errors good ol errors
we haven't had one of those
okay Koreans not defined yes I know
that's why I took it out you dummy okay
so let's see
refresh it so it was working but for
some reason the image is not showing up
the same as a self certificate used to
load a CB and usually bring the from
loading of these resources oh so now
you're blocking me I mean technically I
should be able to take this image like
this single station should be working
SSL certificate use a lot research damn
it so let me see another one whoo okay
so let's see what's a good website to
get some back images
you
okay so those guys are using responsive
images because they want to be cool
okay see this image is humongous
it was a small one still big but
whatever it doesn't matter okay load
hurry up some people probably asking why
you haven't set up how module reloading
because I don't feel like it I'm just
nine moves of these setting things up
right now why isn't this image showing
up this is kind of ridiculous okay okay
that's why my fault
we're missing a height okay
so height say on your 50 pixels
technically this the there's the image
okay all right now how can we do this so
that's the image there now what is that
wanna do to this thing I definitely want
a background read look city is that
image is way too big like they have they
have to have like the smaller version
like come out they'll have a smaller
version of this this is huge
I don't want to compress this thing
see this is seven see this alright
this is this okay so that's so damn
freaking big there's too damn big is
taking forever to load so I can't you
know preview the thing that I want to
see okay so we have the image there all
right kids
my back hurts man they saying down for
like all day man well Thomas is eight
o'clock I want to go play some NBA 2k in
the little bit
I missed was in the chat room still damn
does 58 people watching right now is
crazy
Missy I don't want to say
image that's the whole thing yes Jerome
agree with you there's something ugly
about coding on a Windows computer trust
me I know because that's where I started
but once I you know I tasted the sweet
waters of Mac guys like yo save the damn
image I'm not saving it I'm not saving
I'm not saving it all right so let's see
what else okay
yeah because I usually like to check if
like you if you save it then like you
sort of not checking how fast things are
for people and like I usually like to
know if it's if it's taking too long
it means it's too damn freaking big
which means it doesn't need to be on my
website all right now this thing is you
know there's another trick guys I think
they call this vignette and you're
probably wondering how to do this very
simple you could take a background image
right and you take linear gradients and
you say there's a linear grading left
and right and then there's a linear
grading top and bottom and then now you
have the image behind it so now you get
that nice vignette alright so that's how
you do that little CSS trick yeah man
okay so let's see what else I want to do
to this thing I kind of want to want to
do like a little hover effect so let's
see how can we make this little hover
and what we're going to do today's you
know what hmm
time for some CSS trickery so instead of
me puttin it here like this right I can
create another div inside of it say if
class name Vig okay so I could call it
Vic
all right
so now I can come here take the stuff
from here cut it out
now's a little bit more cleaner okay now
I can come here and take this thing
called Vig in here this background image
all right
background image use opacity Pass
point five man if there's a one give
this a one let me see no it's not what I
want to do a whole lot I see
- right zero zero not difficult to do it
but now I gotta do so much one simple
thing can become difficult anyway let me
just put this up say on this I'm gonna
say position:relative a so the reason
I'm printing the procession relative is
because I want to be able to say
position:absolute this one and I want to
say top 0 right 0 left zero autumn arrow
I could do all this stuff like this or
let's see if it works
okay so we have our some sort of
vignette in here you see we got it in
there okay point three point four deep
okay now if I was to do this at opacity
wanna see how it looks okay that's
exactly what I want so I'm gonna put it
at opacity eight and when I hover it's a
big on the opacity of it to become zero
then we want to do like some type of
transition so we're gonna say efficient
opacity then what's a transitional
paucity and we're going to say point
five seconds he's in and out okay and
there you go so nice little nice little
thing you know what I mean
something smooth something clear nice
and cute nothing crazy
let me see what else
we gotta say purser yeah cursor okay
refresh this theta that's exactly what I
want
ah see a little problem here
so because of how this thing is right we
also got to add the border radius or we
just say on this thumb the
overflow:hidden see if that fix that yes
there you go so if you say over
hitting it make sure that everything has
that border-radius
cool alright so let me see what else all
of the courses is gonna be like that
don't
all right so let me see what else I
wanna actually why should I do
I want to loop this thing so what should
I do I'm going to just create it here
should I do it right here
no I mean doing it's out of here
so I'm gonna say is something that I'm
missing I just don't know exactly what
it is hard
9 and that had that data duck Duck Duck
better duck - duck - duck tap that
all right saw
now let's just say like this pops today
super props and si esta state now I
don't even need a state loop they start
loop a loop or horses equals two is the
loop courses that bind this and yes I
know you could technically do this with
the arrow function find is well I
actually like this format I actually
like doing it like this you know I was
like everybody has don't stick they're
all ways of coding man this is my way
you know well let me see you so here I'm
gonna say loop courses okay now what I'm
going to do is I'm gonna say let theta
plus two that's the ABC all right hey
that map
something like this okay and it would
take this from here cut it out oops did
I miss something
no I'm good I'm good Chi okay yeah so
from there to here okay cool
delete all of this stuff down here
what's going on there's an extra div
okay
so we're gonna say what's going on with
this error there's an error kit okay
that's because we using ticks inside of
ticks this yarn run watch this good old
react man good over yet
good old react okay so fake data
let's see down here hey this that loop
choices let's see if it works sometimes
I don't know why every time I used to
map I'll be forgetting something hey we
got something all right so we got
something back Oh dump it on that's what
I forgot sorry been doing this for like
two three years already and every time
I'm about to loop or resign I always
forget something okay dave has no
corresponding closing tag actually it
does you ate hole it should let me see
it what's going on
okay we got this we gotta make sure with
oh that's why the div Carl doesn't have
another Dave if you now half that
closing tag so y'all run watch okay
let's see what happens now you know
that's like the beauty of this thing man
like there's a human error you know what
I mean like just forget this little
thing right so there's the problem when
when you take like a course and you'll
be like oh man the instructor is perfect
everything he does is amazing what you
guys don't see is that the person copies
and paste code that they already did you
know like like this human error kid like
no matter how many times you've done
something it's just a human error that's
just how it is you know Joe
album without without what I would up
okay so let's see what we got here all
right now let's see why is this grid the
spacing between this grid so crazy
all right that's fine
Missy I don't even know what to do like
that's the thing it's like that's why
it's so good when you have a design
because it's like hard to think about
what you want to create next and at the
same time code like you know what I mean
like it gets really annoying
has anyone boy
Adobe CC to build a layout for their
design first yes
currently I have Photoshop here I have
Photoshop CC kit
I pay for the whole thing I paid I think
it's 30 something dollars 32 dollars a
month for the whole complete set of CC
but do I use it
not really I only use the for the videos
anyways let me move on from this so here
we're gonna continue this area
okay so we got C thumb okay we got the
thumb we have if it's name the title
I was scraped bop bop bop bop bop bop
bop bop-bop-bop but i but i but i but i
but okay let me see if each approach
javascript case single course do i need
this no courses vague hover okay
title okay so like here we're gonna say
font size to ram let's say picked line
enter
yeah man I used to do that all the time
man how do you put text inside of an
image with CSS you basically position it
on top of it okay why isn't this thing
changing title should change quite
didn't change so let me see what's going
on okay so this is what you guys think
should I put this inside of there ah
good idea put this inside
I don't know I should I do it like that
now now it looks ugly I will put it
outside I'm going to do is I'm going to
put something else inside of it I'm
saying watch on I did this already here
okay where is it the homepage I did this
already there you got watch there you go
h3 a font size tool Ram I put this on
you
okay cool okay now instead of put into
vague put into hover on the vague
alright let's put it on the column so
what this is going to do is hover on top
of the column we're gonna get the
animation instead of the image itself
jealousy did it work save Oh didn't work
so let's figure it out
why didn't work column let's see hover
why didn't it work
am I missing something
okay we're gonna column when we hover on
top of the column it should change it
why did to something out okay so it does
change it cuz when I hover on top of it
is changing but what's going on with
this vague okay don'tdon't uh CSS
specifically specific specific CCD I may
even say that word man okay so because
we were so specific before is being
overwritten no matter what so now it
should work when we hover on top of it
yeah if we hover here yes yes yes yes
kiddos yes yes yo don't feel great man
wait well you just like figure something
out man even though you figure it out a
million times I don't know why this to
me
coding is like building a puzzle Wayne
say building a puzzle where I can come
in and like literally see like
everything's
working just fine now let me test
something out because we only have what
eight but what happens if we have
another eight okay it's loading loading
loading what pack are those supposed to
be clickable yes at some point I'm gonna
make it a link if you're curious about
that if you're wondering if you're
wondering is he gonna make it clickable
yes it's gonna be clickable calm down
they're going to be clickable okay I'm
just making sure that things work when I
put in you know 25 different courses at
the same time so okay let's see what I
was what else what else changed his
background thing cuz it's horrible we
also want to be able to move h3 inside
of dumb okay so we're gonna say h3 or
going to say
station letter D index 10 and is gave
let's give the vague a z-index of 5
okay let's see let's figure it out let's
see what's going on okay
so we got this okay no I do not want
this relative that's my fault
agile bad dog you forgot you forgot you
already have something already relative
so you don't want it to be relative let
me move this instead of being here
we gotta move it down here you know
we're gonna say position absolutely
index 10 straight off the joint straight
off to jump we're gonna have a z-index
10 and then what we're going to say is
autumn all right left and I know
somewhere an internet somebody's like
you can use flex boxes for that I know
but I choose not to
Oh God
all right son you know all right so let
me see what else now
should I put it like that now I'm gonna
put it to the right yo what did I say
yeah what did I say
why not flex box your wallet saying man
I Love You Man but as I just said that I
was like yo somebody on the Internet is
probably like y'all
why not flex boxes
listen for the type of animation that
I'm about to do right now flex boxes is
not really the best way to go okay so
that is why for animations I find that
flex boxes does they don't work as good
as positioning so let me see
instead of 30 this is 20
let me see
so yeah if you use position:relative you
can when you use position:absolute and
you have like let's say you have an M
like let's say the parent right
currently the parent which is the thumb
alright the thumb is the image right the
thumb is the div that has the background
of the image if that's position:relative
whenever you use position:absolute means
you're actually stuck inside of this
element not outside of the whole screen
okay so yeah this destroyer of worlds
that's how you use it it's pretty fun
man like you know with time I always
tell this to people like CSS grades are
good for a certain thing CSS flexbox are
good for a certain thing but are they're
good for every single situation no I
find it that they're not okay so let me
see where am I yeah got me lost now okay
so I was on the h3 I'm trying to
position it to where as the h3 h3 let me
see how am i refresh this I mean the
little Google developer tools okay so
we're
I really want it okay 20 pixels that's
what I want it okay cool
so 20 pixels at man what we're going to
use is
let me see as form we would say perhaps
leak 3d 0 0 0 ok copy it is I'm gonna go
up here this transform but in let's say
400 pixels no I got it wrong it's 0 here
and then 400 pixels or is it wait
no I had it right wait no how long is
what I want is on the hover to be a Sara
Lee
yes what I did have it wrong okay so I
had it wrong
let's fix it up 400 pixels let's make
sure we put in
let's see position and form and Lesage
transform in four seconds
he spin up
okay so let's see what's going on with
this do I wanna like that I don't know
do I really wanna like that I do not
know maybe the other way negative 400
pixels yeah like it more like that all
right little quick animation nothing
crazy you know nothing crazy for you
guys to go crazy about but pretty simple
all right now what else do I want to do
to this page I don't like this
background color I don't think this is
the background color that should be
and I don't know where this background
color is coming from
the background color that I want is the
one that I used on what was a single
course
Oh coding live coding live with coding
phase calm oh gosh okay let me see yeah
that's fine
now the only thing that I don't know
about the size of this grid feels like
is huge like I cannot
want this to be just 100 percent of the
whole wave of the screen see with a
hundred pixels that's dad look like it's
a little bit too small say 1500 pixels
of course this is like there's
definitely a bigger screen this is a 4k
screen so I don't know if I really
wanted this big
I cannae mrs. Selfridge approved
JavaScript what else should I add to
this do I have any other information on
my website go to face comm by the way
yo man let me see
Oh we're also having yeah I mean I have
to name an instructor how far you are as
far as being complete mmm you know what
we need like a filtering area we need to
create like a filtering area on top
because if you want to search for
JavaScript and all you want to see is
JavaScript then you should be able to
see JavaScript okay
maybe how should I do the the freaking
thing courses category should I do it by
categories because if they
javascript alright good god was correct
and there's no URL for that right now
but maybe I would like to have it like
that
sorry kids it's hard coming up with this
it's hard I know I definitely want to
have like a filtering system up here it
may be like a search area so anyways let
me hang out with you guys while I think
about this okay how can I go back to the
screen
yeah
joke back at it again coding face.com
yeah so we just coding right now we just
hanging out this this is what I do man
we when you're developer all you do is
call it man like when you are
entrepreneur and like you're building
your own stuff like that's what you do
man
you know just just a little coating you
know what I mean like just a little
color a little code you know with the
Star Wars teacher you know what I mean
representing for the dark side
representing for you know the Empire you
know I was saying about getting a little
tattoo right here that says the Empire
right under my my I'll aegis Empire and
then like maybe right here put like
three little no you know little I don't
know light sabers get three little light
sabers and then like a big logo right
here of like the Empire you know
nowadays rappers from nowadays it's kind
of ridiculous like hey man here's a big
six nine and here's another six nine
right here and then here's another six
nine and then here's another six nine
like people are kind of crazy like when
you see stuff like that that's when you
know you gotta put him like in a mental
hospital like bro you're kind of going
crazy now hi I'm a news
been listening to your video since I'm
struggling to get a job within software
development industry after having just
graduated recently listen man the the
problem with it is you got a half
projects you got to have solid
experience right people come in and they
sell you a dream there was a video on
YouTube of a girl who's suing her
college because they said all the
lawyers here get jobs after they
graduate so she actually chose that
school because they told her hey you're
gonna graduate soon as you you you know
you're gonna get a job soon as you
graduate and now she's suing them right
now you gotta understand man like all
these schools orders boot camps all this
companies are all here for the money man
like you know if they could milk you out
of twenty thirty thousand and if they
could really milk you out of a hundred
thousand they will you know what I mean
like they will milk you out of it but
what can you do
are you gonna sit down and cry about it
no my advice to you is go hard build
your portfolio build real websites like
don't go online like oh let me do some
little algorithm stuff like that not
build real websites right you know this
there's a couple of developers that and
so for engineers that they get into like
really big prestigious schools and then
they go to like really nice jobs but a
lot of times is they come in with a
solid background they come in with a
solid education they're coming with
solid projects right they freaking study
their asses off you know to you know to
ace the interview and they become
successful but some of us are not that
lucky some of us don't have that look
right some of us we got a getting you
know
hard way so what's the hard way the hard
way is to say hey man hire me because
everything that you want to do on your
job and everything that you have from
this listing on indeed com I can do it
and here's my five projects that I've
done that before you know what I'm
saying so if you cannot do that a
company is gonna be like oh he's just
another graduate right that's what's
happening to people everybody's
graduating thinking like you're gonna be
able to find a job it sucks it sucks
that you go to school and that's the lie
that people tell you you know what I
mean like it's not like back in the days
where there wasn't people going to
school you know like let's say the 1560s
around there there wasn't that many
people being you know graduating from
universities and stuff like that so just
by having a degree it was like oh man
this guy is important he's a person that
went to school but now since it has
become like the norm having a degree is
not special no more having a degrees
just like oh yeah cool you got a degree
like that's just how it is nowadays and
it sucks it really does it really sucks
for people who are trying to get in here
man
you know I mean so yeah this gives
retard a yoga nice ooh my mom she said
eat your veggies and you'll be in the
NBA get this get up out of here retarded
