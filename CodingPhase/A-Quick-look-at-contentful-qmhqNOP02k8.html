coding face.com your boy is back and I
didn't did it again alright guys so
today we're gonna talk about something
called content for all right now if you
haven't heard of those guys well now
it's the time basically is how they say
don't let us see you masking in the way
of your shipping software now to break
this whole project down this whole API
everything that they do pretty much and
to break it down for you guys very easy
this is basically WordPress right but
with just an API right like right now I
could build a web page in I don't know
PHP I could build it in just plain HTML
CSS I can building in nodejs I can build
it in Ruby on Rails I could building any
language out there right just a very
simple web application but at the same
time all I want is just a blog all I
want is just content I want a magazine
style I want a blog I want a I don't
know a place where I could write
articles things like that but I don't
want to use WordPress all right number
one because WordPress is not secure a
lot of times you know you download
plugins that just don't don't work or
they have like a back in to the backend
meaning like behind the scenes they send
your private information to the creators
of the plug-in and the creators that are
plugins tell that to people who want to
hack your website there are many and
things that happens with WordPress but
not to knock WordPress WordPress is
still good to learn because people they
want WordPress and now everybody's gonna
be able to afford this okay
but what's cool about this is basically
this thing is just api's all right you
do post requests you have a place where
you will say hey I'm gonna post requests
do a post request
this URL I'm gonna send in the article
I'm gonna send in the images I'm gonna
send in all the data that I need for
this article and now we're gonna be able
to have the same API be available for
everything from you know SDK for let's
say Java or JavaScript or let's say SDK
for an Android device let's say a you
know SmartWatch you send it out for VR
you know for your phones an application
etc right now like I said this is just
like WordPress the only difference is is
just api's okay right so they pretty
much do the whole thing they pretty much
do everything for you they maintain the
servers they make sure your servers
never go down they maintain that no
matter how much traffic you get your
website is not gonna go down if you want
to have that type of security of like
hey man whatever I throw at you guys you
guys are gonna be able to handle it
that's their job right so they basically
send in this service and you might be
thinking in your head like why would
somebody come and pay for this like if I
have a a back-end and nodejs right or
back in and Ruby on Rails and everything
is already set up for me why would I be
sending this data or like let's say this
blog post to them when I could host all
of that and do it myself well a lot of
times people don't want to deal with
that you know it's like not everybody
out here wants to be done with service
not everybody wants to be calling AWS
not everybody wants to deal with let's
say an example GoDaddy or Namecheap or
etc right once you reach a certain level
and let's say your website you have a
very popular website that is a blog you
you know you make post about cooking
recipes right you're this great chef
whatever your chatty that's unique
whatever right chef lady basically you
have this amazing website but your
website keeps crashing right and once it
reaches to a million
it crashes or whenever a new article is
viral it crashes you don't want to deal
with that alright so you deal with a
company like this content fool and a lot
of companies are switching over
you know people that used to have Drupal
used to have WordPress they've realized
that they're like man I don't want to
deal with this stuff all I care about is
creating my website having looked nice
and basically create my content I don't
care where it goes I don't care how much
it cost and that's where they bank
that's where they make their money
because once you get to a certain point
like right now let's say an example
you're jacking a box you're the British
Museum your Nokia your Urban Outfitters
your fender your TiVo there's a million
or websites out there your lokai oh it
doesn't matter a million type of
websites out there that use this service
because it just it works it works in
it's easy for a developer to come in and
just say hey we're just gonna do this
we're a whole bunch of api's we you know
we do a post request to this URL this
thing gets saved the images get saved
everything is already set up for us all
I have to do is just come in and cream
our content right and as a developer for
you guys all you have to do is you come
in you create your application you deal
with a you know a little CLI here and
there you know they have basically a
version for it on every single language
out there it could be an OGS Ruby on
Rails Python PHP anything that you could
think of Java every single language
that's out there they have a version of
this already set up for you already so
what's cool about this is that you know
I'm thinking about I don't know if I
should create some tutorials on a course
on this I don't know how deep I want to
go into this content for because in
reality if you know how to work with
api's you should be able to pick this up
literally by just looking at the
documentation that's how easy it is all
right
but I might do it but that's besides the
point but at the same time I was like I
said what's cool about this is just like
hey man you create your stuff you're
coming here like this how it looks in
behind the scenes in the backend you
create a space define your structure
create your content and I say you use
the API that's it they gives you ok
there's your website you got your space
ID you content delivery API
you got your access token you could do
this with JavaScript download a
boilerplate you know dotnet PHP Swift
objective-c JH Android Java Python Ruby
I'm showing the keys cuz I don't really
care about this to be honest I'm not
gonna use it because I can build this on
my own
and currently I don't have you know
clients that want to pay for something
that I can build for them you know like
you get what I'm saying but sometimes
you're gonna bump into this right let's
say for example you might be working at
let's say Walmart right Walmart has a
section of a blog and they're like man
we want to deal with something more
modern we want to deal with something
more cooler so then that's when
somebody's gonna come in and say hey man
have you heard of content fool so this
is why I'm telling you guys about this
because this is something that's in
industry you know you don't want to be
the guy that shows up and be like oh
I've never heard of that can we use you
know WordPress or do drupal or whatever
and people's gonna look at you're like
man that's so 2016 or that's so 2000 you
know 2009 you know what I mean like this
is 2018 right now you know what I mean
so before somebody hits you up with that
all right to tell you about it and at
least you have some knowledge that this
thing is out there so I mean the pricing
of it is not for everybody
at first they have a free version for
the developers but you come here and
sign up and create an account and
basically work with it and just play
around with it or even you could even
build something for yourself like let's
say you wanted to build a blog you could
literally
create a blog connect to content fool
and have content fool host all of your
your data and your your blocks you know
what I mean but you only get ten
thousand records now ten thousand
records to my knowledge and from what I
understand of this thing I haven't dive
super deep into counting fool but um
from my understanding is like a psych
rose it's like post requests or you know
get requests it's the same thing it's
like hey I want to do a safer article
okay that's one one record I want to go
in and and basically create another one
that's another record hey I want to
upload a photo that's a record you know
it's like all of those things get added
as a record so you only get 10,000
records until it becomes expensive you
know that mean like you might think like
oh you know it's like hey it's like how
much do I really need well you know the
more bigger your company is you know you
start noticing like K starts going up
you know it's like three spaces which is
like sort of like websites three
different websites or three different
spaces
basically it's already $250 okay then
you say hey I got let's say I'm a
digital agency and a half you know
twenty websites that's like five spaces
you know five spaces now we gotta come
in and get some enterprise level because
there's a lot of websites you know you
got five spaces you got 50 50 K records
you got 20 users but now you're looking
at thousand $1,000 a month man like I
don't know I don't know like if it's
worth it when you have something like
WordPress but you got to understand most
of the companies start looking at
something like this money is not a
problem money is not an issue this is
something that you're gonna show it to
major companies this is not something
that you're gonna say hey you found out
a client on Craigslist and they're like
hey man can you build me a website for
you know
$2,000 $1,000 per arm a dozen dollar
project right for example and you're
gonna come here in a year man
you know you're gonna pay me a thousand
dollars and for the rest of your life
for $250 you're gonna host this website
peoples gonna look at you like you're
crazy like that hosting a price is
ridiculous I just wanted to let you guys
know about this um this is just like a
quick overview I know there's people out
there who are like content fool
professionals and guys who are finesse
kings and in the mckeon man I got all my
clients paying you know $250 per month
you know that's one dumb you know what I
mean like me personally I don't know if
I I will put one of my clients that I
care about on this service because it's
just it's that expensive it's not really
for regular people you know because in
reality this thing is really built for
companies that need that you know that
access to API so like let's say you have
an application you have a freaking app
on on a freaking SmartWatch you have an
app on on the TV you have an app or etc
right any freaking device out there
you're not gonna go in and do that with
WordPress WordPress is gonna be like yo
hey man too much request this thing is
not built for this this thing is not set
up to be some type of REST API
I've seen people hack WordPress to do
this but it's just not meant for that
it's not built for that right so this
thing is actually built from the ground
up to become a basically you know how
you call this to be just like a REST API
for content all right and then from
there you could literally pass it on to
any device that's out there so this is
for major companies this is not for
Johnny you know the mechanic who just
hits you up hey man can we get a new
website for us this is not for him you
know I mean but I wanted you guys to see
this and know about this company because
if you guys are gonna be getting higher
in the next few months
in any major company that you're going
to go to they're going to talk about
content fool and I haven't seen a lot of
people on YouTube talk about this at all
but content fool is something nothing
that you have to know it but it would be
nice if you go in there create a free
account sign up play around with it you
know create a couple of blog posts you
might even use it for your own personal
website just to literally just to get
comfortable just to see you some of you
guys have never touched WordPress
because I know a lot of people is like
man I hate PHP I hate this in that but
it's like man you need to be comfortable
with CMS all right working with CMS's
out here because it's like whatever you
gotta go either with freelancing or
working for a company at some point
you're gonna have to work with a CMS
right and I know if you don't use PHP
you're never gonna use WordPress right
so if you're never gonna be able to
touch WordPress at least come join
content fool play around with it and see
how it is all right see how it is see if
you're comfortable with it and at least
one day if you have to use WordPress you
won't be surprised with everything
because this is pretty much WordPress
but with just api's okay so yeah man
I'll see you guys later
this is just a quick overview this is
not a review this is not a tutorial just
saying it out there there's just me just
sharing a technology sharing a service
with you guys cuz I know there's gonna
be a lot of content full professionals
out there who's gonna be like oh my god
you botched content full content for so
much more than just api's in and you
know and it's like bro I'm just trying
to break down a topic that should be
easy on YouTube I'm not trying to make
this thing a long topic about content
for but yeah anyways man if you got to
the end of the video make sure you like
this video make sure you leave a comment
tell me hey I got to the end of the
video I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
