it again man cutting face calm listen
your boys back I did it again you know
what I mean being here man
so I just wanted to tell you guys man
and Cher
you know somebody got a stock you know
somebody one thing can be a really good
inspiration for a lot of people here you
know some of the schools for money who
was pretty much it's not a square but
it's super intelligent has accomplished
a lot and I just wanted to share this
with you right basically his name is
snugs
right so over Shawn Snug see right
Michonne Stovall right super cool dude
he actually reached out to me a while
back right and we were supposed to work
on on my website in and just like just
get in contact with each other and you
know what is funny because at the same
time I was like I get so overwhelmed
with so many emails and so many things
that if I'm not literally on my gmail at
that moment if I don't see the message
it gets strong all the way to the bottom
right so basically he reached out to me
and then I remember I saved him I saved
his profile on my bookmarks I was like
okay I'll get back to it and then I
started doing a whole bunch of stuff you
know I did the freaking developers or
 mentorship I did a whole bunch
of right and then I never got the
chance to work with I never got the
chance to interview I never got the
chance to really just come in here and
give you guys like a full introduction
just do because when I bumped into him I
was like man I found him super
interesting it was really funny right so
he left me a comment where he basically
say it was about that video that I did
they said disconnect be totally seen is
the senior developers in juniors right
and then he basically left me a comment
like yo I just spoke about this very
topic are
rubyconf last year and you're correct
because there's a disconnect for a while
right now I watched this already
it is funny I didn't even know it was
him and when I watched it I loved it I
was like man I don't know who that guy
is man when I get there man when I get
my chance I won't be up there like just
like this guy right and then it's just
funny like he had reached out to me I
just didn't know it was him all right
which is kind of crazy all right so this
your boy right here I'm just saying you
your boy with Shawn is over here man
with the MCM jacket kenan them doing
Ruby conf right you know before a lot of
people a lot of people watch this all
right and it's a very good talk right
now if we go into it this is not like
some square dude who's like you know
some nerdy guy who just comes in and it
doesn't talk this guy is very
intelligent super cool swagging as hell
you know he got the sauce I'm believing
in that he got the sauce he's like one
of those people that you know they just
killing whatever they do they come in
there right so if you look into his
profile
sorry Schneider I'm throwing your
profile out here but this is motivation
for people right this somebody who's
been here for a while does not like
something that just started yesterday
you know he organizes NYC Ruby like you
know like I don't even know what to say
you know what I mean like he already
does a lot to me that's already so much
to do like it's difficult to basically
set up a meet of it and organize this
and he's been with us for a while now
he's also you know like he's been in
here you know work with air peer which
is kind of crazy because air pair I'm
constantly looking at their blogs and
like their tutorials and their
information that they usually throw the
human searcher search air pit right you
know professor and why you teaching Ruby
on Rails which Ruby on Rails is my
favorite
period right and Ruby is my favorite
language barrier right so he's been
doing this for a long time you know
what I really like you know James
Madison and why you like this ain't some
dude I just came up

what I wanna do like this probably some
K 16 17 years old I was like nine trying

not my type of lifestyle and then you
feel and you know you find out that
basically as people living so cool
lifestyles out here and
they basically do development you know
what I mean like you don't have to

good places you know what I mean so I
just wanted to share this moment with
you guys cuz you know me I get high I
get hyper certain shape the sections

somebody who cold you know somebody who
creates cool in this world the
 creators of this you know
what I mean like man
so can't wait to bump into her boys dogs

know what I mean what is a square you
see square what is a square person
square
let's look this up Wikipedia
let's look it up what is a square it is
often used to speak of a person who is
regarded as though rigidly conventional
and added some with current trends and
referring to a person the word
originally meant someone who was honest
traditional you know you need an
agreement that is equitable in all sides
his is gray square I'm just saying let
me see let's see we can wait you know
what I mean like we're anti square in
here man we here we like him show you
personality be who you are don't be a
square don't don't try to please
everybody don't don't be the stereotype
of a what developer you know what I mean
you don't have to be the weirdo guy with
a black shirt with a beard and a
 a mustache doing some crazy
with some glasses on a long beard you
don't have to be that
you can just be yourself you could just
swag it out killer killer with it you
know what I mean
be yourself she want to be like a little
rock star be a rock star you want to be
a rapper style be a rapper style you
want to be a fashion fashionable dude be
a fashion we'll do well just don't be a
square god damn it
that is a what else let's see who I was
a senior I know I know plans to work as
an enterprise developer not me not me I
don't want to be a enterprise developer
I'll be honest I work for business and
that's as far as I'll go I'm not looking
to work for Microsoft I'm not looking to
work for IBM I'm not looking to work for
 I don't know any boring company
out there I'm not looking for that I
don't care how much they pay pay is not
everything you know
your boy your boy look at the comments
because people sometimes people see me
laughing it and they'll be like what the
hell is he laughing about well your boy
Danny will be there I'll say Joe don't

can't easily by tims to be honest right
yes you are right now can I kill it can
I kill it kill it kill the Tim so it
lives the image thank you boy Rashad it
was killing earlier like there's an
image there I forgot but can I come in
like that maybe you know what I mean you
know everybody got different swag I've
never been a Tim's type of dude I always
was like like a person that that wears
sneakers I was a sneaker head for a long
time now I'm uh you know advanced shoes
wait we don't know no strings no
laces that's the type of guy I am there
you know it's a different sauce you know
but yeah I could definitely buy - in
that is nothing but that's not the
point it's not what you can buy it's how
you put things together how you make
 look good you know what I mean like
I come in here swag it out little shirts
a little bit wrinkles simple old Michael
Kors but we still swag it out you know
what I mean you still hit him with it
he's still in here let me say so what
else people talking about there's people
in this sharing planning my next role
was some chick friend said yeah man this
channels the best man the people are in
this channel is the reason why I love
this channel my channel sucks my channel
sucks I suck my worst critic
all right so my channel sucks but the
people that I bring to this channel
that's the gems alright don't those are
the people that you want to be around
the people that's gonna motivate you the
people is gonna you're gonna see here
and they're gonna be in here just
killing me you know what I mean was that
born in the US or Dominican Republic I
was born in Dominican Republic not a
polygon Minicon look at his coming
look at his comment it this is a yes
yeah this will say sometimes people miss
the whole point of the whole shame
how much does Joe make I mean Tim's and
Tim's and Sharon not that expensive to
be honest you're not getting it
Daniel you're not getting it right now
man I'm trying to put you on a trumpet
childhood what is the image that I was
talking about where is it where is it
where is it did I lose it think I lost
it and I'm not talking about I'm you
saying find out how much that jacket
cause I'm not talking about the terms
the terms is the least important thing
in the whole image you just missed the
whole you know is the fact that he
killing out here with the MCM matching
with attempts you know I don't know what
type of genius a knows what they look a
 fly you know I mean I he just
killing
comfortably enough to wear this hat you
know like he's comfortable with himself
you know what I mean that's what I was
talking about that's why the video is
called you don't have to be a square to
be a great developer and then I put a
square here the square image of the
icons or any love emojis so it's like
you don't have to be a square you can
just be yourself and have fun in this
thing you know that's what I was talking
about it's not about the Tim's anybody
could buy Tim's then you go to
to the outlets and you can buy yourself
sometimes it's the fact that he could
just be here with some tips and MCM
jacket and a hat you swagging it
and then on top of that if you look up
his name this dude has done that
a lot of you know what I mean like
this is not like some some dude I just
came most on internet and say our
 here guy is I'm a
developer under a tree no this dude has
worked in a lot of respectable companies
he's done a lot of like I really
just like curse everybody everybody I'm
like right so he teaches Ruby on
Rails right oh my you and i'ma just
leave you at that right so that's what
I'm talking about but he's not a square
and yet he's worked himself up to being
good positions and good jobs and that's
why I put him here so you guys could get
this motivation but like yellow I could
just be myself in and just you know kill
the game be a glitch in the matrix
yeah this do you uh this icon in the
fact that he got this this is like your
world's got a a penguin and
there's a girl I'm a treehouse developer
yeah man people you know we just in here
man okay so Alexis says is there any way
I can share the webpages are creating
half PS critiquing it's that what github
is for I'm getting old no github is for
basically sharing your code with other
peoples creating a project either for
yourself or for others and then sharing
it online for the open source for people
to be able to download it and use it you
know for their own purposes now you can
use github pages to share your page okay
so you can look that up how to share
your page how to create a demo page
alright that's what you can do you know
so if you want me to to look over a page
that you created go ahead and send it to
me I'll put it up here and we'll all
critique it will do this I've you
know I mean not today I gotta go to work
tomorrow morning
unfortunately like some people who be
like oh my god he's not a real developer
I am kids I am a real developer and
sometimes I could get in late but
nowadays I can't because I just took a
two-week vacation to have a case so I
can't take no days off or you know take
clips have a day down come in late
what's the best way to study in practice
in the finally number one like I said
from the beginning you buy a course
right you buy a car is not because I
tell you to buy a course you buy a
course to learn then from there as
you're learning you're creating the page
that the instructor is telling you and
you also create another page
simultaneous simultaneous sorry ah sorry
I'm drinking something but yeah so no
parallel to each other right and you say
hey I have this page here we are
following from the instructor and then I
have this other page which is the same
thing but with different titles
different images and you create it on
your own way as you're learning you know
if you're learning how to create a menu
and your other page you go and create a
menu if you're learning how to do list
we're for responsive design then on the
other page you start making it
responsive because the idea is for you
to remember all of this stuff and be
able to use it at one point so that's
all up to you how you want to learn it
me hard there it was I basically went in
I will learn a course and while I was
learning it I would look at a video and
then whatever I did I would do it for
that videos on page and then I will
create another page where I will try to
do it without looking at the code now
whenever I needed to look at the code
then I will say hey I don't understand
it right so if you don't understand it
then you watched the video again until
you understanding a
coochi can okay Kuchiki Jane I'm Nina
what I'm sorry youichi i hope you stay
around I hope you stay around which a
man and we keep you around because he
already you already made me laugh nah
man it's this channels about basically
motivation it and teaching people how to
code how to get in here you know how to
get into this this industry that's why
I'm about and I'm teaching you guys in a
different way not from like a way of
like talking to you like hey I'm an
instructor hey I'm a developer for this
company like who cares about that right
I'm talking to you guys like you know
just a friend somebody that you know
from school somebody from you know
somebody that you know from around the
corner you know that's how I so see you
guys
so that's what this channel is about and
yeah like this sounds a bit technical
worry or sometimes I don't be technical
cronies without Cronus gentle device do
you still hate on coding boot camps some
really do get results and maybe they do
I just think that you can get the same
results in your house by yourself put in
the same time all right if you're gonna
give on eight hours a day for three
months why you can't do that for
yourself all right the same that
they gotta teach you is the same thing
that they're gonna teach on a course
online you know what I mean
it's not really where you learn it is
how many hours you put in so if you're
put in a lot of hours you're going to
get everything quick as soon as possible
right but if you decide to do it one
hour a day then of course it's gonna
take you forever to learn this thing so
that's what I tell people hey just
 try to knock it out in a weekend
at least eight nine hours every weekend
for at least a month or two you know
what do I hate boot camps no I don't
hate it
you know I think it might be cool to go
and hang out with other developers
people who actually want to become
developers right but then that's cool
that's out of its cool what's not cool
is you know getting that a for $20,000
$50,000 what I really charging now I
feel after I created the video where I
say you can't become a developer in
three months and it kind of blew up a
lot of people have seen it you know it's
kind of got a lot of people pissed off
because they're like oh you know he's
talking about this and this and that
and I'm not saying that you can't become
a developer what I'm saying is you can
become a junior developer a junior
developer you can delay in your house
to become a developer a web developer
software developer software engineer
that takes time
now some people now they've been adding
they like oh that's a senior developer
know where I come from is I'm not a
developer until I know all this and
I know how to do it well but people come
in and but I they want to call
themselves developer and they don't even
have the right time and they
haven't created the right projects it's
like you're not a developer yet you're a
junior developer which is a big
difference
yes Finn said you said it perfectly
I've seen most people's motivation
merely calling any person enough people
motivation in there to blow hard
consistent yes I think Cree with that
100% as even if we come to my if we come
small I say here and I mustn't give it a
second if we come to my website and we
look at many years and we come in and we
say show me the leaderboards and you see
how hot it is reports so neither boards
there's a bunch of people who've signed
up
signed up to to the website and half
register have bought two courses and
they have an evening starting which to
me that's crazy you know what I mean
like I love the fact that they have
supported me and they they came in and
showed me love it
I have support of the channel support of
the website but at the same time I'm
like you know why haven't you guys
finish the courses well haven't you guys
continue why don't you guys put in the
time you don't understand that this is
gonna change your life
this is gotta take you to the next level
why haven't you done this and then you
go back to - I get you know a lot of
people don't really
I really want to put in that work which
is actually there for you guys I do
because a lot of people search for this
they search for how to become a
developer how to learn to call how to
learn this this and that all right but
only probably 5% of the people that
search for those things are actually
looking to learn it so that means only
5% of that is gonna be your competition
when you try to get a job which is great
you know which means you're always going
to have a job because most people won't
continue that they will follow - yeah
man
that's how you do it
you know it's fine when you guys jump in
whenever you already
there's no rush I want you guys to
finish whatever courses your guys are
working on or whatever you're doing but
I'm saying for the people that already
have bought in they're already in there
there's a lot of people are branding
developers and I'm like man you guys
should really take advantage and it's
like if you pay for something use it
good paper sunny if I can go out go hard
start creating web pages don't just
leave it for next week because next week
becomes two weeks until weeks become a
month and then two weeks and a month
become two three months all right and
gonna all show I pay for something and
then I'm gonna get back to it next
summer now you're looking at a whole
year that you could have been doing this
and you could have been finished you
know you could have been working instead
of you working washing dishes or instead
of you working at that office that you
hate instead of you taking the
train to that job that you hate you
could be doing something cool you seen a
Mexican guy you got you doing it right
man you're doing your thing you're only
here for a reason you know you you try
to learn trying to soak up everything
that you can and then continue with your
life you know there's no point of
staying on of this limbo of like oh
maybe I should learn they make a
nap
you know what I mean so just go hard man
well you guys I'm out of here
I love you guys when I just wanted to
share this you know you don't have to be
a square to be a great developer you
could be here and just be yourself just
swag it out head on with the sauce man
