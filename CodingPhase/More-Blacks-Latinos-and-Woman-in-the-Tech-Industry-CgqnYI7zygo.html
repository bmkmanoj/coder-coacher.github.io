back at it again man coding face.com man
listen your boy is back you better
subscribe and you better like this video
man alright guys so we're gonna talk
about you know just giving back man and
and also I want to kind of touch on you
know minorities you know blacks
Hispanics the whole squad you already
know man
oh listen guys like I think it's time
for people to just start changing
changing their ways and changing what
you know the perception that people have
of us you know what I mean like let's be
honest like people know blacks and
Hispanics for you know sports dancing
and just pretty much having to the swag
the the certain style that everybody
else in the whole world they want that
they wanna have you know I was like the
one half hour flavor because there's
something in Africa man we all come from
Africa but there's something Africa and
being part African and having that that
deer is just it gives you a certain
flavor right and just going back to the
point I think it's time to pretty much
add something else to our resume you
know not only are we you know great
dancers not only do we have grace like
not only do we rap not only do we you
know become great you know basketball
players great baseball players great
football players but I think it's time
to also add you know we are actually
pretty damn smart man like you like it
or not there's people that want to put
us in a box and say hey there's people
all they could do is this I feel is 2017
man it's time to change it around man
the idea of like you know like in
Chicago like there's a whole bunch of
kids who are just carrying guns and
wallet now over there to be honest with
you guys man is a like that has to
stop you know we have to actually come
in and it's guys like me who need to
actually come in and put in and
example guys like chance the rapper who
donated a million dollars to public
schools when he don't have to he could
easily put that money round his pocket
but he comes out of nowhere and
basically just really hey I'm giving it
out you know guys like me that pretty
much is here to help other people's you
know and I feel like I want to become
not like you know some super hero role
model and be like oh yeah that like that
guy I want to be like that guy but I
kind of want to just like show people
and like you know show people from
minority it's like hey guys like we
don't have to be the stereotypical
person like that everybody wants us to
be you know what I mean like it's cool
to be smart it's cool to program it's
cool to actually make money the legal
way that way the money way the green
money way the blue cheese way that way
yeah man like it's really good to make
money but it's even better when you make
it legal you know me like I hate not
that I hate it but I hate the fact that
you know everybody has a different
server type right you know some people
say Jewish I really go a business and
really good with money they have you
know Asians are really good with math
that go with science you know
all the other people they're going
whatever they do you know a whole bunch
of different stereotypes and it's like
we have pretty much a lot of negative
stereotypes on us you know and I think
this the year 2017 that we just have to
change that around because it's no
longer cool to be the guy that's looking
dumb out here it's no longer cool to be
the guy that selling drugs out here it's
no longer cool to be the guy with three
to four baby mamas it's no longer cool
to do none of that it's time to
just like step it up and be like you
know what man
i'ma stay in school I'm gonna finish
this high school yeah I'm gonna go to
college yeah i'ma go maybe to a boot
camp yeah maybe I might just learn how
to program on my own but
it's time to basically do sign and
people like me which I think I put
myself in a high pedestal because I feel
like I have to motivate other people you
know it's really up when somebody
like makes it out the hood and then
never helps back people back in the hood
it's like you gotta help out others too
you can't just be like hey I'm good bro
like worry about yourself now you can't
be like that you gotta help the other
person man and yes there's a lot of
crabs in there there's a lot of envy but
the same time you know who is it that
the ones that actually need helping that
you could actually help out you know
what I mean so it's time to help each
other out man like I really wish that
you know 2017 2018 2019 2020 we we start
getting you know more more African
Americans in in this field more
Hispanics in this field
Mexicans Dominicans Puerto Ricans like
it's it kind of sucks when you know you
go into an office and you're like you go
in then you're like oh man I'm the
only minority up in this bitch and then
when another black person or another
Spanish person comes in you know oh hi
son I see you you ain't here to you know
like it sucks to be that guy you know
what I mean you have to do that you know
it's like this should be more minorities
in the shade it's like we're a minority
of the minority inside of the web
development and programming and computer
science whatever everything that has to
do with technology
we're like a minority of a minority you
know women that's why I always you know
support the girls that they want to code
and I was pushing forward because when
you really think about it we're pretty
much the same we're like a minority of
the minority inside of you know what
development like women or females you
know why black wherever they they from
they're only 7% and the minorities as
far as blacks and Latinos we're probably
the same
probably another 7% in this you know
what I mean so it's like we have to
motivate each other and get ourselves in
this gaming you know go ahead tell you
little nephew like hey man
stop playing that ps3 is something that
ps4 hype on that computer and start
coding start learning something new you
know teach them something cool you know
teach them how how cool it is to
actually create a program create a a
website you know so you could basically
influence them and doing something
positive like you know what I mean so I
just wanted to make a video about that
because I just I really hate having to
like you know I watch this whole video
and then I'm like they don't want you
you know if you go to a public school
they don't want you to go to college
they just don't they just don't care
they don't care to give you a good
education so basically say hey man we're
gonna give this kid a good education a
good math good algebra so you know get
them prepared for college they don't
care about that like if you think about
it this is thing called AP classes you
guys probably know it right it's kind of
 up but in AP classes like
minorities are like the minorities in
there like only white kids is gonna be
in those classes in 99% of the time and
yeah people's gonna be oh but they're
the ones doing the homework they're
going on doing they think but it also -
it comes to the teachers it also comes
with you know the training that they
given the teachers because like it or
not
public schools it sucks man like
if you bring in a public school here in
the US special in New York it
sucks so I'm just saying man like we
gotta we gotta start helping each other
out man like that's why I created this
channel 9 especially that's why I keep
the swag in them I keep the in here
like that
like this because I still want a young
kids who that come to this this channel
and be like oh you know what I relate to
that kid
you know like I understand there's a lot
of people who are here like 20-something
30-something 40-something who love my
channel but at the same time when I made
this channel
it was mostly to be like hey man I want
to teach these kids that are growing up
right now like hey you could be yourself
you still have your swag you can still
do you use to wear your fitting you can
have your little lingual but at the same
time it's cool to be smart and it's cool
to you know make legal money out here
you know and that's what I want to bring
out there I wanna you know spread that
little positive energy you know out
there so you know God could come through
and just sprinkle a little shine over me
