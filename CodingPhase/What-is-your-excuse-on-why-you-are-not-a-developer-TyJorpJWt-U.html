gonna guide you to become a developer
from the beginning to becoming a pro
making sure that you got a job making
sure that you come in and you learn all
the skills on how to make money on your
own as an independent either freelancer
or if you decide to make passive income
alright go check us out peace boy Joe
back at it again coding fees.com your
boys back in I didn't did it again
today we share in this article how I
went from programming with a feature
phone to working at an MIT startup how
does this happen you know you're
probably asking yourself how is it that
this happens how does this k elvis chin
you know chin Dara how does he make this
thing happen
rain how does a little kid creating some
application on a village like you know
what I mean like you know we have
everything here in the United States and
then yet there's so many kids out there
who don't get the opportunity to create
cool stuff work they don't even know
that the possibilities are there for
them alright or even for you guys man
you know right now you might be you know
34 35 years old and you're thinking in
your head man maybe I should I should
you know jump into this but I just don't
know can i still make it at my age am I
too late you know you're 40-something
years old you're like oh man I don't
know you know maybe I'm too old this is
a young kids game guys and it's not
about a young kids game is not about how
old they are is not about you know if
you have money if you don't have money
it's about do you really want this you
get what I'm saying like people
complaining all the time they're like
man you know I'm on I'm on this this
computer I don't have a Mac I don't have
this this and that guy's Linux is free
you download Ubuntu Ubuntu is free you
could take a really
really old computer put in Ubuntu and
they'll feel like it's brand new for web
development and programming in general
you don't need a lot of RAM you don't
need a lot of memory for it or a big
hard drive all you need is like the
minimum that's it and you could build
something right now
this kid is from Nigeria he was just
like a kid in a village all he had was a
Nokia phone and he basically created an
application with that all right and then
you know what time he got a little bit
better people started appreciating the
fact that you know how the hell did this
kid build something like this with a BS
phone you know like look at this like on
this phone you know what I mean like
people come here we're like man I don't
even have a computer guys you have an
Android phone do you know that Android
there's literally a whole bunch of
applications where you could come in and
code in there and create your
applications through there through your
own phone you could create an
application you could create your own
website through your own phone you don't
even need a computer okay and this
websites out there if you computer slow
or whatever you could use something like
code sandbox that I oh alright and or
repple de IT and pretty much build the
application there ok so there's really
no excuse for you guys man you know this
kid built this thing with this now you
know now with the proper training and
you know being around the right people
now he's in you know in a starter from
MIT now of course you're probably
thinking oh man you know they probably
felt bad for him they set him off gave
him new computers and all that stuff it
could be true let's be honest it could
be true you know but what got him there
is the fact that he had the skills right
he had the determination to come in and
say hey I'm gonna build something
I have a lot of ideas I don't have to
write you know the right training I
don't have the right tools but look what
I could do with just this you know what
I'm saying so it opens doors for you you
have to work hard right if you're still
thinking like man I don't know if I can
make it I don't know if I can do this
guys if you're still thinking like that
like you only hurting yourself
all right and you probably do get in
your head like man Joe what you doing
free coal camp you talk bad about free
Coquette guys I don't talk bad about
free coal camp I actually like free coal
camp what I said to people was the fact
that you can fall in a trap of just you
know there's a word that a real tough
candy said man it was something like
tutorial heaven you know what I'm saying
like everything on a tutorial is perfect
right
but the real world doesn't work like
that right you could come in and go to
free coal camp and just follow along the
little tutorials that they have there
but you're not really building anything
you're just like following along things
that are in the documentation but that's
all I said you can use it for practice
but you also need to use other tools and
other places to really learn this stuff
so you know I tell people all the time
just don't fall into the trap of like
you know I'm just gonna go to freako
campaign do the little assignments there
and that's a I know how to code no you
need to build websites those are the
things that's gonna get you to become
successful but one good thing about
freako camp that i really enjoyed is the
fact that they always have new articles
you know a lot of people like freako
camp so they come in and share their
articles and share their stories with
the community and you know a lot of
those guys they make it because of
freako camp but they like to share it
because freako camp has such a large
community now if you release an article
here
you pretty much reach out to like
400,000 different developers or
up-and-coming developers so it's a great
platform for that
all right now going back to this caveman
like I mean like what more do you guys
want
you know what I mean like as far as
motivation it's like man is this kid
could make it what a freaking Nokia
phone like I know exactly what type of
form this is because back in 2001 2002 I
used to have a phone like this
and used to make my own beats on it and
I also used to make little programs in
it or if you ever user was that Native
Instruments calculator I forgot Texas
Instruments calculator pretty much you
could do some programming in there too
like I remember playing Pokemon on on a
friend's calculator because he actually
put in Pokemon inside of his calculator
so yeah man like you come in and learn a
lot man and it's all about your
determination man if you over here
worrying about man how old I am
I don't have money I don't even know if
I can afford this I don't know if I can
take some time off to to learn this if
you worrying about that man you're
always gonna be one of those people for
the rest of your life that's gonna be
wondering like why if I would have
became a developer what if I woulda came
in and worked hard you know there's
people that's here on this channel right
now that they've been here for a year
and they know who they are and they've
had a lot of improvements all right some
of them are still scared to go for job
interviews and I tell them all the time
man what are you doing you need to start
going for job interviews like you
already know the skills now it's just
about just being confident just show up
to the job interview even if they don't
hire you the first one or the second one
or the third one on the fourth one
you've learned everything that you
needed to say and all the things that
you need to do to become a developer so
on the fourth one you will get that job
it's just how any career is you know
people that you know are some of them
are lucky they might come in and get the
job too
day you might just check off all the
checklist that they need and then I okay
this person who knows HTML CSS
JavaScript check this person has
experience with the backend and PHP even
though we use let's say Java or they use
asp.net this person already has
experience with the backend so we can
train him with dotnet so let's give him
that check so now he got that little
check he said okay cool we could hire
this person
you got what I'm saying so don't worry
about if you're going to be able to do
this guy's trust me anybody can do this
it's just now everybody will do it it's
a big difference
everybody can do it but not everybody
will do it you get what I'm saying
out of everybody else here this what
12,000 people right 12,000 people I will
say 4,000 of those people will really
follow through all right
and then that's just how it is you know
that's why that's the beauty of it right
like I love everybody that's here but
let's be honest not everybody is going
to make it because not everybody works
as hard not everybody wants to do it
everybody wants to have the the final
outcome which is a large paycheck
security benefits you could start your
business your own company but the
journey to get there not everybody wants
to go through it
not everybody wants to come here and be
in front of a computer you know after
work for two three hours right not
everybody wants to do that you came home
you work at a restaurant you work at you
know as retail you work at an office
doing data entry after you come home at
6 o'clock you don't want to come home
and spend another 2-3 hours in front of
a computer right if you're feeling like
that you're not going to make it all
right
the people that come in and say hey I
want this this year I came in and I'm
only making 30,000
next year I want to make double that I
want to come in and make 6070 thousand
eighty thousand all right your job is
not gonna offer them you owe for that at
all they don't offer you that at all
let's be honest they just not you know
most jobs come in in the villa hey man
we gotta give you a little race of 3%
per year or or even less than that you
get what I'm saying like you're how long
is gonna be till you get to double your
your paycheck it's gonna take you a lot
of years on that bs job that you working
on it's like hey you work at for example
you work at FedEx you're getting $18 and
it's like for you to become a manager
this guys in there that's been 20 years
inside of FedEx you know driving the
truck they've never being able to make
it to manager that's just how it is
that's how the world works so why are
you gonna do you're gonna get stuck in
there and keep on doing the same BS job
well you're gonna say you know what I'm
gonna try another career something
that's gonna you know help me grow as a
person and at the same time is something
fun something that I can enjoy so guys
take this example for this kid I'm gonna
add the article in the comment section
and yeah Manley check this kid out oh
you know read his story see all the
things that he's been through um and
just take it as inspiration man it's not
for you to come in and be like oh man I
just gotta be lazy and I'm gonna you
