about operators all right so let's say
we want to add two numbers how are we
gonna do this same thing that we would
do in life you know just to add two
numbers we use the plus sign right it's
the same thing as programming okay so
we're gonna say something like this is
gonna say two plus two all right and
that's going to return back the total of
four okay let's say we wanted to do for
example let's say four minus two okay
then that's going to be as you guys can
see the number two all right now same
thing if we come here we do hey I want
to multiply three times four
okay it takes a little while because you
gotta think about it got to compile
everything and interpret everything so
hey we're doing this on the browser
right so it takes a little bit longer so
it's 3 times 4 is 12
all right there from day if we want to
divide we could just say like this
something like 12 divided by 4 and
that's going to equal to 3 and one thing
that you're gonna see is we got 3.0
which is a float okay anything with a
decimal that's a float all right
so and nothing that we're gonna go into
we're gonna say hey if I wanted to
basically come in the division but you
want to say give me the floor number you
could say 12 divided by 4 is 3
but if we say something like let's say
15 divided by 4 is
se3 okay so now if we want to do a
modulus all right so let's say you got
20 modulus 3 okay you see the number 2
all right now let's talk about other
operators okay right now this is what I
call the math operators right this is my
way of calling it you know people call
it arithmetic because I believe it's
arithmetic operators but I just call it
math okay now this operators you can
also use it with variables so you could
literally come here and say something
like this you can say a equals to 4 and
then you can say B equals 2 let's say 3
and then you could say C equals to a
times B and then you come here and it
will basically print out the total say
hey we'll see and automatically you will
get the answer takes a little while I
don't know why it takes so long but as
you can see pretty much it's like hey C
equals to 12 all right so if you print
it out that's why it shows you all right
we've run this one more time and as you
can see 12 there you go all right so the
next thing that we're gonna talk about
is other operators all right other
operators that we use for relational
situations okay so let's say right now I
wanted to check if the number 4 is
greater than the number 3 okay I will
say you like that just like regular math
guys I know you remember this from like
junior high school or elementary school
like it's very simple
you're just doing it with a program
alright so as you can see a well 4 is
greater than 3 all right so it basically
equals the true
right if we come in and we do the
opposite way we say it's for less than
three then it's gonna tell you hey this
is false
now I know you seen this where we say a
equals two to three right and this is
what we call assigning a variable all
right when you see that one equal sign
but when you see two equal signs is to
check if it's equal to the same thing
all right so we're gonna do this we're
gonna say B we're assigning it the
number five okay and if we come here and
we say print a equals 2 to B all right
so all we're saying is it's the number a
okay well the variable a equal to the
variable B is it the same number is it
the same words it says the same letters
all right we're gonna check this out
and it's s is false okay so that's
pretty much it
all right now you got other ones where
you say hey is this not equal to okay so
you come here and say it's a not equal
to B right is it the same right so
you're saying hey it's a not the same as
B and that's going to return true okay
and the reason why is returning true is
because it's like hey man a is not be
okay so it is true all right now the
next thing that we can also do is
basically check your face greater than
or equal to so we could come here and
say something like this let's say
greater than or equal to 2b okay
it says it's false now we're gonna do
the opposite and we're gonna say is the
variable a less than or equal to B and
it's gonna say it's true now if B was 3
it will also say true because it's equal
to the same thing so you're basically
saying hey is this less than or equal to
it and
both the same thing so it's like okay a
and B is both three so that's true
now if it was less than it will also be
true okay
same thing with greater than if I come
here and I say a is greater than or
equal to B is gonna say hey it's true
all right now another one that we want
to check out is basically logical
operators okay and I usually use this
for situations when I'm doing like if
statements so I will usually do
something like this where I will say
like this I will say a a plus B okay a
plus B right okay something like this a
plus B greater than then B okay and then
I will say and let's say a I'll put this
in the parenthesis I'm gonna say a
is actually equal to 2b okay so what I'm
doing here is I'm saying hey if this
statement here is true okay and this
statement here is true then the value
itself is gonna return back true okay so
I'm gonna run this as you see it says
true all right and that's because a plus
B is 6 and then 6 is greater than B okay
so that's a true statement right here
and then you come here and you say is a
equal to B and then that's also a true
statement
all right now just to make it easier for
you guys I'm gonna put this here in a
comment all right so when you do the
hashtag that basically writes a comment
so you basically whatever you write
inside of that line it doesn't run in
the code okay
so you can put a little comments for a
documentation or like a comment you want
to leave for another developer so for
you guys I'm gonna explain this I'm
gonna come here I'm gonna say you know
if this is true and this is true okay
then it returns so true okay now if I
come here and I'll say like this I'm
kind of copy this alright I'm gonna say
true and false all right if true and
false then this is going to be false
okay now if I come here and I say false
and false
then this is going to be false okay now
let's talk about the or alright so
you're gonna come here and I'm gonna
change this up I'm gonna put or alright
so we're gonna say okay so if a plus B
which is six is greater than B or a
equals to B then is going to say true
okay so we're gonna come here I'm gonna
copy this I'm gonna just add this for
you guys to to have you know for future
references you're gonna say and this was
going to be for the or alright and we're
gonna say if this is true or this is
true that this is gonna be true okay now
if we say if this is true or this is
false
alright then it's going to be true
now if this is
false and this is false then this is
false
okay all right so the next one you know
is basically not all right so you can
actually use not whenever either one is
is not true and that's gonna return back
a true statement so we're gonna come
here and say not now let's look at a
good situation where you we used to not
so let's say for example we're gonna
change
beats actually equal to seven and then
we're going to say something like this
we're gonna say C equals to a greater
than B okay and automatically C is going
to be I see you guys can see let this
load a false statement
all right so what we want to do is to
check if it's not true if it's not a
true statement then I want to be able to
return back true so I'm gonna say C
we're gonna come here we're gonna say
not C okay so what you're saying is this
C variable is actually false and because
it's false when use not is going to
actually turn back true okay now if you
want to say something like this flip it
up and we say okay a is less than B
which is 3 is less than 7 then when you
say not see it means hey this is not
true so basically is gonna say is false
okay it's gonna return back false all
right but not I don't really use it that
much using in different ways but I don't
really use it like this with the not I
usually find better ways to actually do
this but yeah let's move on to the next
operators which are assignment ok right
now we've been using this type of a sign
right we basically saying hey hey the
variable a we're signing it the number
three okay now let's say for example I
wanted to come here and say a is equals
to a plus a plus three let's say for
example right so now I'm reassigning it
one more time so I first I said the
letter a is equal to three and then I'm
saying letter A is going to be a plus
three which is gonna be six okay so if
we print this out we say print so we're
gonna say print a and we're gonna come
here as you can see is gonna say six now
instead of us assigning it like that how
about we come here and make it shorter
right and make it nice and sweet so what
were you gonna do is we're gonna say a
plus equals three so what it's saying is
a is equal to a plus three so this is
the same thing that we had before as you
can see it returns back six all right
now we could also do the same thing with
other operators instead of the plus
we're gonna say a minus three so the new
a is equal to a equals 2a minus three so
that's zero we can also come here and
say multiplication and actually come in
and say hey the new variable of a is
equal to nine
we can also come here and say division
and as you can see it's gonna say 1.0
you come here and put in floor as you
see it says 1 we can also come here and
put a modulus okay
zero all right now I almost forgot to
tell you guys about exponents so let's
say I wanted to do 3 to the power 3 so I
could come here and say like that and
basically comment that out for a second
so you guys can see that's actually
equal to 27 now if I want to do it with
an assignment I could literally say like
this let's say a equals to 3 and then I
say I'm saying the new value of a is the
a to the power of 3 and we run that and
as you see it's 27 alright guys so
that's pretty much it those are the
beginning operators that I feel like you
guys need to know at first for Python
and yeah I'll see you guys later it's
your boy Joe back at it again coding
fees.com your boys back in HOD and did
it again I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
