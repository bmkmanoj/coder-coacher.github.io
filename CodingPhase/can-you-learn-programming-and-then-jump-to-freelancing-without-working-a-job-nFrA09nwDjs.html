question from your boy warty son he
basically he sent me uh you know a
message that he wanted me to answer so
before I go to sleep I'm gonna answer
this for him
basically he said can you learn
programming and then jump to freelancing
without working a job yes you could
definitely do it you know you can find
yourself a job online like you could go
to like let's say for example uh where's
a PHP lair about right this this website
called laravel or jobs I think it's
Larry jobs calm so let me see if I can
share this with you okay hopefully the
stream is way better now and you guys
could definitely see it so Larry jobs
here are remote as you can see a remote
remote so long as you can work like us
hours you know they have some jobs and
you know all over the world but you
could definitely get a job remotely
without having to work for a company
like you know you could just do
freelancing
if freelancing doesn't mean just getting
a client a freelancing could be you're
working for a company for like six
months you know you got a contract for
six months and they tell you hey you're
gonna make $4,000 a month or 2,000 or
3,000 whatever it is that you guys get
to decide on to do and basically yeah
both agree upon it and pretty much you
you can start working ok remotely this
is other website called remote ok that I
oh there's another pretty legit website
created by level style yo he's the one
that created this website and pretty
much older the jobs here are
are basically a remote okay like as you
can see you got seen a job you got will
be a rails or let's see
what else they're having here like every
week there's new jobs every single week
this away new jobs you know come here
and do like a search for guys right here
let's say you want it oh sorry okay this
is like supportive or support engineer
contract work there's like the last what
is the last five days this month it's
constantly changing here like every
every few days it changes a adds new
ones you know a lot of times people pick
up these jobs pretty quick
you know people getting here super quick
you can go to stack overflow there's
definitely like a lot of jobs there that
you could do remotely right so that's
technically freelancing all right you
can find a client you could work
full-time it all depends on you what you
want to do you know react native in
rails engineer you know for a full-stack
engineer Ruby see like sometimes when I
see like moving around like constantly
you know I was like you're gonna find
this especially for remote work like
Ruby on Rails is like one of the the top
hiring you know programming languages or
frameworks that you know most people
work remotely okay because you don't
need an office for this they got trust
before results okay so you got solutions
architect Ruby senior
Ruby application senior senior full
stack engineer you know a lot of times
like I told you guys just because you
see that's a senior it doesn't mean that
you can't apply to it senior just means
that you know your that's it that's
all that it really means so let me see
it just means that you're comfortable
way with the language or the framework
it just doesn't mean that you gotta be
here for 10 years as a developer nah it
just means you're comfortable you're
very good at what you do that's it
you know I mean but yeah man so sorry
man I don't know why I'm like my throat
is like killing me now I've been like
talking for like the past I don't know
since 8 o'clock today about recording
videos for this Ruby on Rails course so
that's what's going on but yeah let me
see the chatroom see holes in there
hopefully Hardison that answers your
your question you know what I mean so
hopefully that that can help you out you
know you can also check out fiverr.com
which is for for people that think like
oh yeah fiber comm is only five dollars
like you have to be a idiot to think
like so many people will be on that
website for five dollars like people go
in there because they they gotta get
that money you know what I mean like you
come in and you tell somebody oh yeah
your first thing is five dollars and but
if you want any changes or you want
anything more complicated it's gonna be
like two hundred three hundred dollars
so it's a gay man
let me see what else what else what else
what's the opinion upwork get part-time
work on there yeah work is great the
only problem is sometimes unless you
have the right portfolio unless you have
the right projects like just like
anything else you might see yourself
competing with Indian workers who are
working for like $3 an hour you know
what I mean so for them might be a good
deal for us
really sucks cuz it's like really like
cutting us up you know what everybody's
like hey man you guys charging twenty
thirty dollars an hour forty dollars an
hour we're gonna charge four dollars
you're charging thirty imma charge $3
you charge $20 imma charge four dollars
like you know I was like so it's like
it's kind of messed up in up work but at
the same time there's a lot of
professionals and up work so guys that
are charging our reasonable prices so it
really helps out the industry as far as
like working remotely in getting clients
but yeah man oh oh what else
yeah just read
right now all lo mein is in here your
boy Hector burn Alice in here my
calluses in here
how can I become an expert at Ruby by
building applications every single day
build every single application you could
think of try to rebuild everything
that's out there
everything from Instagram to Facebook to
snapchat to you to try to recreate it
and that's it if you could you're able
to recreate any application out there
that means you're and that you're an
expert because that's saying you've
gotten to that level it also tool once
you get to a certain level where you're
like okay I could build all the
applications then now you gotta get to
the way of like designing your you know
architecture for like of like you know
of your application you know like that's
another level you you want to go in
there start reading books for that you
know like those are things that you're
not gonna learn on the Internet
like you need to read it from like
expert on architect and you know
infrastructures like what development my
canister says he been coding for Ruby
for over a year but still find it
difficult to understand popular will be
repos like device you have to go into
device and go like line by line and try
to understand that like that or you can
try and create your authentication
system from scratch there's a lot of
tutorials on that on YouTube and or like
online or on the net where you can
search it so you can understand how
device actually works
Carter Carter says Rubio rails I heard
that was dead and it's just like this
thing keeps on getting repeat it and
repeat it and repeat it like you know
it's like you know it's like when
somebody comes in and be like hey man
you know when the first time I heard
Ruby was dead and around 2013 we are in
2017 and there's like a million jobs out
there a Ruby on Rails I don't know how
it I don't know how I guess it's like a
zombie movie or Rails is a zombie out
here is that the third most used
framework out there on the web on the
whole web it's the third most used
framework after PHP after that net comes
to Ruby on Rails and somehow is like
walking around like a zombie because it
died years ago according to the internet
Oh God
let me see yeah what is saying um you
know I just try to help people out
whenever you have a question send assume
you meant yeah man
Ruby's not that that's like saying Java
is dead exactly
these work cheap on Fiverr yeah but
that's how it is I mean look if you live
in the United States why wouldn't you go
work at a company right you're gonna get
benefits you're gonna get everything all
right now once you become an expert in
your field whatever it is that you're
doing then you could go out there and
start charging top dollars you can go to
top tool with the top tool something
like that that they hire only experts
and they make sure that you get paid you
could go in there and start getting like
you know $80 an hour and 60 dollars an
hour but you gotta be expert you gotta
go in there take like a million tests
you gotta go in there and do a whole
bunch of BS me personally I never like
top tool because I'm like I just not
gonna waste my time like they want you
to do like a week's work a week's worth
of work for free just to get accepted
and it's like bro I'm not gonna give you
a whole week of my time like you could
keep that like I'm not desperate but
yeah but if you really wanted to go hard
and go hey man go do it
Brandon King how is up work any
different for fiber it will depends man
like you can understand man when you
work on on the internet you work online
you gotta know how to market yourself
you gotta know how to present yourself
which is why I tell people stop building
be as applications stop building stuff
that looks horrible right you want to
sell yourself as if you are one of the
best developers out there right then I
wish I could just show something I would
show like two different applications
like okay for example right I'm gonna
take this I'm gonna share this screen
okay oh yeah right
so this is the blog post that I'm
basically working on Ruby on Rails right
there's a nice design nice website yes I
have Dragon Ball Z pictures on it just
to make it simple you can fill it in
with whatever but it's a very nice
design very clear very very clean right
when a website like this you share it to
somebody and say hey this is a blog that
I created on Ruby on Rails and you know
something professional somebody's gonna
look at this and be like oh this is cool
this is nice but if you come in and be
like hey let me see
trap template
I think tell you guys like okay yeah
here you know this is what people are
creating this is the type of websites
that people are sharing on their
portfolios right they take bootstrap and
say hey here's my application your
application looks like so it's like
if your application looks like
you can't expect nobody to come in and
pay you top dollar you get what I'm
saying if you come in you have the same
the same application but your
application looks like this nice and
clean there's my tiger nice typography
you click on it hey still not done it's
a lot of stuff that we're working on but
the design of it it's nice it's like it
makes you look like you are professional
if you to go to this website a Awards
com right look at all the websites that
they have here this is like the best of
the best this is not like you know
little Johnny from the internet that
came in here and started working on this
type of website it's like there's a
websites to have nice design it's
usually a team of developers who created
it
you got a designer you got a couple of
you know developers creating the website
so let's say this one looks nice and
clean very simple but the typography is
a plus
I mean maybe I noticed it because I went
to school for design and I understand
how typography typography works in sorry
I'm freaking sleepy but
typography works out spacing works how
you know all these things work like
hierarchy like everything looks nice and
clean okay
but if you show up to a page you should
send somebody a freakin your portfolio
your portfolio looks like this all your
projects look like this is like you know
like how are you expecting to get high
or high are you expecting to get top
dollar you know what I mean oh fiber
calm you gonna find a lot of websites
are done like that just bootstrap it
just looks horrible right it just looks
horrible and as a client the client is
gonna look at them but I know I don't
want that like you know you know what I
mean Adrian Lincoln is like yo lol your
application looks like but it's
true you know if that's just being
honest man so it's like you want to be
able to be on top of the game you don't
want to be showing up and looking like
one of the fiber guys you want to look
like hey man how the hell is this guy
working on fiber that's the impression
that you want to give to a client and
like once you get them you get them you
know what I mean like you know how many
people I got on craig's that is like in
the beginning like I got a client still
ty hit me up for fixing websites that I
did like four years ago
like you know just to clean it up and
this Amanda's you know that's $45 an
hour
all I had to do is just change the menu
from blue to red or something like that
in hey it took me one second but that's
$45 you know what I'm saying so but at
the same time I was like you you gotta
you gotta sell yourself man
she might portfolio consists of web apps
or websites ah both you should have
liked websites which means like landing
pages and you know a couple of static
sites and then you should have like full
application like things that are dinner
with api's things started dealing with
you know the back end which is what I
was sending people like hey you got to
start playing around with the back end
you just doing the front end it's not
gonna get you nowhere but hey man what
do I know man I'm just some developer
that actually did it you know and I mean
I actually they all the things that you
guys are going through right now and
already passed through it like I already
passed it all that stuff the only
difference is like I didn't have nobody
to tell me what to do
all this stuff I found out by making
mistakes Brandon Kings ah yeah you need
some water Joe get some water get your
boy some water real quick yeah I'm
seeing the same tired man but yeah man I
just wanted to answer the on the
question from from I was his name words
what isn't 10 word is intent
I just wanted to answer his question
real quick but yeah man
that's nothing to man a lot of you guys
don't don't have the creative artistic
side of you know doing like the front
end like if you don't even have that in
you and you don't even want to be
dealing with like creating stuff that
looks really nice
you know really nice and clean like
that's not really your calling your
calling is more the back end cuz you
enjoy programming you get what I'm
saying like the front end is like
dealing with stuff in them the front end
of what what the user is gonna see the
back end is where you do more
programming so you know what I mean so
yeah man
anyways guys I'm out of here so you boys
joke back at it again before your boy
Joe passes out right here all right

on the live stream right now that's
crazy it's 2:40 in the morning son how

know it's crazy man you want to check
go to coding phase comm um go to
