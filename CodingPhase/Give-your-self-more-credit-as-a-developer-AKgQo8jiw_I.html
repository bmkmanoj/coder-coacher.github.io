it again coding face.com
your boys back and out and did it again
listen guys I'm gonna say this I want
you guys to give yourself more credit
give yourself more you know more to
yourself more credit to yourself like
you know sometimes you may take my old
man my employer is not it's not
supporting me my employer is not how you
call this Lake doesn't care about me and
this and that and it's like yeah you
probably right they don't care about you
but you got to give yourself more right
you got to know your work you got to say
hey man I don't need this people they
need me that's what you got to think in
your head as a developer you got
understand that you're somebody woulda
Talent somebody would've skill you're
you're not you know Johnny Smith the
mechanic and I'm not saying that the
mechanic is anything wrong but you
really busted your butt to learn all the
stuff you either spent years or months
to get to to this point where you at now
where
you're working with clients or working
with a company and you know sometimes
they they might not care about you they
might not care about your well-being
they might not you know pay you what
you're supposed to be getting paid don't
worry about that and you had you gotta
think like man I'm not here you know I'm
not here because I need them
I'm here because they need they need me
it's that simple
like it or not you don't really need any
company out here because so be honest
with you guys there's so many ways you
guys can make your own money on your own
but without having to need to work for a
company there's so many different ways
man you could be selling you know
WordPress themes you could create you
white kids start selling them you can
create our code snippets and sell those
you could create scripts and sell those
things you could create a
software-as-a-service and and that's it
create your own company a lot of people
do it the only problem is that you know
a lot of developers don't understand how
the business works you know people think
hey I just finished from a boot camp I
should get a job
hey I just learned all of this courses
from you to me or I learned it from yo I
should get a job
hey I should go and hike all is it
I just finished college and I graduated
I should get a job sometimes you don't
have to
if you know how how to make money out
here you know in the sense of like like
one you could be a client of course so
you could create your software
as-a-service
create like a cool a cool web app you
know I see people on Facebook making so
much money just like on little html5
games that's that's not hard at all like
I'm telling you you always got to think
of yourself as an independent you cannot
think like you're gonna be depending on
somebody you don't need anybody you know
as a developer you have a skill man
trust me you gotta give yourself more
work like you know you gotta be like man
I'm not worth that I'm not worth you
know what 2530 dollars an hour I'm worth
more than that I have a skill
so you should get paid more you know
especially because there's so many
companies that do launch
sometimes you might be in a company that
they don't want you or they don't care
about your but they don't appreciate you
you gotta be like man why am I here you
know I mean like why are you staying
there you don't have to stay there
there's a whole bunch of companies out
there sometimes you know people is do
things for fear you know they scared to
go get a new job they scared to leave
and have to start all over it and
whatever roots you had in a certain city
yard
or location you already set roots and
you're like man I don't know if I should
leave and listen and know I might just
leave stop worrying about it you know
you live in a in the middle of nowhere
and I don't know Cincinnati somewhere or
Arkansas or something like that and
you're like man the most i'ma get is
sixty thousand here but I know if I go
to another city I won't make a hundred
thousand if you really care about that
money and you're on you know your way of
life is gonna be so much better then
leave go to another city you don't have
to stay in that town that you grew up in
at all you had to move guys you have to
always reinvent yourself in you know
keep it moving
you know that's why I always tell people
man he's gotta keep it moving for real
like you're gonna know you're worse man
I said developer you have a skill you
gotta think about that man you have a
skill trust me people want you stop
thinking like oh man
I need this job I can't leave this job
because benefits just here is good and
this is not know who cares
go to another job you get other benefits
too and probably even better you know
you should never be stuck to anything
never give a company a client an
employer the power to control you in one
thing - guys this there's something that
I tell people all the time watch your
finances all right watch your finances
never get yourself in more depth than
you need to be because then you become a
slave to the system then you get stuck
to a job because it's like let's say you
buy a house where you know you know the
house is almost seventy four seventy
percent of of your whole income seventy
percent of your your check go straight
to your house that means you messed up
that means you completely messed up
because now you're depending on that job
you can't leave that job you leave that
job one month I say you're you're behind
on your mortgage two months you behind
on the mortgage a few months you know I
mean like god forbid you know they tryna
take your house back you know
but that's why you should never get into
something that it's out of your league
man because you become a slave to it
right you know even some people that get
into cars and it's like when I was about
to buy this car at first I was like man
I don't know if I should buy it because
I don't like to feel tied down in this a
big commitment I'm paying almost $800
for this car right now
the the year before that was my rent you
know what I mean so in my head I'm like
man I'm paying as much as I paid for
rent last year for a car but that's fine
because I'm making that much but I was
about to buy a Maserati all right that
would have been $1,200 all right per
month right that would have been crazy
now that I think about I'm like yelling
what was I thinking oh I was got myself
in and something that would have been
like I don't know like half of my check
per week legs that would have been crazy
you know what I mean so
it would have been too much and just of
a car but you know sometimes we fall
into that trap and then that's when you
get stuck to a job because now you have
all these bills are depending on that
job you was basically in getting things
that are completely dependent on that
income that that job gives you so you
have no flexibility you can't say hey
I'm gonna move somewhere because you
can't because now you're stuck you got a
house
you can't you try to get a job this is
gonna make you happier but they're gonna
pay you a little bit less you can't do
it because you have so many bills on top
right so you gotta know your worth guys
that's what I'm gonna tell you guys for
this video know your worth
know that you just gotta be out here get
your skills but know what you have right
into it smart don't be a slave to the
system know that companies need you you
don't need companies right a lot of
people you know employers walk around
with this chip on the shoulders like
they are you insane oh you crazy like I
don't need to be here
you know what I mean that's how that's
how you gotta think in your head you
know like sometimes a manager you might
see a manager let's say a project
manager or something like that and it's
like they need that job because they
have no skills besides our bullshit
business degree and then the only way
that they're going to get a job is doing
the same things that they they're doing
their brain which is just either in
business or project managing but they
have no skills they can't just be like
hey I'm gonna go independent they can't
open up their own business
people they just depending on whatever
is there whatever the company gives them
you know what I mean so you you actually
in the whole different situation so you
gotta know your work man
so yeah man I'll see you guys later love
