back out of the game man : fingers calm
listening boys back I didn't did it
again hold on I gotta get my water man
you know got a little hydrated all right
so so this topic is first impressions as
a first you know first time developer
somebody who's about to be hired during
a developer whatever you want to call
yourself right whatever the market wants
to call you all right so how exactly can
you make a very good impression for
people to be like oh man this guy he got
his together like we should
definitely hire it look I was saying
like I was talking about here first of
all you gotta have the right portfolio
you don't want to have a portfolio full
of to do apps full of you know little
things like like little examples that
you know that people start putting
on their portfolio which shows like oh
they could do algorithm oh they could do
uh you know slice the array or
 push into an array like come on
guys like don't put down your portfolio
then because that looks like you're like
the little high school student who who
just learned how to program when you go
for a job it's just like any other job
out there right just like any position
that you might be going you want to show
that you have experience you want to
show that you actually know what the
hell you're talking about that you're
not just so beginner guy that they're
going to give a chance to and for the
next six months we're basically going to
be training all the time
you should want to actually put in from
your part and you know just show people
that you care right show people that
you're working on real projects show
people that you working on cool things
that they could be like oh wow this guy
created a website which basically goes
into Spotify API and then basically we
returns back a list of songs that
somebody can actually like or something
cool one of them doing the Star Wars API
just to play around with it or I don't
know like you could song connect to the
Zillow API which is a major real estate
website right and find out different
apartments in your location you can go
ahead there's a website that shows you
the cheapest all apartments around your
neighborhood right you can create
something like that you go create an API
or you know something like I said a
Google API for Google Maps right and so
I don't know the best little freaking we
dispensaries in San Francisco or LA
whatever right something that shows you
can come in and create quotient and
nobody's going to have to hold your hand
you know what I mean like that's what's
important that should be your first
impression the first impression should
be like hey no one needs to hold my hand
hire me and I'm good to go
that should be the first impression that
people should be getting from
so at the same time always you know try
to come in come on early at least the
first few months coming early make sure
you get there on time
once you do there for like a month two
months who cares
you already proved your point you're
like okay I could get here early if I
want to now if I coming late a little
while is all right nobody's going to
kill you about it
just make sure you're good at
your job that's one thing is if you're
bad at your job and take forever to
coding and on your code look sloppy
then you know you can't complain when
people start telling you like oh get
here early that I like just do your job
in order moon also - yes
you know the good to work in flip-flops
you know sometimes people may be very
highly coders you know they very free
when it comes to like startups and stuff
like that right you'll see people in
shorts you'll see people in and
flip-flops but for you to be taking
serious and you want people to take you
serious at all times don't show up to
work on flip-flops don't show up to work
and shorts maybe we're just a regular
t-shirt that's fine don't worry you
don't have to wear a button-down all the
time all right so that's fine but don't
wear flip-flops because it's just even
if you're a brand new developer or evil
season develop break it just doesn't
look good it doesn't look like you're
there to work you're there to really
bust your ass and and work hard it just
looks like oh there's a hangout spot
even though some other people might do
it you don't want to be part of that
crowd you don't want to be the part of
the crowd like oh we look like we're in
our basement long
you don't want to do it we want to give
a first impression of okay that's
personally easier to work he's really to
bust up you know busting ass up out here
and yeah so that's what I was thinking
because also too you never know who's
going to come into the office
you never know somebody from another
company might swing by and they like
your skills but now they look at you in
the leg
this is young the guy in flip-flops with
shorts on and I'll Mohawk I
don't know you know I mean like just be
presentable be presentable at all times
it doesn't have to be like crazy like
you see me I'm not out here crazy like
I'm all over here like super dressed up
or anything I'm laid-back dressed up but
at least I go in there and absolute
people show it something people
in chocolate icing
I'm like man this is work well I mean
like if anybody comes in and sees me
like this what they are thinking one so
always the first impressions should be
something that
people's going to look at Jimmy like
okay this person he's a hard worker he's
he knows what he's doing he's not here
looking like crazy
doesn't come in with a bullshit-ass
portfolio of light here's three
different ways to do it to do that like
nobody cares about that
I always tell you guys when we were
going to portfolio create real projects
man it doesn't matter if it's a real
client or not create a real project and
have a nice design you will keep leaving
this out man people keep leaving
this out and and creating their own
designs man when you put in something in
your portfolio that's what's going to
show that you know what you're doing
this one's going to show that the
website is you working on our top lines
you don't want to work on a site or
basically you know also the people that
you've worked on some city s website you
want to show them the best right so if
you're not a designer and you don't have
the skills right now at this moment
listen it ain't seem to basically go
online and
find a dremel layout or go to somebody
else's website and copy and just put it
on your portfolio but redo it from the
beginning right I forgot so as I like it
I'll recreate the website and basically
just keep it on my portfolio but I hate
I created this website and also people
can look at it but oh wow this guy
created this website like it looks real
nice it's fun because even though all
your functionalities work perfectly if
the website looks like nobody cares
well how much work you put in
I don't know matter if you put in 50
hours into one website it doesn't matter
because as soon as the website looks
like automatically is like oh under
the hood it is probably sick no no my
first impression kids right so anyways
now see you guys later there's another
video by employee Joel coding face calm
listen we in here not all not live today
but we ain't here man doing my little
drives alright
and I want you guys to check out the
description and the description I have
courses for those people that want to
become web developers so people don't
want to learn I have the best courses on
my description Harry and I have courses
on my website which everybody who has
taken it has been saying yo I love the
tutorial the school course right I'll
release in the Dallas great one this
week
and then right below it there's a whole
bunch of courses from uniboob you know
they're all $10 right now if you take
advantage you're going to see that

voices out there alright guys I'll see
