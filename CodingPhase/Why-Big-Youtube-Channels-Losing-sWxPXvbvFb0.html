again man coding freeze calm your boys
backing out and did it again guys we
here man we chillin listen Cody freeze
calm all right listen so I'm reading
through the comments and I'm hearing on
what the reading not hearing cuz I can't
hear anything from the comments but
reading from art Bell he says do you
have a Grammy moment for Eli Chris
Parrillo review tech all these guys have
huge number of subs five ten thousand
views I think YouTube is pushing them
out help them out do you have a fix for
this maybe eight years this can happen
even to coding phase YouTube decides you
have been on the system too long and
pushes your video to the bottom of the
list even in Dominica I don't know what
that means even in the mannequin or or
whatever I don't know exactly what that
means but let me break it down to you
guys you know for all of these guys you
know that they're not getting that many
views it sucks right it sucks because of
the way how the algorithm works from
YouTube in the way how you know you
could have two million subscribers right
two million subscribers and they only
show it to 20,000 people that happens
right that happens every single day that
even happens to me I have nine thousand
subscribers they only show it to maybe a
thousand a thousand five hundred people
right now what's the solution to this
the solution is that every time that you
have a video up you say hey this is Eli
the computer guy calm hey this is Chris
Parrillo calm hey this is review check
this is something that I've been doing
since they want for that simple reason
that if you wanted to get my content
you're going to go to my website right
the people who are here they say hey I'm
just gonna focus on YouTube I'm gonna
let you to do all the work I'm gonna let
you to promote me I'm gonna let you to
decide if they want to show me or not if
you leave it to YouTube that's on you
that's your fault right that's
definitely your fault and the fact that
a lot of these guys have even millions
subscribers and don't know what to do
with those millions of subscribers
that's undone you know what I mean like
I can't help everybody you know I mean
like I could try to help people out
giving a little pointer you know giving
a little things just you know to make it
work you know people be like man how are
you doing this you know this and that
with this little amount of subscribers
I'm like because you have to be able to
tap into your audience and give them
what you what they really want you know
it's like let's say an example like
elide the computer guy Eli the computer
guy has a whole bunch of people who are
subscribed to him for his tutorials but
he don't want to do tutorials he want to
be talking about Arduinos and and you
know raspberry pies and nobody cares
about that right none of those guys that
are subscribed to him care about that
that's like right now if I come in here
and I start promoting let's say game
development right I started doing game
development let's say an example right
and I say hey guys I'm switching
everything to game development the
people that are here they're gonna be
like wait what I'm here for web
development why are you switching it
over to game development even though
you're bored with web development you
have to continue doing game development
because what development because in
reality that's what the people are there
for you know what I mean it's like when
I sign up to or subscribe to let's say a
beauty channel I'm not expecting to see
on a beauty channel the girl singing I
want to see some makeup I want to see
listen that etc right and it's the same
thing for tech when a guy signs up or
subscribes to let's say marques Brownlee
right they go to him exclusively for
reviews we don't care about his personal
life we don't care about what he likes
we don't care about his gaming we don't
care about a you know he likes to build
robots on the side we don't care about
that right we're there for the reviews
so show me reviews that's where all of
these guys start messing up you know
like
Perillo he's good he was really like
going up all the time but I believe
after he started doing like a lot of
vlogs and a lot of stuff and I don't
know I think his wife is actually even
more successful in YouTube to him now
you know it's like I love his channel
tool but let me see you know it's just
crazy you know it's like sometimes it's
like it just doesn't work out you got to
know your audience you got to give them
what they want you know it's like the
same thing like here like sometimes if I
come in this is I was guilty of it
myself when I came in here people was
really here for my opinions and and
giving them an insight to how it is in
the industry X Y Z right so that's why
they come here when I first came in I'm
gonna give you you know let's go to
socialblade.com let's go to show you you
know we're proof coding phase calm right
I'm gonna show you what prove and show
you how this thing works
so future projections detail statistics
okay
all right where is it where's my
subscriber count I mean cuz I always get
a lot of views that's for sure but let
me see I want to give you guys with the
right details all right cool
when I first came in here right my
channel was like this going up every
single day because I had content that
people was really wanting to see right I
started actually deviating from that and
started creating other stuff like I came
and I was like okay cool everybody's
gonna you know they gotta mess with me
because they like my content they like
what I do or you know they like the swag
they like the sauce so whatever I create
for them even though it's related to
what development they're gonna like it
you know my channel started going down
that's when I started doing you know
little experimental
things like coming here and doing a hike
oldest there what was the name of it
like the mentorship program with people
like five six people and it was cool cuz
I got to me you know five six people
that were super cool but the same time
and literally tech my my channel because
everybody that was coming here and the
way how the algorithm works is like I
had a momentum I could look I know I
could have probably gotten a hundred
thousand subscribers that first year if
I were to just continue with what I was
going like I had number one keywords on
web developer number one keyword that's
what development number one keyword on
courses what development courses I had
number one keywords on everything right
automatically as soon as I started
changing up my my topic and started
doing experimental things my channel
tanked and started going down and then
it started continue going down when I
still was just creating this this crazy
content which is good
and I was helping people out but was
helping such a small audience that
YouTube was like nobody searching for
this yo nobody's searching for you know
mentorship program nobody searching for
none of this stuff so what happened all
the stuff started going down there from
there now in this month right here this
one I started like promoting all the
people be like oh yeah go check out this
channel go check out my buddy's channel
go check out this and that and people
just pretty much came into the sauce
then so what I was doing before and then
you started running with it their
channel started going up so now they
pretty much took what I was doing my
sauce and started building it there on
the only way but with the ideas that I
already came in with the ideas that made
me ha right and then from there nobody
gives me the promotion you know what I
mean so I was like here telling people
hey go check out this channel go check
out this other channel check out this
guy this and that check out this girl
isn't that whatever right my channel
started going down no matter what no
matter what I did and then I realized
here in July and that's when I you know
people that watched my channel are
every day I was like wait what like my
channel was going up what happened I
realized I went over every single video
I started noticing a trend and started
realizing people were not searching for
mentorship people were not searching for
you know the things that I was putting
out for them they were searching for
those first videos that I had my you
know why become a web developer in 2017
why you know top ten reasons why this
and I or you know here's a tutorial of
HTML CSS he is a tutorial of angular
he's a tutorial of react those sort of
things that people were starting to look
at and then now as you see this a big
change starts going up and it keeps
going up next month is gonna be even
like this is gonna be even higher than
that right because now my subscriber
counts is going up my views is going up
even more and as you can see my view
counts always been there because the
people that subscribe to me they always
come back I want to see what the hell
I'm doing
you know I keep them interesting you
know I give them good topics I'll give
them cool stuff things that you know how
can I say it is like I'll take care of
my subscribers right but when you happen
to be one of this big so are youtubers
like the ones that you say they're not
doing that they're not listening to what
the subscribers really want
so YouTube knows that so YouTube is like
nobody's looking for Arduino put that in
the back burner send them to the back
send them to page twenty thousand you
know what I mean it's not it's not
YouTube's for nobody searching for that
just because you have a large audience
right doesn't mean that that audience
wants to see that well that audience
subscribe to you for what you want to
show them right they subscribe to you
for a topic they subscribe to you for a
certain type of content that's why they
there for the moment you start switching
it up
the moment you start giving away your
own audience to other people think stars
going down it's an algorithm
no the algorithm doesn't know anything
better it's just like okay things are
nobody searching for this titles that
this person is looking and talking about
and even like let's say you can come in
and put a title be like Oh angular 4 but
then the video is all about react
YouTube knows that YouTube knows that
that you basically you put a title
that's fake and then you're basically
trying to click beat it so that's what
happens pretty much it you know so as
far as like those big youtubers man
there's no way to really help them they
gotta help themselves they gotta sit
down and understand how how the world
works like you know you go look at your
audience that audience is still there
YouTube still shows your videos to
people they just not showing them like
you know to the masses you know because
you put in content that nobody cares
about
it's that simple like you know if you
come in if I come in and I start
creating videos about let's say how to
hack your ps4 they're gonna be like Joe
this is not what are we here this is not
what we came here for go create another
channel and go build that other channel
on that don't come in here and mess up
your whole algorithm don't mess you mess
up your whole flow your whole sauce that
you got on YouTube and it's like that's
what you you know what I mean so that's
just a little message and there's like
the technical things that I tell people
like man you gotta come in here be smart
with it if you're thinking like hey
YouTube is supposed to take care of me
YouTube is supposed to give me a million
dollars nah you make that million
dollars yourself you know what I mean
like I'm being honest like give me a
liar the computer guys the SUBSCRIBE
account right now 1 million people that
he got you know in multiple channels
give me that I'll show you what to do
with it
you know what I mean give me Chris
Parrillo so what 200,000 or 300,000
subscribers I'll show you what to do
with that
alright people just gotta use their
brain look into their research and go
into the videos that you did before
or find out why people subscribe to you
make those type of videos stop trying to
make a video or a channel about 30
different topics it's not and nobody's
gonna sign up for you you know nobody's
gonna look for you right because if I'm
looking for react and I'll go into a
channel that I'm like oh he got a cooled
reactor torie I subscribed to him but
then now every single video he drops is
about angular I'm over that way
this isn't what I signed up for it right
so then either I don't unsubscribe or I
just don't look at his videos period and
YouTube knows that they've been okay
how many people from the subscribers
actually searches for this person that's
another thing too
now you gotta keep people interested
like people come here even wanna you
know it's like something like this girl
Barbara say yesterday is like there's
many days that alright I'll do a live
video and there's no audio and that's
like my mistake alright but at the same
time there's like 40 50 60 people on the
live video even if I'm not they can't
hear what I'm saying they hear because
they want to see me this wanna see what
the hell I'm talking about I don't see
what I'm doing this guy's nobody's going
for them I'm being honest nobody's going
for them to look for them and be like oh
I wanna hear what he like the computer I
gotta say take nobody's doing that like
nobody has really no we haven't made a
connection with like that we haven't
made a connection Chris Parrillo like
that and I like CRISPR because he's been
around for like forever that's like one
of those people that I remember like you
know what 2009-2010 around there like
they were doing this it's mad years
later and it's like why is the same
content it's the same desk it's the same
story the same like bro like you guys
those guys make money like I'm like a
bleep compared to those guys right those
guys make money you're telling me that
they couldn't go and spend money into
getting a studio setting up a story you
know how much that cost that cause about
a thousand dollars a month which is
pretty much almost nothing right
right dozen dollars a month rent a
studio then from there create a white
screen create get some lights get some
you know gonna intern to do editing for
you like I look at this guy was his name
but to you unbox therapy right unbox
therapy and this is the definition of
somebody that knows what he's doing he
knows what he's doing he went in and
pretty much a messy studio see if we
destroy the new studio look at this you
see maybe they have a unbox therapy
studio see if we could see images okay
here you go
yeah he got a legit place you know how
much that cost right here no more than
especially for him cause he lives in
Canada in the middle of nowhere a lot of
these youtubers they don't live in
cities like mine I live in New York City
where everything is super expensive if I
wanted to get a place like this this is
gonna cost me like $10,000 or more a
month right you got guys that live in
the middle of nowhere North Carolina on
a mountain they live on on you know Lake
Tahoe in like the guys live in the
middle of nowhere all right you're
telling me they can't go and rent out a
spot like this and be like hey for
$2,000 a month I'm gonna rent out a
studio invest into my channel these guys
mean money that's what I'm saying like
they made their money if they fail now
that's what I'm done you know what I
mean that's what it's like people tell
me like oh man I feel bad for you know
the computer guy I don't I'm being
honest I don't because it's not that
hard it's not that hard
give me those subscribers give me that
audience
give me those ears and
those eyes I'll make something happen I
have something bigger than this I have
20 channels I'll make a network you know
what I mean like you gotta have some
type of brain some type of insight into
this and what pisses me off about the
whole situation with those big guys is
it's like brutal they've been here for a
lot of years you telling me all they've
been doing is pocketing money in their
pockets and buying big computers $20,000
computers and and buying this and that
and paying for trips and paying for you
know going around the country for six
seven months without having to work why
didn't you invest that into a studio why
don't you invest that into better
cameras why didn't you invest that into
a set like right now I'm in this I'm in
this room man I got the the ghetto the
ghetto curtain I got the the ghetto
freakin backdrop this ain't one where we
gonna be at next to you kids right this
is the first year this is where I'm
supposed to be on my first year right on
my fifth sixth seventh eighth year this
isn't what you're gonna be seeing you're
gonna be seeing something huge something
big probably four or five people coming
showing up over here on the calling face
channel dabbing in just like having fun
a couple of my friends I might just have
Matt don't you know just chilling I
might just get Matt a visa like that's
how we're doing it you know what I mean
like you gotta have a vision you gotta
invest into this you can't just be like
hey man I'm just gonna do the same thing
that I did last year and the year before
in the year before in the year before
like it doesn't work like that guys look
up this video um I'm gonna give you guys
a a good video to check out nokia
documentary and missing if it's this one
Nokia case study
yes search this video Nokia case study
guys this guy breaks it down how Nokia
had the chance to be like you know they
were one of the biggest companies in the
world they have fifty to fifty three
percent of the heart or the home market
share of like cell phones and mobile
phones and everything and they pretty
much lost it to Apple and Android and
the company that Google boy which I
believe was called danger they're the
creators of the t-mobile Sidekick right
they're the ones to help Google create
the Android phone right the cut that
company Nokia could have bought it and
then at the end
Nokia yes the CEO of Nokia is a crime at
the end of his his last meeting he's
like we did everything right and we
still lost no matter of fact there's the
quote when he started crying we didn't
do anything
Nokia CEO and the his peace thing we
didn't do anything wrong but somehow we
lost and the reason why they lost is
because they kept doing the same thing
and they thought hey there's not gonna
be no competition there's nobody else is
gonna come up with new things there's no
new topics like some are you know I mean
it's like I looked at a video from he
like the computer guy where he was
saying hey I'm not going to I stopped
doing no man effect was something like I
stopped doing tutorials because there's
already Linda there's you to me this
this this and that and it's like wait
you're telling me you're you're the
tutorial guy you're the guy who who
everybody looks for it in to do
tutorials and yet you let somebody call
traversing media who came in later on
and eat up your whole market pretty much
you know what I mean when you think
about it
right like if I was he like the computer
guy what I would have done is hey people
care about tutorials people care about
my content they come here everybody who
watched my videos from 2009 2010 2011
they were here for tutorials so all that
subscriber count' that he has is really
from tutorials nobody cares about
Arduinos and whatever so why didn't he
just make tutorials
well you to me that's Pluralsight who
cares people you already have an
audience
not even you to me or any of those guys
they don't you have an audience I see
like you have you already have a direct
audience that's looking for tutorials
these guys that wanna die are there that
wanted to be IT workers who are like hey
man there's no jobs for IT workers so
now as you as a youtuber you should
develop that audience be like you know
guys
nobody's there's no jobs for for IT
workers can we switch up to what
development can we search up to Android
development iOS development and then you
would have told um that instead of
letting people like me letting people I
Traverse immediately and people like
Chris or something etc etc whatever
right grow right because the reason why
all of these channels grow because
there's a CO for it
people wanted is a demand for it people
want those tutorials you know what I
mean so it's like and then once somebody
owns that that that market share of the
whole industry whatever the whole
YouTube that says a wrap that person
owns it like I'll be honest I don't
think nobody's gonna be able to take off
traversing media when it comes to
tutorials for a long time I don't think
nobody for it's gonna have to be a
company that's gonna have to really pay
a lot of promotion to beat him because
he already got the audience and he's
just been eating up the audience from
everybody and just creating good
tutorials for free and reality losing
money but um that's fine he has a plan
only he knows his plan plan he has a
plan
you know what I mean so it's like all
this other guys man I don't feel bad I
wish them nothing but the best place I
come on man it's like you know you do
you your channel was now we're gonna go
down because you have so many big
subscribers and you could start be like
creating content about nothing then
that's what happens man luckily I
learned that lesson super early in my
youtube career right we learned that so
early right imagine if I would have gone
to 2 million subscribers or million
subscribers on my first year and I
wouldn't have noticed this right I
thought what I had noticed that big drop
I wouldn't be creating the same content
that I was supposed to be creating and
what I'm doing now so it's like I
learned our lesson pretty early all
right this guy's didn't learn until now
so there you go all right that's my my
answer to that comment you know arbel
you know wish those guys the best you
know but you know I was like I don't
look up to know those guys like I like
Chris hugs because he motivated me into
wanting to become a youtuber you know I
wasn't one of these this nerds out here
you know those guys you know looking
weird and this and that and just like
that wasn't me I saw Chris Hawkes
he's a regular guy I said oh I reckon
like I could do this I could do it too
and then just put a little sauce cuz
nobody else is doing it like this right
and I said yeah
I'm gonna just do it you know what I
mean so when I said that's my Grammy
moment is getting that recognition but I
okay
he showed me love and I appreciate it
that was my Grammy moment just like okay
I got my Grammy cool
let's keep it moving us keep on checking
off things off the bucket list right I
got a lot of things and goals that I
have on my bucket list so that was one
of them alright so yeah man we ain't
here you already lost your boy Joe back
at it again coding phase calm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
