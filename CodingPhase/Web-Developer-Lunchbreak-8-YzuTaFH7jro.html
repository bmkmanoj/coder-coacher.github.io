know it's like raindrops drop tops mm
man just shoving out here finish eating
a little lunch

I really don't even want to go back into
work I got so much that I got to do
today I might have to stay in late it's
one of those days I wasn't going to do a
what develop a lunch break I was
supposed to actually record some new
content for you guys for the tutorial
but I guess I'm gonna do when I get home
you know cuz I don't even want to look
at a computer on my lunch break I just
wanted to eat and just relax chill you
know get some air and uh you know the AC
lay back lay back in a Maybach kid whoa
whoa whoa
lay back drop top I'm and uh good good
and hot ups I'm gonna love my nut box
she just gave me something up but I
don't know guys um yeah man what you
guys are up to today yeah I gotta go
back to my all my old corner man because
there's no reception here there's barely
any reception here it's like I know
probably the connection looks horrible
right now cuz I could see it I only got
one bar on my phone yeah no I know today
I splashed this morning this morning I
splashed out I went all out you know
it's not impersonal so you know so the
people taking a personal it's not
personal man
just I had to set some check layer for
you know the people who are here just
cloning my don't clone my shake man
just do what you do you know gain idea
find your own way find your own lane
into this thing because what's going to
happen like when I start doing this what
you're gonna do it you know what I mean
like what you're gonna do once I stop
doing this like you gotta learn how to
get your you know your own ideas your
own you know it's not that hard
this should be easy all you have to
do is be yourself here that's it and
just share some cool knowledge and some
cool resources to people why did I
delete the video because I said it um
you know I might not feel the same way a
week from now two weeks from now like I
might not even care so me having a video
here where thousands of people is gonna
watch it and like re-watch it and people
gonna record it and save it to their
phone and be like oh sure you remember
that time that Joe passed out you know
like I don't want that
you know so that's why I deleted it
nothing crazy yeah I say what I needed
to be said but it's fine because I know
the people that clone my shed they so
they got to see it somehow
plus it was just a quick rent you know
it's like I got to rent out some time I
gotta get on my Kanye sometimes man
you know spaz out you know like going
stays like you know ghost AZ be like you
know what man this this Awards
go onstage and be like I'm sorry John
summers you're gonna get to talking to
many but you know Christian had the best
 videos and all hear
about God stays with me like I'm sorry
John summers but you know Chris Shaw has
the best videos on the whole
 year on YouTube
pass out you know oh god now is that
drama and he's just messing around man
it's a joke guys you know it's like I
said my channel is my channels where I
must share everything like you know
that's why it's called you to like my
channels now if you're looking for a
professional developer experience and
you would want all you want is code this
is not the channel for you and like I
think by now you guys should know that
like there's a personal channel this is
not a channel where I come here to sell
things to you guys
this is not a channel about oh me just
acting like what I'm not this is a
channel where I just come in here have
fun share my experience
and you know give my advice you know if
people want to believe in it cool if not
I don't care because it's just an
opinion and also you know people wanted
drama then drama is what they will get
but the channel is not about drama
you know so my channel is about just
like you know like me this journey of
becoming a web developer you know what I
mean so that's what I'm saying
yeah no I got a I'm trying not to let
nobody affect me you know but it's like
when when you're like the originator of
a lot of that's going on right now
and now I really feel and I know so that
I'm the reason why a lot of people are
stepping up their game this year because
what I brought in was kind of something
completely different you know it's like
Christian so I was bringing him up
because we kind of brought something
different like me I came in with like a
real life experience
Christian I came in with the vlogs and
like he knows that was something totally
different like this people I'm not gonna
say the name like you guys should know
this people did not even show their
faces until we got into the game a lot
of those people that were making videos
they were just making tutorials without
showing their faces somehow we got into
the game and now they got a camera now
they want to show who they are now they
want to try to be themselves you know
it's like nah man keep doing what you
was doing and let us do what we're doing
you know don't don't copy the wave man
don't copy the style and that's saying I
don't know that's my only thing that's
why I don't even wanna you know am sorry
to everybody as far as like my youtube
friends people that are respect I'm not
watching nobodies videos no more I don't
want to know what anybody's doing period
like I'm not gonna watch none of you
guys videos no more cause number one I
don't have time
number two I don't want to get
influenced by nobody and number three
I'm gonna get mad when I start seeing
 on your channels that I know is
coming from my channel and I'm gonna I'm
gonna get pissed off because
when I create something I just created
off the fly like I don't even think
about it that's why when you guys see I
do a tutorial I don't plan that shape
there's a certain style that I have for
my channel that nobody else has which is
like improvise I just I wake up one day
I'm in a good mood on my cool let me do
a tutorial some happen I work I'm
like cool I'm gonna make an advice about
this you know it's like I saw a new
course on udemy which I like I mean how
cool I'm gonna tell somebody about this
that's how I don't mind my channel I
don't do it planned I don't say oh this
day we're gonna do this this day we're
gonna do that now I just come in here
have fun crack some jokes you know it's
like I just freestyle this no I'm not
I'm not planning anything that this
channel is not gonna be a professional
channel Adam then it's gonna stay like
that even if we will go and
cool this is for me to basically
document
what Bella may know and things that
influence you know five ten years from
now I want to look back on this I put it
look back when we used to use nodejs or
back in the days when we just use PHP
now we're using the Harry Potter
framework you know what I mean I want to
look back on it so it's not impersonal
you know
is your boy jobs not the same hot on
that I just word you had a chat that
today I don't know man there's not that
many people I don't know what's going on
it's fine though because you know what
it is it's three o'clock usually when I
do my live videos will be one o'clock
two o'clock that's the prime time that's
what everybody's like on the lunch
breaks and they get to you know come out
and say what up but today right now it's
kind of dead because there's not that
many people everybody's working right
now most of the people who watch this
channel they work guys
so yeah
yeah exactly that's what I'm saying 84
you basically set it best man you know
that's my problem which I said before
earlier whoever got to see it this
morning yeah got a little glimpse listen
there's people here who who they like oh
who come here and over like oh this guy
is not a real developer I'm like I've
been doing this for five years I've been
working major companies how the
hell am I not a real developer you know
I mean just because I come here and like
I around this YouTube is for fun
I'm not here trying to sell we're
not here I'm not a company I'm
just myself right so that's what it is
all right and then that's people who
just be like oh man they're you know I'm
not gonna do a collab with him because
you know he he's just two crazies to
wild and then yet they come here and
 leech on my start creating
content similar to what I'm doing
started doing the same that I'm
 doing with just a little
variation just like 84 cent I'm not
gonna dab I'm a jab you know what I mean
like come on exactly yup 84 you said it
perfectly man
I basically infiltrated some you
know what I mean listen I'm a glitch in
the matrix imma leave it at that you
know what I mean
like I'm like the you see when
the Matrix movie the Green Line started
coming down and then I all there's
a glitch that's me right there there's a
glitch in this chain they're like oh how
the we let this kid in and it's
like man the kid is too nice with it you
know they don't like the cockiness they
don't like the little swag you know they
don't like the fact that you know my
whole crowd you know from 14 to 26 pick
make they love me
there crowd is like you know 30 thing
just nothing wrong 30-something 40 sorry
is like cool I'm the new generation
these people that is going to start
watching my channel who are like 10
years old 12 years old who are gonna
find my channel but I oh I like this guy
and now I'm gonna get interested into
coding that's the point
you know like date this is how people
talk this is how people of my
generation talk this is how people get
their up you know what I mean like
you like it you like it or not like you
know it's like the swag is there the
sauce is there man the drip I don't drip
on them real quick dropping a little
drip of the sauce
you dig first boring part which is queue
waiting things fixing things in mobile
doing little that needs to
get fixed
unresponsive that is so boring
alright so that's what we at in my
project that I gotta finish in the next
week or so so I was like it freaking
sucks but um yeah I'm just having fun
